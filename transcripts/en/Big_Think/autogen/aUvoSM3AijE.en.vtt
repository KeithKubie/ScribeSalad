genetic engineering is not a bad thing

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:04.939
genetic engineering is not a bad thing
 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.900
genetic engineering is not a bad thing
because even if it were it's not going

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910
because even if it were it's not going
 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.500
because even if it were it's not going
to go away um I have geneticist friends

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510
to go away um I have geneticist friends
 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.769
to go away um I have geneticist friends
who have no barriers whatsoever moving

from conventional breeding which means

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330
from conventional breeding which means
 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.870
from conventional breeding which means
we're using a microscope Ben we're

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880
we're using a microscope Ben we're
 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.520
we're using a microscope Ben we're
taking genetics out of one thing and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530
taking genetics out of one thing and
 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.410
taking genetics out of one thing and
putting it in another thing that's

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420
putting it in another thing that's
 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.560
putting it in another thing that's
conventional breeding whereas we're

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570
conventional breeding whereas we're
 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.290
conventional breeding whereas we're
bombarding something with radiation from

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300
bombarding something with radiation from
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.630
bombarding something with radiation from
something else and splicing genes and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640
something else and splicing genes and
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.009

doing all kinds of nanotechnology they

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019
doing all kinds of nanotechnology they
 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.899
doing all kinds of nanotechnology they
have no trouble walking back and forth I

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909
have no trouble walking back and forth I
 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.899
have no trouble walking back and forth I
don't think that genetic engineering is

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909
don't think that genetic engineering is
 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.099
don't think that genetic engineering is
a bad thing if we know its impact and I

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109
a bad thing if we know its impact and I
 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.500
a bad thing if we know its impact and I
think that just as much on the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510
think that just as much on the
 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.539
think that just as much on the
conventional so i can raise issues about

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549
conventional so i can raise issues about
 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.939
conventional so i can raise issues about
invasive species on a conventional basis

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949
invasive species on a conventional basis
 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.899
invasive species on a conventional basis
that are more deleterious bamboo we all

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909
that are more deleterious bamboo we all
 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.229
that are more deleterious bamboo we all
love bamboo don't we it is a threat in

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239
love bamboo don't we it is a threat in
 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.990
love bamboo don't we it is a threat in
the south because of just people

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000
the south because of just people
 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.970
the south because of just people
planting it just for fun well it never

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980
planting it just for fun well it never
 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.710
planting it just for fun well it never
goes away you can dig a hundred feet

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720
goes away you can dig a hundred feet
 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.430
goes away you can dig a hundred feet
down it's still there we have weedy rice

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440
down it's still there we have weedy rice
 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.590
down it's still there we have weedy rice
in the South that's still there from

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600
in the South that's still there from
 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.020
in the South that's still there from
before the civil war that took down rice

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030
before the civil war that took down rice
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.430

fields where you can't farm the rice

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440
fields where you can't farm the rice
 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880
fields where you can't farm the rice
fields so I have examples that are every

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890
fields so I have examples that are every
 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.620
fields so I have examples that are every
bit as deleterious is what we might

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630
bit as deleterious is what we might
 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.800
bit as deleterious is what we might
imagine from genetic engineering that

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810
imagine from genetic engineering that
 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.560
imagine from genetic engineering that
have been here continuously for our

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570
have been here continuously for our
 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.610
have been here continuously for our
existence here in America certainly and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620
existence here in America certainly and
 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
existence here in America certainly and
so I could say do I want to focus on

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890
so I could say do I want to focus on
 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.770
so I could say do I want to focus on
genetic engineering the answers I don't

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780
genetic engineering the answers I don't
 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.790
genetic engineering the answers I don't
at all I don't have time am I kind of

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800
at all I don't have time am I kind of
 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280
at all I don't have time am I kind of
leery of it yes I am I'm I was trained

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290
leery of it yes I am I'm I was trained
 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.520
leery of it yes I am I'm I was trained
in the sciences as a college student so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
in the sciences as a college student so
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.490
in the sciences as a college student so
I'm concerned about the long-term

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500
I'm concerned about the long-term
 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.899
I'm concerned about the long-term
processes and how we evaluate this and

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909
processes and how we evaluate this and
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.700
processes and how we evaluate this and
whether the evaluation is thorough or

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
whether the evaluation is thorough or
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.550
whether the evaluation is thorough or
whether we are trying to satisfy a

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560
whether we are trying to satisfy a
 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.640
whether we are trying to satisfy a
profit motive in a business string I'm

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650
profit motive in a business string I'm
 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.980
profit motive in a business string I'm
sensitive to that by the same token I

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990
sensitive to that by the same token I
 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.780
sensitive to that by the same token I
think that there are things being done

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790
think that there are things being done
 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.449
think that there are things being done
in research that maybe be rushing maybe

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459
in research that maybe be rushing maybe
 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.360
in research that maybe be rushing maybe
could be perceived as rushing the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
could be perceived as rushing the
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.900
could be perceived as rushing the
results to put it in lay terms

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910
results to put it in lay terms
 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.970
results to put it in lay terms
