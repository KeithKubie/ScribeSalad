00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.420
Alright, let's look at one last trait for this

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.310
lesson. Sickle Cell Anemia. People with Sickle Cell Anemia have

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.350
a haemoglobin protein that changes the shape of red

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.850
blood cells and reduces the flow of oxygen in the

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.280
body. The lack of oxygen delivery caused by the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.650
anemia can be quite painful. Now in the United States,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.200
about one in 5,000 people have Sickle Cell Anemia. But

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.510
in some regions of Subsaharan Africa, there are actually 1

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.100
in 50 people. Let's bring back our fictional

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.619
family with an African American background, a pedigree of

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.290
Bobby and his family. It shows here that Bobby

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.350
has an affected cousin. And an affected great grandparent

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.220
on his father's side. Now just like the other

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.290
traits, before we get involved into the genetic basis,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.180
I want you to tell me a little bit

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.100
more about the inheritance patterns that you see here.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.920
I want you to tell me if the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.410
inheritance pattern most resembles that of an autosomal, sex-linked,

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.910
or maternal trait. And also try to decide if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.170
the trade appears to be more dominant or recessive.
