00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.950
So let's take a little bit
closer look at, rods and cones.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.020
They have a certain similar structure.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.040
They have this, we'll call it
an outer part, but remember, the,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.630
the pigment epithelium is up here and
the light comes in that way, but

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.802
this is called the outer part because
it's this inverted retina thing.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:20.110
All right, and this inverted part
is where you have these disc shaped

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.220
elements, that react to light, and
they react to different wavelengths

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.770
of light, we'll talk about the different
wavelengths in a minute, and those

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.299
wavelengths and those reactions set up
chemical reactions in the, in the cell.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.370
And of course it is still a cell,
so it's got these inner elements,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.680
these organelles and a cell nucleus, and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.960
then what's important is it
has this synaptic body where

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.370
it changes the chemical properties at
the synapses depending on the light.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.670
So let's take a look just at the rod for
a minute.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.360
The rod has this chemical,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.770
these disks made out of what's
called rhodopsin, all right?

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.611
And here, this is an electron micrograph
of what it actually looks like.

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:02.884
And this outer segment is made of up
these plates, rhodopsin plates, and

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:07.027
what happens is that the, the rhodopsin
is a chemical that when it gets hit by

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:11.625
photons, it splits into two chemicals, I
don't remember both of their names, but

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:14.460
one of them is actually
associated with vitamin A.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.460
Remember your mother always told you
you had to eat your carrots in order

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.013
to see well?

00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:19.232
Where does that come from?

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:24.224
Well, the vitamin A, in, in the carrots
is involved in the chemical

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:28.171
that's involved in, in,
rods being able to see light.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.133
So I'm presuming that that's
why your mother told you that.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.963
Just ask her, all right?

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:36.496
To stress the sort of chemical
nature of what's going on,

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.811
there's a slide here that
just shows the same rod, and

00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:43.000
there's a sort of this
change in these sodium ions.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.460
And, oh here I, I wrote it down in,
in notes that, when the rhodopsin

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.910
splits, one part's called opsin, and
the other part of this vitamin A, bit.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.500
And, when light comes in,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.742
this change is sometimes referred
to as bleaching the, the rods.

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:02.880
All right, so they, they,
they start to change more.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
And that, and how bleached they
are is sort of how adapted they are.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.410
Right?
So when they're not

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.630
bleached at all a very small amount of
light, now coming in will change it,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.690
after you've bleached them a bit.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.270
Now you need a different, you're now
operating at a different, light level.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.890
In fact, there were studies that
were done that were showing that

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.620
a single photon, so those of you who
are familiar with the physics of light.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.690
A single photon will, can make a change
in the cell that this system can detect,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.370
which is just remarkable, right?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.420
The ability of the system to detect
small changes of illumination.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.200
And, you can sort of ignore
this diagram over here.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.170
It's just showing you that it's
understood at a pretty detailed level

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.440
how the light makes a change
in the chemistry, and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.380
that the chemistry then changes
what goes on in these synapses.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, we said before that each of these
photodetectors respond differentially

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.970
To wavelengths of light.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.640
And we showed you short,
medium and long.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.292
The one we didn't show you before
was the one that includes rhodopsin.

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:07.580
All right, so here's the blue or the
short pigment, the green and the red,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.730
which we've looked at before, and
here is what the, the rod responds to.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.020
You see the rod is relatively
broad spectrum, okay.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.750
Which is good because it means that if
there's any of this kind of wave lengths

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.240
of light coming in at night, the rods
will be able to see them, even though

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.970
they're very, very low amount of
illumination that they're sensitive to.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.250
We're not going to talk
more about cones and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.370
the tristimulus theory, color theory
of color because we did that last time.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.880
But these are the four
operating spectral

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.860
responses that each of
the photo detectors give you
