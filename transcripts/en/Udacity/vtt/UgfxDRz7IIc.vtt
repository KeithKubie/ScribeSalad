00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, let's see. I want to make this triangle bigger. Well, V₀y--it's opposite the 30° angle.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And since I know the hypotenuse, I can say that the sine of this angle must be

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse V₀y/100 and if I plugged this into

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
a calculator or a search engine, I find a result of 50 m/s.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I can assimilate thinking to solve the V₀x, and when I do, I have an answer of 86.6 m/s. Good work.
