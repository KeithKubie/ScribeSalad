00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.940
SPEAKER 1: On July 8, 1853, residents
of Edo beheld an astonishing sight.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.460
Four foreign warships had entered their
harbor under a cloud of black smoke.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.040
Commodore Matthew Perry
of the United States

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.100
had arrived to force the
long secluded country

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.475
to open its doors to the outside world.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:37.280

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.930
SPEAKER 2: Imagine this scene.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.050
Police boxes throughout the
city of Tokyo are destroyed.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.810
Buildings and streetcars are torched.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.160
The government responds
by declaring martial law.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.020
It seems as if the recent war
with Russia has come home.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.036
The Hibiya riot marked the
first major social protest

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:03.420
over the age of imperial democracy.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.770

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.700
SPEAKER 3: An elegantly
dressed European woman

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.070
holding a camellia blossom lies
luxuriously on a chaise lounge.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.900
This could describe a French
image of a stylish Parisian,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.520
but is, in fact, a 1920's Japanese
advertisement for the cosmetics company

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.430
Shiseido.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.920
There is no Japanese company
whose advertising design better

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.690
represents cosmopolitan chic
in early 20th century Japan.
