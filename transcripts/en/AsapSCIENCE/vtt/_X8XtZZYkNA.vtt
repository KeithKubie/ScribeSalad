00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.960
This episode is supported by Skillshare.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.450
Do you ever wonder how your brain stack up
to those around you?

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.139
Well, if you are standing tall beside them,
you might be smarter!

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.059
Researchers have already uncovered that tall
people are often higher earners - which was

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.359
hypothesized to be linked to self-esteem,
social dominance, or discrimination against

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.359
shorter people.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.609
However, a 2009 study revealed that taller
children have higher average cognitive test

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.609
scores.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.279
Or maybe you are the oldest sibling?

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.619
A study of 250,000 Norwegian military personnel
found that the first born had an average IQ

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.590
2.3 points higher than younger siblings.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.500
This wasn’t genetically based, but rather
the benefits of full parental attention.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.940
When you were a baby, were your breast or
bottle fed?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.630
A Brazilian study tracked over 3000 babies
to the age of 30.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.060
Researchers found that breastfeeding duration
and amount was positively associated with

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.230
IQ, education and income.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.840
Speaking of drinking, alcohol is bad for your
brain, right?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.250
Maybe so, but the intelligent among us are
more drawn to booze.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.470
A study found that intelligent children in
both the UK and US were more likely to grow

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.479
up to consume more alcohol.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.549
Similarly, a study that assessed the IQ of
6713 11 year olds and then followed them to

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.549
age 42 found the same to be true for drug
use like cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.850
magic mushrooms.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.630
Why would smart people seek substances that
could harm them?

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.399
Known as the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis,
it suggests that more intelligent people have

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.940
evolved novel values and preferences.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.380
For example, while the majority of us function
best during the daytime the novel environment

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.560
is night time.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.060
Therefore the hypothesis predicts that night
owls are the more intelligent among us, and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
an analysis of the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health confirmed this prediction.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.880
If you find this information worrying, you
are likely...pretty bright.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.689
A sample of 126 undergraduate students found
verbal intelligence was a unique positive

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.900
predictor of worry and rumination.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.950
However, people who didn’t worry scored
higher on tests of nonverbal intelligence.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.960
Like daydreaming?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.549
A new study has found that daydreamers may
be more intelligent, suggesting that people

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.299
with efficient brains may have too much brain
capacity to stop their minds from wandering.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.299
Lefty?

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.070
A study of 96 left handed and 96 right handed
individuals found that lefties scored greater

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.860
creativity as well as measures of ‘divergent
thinking’, the ability to generate new ideas

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.150
from a single principle.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.250
You have little control over being a lefty
or righty, but if you want to take your intelligence

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.010
into your own hands consider a music lesson.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.440
After only 20 days of music training, a study
found that 90% of the preschool aged children

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.040
showed improvements in verbal intelligence.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.060
While you are at it, quit smoking.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.340
Unlike other risky behaviours a study of 20,221
18 year old males serving in the Israeli army

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.750
found IQ scores are lower in male smokers
than nonsmokers.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.260
Maybe abstinence is key?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.610
A study that assessed 12,000 teens from grade
7-12 found that high schoolers with a higher

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.440
IQ are more likely to be a virgin.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.690
A separate survey found this extends into
later years as well.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.511
By age 19, 80% of US males and 75% of females
have lost their virginity and 87% of college

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:05.350
undergraduates have lost their virginity.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.470
However, when assessing elite colleges this
number becomes much lower.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.030
56% of Princeton undergraduates have had sex,
59% at Harvard, and 51% at MIT.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.480
Finally, do you find this picture funny?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.980
Congratulations, your dark sense of humour
is positively associated with intelligence

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.500
regardless of age and gender.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.090
It is important to remember correlation doesn't
equal causation, but it is interesting to

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.540
investigate the variables related to intellect.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.950
So how many categories did you fit into?

classes.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.380
I've personally used it for visual effects
and improving my After Effects skills.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.720
It's been a huge asset for me.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.110
I actually took a writing course.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.480
I'm trying to write different things, like
comedy and sketches.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.050
And this helped me so much.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.070
Anyone can take a class.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.770
