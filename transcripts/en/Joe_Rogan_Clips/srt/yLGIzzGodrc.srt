1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,890
Hello freak bitches,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,720
got back in with Alex and spent a little
bit time hanging around with him and

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,890
Roger Stone and so on and got really
interested in the kind of dynamics of how

4
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:14,230
Alex and Trevor communicate to each other.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,100
But I'm wondering if you've seen
Alex more recently than I have now.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,800
Alex has been my friend since 1998 yeah,

7
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:24,130
I was at his custody trial not long
ago. And you were brought up, you were

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,550
smoking pot on my show. He was smoking
pot. Just chesting it. How she,

9
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,940
George Soros makes the weeds
stronger. That's what he said.

10
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:36,730
He said that in this custody
trial. That's exactly what he said.

11
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:39,720
He said he tests it once a
year just to, cause he's,

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,210
he's weird because he's always
there when that happens.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,330
I mean D I mean, come on man.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,330
What's really funny is we drank whiskey
on the show too and no one gives a shit

15
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:56,620
about that. It's way more destructive.
It's the pot, whatever it is.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,300
The self reflective. Yeah.
Paranoia, inducing marijuana.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,150
It's a real problem. But I now wonder,

18
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:08,470
so he says that Trump called and
just after the election thank him.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,280
And I'm inclined to believe that's true
cause I don't think that's the kind of

20
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,070
thing that Alex would lie
about. But have you got any,

21
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,360
if you come to any conclusion about
whether there is a connection between Alex

22
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,170
and Trump now?

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,130
Cause I'm beginning to think maybe
there just isn't any more that may be,

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,620
but I could be wrong. That's
a good question. I don't
know. I mean first of all,

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,300
I don't see how Trump can have a
connection with that many people.

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,330
I feel like the job of being the president
has got to be so insanely demanding.

27
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,430
The idea that he likes, he's taken
a few moments out of his day.

28
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,540
He's got his feet up on the chair with
a laptop and he's on info wars.com it's

29
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,080
like God damn,

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,410
I've got to call Alex and find out what
the fuck's going on with this child.

31
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,050
A slavery thing on Mars. You know,

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
where are these slaves?
Tell me where we're on Mars.

33
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,460
I think it benefits everyone to think
that it's cause it makes an X Trump look

34
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:05,140
bad. So it benefits people on
the left to say that Alex is a,

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,440
is connected to Trump.
It kind of benefits Alex,

36
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,500
I think for people to think it too,
cause they aggrandized his him.

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,640
Well it helps him in a way. I
mean it's like the people that,

38
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,200
there's a bunch of people
that enjoy Alex, right?

39
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,130
So some of them enjoy it for the theater.

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,250
There's a theater element
of it all. You know, I mean,

41
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:28,360
and it's all doom and gloom
and yeah. And then some of it,

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,420
some people enjoy because like Bohemian
Grove occasionally he's correct.

43
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,660
Like Bohemian Grove was a real mind
fuck when you see all these super rich

44
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:40,960
people were in robes,
right? In effigy. Yeah.

45
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,410
I was in the crowd with all the
old men of wealth in Dallas.

46
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,650
Don't freak you out and you see those
people. One thing freaked me out.

47
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,490
I'm like, Alex came out of out
Bohemian Grove night with uh, with,

48
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:56,290
with a varying interpretation of, of what,

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,770
what was your interpretation? My
interpretation is basically with,

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,500
with one caveat I'm about
to caveat there. Okay. Um,

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,610
my interpretation was that it's just like
fucking, you know, skull and bones or

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,240
[inaudible], you know, those
are all creepy, right? Yeah.

53
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,200
And they want to Nevis that does seem to
be amongst the American ruling elites.

54
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,030
That does seem to be a
proclivity for ritual. Um,

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,080
maybe a, maybe amongst the British
elites as well. I'm not sure about,

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,440
but that's in itself psychologically
interesting. I think secrets too, right?

57
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,590
So it's like why? So
that is interesting. Why,

58
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,610
even if the ritual at Bohemian
Grove, I, I, you know,

59
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,540
and I would contend that
contrary to what Alex implied,

60
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,430
they weren't actually sacrificing a child.

61
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,160
You didn't say they were
sacrificing your child.

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Then you said at some point
and then this video. Yeah.

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,670
It couldn't be real copy be ladies
and gentleman. It couldn't be real.

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,300
He probably was so jazzed up that they
were actually dressed up like monks,

65
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:52,860
people,

66
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,560
the hoods and they have the Moloch the
owl guy when he was actually there,

67
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,400
I mean that probably ramped
up his love of conspiracy.

68
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,160
Oh solid three or 400%.

69
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,090
It was hilarious cause you know
we went in separately to to um,

70
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,710
cause Alex got it into his head that
maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove

71
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,550
deep, deep inside. Yeah. Like the
wicked man that I was like learning.

72
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,370
And then some, he would be the ones who
were first in the Valley at the hour.

73
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,590
So he went in separately to be,

74
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:23,650
he went in far the undergrowth
and I went up the street,

75
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,000
I just went in the driveway,

76
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,200
gave the security guard or kind of
viral the world wave and then we went in

77
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,070
there. That's all you had
to do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,150
The guy so often the case.
Yeah. So white house.

79
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,130
And then we saw Alex and Mike Hanson,
who was his producer at the time,

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,340
walking like towards us. And I was
with this local lawyer who had,

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,800
who would we talked up with?
And I was like, um, Hey,

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,080
you know Alex, Mike, how you doing?
And they were like, keep walking.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,690
There's cameras in the trees,
there's hours everywhere.

84
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,980
And then there's no walls. Yes, because
we felt like the owls were cameras.

85
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,310
They got it into their heads
that the hours at Bohemian Grove,

86
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,920
the hour motifs that Bohemian Grove, uh,

87
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,940
was indicative of the fact that
it was like molec the owl guard.

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,640
And it was like some sort of satanic.

89
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,440
But actually I would say that the
reason why there's all those hours,

90
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,980
cause I saw like stuffed hours
in display cabinets and so on.

91
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,720
But I think it's like, I think
it's an owl sanctuary. So

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,480
anyway, they stuffed on
that. I'll say for me,

93
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,560
I presume it died of natural
causes. [inaudible] shit.

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,080
He fucking sanctuary. If
they kill it then stuff it.

95
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,010
So it's sorta like a Norman
Bates mom and psycho stuff.

96
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,580
But what was odd that night was
one thing that the artist moment,

97
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,770
and this is where I will,

98
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,100
this is where my memory of the
night does tally with Alex says,

99
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,460
is that for whatever reason the people
in the crowd were really into this,

100
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,110
this ceremony land. There was a sort of,

101
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,410
they were really fired up diet. Let some,

102
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,740
I remember this old guy walked up
to me before it started and said,

103
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,400
are you a first timer? And I went,
yeah, I do. Oh, you've got to love it.

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,130
You've got to love. It's like
burn and burn him or something.

105
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:20,810
Something along those lines. Uh,
and, and it did make me think,

106
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,770
and then I looked behind and there was
Alex and Mike why died looking like they

107
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,540
would ruin, you know,
the belly of the beast.

108
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,450
And then there's all these
old preppy men like wide-eyed.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,530
They were really into it too.

110
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:34,670
I felt like the only sane person in
the entire Redwood forest, I was like,

111
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,740
the only person who's thinking
this is just fucking ridiculous.

112
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,450
It is ridiculous. But, but they
were into it. It was that moment.

113
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:45,860
It was that moment of revelation actually
that then led me to write the book

114
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:49,010
that I wrote after that book, which was
the metastatic goats, which is about,

115
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,910
you know, um, soldiers tried to kill
goats just by staring. And then,

116
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,910
cause I did, cause I remember lie, um,

117
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,880
I remember thinking I was
actually, I was in Belfast.

118
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,860
I was giving a talk about my book them,

119
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,280
which is where I talk about all of
that stuff. And somebody said, okay,

120
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:06,800
so I know what you think of it.
This woman in the audience said,

121
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,810
I know what you think. I know you
think this is like ridiculous.

122
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,300
And I know that Alex Jones thinks is evil,

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,870
but what about the people in the crowd?
What were they thinking about it?

124
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,310
And I thought that's a
really good question.

125
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,450
So that's what led me to write a book
about like a rational thoughts in powerful

126
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:24,550
places, which is what led me
to rap MedStar guts. When you,

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
when you're there and you see that there
really is this giant stone owl and they

128
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:34,080
really do have this bundle of sticks that
they're burning and everyone really is

129
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,360
wearing these robes. Like,

130
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,390
I mean you had a big part
of you how to be like,

131
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,810
how many of these fucking things are
going on that we haven't infiltrated?

132
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,580
And that's true that there's a, there's
a photo of it there. This is real.

133
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:47,941
I mean,

134
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:52,941
they really do have a giant owl and they
really do burn some sort of a sacrifice

135
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:57,580
in front of this owl. And there's
a speakers that are, uh, there's a,

136
00:07:57,581 --> 00:08:02,470
there's a one point this is a lesser,
um, documented part of the ritual.

137
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,680
At one point there's a guy in leaf covet
later Hosan appears in like a stage cut

138
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:14,890
out at the Redwood tree and starts singing
this cat of allergy to nature. Like,

139
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:18,490
Oh, trees. So leaves.

140
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,030
So that's how it starts. That's
before of the men in robes turn up.

141
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,310
So it's like some weird pagan nature.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,520
Literal covered later hose and Joe,

143
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,600
how much would you give to be in one
of those skull and bones meetings?

144
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,750
See if they actually like film each
other's suck index or something.

145
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:37,800
There's just something that goes on
where they have like something over those

146
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:41,410
guys supposedly. Yeah,
the conspiracy theory.

147
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,780
That's the means to engage in gay sex.

148
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,070
I do believe these things happen
for a reason. Like, you know,

149
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:51,130
skin and bones accessory reason
being they have something over you.

150
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,580
It could be that, or it could
be just this weird sense,

151
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,320
this weird of psychological need that
people like Ivy league people feel they

152
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,660
need to like have a sense of superiority.

153
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,990
And one way to do that is to kind of
create the secret rituals to get them a

154
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,370
sense of like, you know, grangeiro
for the people that's possible.

155
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,060
Now a guy like Alex Jones stumbles upon
something like that or infiltrates it

156
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:16,350
and finds out it is real. I mean,
that is justifying to such a,

157
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,910
an enormous, enormous level.
Yeah. But I'll expect, here's my,

158
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,680
my truck with Alex and all of this
is that it wasn't like the Alex,

159
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,860
all the fucking crazy shit that we saw
that night wasn't enough lucky hat to

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,450
like turn it up to 11 of course. Yeah.

161
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,890
I need apply that we had
possibly witnessed an actual
human sacrifice and said,

162
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:41,250
of course. But that standard, that
standard Alex Jones one-on-one,

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,620
but it shouldn't be styled. It
shouldn't be. But I mean, I mean,

164
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,580
think about all of the
exaggerations exaggerations
that take place in the media,

165
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,450
whether it's on the left or the right.
There's this rampant exaggeration. Well,

166
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,350
it's funny you should say that.

167
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,620
So did you watch Alex being interviewed
by Megan Kelly? Yes I did. Yeah.

168
00:09:58,621 --> 00:09:59,610
Well that may be enough. You know,

169
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:03,390
they phoned me a couple of days before
the broadcast back in Kelly's people

170
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,510
cause they were panicking. I remember
there was like a lot of criticism.

171
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,810
They look at Ang food for having
them on in the first place. Yeah.

172
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,500
So they called me up and they basically
wanted me to give them as much evidence

173
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,650
as I could. The proof that
Alex and Trump were, you know,

174
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:19,890
aligned and they would talk to each
other and so on. Called you. Why?

175
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,410
Because you'd went to Bohemian grow
with them. I went to pay him and go,

176
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,490
but then I also put out this little
Kindle single last summer called the

177
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:31,050
elephant in the room in which I'm trying
to trace like the relationship between

178
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:36,000
Alex and Trump did via, and it's kind
of in this interesting stuff. But,

179
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,580
um, so I answered the
questions as best as I could,

180
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,780
but I don't know that much about exactly
how often Trump and Alex told to each

181
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,350
other. I don't know either. I'm not
even really that interested in it.

182
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,420
It was as odd as it is.

183
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,740
Like I have a very fucked up
relationship with Alex in, in that,

184
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,170
and he's actually my friend. And so when
I see him, it's like, what's up man?

185
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,630
What are you doing? I give
him a hug and people go, Oh,

186
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,180
he's a monster or hockey, be friends
with them and this and that. And like,

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,190
I don't know. Yeah, I just base it on
my interactions with them. And yet,

188
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,360
does he say fucked up things? Yeah.

189
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,000
It was the most disturbing thing that
I didn't even know when he did the

190
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:15,360
podcast. I didn't know that he
was a Sandy hook denier. Right.

191
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,050
So apparently he's backed
off that since, uh,

192
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,480
being confronted by the facts. And,

193
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,980
and there was a horrible article that I
read about a father who was actually a

194
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:29,580
conspiracy theorist until his
son was killed in Sandy hook.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,110
And then he got death threats
for lying and presumably for,

196
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,190
from info Wars. And that was
so, so just so sad. Yeah.

197
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,480
That's just so hard.

198
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:44,481
People look for fucking conspiracies and
everything and I don't know what it is.

199
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:49,170
I have friends that have this
issue. I don't understand it.

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,220
Things that can be easily explained.
They look for a conspiracy.

201
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,110
Anything that happens in the news,
there's gotta be a different story.

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,460
Like sometimes shit just happens
and when that shit happens,

203
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:04,930
the news has a story. It doesn't always
have to be some sort of nefarious plot.

204
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,580
But these people also think that the
government is filled with idiots. Well,

205
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,470
I'm sorry, but you
can't have it both ways.

206
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,570
You can't have a bunch of incompetent
fuck heads who pull off the perfect fake

207
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:21,571
world where everything you see is some
sort of an elaborate played out scheme in

208
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,470
order to manipulate you into either
buying this or voting for that.

209
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,060
Like there's a weird inclination
that people have to uh, not just,

210
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,150
not just some conspiracy theories but
almost everything to think everything is

211
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:39,370
some part of some crazy plot.
I'm not sure I understand it.

212
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,440
What you said about like, you know,

213
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:45,910
biases and untruths and like across the
media on the left and underwrite remind

214
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,640
to be if the mechan Kelly
thing. So, um, you know,

215
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:51,820
so they phoned me up obviously in a bit
of a panic cause they were getting like

216
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:56,260
so much grace I said, and then they
reedited the show like frantically,

217
00:12:56,261 --> 00:13:00,040
just before weaponry edited it. How
did they change? Well, I don't know,

218
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,440
but what I do know is like, yo,

219
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:06,441
I saw the final product and the final
product was basically Meghan Kelly,

220
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:11,380
like looking incredibly poised, saying,
um, you know, you're wrong Alex,

221
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,750
you're wrong about this. And then
it would cut to all it's go up. But,

222
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,740
but I haven't cut back to
Megan. So all they did was lie,

223
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,800
edit Alex at his most sweaty and stuttery
and then Meghan Kelly at her most

224
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,210
poised to perfect. What did you see?
Did you hear the Alex Jones a audio,

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,400
the leaked audio that he released? Yes.

226
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,170
Or they were sort of buttering him up and
conning him? Yeah, she was saying, uh,

227
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,860
personally I was saying, I don't,
I'm not here to make a hit piece.

228
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,190
I just want to know the real you.
And although they did rent it, so I,

229
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,950
I wonder what the original program would
have been like cause they felt forced

230
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,780
to basically by him. Yeah.

231
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,140
Well they felt forced by like the
people pushing back against them,

232
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:57,880
doing it all by him, uh, to then
put out this shitty, you know,

233
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:02,560
10 minutes. I basically was in Megan
Kelly's corner. I would have told her,

234
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,130
first of all, don't ever go to NBC.
Listen, here's the deal. Like you,

235
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:11,131
you made your bones as an ice princess
on this conservative network and do you

236
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:14,020
think they're just gonna
accept you at NBC? Right.

237
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,270
People are going to resent
you. They're going to hate you.

238
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,840
Like you're the lady that chastise
people for saying that Santa Claus

239
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,190
potentially wasn't white. I remember
that. I don't remember that. Oh my God,

240
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,080
it was something where
they were saying they were,

241
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:30,070
there was people talking about Santa
Claus being black and I'll never forget it

242
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,850
cause she was on TV going, you
know, listen, Santa Claus is white.

243
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,360
Like then I'm like, what the fuck
the fuck are you talking about?

244
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,300
Santa Claus isn't real. You crazy bitch.

245
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,550
You can't say Santa Claus is white more
than you could say cat in the hat is

246
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,930
red. They're not real things.
You know you can decide that.

247
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,630
You know like the cat in the hat in
the book is always white. Okay. Yeah,

248
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:57,140
you're right. Good point.
But is he black? Is he white?

249
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,170
What does the cat in the hat?
He's got a hat is red and white.

250
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,280
What color is he though? Hmm,
I think he's black, right?

251
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,820
Is he? Okay. All right. It's not porn,

252
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,870
but what's important is that like her
whole thing was being this spokesperson,

253
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,030
this ultra hot spokesperson
for the conservative movement,

254
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:21,020
but also being someone who's ruthlessly
smart and articulate and capable of

255
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:26,021
shutting down these stammering liberals
that day or go and question her,

256
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,350
her narrative, and then all of a sudden
she's on NBC. Like you can't do that.

257
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,750
That's a terrible move. I,
they're not going to accept you.

258
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,620
This is not going to work.

259
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,440
And the ratings have been
horrendous and now she's free.

260
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,780
And now they pulled the show.
They pulled the show early,

261
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,730
but it just goes to show like, you know,

262
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,731
we rightly attack people
like info Wars for spreading,

263
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,410
you know, outright lies.
Yes. But we on the left,

264
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,010
like Megan Kelly editing that segment
to make it look like she was poised and

265
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,310
perfect. Perfected all Alex does this
stammer and sweat. What's very hard,

266
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,680
very hard sell saying that
Megan Kelly's on the left,

267
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
she's on the left now what? I mean, the
mainstream, the main season that NBC,

268
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:09,800
so the main stream has its own tricks.
It's like, it's not an outright lie.

269
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:15,020
Like Alex would do, but
that, you know, panicky,

270
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,200
selective editing is
its own. Well I would,

271
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,910
I would have imagined that that Joel,

272
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,160
in the interview between
Alex and Megan Kelly,

273
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,490
Alex would have said some
things that were, you know,

274
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,500
eloquent or all or sentence without
Istomin in a swag. I'm sure. Yeah,

275
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,453
I'm sure.

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,290
Well here's also the problem and having
any sort of a conversation about Hey,

277
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,790
sort of difficult subject and stuffing
it into seven minutes or whatever it is.

278
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,530
It's ridiculous. Yeah.

279
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,150
It's an ancient way of communicating and
now that we have the internet and Alex

280
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,800
has shown with his own show, you know,

281
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,130
that he can go and rant
about something and you know,

282
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,990
for 15 minutes or whatever it is like,

283
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,900
and with no limitations
or restrictions like it's,

284
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,760
it's a better way to communicate.

285
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,840
And one of the things that I wanted to
do when I had Alex on the podcast is I

286
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:07,130
wanted people to see the Alex that I
know because there's no other way to see

287
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,900
him like that. I wanted to get them drunk.

288
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,500
I wanted to get them high and I wanted
to have them talk. And my friend Eddie,

289
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,600
who's just so in a conspiracy,

290
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,070
he kind of fucked some of it because he's
just so when a chem trails and proving

291
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,270
the chem trails are real,

292
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,920
but it was good overall
because it's like he was,

293
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,680
Alex is so crazy that
even Eddie was like, what?

294
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,220
It was a couple of wallets where
Eddie turned to look at Alex. He goes,

295
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,054
what the fuck?

296
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,140
Like when he's talking about
interdimensional child molesters and it's,

297
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,990
I wanted people to see
him the way I see him.

298
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,450
He's a fun guy that I
like hanging out with.

299
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,240
Do I think that he has a
lot of influence? Yeah.

300
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:47,930
Do I think he says things that he
definitely shouldn't say? Of course.

301
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,650
Especially the Sandy hook stuff. I mean,

302
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,780
I think this inclination to
always look towards conspiracy is,

303
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:59,430
is, is, is dangerous. It's
harmful. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's,

304
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,540
it's, it's dangerous in
that people are easily led.

305
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,360
And if you get people thinking
that everything's a conspiracy,

306
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,960
the real problem is they don't know what
the fuck a conspiracy actually is when

307
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,690
it's in front of them and it's real,
and there's a ton of them that are real.

308
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,870
So when you call, you're crying
Wolf around every corner,

309
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,750
and then all of a sudden you
turn a corner. Like, Holy
shit, that's a real Wolf.

310
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,880
No one is listening. So I agree that
that's my frustration with Alex too,

311
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,470
is that he has a conspiracy template
and whatever real world event happens,

312
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,580
you can shoe horns into this kind
of simplistic template. Yeah.

313
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,290
[inaudible].
