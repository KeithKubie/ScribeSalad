Creepy woody and this place is great for kids.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.089
Wait...
It's episode 31 of IMG!

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.260
Parents are

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.150
awesome, except when they play favorites.
And here's Bert

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.109
in real life. There won't be any cats in this
episode, but there will be zombie

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.599
jean shorts rigor mortis girls and
plenty of dogs.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.109
"Ugh, are we gonna go yet?"
"Hi-five!" "Ice,

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.599
hahaha, it makes me happy."
Oh and the thing I said about no cats -

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.329
- not true. Here is one you can buy at a grocery
store. But let's move on to insects,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.550
dead ones. Magnus Muhr symbols dead
flies into poses,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.420
draws limbs and props and takes a
picture. Hey, this one got to me to moth.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.750
Some people earn their swag and some
people

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.449
are born with it.
Got a problem, player? Best

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.809
party ever. You gotta peel 'em all.
Well, seriously, let's peel 'em

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.589
and enjoy some banana art.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.340
Not enough?

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.240
Well, reddit provided the ultimate. Reddit
also showed off this colorized photo of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.780
Abraham Lincoln from the White House Museum.
He looks kinda weird, right?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.900
Well experts say that his odd face
may have been caused

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.060
by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.240
Let's get chart-y. This is the famous Venn diagram showing the relationships

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.600
between mythical creatures.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.220
But more importantly, nerdy weddings.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.050
They're gory, lightsaber-y and super sweet...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.960
crotch.
Phil Noto is an artist whose work I love.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.979
Superhero tensions.
Jon Hamm

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.630
as Superman and battleship shoes.
Whenever I see shoes like that I'm like,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.030
hey,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.130
nice shoes, and then girls were all like
thanks, they're vans; awesome!
MoIllusions.com

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.890
delivered my

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.759
favorite - ambigram.
This word spells black one-way

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.090
and upside down it spells white. Now, I've shown you rotating snakes before - the image

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.560
that moves when you look at it.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.640
I mean, seriously, look around the image, pause the video,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.080
it'll creep you out. But this one's new to
me and it's really neat. Look at the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.940
different letters

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.270
and as you look around it will seem to
grow and move. But now, a bunch of punching

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.670
bags hung all over the place,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.490
except from one angle they're Muhammad Ali.
Wilson Hennessy

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.080
blows my mind.
A cigarette that almost disappears,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.490
a painted paint can that almost disappears and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.510
how is this possible?
Finally,

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.580
Sarah Dayo has been creating what
look like half-open

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.010
doorways with an oddly shaped mirror.
GIF break.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.370
Toast like a boss.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.690
Still want more? Well, you're in luck. We
almost have five thousand pictures submitted

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.700
by people like you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.760
on Facebook.com/VsauceGaming, including

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.110
Muhammad's nervous banana and Kelly's screenshot from

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.890
Vsauce Leanback. Wow, be careful,
don't look directly into his eyes.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.250
Oh, and remember creepy Woody? Well to find out where that's from and how you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.090
can get your own,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530
check out today's new episode of LÃœT right
here. It's just like this show, except you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.250
can buy everything I mention.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.810
And hey, as always,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.090
thanks for watching.
