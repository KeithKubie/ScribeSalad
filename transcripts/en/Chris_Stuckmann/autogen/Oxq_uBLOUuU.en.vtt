00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
that run around saying stuff they're not
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.450
that run around saying stuff they're not
really speaking English but you get a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
really speaking English but you get a
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.500
really speaking English but you get a
sense of what they're saying I think

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
sense of what they're saying I think
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119
sense of what they're saying I think
that's what makes them so clever even

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
that's what makes them so clever even
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.170
that's what makes them so clever even
though they're not speaking the English

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
though they're not speaking the English
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580
though they're not speaking the English
language you can still understand what

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
language you can still understand what
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.750

they're saying now one of the things I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
they're saying now one of the things I
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490
they're saying now one of the things I
really liked about the first film was

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
really liked about the first film was
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.260
really liked about the first film was
the adult humour there was quite a bit

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
the adult humour there was quite a bit
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.729
the adult humour there was quite a bit
of it actually and it wasn't like dirty

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
of it actually and it wasn't like dirty
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830
of it actually and it wasn't like dirty
or anything but it wasn't strictly a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
or anything but it wasn't strictly a
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240
or anything but it wasn't strictly a
kids film and I really liked that about

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
kids film and I really liked that about
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369
kids film and I really liked that about
the first one and this film has possibly

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
the first one and this film has possibly
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080
the first one and this film has possibly
even more actually because there are a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
even more actually because there are a
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700
even more actually because there are a
lot of moments in this movie where none

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
lot of moments in this movie where none
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.780
lot of moments in this movie where none
of the kids in the audience were

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
of the kids in the audience were
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.890
of the kids in the audience were
laughing and all the adults were

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
laughing and all the adults were
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750
laughing and all the adults were
chuckling including myself and I found

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
chuckling including myself and I found
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130
chuckling including myself and I found
that a lot of fun about Despicable Me 2

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
that a lot of fun about Despicable Me 2
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.780
that a lot of fun about Despicable Me 2
and for that reason I think this works

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
and for that reason I think this works
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460
and for that reason I think this works
is a sequel because it's a film that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
is a sequel because it's a film that
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350
is a sequel because it's a film that
people of all ages can really enjoy you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
people of all ages can really enjoy you
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.490
people of all ages can really enjoy you
get to learn a little bit more about the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
get to learn a little bit more about the
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.140
get to learn a little bit more about the
character of GRU in this movie he didn't

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
character of GRU in this movie he didn't
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670
character of GRU in this movie he didn't
have the greatest childhood in regards

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
have the greatest childhood in regards
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980
have the greatest childhood in regards
to girls and when he gets stuck on this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
to girls and when he gets stuck on this
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.620
to girls and when he gets stuck on this
stakeout with this other female spy you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
stakeout with this other female spy you
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.060
stakeout with this other female spy you
know there's there's hints of romance

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
know there's there's hints of romance
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410
know there's there's hints of romance
there and the three little girls he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
there and the three little girls he
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030
there and the three little girls he
takes care of don't have a mother figure

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
takes care of don't have a mother figure
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590
takes care of don't have a mother figure
and so there's actually a nice

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
and so there's actually a nice
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.630
and so there's actually a nice
underlying depth to the film in regards

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
underlying depth to the film in regards
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.920
underlying depth to the film in regards
to that and I think that's something

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
to that and I think that's something
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510
to that and I think that's something
that would be good for kids to see but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
that would be good for kids to see but
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280
that would be good for kids to see but
at the same time it actually has quite a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
at the same time it actually has quite a
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140
at the same time it actually has quite a
bit of adult humor that I found myself

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
bit of adult humor that I found myself
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760
bit of adult humor that I found myself
really enjoying it there's actually a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
really enjoying it there's actually a
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230

can't believe that's actually in there
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080
can't believe that's actually in there
because they got away with some stuff

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
because they got away with some stuff
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940
because they got away with some stuff
