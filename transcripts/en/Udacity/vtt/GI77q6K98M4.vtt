00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.976
Okay, so after all of that, that leads us into a new quiz. Which is, why

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:05.780
do we separate our services? Check all that

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.700
apply. Is it so that they can be scaled

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.150
independently? Is it to increase the fault tolerance?

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.780
Is it so that two very different processes

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.710
aren't competing for resources on the same machine?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.280
Or is it so they can be updated independently?
