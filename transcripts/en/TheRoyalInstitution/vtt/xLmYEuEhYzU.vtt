00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.480
We know that running science activities at
home

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.580
with your kids can sometimes seem like a daunting
task,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.750
but it needn’t be so!

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.450
We've got loads of different activities for
you to try in our own ExpeRimental series,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.270
and this video will help you get the most
out of these,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.660
or any indeed any science activity you want
to try at home.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:35.110
1: Don’t worry if you don’t know the science.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.290
This is usually the first thing people worry
about

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
when it comes to thinking about doing science
activities at home.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.289
The importance of these activities isn't in
the learning of facts and figures.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.760
It's to get your kids asking questions, making
predictions,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.440
and using these to design investigations.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.839
In other words getting them to think like
scientists!

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.789
If your child asks you a question and you
don’t know the answer,

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.030
it’s okay to admit it!

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.869
In fact, this may present an opportunity for
further exploration.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.009
Maybe you can carry out another experiment
to investigate the question.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.870
"Can we use that important scientific discovery
to have fun?

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.470
Yes, we can!"

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.240
2: Play, Look, Ask

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.380
We believe that play should be the starting
point for engaging children with science.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.810
Children can learn through play

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.030
but that learning turns into thinking scientifically

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.880
when you encourage the children to “look”

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.033
and focus their attention on certain aspects
of an activity

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:43.850
and then to consider questions about what
they think might happen.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.420
So is there anything you could do with the
spaghetti to stop it moving?

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.130
I could maybe put this in the middle here?

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.130
OK, try that!

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.860
This is just how we designed our series ExpeRimental.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.890
For example one activity involves children
trying to find faces in the environment around

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.890
them.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.950
Before beginning they’re asked which facial
features they think are the most important

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.670
in recognising faces.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.750
Why do you guys think this looks like a face?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.670
What features can you see?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.560
This encourages them to think about the investigation

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.159
and make predictions before starting.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.850
The children are then asked to take photos
of the faces they find,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.870
and then keep a tally of all the reccuring
facial features to find which are the most

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.980
common.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.069
This can then be used as the basis of further
questioning.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.590
Such as why they think some features are more
important than others...

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.120
3: Ask the right questions

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.850
Do you find it easier to see the shapes with
all the colours,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.049
or easier with just the one colour?

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.239
Easier with loads of colours.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.239
And why's that?

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.349
Whilst you’re running science activities

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.080
it’s important to ask your kids lots of
questions

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.590
to keep them engaged and thinking about about
what they're doing.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.030
The way you ask these questions can also make
a big difference.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.010
So try to avoid asking simple yes/no questions.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.370
I'm going to pour it in there, what do you
think will happen?

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.370
Change a little bit of colour!

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.849
What do you think Tom?

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.849
Explode?

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.250
Maybe it will explode...

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.780
For example instead of asking “do you think
this will happen”

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.580
Try to ask something along the lines of “what
do you think will happen?”

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.920
This will encourage your child to think about
the investigation

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.769
and make a prediction.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.270
In doing so they’ll have to think through
a number of possible outcomes.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.780
So this cabbage water changes colour in a
slightly strange way.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.010
Shall we see if it changes colour with other
things?

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.010
Yeah!

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.340
This is actually bicarbonate of soda.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.260
What do you think might happen this time?

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.950
These predictions can then be put to the test

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.909
and can help you progress each activity through
a testing phase.

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.329
This helps the kids get a sense that they
are really leading the activity.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.239
4: Feel free to go off script!

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.950
Most science activities will have a set of
materials

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.310
and instructions to help you carry them out,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.939
but if you want to go off script,

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.700
or if your child suggests modifications

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.599
it can be fun to follow these through to see
what happens.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.340
Do they think that their design for an elastic
band cannon

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.560
is better than the one suggested?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.729
If so that’s great, give it a go!

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.810
If it doesn’t work you can always return
to the suggested method,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.310
but perhaps with a greater understanding of
why one works and the other doesn’t.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.560
5: If it doesn’t work, don’t worry

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.780
What do you think would happen if we dropped
it?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780
Bounce!

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.720
Oh! Shall we see if it bounces?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.480
Everyone ready...

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480
Noo!

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.460
If an activity doesn’t work for you at home,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.760
or you don’t get the expected outcome,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.530
don’t see this as a failure, but instead
as a learning opportunity

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.020
can you figure out what went wrong?

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.729
By tweaking the way you do things

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.380
and looking at how this affects an outcome

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.440
you can begin to work like scientists.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.639
If you’d like to get some ideas for science
activities to run at home,

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.419
check out our Experimental series

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.229
Each activity is designed to be carried out
using everyday household items

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.990
Whether it be building towers with spaghetti
and marshmallows,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.170
or carrying out brain bending illusions.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.280
Each activity is supported with each own video

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.919
and a printable fact sheet to help you run
through each activity step-by-step.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.080
So what are you waiting for?
