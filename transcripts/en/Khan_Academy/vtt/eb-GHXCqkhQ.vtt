00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:02.683
- [Instructor] We're asked
to select three ratios

00:00:02.683 --> 00:00:06.252
that are equivalent to seven to six.

00:00:06.252 --> 00:00:08.476
So pause this video
and see if you can spot

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:12.643
the three ratios that are
equivalent to seven to six.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.680
Alright, now let's work
through this together,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.560
and the main thing to realize
about equivalent ratios

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.482
is we just have to multiply or divide

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.325
the corresponding parts of the ratio

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:24.546
by the same amount.

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:26.277
So before I even look at these choices,

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:28.772
for example, if I have seven to six,

00:00:28.772 --> 00:00:31.522
if I multiply the seven times two

00:00:32.495 --> 00:00:33.791
to get 14,

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:36.566
then I would also
multiply the six times two

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.731
to get 12.

00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:41.898
So, for example, 14 to 12
is the exact same ratio.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.244
Now you might be tempted to pick 12 to 14,

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:48.512
but that is not the same ratio.

00:00:48.512 --> 00:00:50.451
Order matters in a ratio.

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.422
This could be ratio of oranges to apples.

00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:55.818
And we're saying for every seven oranges,

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:57.623
there are six apples.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.085
You wouldn't be able to say
it the other way around.

00:01:00.085 --> 00:01:01.398
So you would rule this one out

00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:03.969
even though it's dealing with
some of the right numbers.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.482
It's not in the right order.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.026
Now let's think about 21 to 18.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.693
To go from seven to 21,

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.451
we would multiply by three.

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.538
And to go from six to 18,

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:17.564
you would also multiply by three.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:18.397
So that works.

00:01:18.397 --> 00:01:20.719
If we multiply both of
these numbers by three,

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.729
we get 21 to 18.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.822
So let me circle that in.

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:27.241
That one is for sure equivalent.

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.908
What about 42 to 36?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.483
Well, to go from seven to 42,

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:36.092
we're going to have to multiply by six.

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:38.390
And to go from six to thirty-six,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.480
we also multiply by six.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.421
So this, once again,
is an equivalent ratio.

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.667
We multiply each of these by six

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.147
and we keep the same order.

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:50.142
So that is equivalent right over there.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:50.975
63 to 54.

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:57.591
Let's see, to go from seven
to 63, you multiply by nine.

00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.841
And to go from six to 54,
you also multiply by nine.

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:06.456
So once again, 63 to 54
is an equivalent ratio.

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:08.042
And so we've already selected three,

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:10.299
but let's just verify
that this doesn't work.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.662
So to go from seven to 84,
you would multiply by 12.

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:16.412
To go from six to 62,

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.015
you multiply by 10 and 2/6

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:25.860
or 10 1/3, so this one is definitely not

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.173
an equivalent ratio.

00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:29.256
Let's do another example.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.256
So once again, we are asked
to select three ratios

00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:35.923
that are equivalent to 16 to 12.

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:40.866
So pause this video and see
if you can work through it.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.323
Alright, let's look at this first one.

00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:44.008
So eight to six.

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:45.370
So at first you might say well, gee,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.776
these numbers are smaller than 16 and 12.

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:49.996
Remember, you can, to
get an equivalent ratio

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:52.200
you can multiply or divide these numbers

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.078
by the same number.

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:56.411
So, to get from 16 to eight,

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.766
you could do that as, well,
we just divided by two.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:04.849
And to go from 12 to six,
you also divide by two.

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:08.365
So this actually is an equivalent ratio.

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:09.813
I'll circle that in.

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:11.480
What about 32 to 24?

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:17.115
Well to go from 16 to
32, we multiply by two.

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:20.815
To go from 12 to 24, we
also multiply by two.

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:23.369
So this is an equivalent ratio.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.181
What about four to three?

00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:27.532
Well, to go from 16 to four,

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:30.951
we would have to divide by four.

00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:33.006
And to go from 12 to three,

00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:35.808
we are going to divide by four as well.

00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:37.127
So we're dividing by the same thing,

00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:38.212
each of these numbers.

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:41.048
So, this is also going to
be an equivalent ratio.

00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:44.158
So we've selected our three,
so we are essentially done.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:47.471
But, we might as well
see why these don't work.

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.700
Now let's think about it.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.367
To go from 16 to 12,

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.389
how do we do that?

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.822
Well, to go from 16 to 12,

00:03:55.822 --> 00:03:58.444
you could divide by four

00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:00.002
and multiply by three.

00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:03.621
So this would be times 3/4.

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:04.935
You would get 12.

00:04:04.935 --> 00:04:06.852
And to go from 12 to eight,

00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:09.320
so you could divide by
three and multiply by two.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.685
So this you could view as times 2/3.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.578
So you'd be multiplying or dividing

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:17.705
by different numbers here, so
this one is not equivalent.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.680
And then 24 to 16?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.850
To go from 16 to 24,
you would multiply by,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.320
let's see, that's 1 1/2.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.505
So this right over here would be,

00:04:26.505 --> 00:04:29.231
you would multiply by 1 1/2.

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.452
And to go from 12 to
16, you would multiply,

00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:34.761
that is, by 1 1/3.

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:37.392
So, times 1 1/3.

00:04:37.392 --> 00:04:39.248
So you're not multiplying
by the same amount.

00:04:39.248 --> 00:04:42.498
So once again, not an equivalent ratio.
