SARAH THOMSON: OK, so I'm back
here with two pretty fantastic

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.830
guests.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.470
This is Mike and Ryan, and I'll
have them introduce themselves,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.930
but essentially
these guys are coming

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.130
from what I like to call
indie boutique publishers.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.726
Sounds fancy?

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.850
Whether or not you agree
with that, you can debate,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.176
but these two folks have been
in the industry for a while,

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:28.550
and I think they're
going to have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.890
a lot of really great
insights and gems of wisdom

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.720
that we're going to share
in the next half an hour.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.980
So if you don't mind,
guys, pick and choose

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.810
who would like to intro
maybe your studio, what

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.830
your background is, and sort
of the vision of what you're

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.510
doing.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.770
RYAN HOLOWATY: Sure.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.700
Do you want me to start?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.680
MIKE GORDON: You can go first.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.310
RYAN HOLOWATY: Cool.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.101
There's going to be a
lot of that, I think.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:52.400
Yeah, so, I'm Ryan.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.720
I'm from Noodlecake Studios.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.640
We are in the middle of Canada.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.600
It's called Saskatoon.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.480
Probably most of you
have never heard of it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.364
If you're flying from
Vancouver to Toronto,

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:02.780
just jump out of
the plane halfway

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.630
and you'll land in Saskatoon.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.380
So yeah, we started out in about
2011 as a first-party studio

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.960
making iPhone games,
and we kind of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.940
pivoted into publishing a little
bit when Android came out.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.372
The quick TLDR story
is we developed

00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:18.830
some software
in-house that allowed

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.970
us to run native
Objective-C code on Android,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.470
figured a bunch of
our indie friends

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.751
would probably want to
capitalize on this because none

00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.750
of them were even supporting
Android at the time

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.570
because it was such
a new platform.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.360
So we used that
and decided instead

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.600
of doing a tech license or
something, because Unity

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.890
was, you know, looming--

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.980
we knew these cross-platform
tools were on their way--

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.080
we decided to make a
publishing company out of it.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.980
And the catch was, we
would take your game,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.790
port it for you for
free, and then we

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.619
would just take a
cut of the rev share,

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.160
market it, do all
that sort of stuff.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.800
So our Android catalog
is actually quite massive

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.750
because we've been
doing this for a while.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.654
Things just kind of
continued to move along,

00:01:55.654 --> 00:01:57.320
and we started getting
developers coming

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.550
to us who said, hey, you
can market and publish

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.120
these games better than we
could on any platform, so

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.650
why don't you take
the whole thing?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.880
And then so we kind
of moved into a more

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.980
traditional publishing
role, as well still making

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.889
our own first-party games at
the time that we kind of used

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.970
to then snowball and
cross-promote our games.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.387
So every time we
launch new games,

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:15.678
it goes out to all of our
users across all of the games

00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:17.690
that we have in our
catalog, which on Android I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.110
think is over 100 and some
at this point, probably, now.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.550
It's getting quite big.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.920
We still do some one-off
publishing deals,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.620
but they're kind of more for the
higher-end indies, if you will.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.300
So the Snowman team, we did
the "Alto" series for them.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.000
We recently took over
the Capybara contract

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.080
for "Sword and Sworcery."

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.149
We've worked with Cyan on
"Myst" and things like that.

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.940
So we kind of do some
of these bigger ones.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.780
But for the most part
now we're cross-platform

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.600
publishing and moving into Steam
and console space now, too,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.805
so we're kind of
running the gamut.

00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:51.020
MIKE GORDON: Cool.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.911
That was awesome.

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:52.410
Yeah.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.370
So I'm Mike.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.430
I'm the CEO of Iron Horse Games.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.130
Iron Horse has been around
for about two years.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.340
We mostly focus on
publishing idle games.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.680
Iron Horse, if you're
curious, is one person,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.270
and he's standing here on stage.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.430
I've put out 11 or 12
games since December.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.290
We're doing pretty
heavy user acquisition

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.030
across the portfolio
at this point.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.820
I mostly focus on small-
and medium-size teams,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.010
one-person teams
like Ben there, who's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.540
one of the teams I work with.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.030
Ben's the very
talented developer

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.430
behind "Swarm Simulator," if
you guys have played that.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.840
It's a great game.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.930
Prior to that, I was the
vice president of publishing

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.820
at Kongregate for
about four years,

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.840
focusing on their mobile
publishing business.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.605
Yeah, that's the
long and short of it.

00:03:37.605 --> 00:03:38.480
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.710
Thanks, guys.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.830
Maybe you can speak a little bit
about what's your journey been

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.460
like so far as a publisher.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.290
It's very different than--

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.230
working for a big company
is very different than being

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.971
purely an indie
developer, so any thoughts

00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:57.470
you'd like to share on what
that journey's been like so far?

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.910
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.820
So "challenging" is
probably one word for it.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.080
I think this was mentioned
in the previous talk

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.000
that Sarah did.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.580
The marketplace shifts
radically and you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.020
need to respond to it quickly.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.300
So started about
two-plus years ago.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.490
And in that time, I have changed
my business model fundamentally

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.716
three times and successfully
dodged a couple of bullets.

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:26.090
So hopefully, I've got a couple
more of those left in me.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.422
As challenging as it is, I think
one of the things that's great

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:34.880
about it is you can help small-
and medium-sized developers

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.652
actually grow.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:37.610
I've had a lot of
conversations with developers

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.160
where they've actually
tried to dissuade me

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.540
from signing their games
and working on them.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.280
I've had conversations
where developers have said,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.200
are you sure you want
to invest in this game?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.740
Like, you think it's really
going to do this well?

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.239
And the answer, nine
times out of 10, is yes.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:56.030
At least it's going to
do well enough to be

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.440
worth the effort to put it out.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.780
And in many of the
cases, it's well enough

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.160
to generate a significant
amount of revenue

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.410
for myself and the developers.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.770
So it's been challenging,
but if you can adapt quickly

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.880
to the changing marketplace
on iOS and on Google Play,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.030
you can capture
a lot of success.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.780
RYAN HOLOWATY: Yeah,
I mean, I can kind of

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.821
piggyback on that answer.

00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.300
He's right-- you've
got to be lean

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.130
and you've got to
be able to move.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.222
For us, our publishing is we do
the user acquisition marketing

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.680
side of things,
too, but we're also

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.870
more of a technical publisher.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.150
Teams will come to us
with, you know, partially

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.069
finished projects, and it
can range from 25% to 85%--

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:35.110
it doesn't really matter.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.640
Kind of depends on when
they decide they want

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.150
to reach out to a publisher.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.240
So we take on games of
all sorts and sizes,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.190
and how those deals
work really depends

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.677
on what they're looking for.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.260
And so one of the
big things is, yeah,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.110
like being very quickly
able to adapt to the market.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.930
Because again, Unity didn't
exist back in the day

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.347
when we started this, and now
it does and it's everywhere,

00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:57.763
and that totally crushed the
whole porting side of things.

00:05:57.763 --> 00:05:59.630
But we saw that coming,
so we had to adjust.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.990
You know, the fall of
the bottom of pricing

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.580
was a huge thing we
had to adjust for,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.430
because back in the day when
only four games came out

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.455
a month, you could charge $5
for that game and it was great.

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.830
But now, it's like everyone's
releasing 100 games a week,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.126
so, you know, how do you acquire
users through different means

00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:16.750
than just looking
for feature placement

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.270
on the stores and
things like that?

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.720
So yeah, you got to be
able to move and adapt,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.400
and I think we've been good
at doing that at the office.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.245
And still, a part
of us just-- well,

00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:27.670
we like to stick
to our roots when

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.300
it comes to games and the
games we're working with,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.150
so if it's something we
think is fun and cool,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.950
we'll probably figure out a way
to work with you, too, on it.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.533
So it doesn't
necessarily have to fall

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:37.856
into a single type of genre.

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.390
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.710
I think if I don't ask this,
someone will probably ask this

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.200
during the Q&amp;A. So
what are you looking

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.750
for in games and indie
games, specifically, that

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.930
catch your attention?

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.420
How do you-- how, as an
indie game developer,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.310
do you create a
really effective pitch

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.570
to drum up interest around
a publisher such as yourself

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.834
or any of the other
publishers out there?

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.250
RYAN HOLOWATY:
Yeah, so for us, we

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.990
see a lot of pitches every day.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.120
I would say we're probably
in the range between 10

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.859
and 15 pitches of games a day
that, throughout the week,

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:17.400
we're tallying up
to over 100 pitches

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.820
we see very wildly
range in quality.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.447
But to stand out, I
mean, you're probably not

00:07:23.447 --> 00:07:24.780
as clever as you think you are--

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.550
I'll tell you that right
away, because we see a lot.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.094
So the big thing for us is
when we're looking for games,

00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:32.010
I mean, we obviously are
looking for something

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.410
that is going to catch us--

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.754
something, is it interesting?

00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:36.420
Is it different?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.540
You know, if it's very
generic, run-of-the-mill,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.790
we've seen it a million times.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.748
It's probably not going
to do that much for us.

00:07:41.748 --> 00:07:44.190
So if it is a genre of
something that exists already,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.160
try to put a unique spin on
it, something that might not

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.140
be something we've seen before.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.270
Or if it is, just make
sure it's damn good,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.449
because a lot of people just
stick to a Unity template

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.740
and that's it, and that's
not going to help you either,

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.260
because we've
literally been pitched

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.660
Unity templates before us as
potential publishing games.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.770
So it's a pretty wide smattering
of things that we work with.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.840
But if you can hook us
with something unique,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.736
something interesting,
and you are

00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:11.610
going to sell it just
as much as the game is.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.590
So are you a
competent developer?

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.610
Do you know your stuff?

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.190
Do you know, you know, the
roadmap for your games?

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.290
Do you know the cost
to get some things done

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.640
if you need funding?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.080
Having your stuff
together is just

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.350
as important as the game
itself, because we'll vet you

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.855
as a developer,
and if we think we

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:28.230
can't work with
you on something,

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.970
then we'll dump the game even
if the game itself is cool, so.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.746
MIKE GORDON: Yeah, to
piggyback off what you said,

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:36.120
one of the first
checks that I do

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.536
when I'm talking
to a developer is

00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:39.850
if we have a shared sense
of what success is going

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.360
to look like on the title.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.110
I think a lot of
developers haven't either

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.870
thought about that or they think
about themselves as artists

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.644
as opposed to businessmen.

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:49.560
You can be an artist,
you can put the game out

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.730
as an art project--

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.010
you just can't come to
me to publish that game,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.090
because I won't publish.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.000
RYAN HOLOWATY: But we might.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.750
MIKE GORDON: Yeah.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.570
You should talk to Noodlecake.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.250
But don't talk to me.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.340
The reality of the
situation is I'm

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.210
looking to help you
grow a business,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.040
and if we don't share that at
the start of our relationship,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.670
then it's over before it starts.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.740
I think the other
important point

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.560
is you should think
about the game

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.829
and how you pitch
and present the game,

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.370
the way that I think
about it and how

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.650
I'm going to take it to
places like Google and Apple.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.660
So if you were to come
to me and you're like,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.120
hey, I've got a game,
it's like "Clash of Clans"

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.679
but they're pandas, that's
not going to cut it.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.220
What I'm really looking for is
something that's going to kind

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.070
of move the genre
forward in a way that's--

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.437
introduces some complexity
that doesn't exist there now,

00:09:41.437 --> 00:09:43.020
and then usually a
presentation or art

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.436
style that's slightly different
or unique that you haven't

00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:47.540
really seen in
that genre before,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.110
or that's really well executed.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.255
I think when I'm trying to
tick those boxes myself,

00:09:52.255 --> 00:09:54.630
I'm not trying to tick them
because those are things that

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.010
are inherently
interesting to me,

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.516
although they are interesting.

00:09:57.516 --> 00:09:58.890
I'm ticking them
because it helps

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.000
to differentiate the
title to Apple and Google

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.430
for featuring
purposes and support

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.200
and to just get their attention
to get feedback on the game.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.140
So think about that when you're
pitching games to publishers,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.320
too.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.370
It's really important.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.953
RYAN HOLOWATY: Yeah, like we had
a game called "Chameleon Run"

00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:16.500
that we published years back,
and that game is basically--

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.560
you've seen the genre
before 100 million times.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.870
It's an auto-runner with a
color-switching mechanic.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.840
But the developer who made it
understood how to push that

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.850
genre forward in
such a unique way.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.556
His controls are beyond tight,
the onboarding was amazing,

00:10:30.556 --> 00:10:32.430
he had a great visual
style, and just kind of

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.680
pushed it into a way that
was like, you've seen it,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.550
but not like this.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.010
And it was great and it
was one of those games

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.570
that, when we got pitched
the demo of that game,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.440
it was just a couple,
like, demo levels.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.940
And we got it over a lunch hour
and we were at a restaurant,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.130
and a couple of the
guys started playing it.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.120
One guy went to the washroom,
stayed in the washroom,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.830
and beat the entire demo
while he was in the washroom.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.960
We all went back to the
office and we knew right away

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.070
that there was
something there, right?

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.319
There was a hook to that game.

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:56.550
It ended up winning an Apple
Design Award, you know,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.290
has been Editor's
Choice on Google Play.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.060
You know, it was a
huge smash for a game

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.393
that essentially at its core,
still just an auto-runner.

00:11:02.393 --> 00:11:03.930
But they pushed
the genre forward,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.870
so that's definitely something
that we look forward to.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.140
SARAH THOMSON: That's actually
me and Flipflop Solitaire.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.730
Yeah.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.271
I've played a whole
lot of that game.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.570
Very basic concept, but,
like, just so well done.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.520
Yeah.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.440
Talk to me about how
you look at success.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.230
Success is a very
broad term, and success

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.960
is something that means
a lot of different things

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.400
to different people, so talk to
me about how that looks for you

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.080
and perhaps maybe
how indies should be

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.170
looking at success on mobile.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.525
RYAN HOLOWATY: You know,
for us, success definitely--

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.400
I mean, there's the
monetary aspect of it is,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.941
like, the easy one--
to just say, oh,

00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:46.110
is it going to make money
for us and the developer?

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.250
I mean, that's obviously
the starting point

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.200
that people are
looking at, but what

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.080
kind of money that makes
definitely can vary.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.540
Success to one developer
might be totally different

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.280
to another one,
depending on their needs.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.200
Is this a full-time
gig that you're doing?

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.994
Is it an evening
and weekend project?

00:12:00.994 --> 00:12:02.410
We've had some
devs who, you know,

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.120
they just wanted to make
their development money back.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.110
We've had others
who this was like,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.480
I might lose my house situation.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.770
Don't be that developer, please.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.820
MIKE GORDON: Please
don't be that developer.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.840
RYAN HOLOWATY: But
there are people,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.340
there are devs out
there like that.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.990
So you know, there's
nothing wrong

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.570
with being what I like to
call a blue-collar indie dev.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.270
Like, you don't have to set
the world on fire with one game

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.160
and make a million
dollars and retire.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.810
It's not probably
going to happen.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.660
So, you know, if you make
enough to make your next game,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.310
that's success to me.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.490
MIKE GORDON: Yeah,
for me success--

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.305
it's kind of three
different definitions there.

00:12:32.305 --> 00:12:34.180
I mean, the first for
me and the most obvious

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.970
is being able to generate
enough revenue to reinvest back

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.022
into the business and grow
the business, both for myself

00:12:40.022 --> 00:12:40.980
and for the developers.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.442
So that's-- over the
last six or so months,

00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:46.900
we've been doing some pretty
heavy marketing and that's all

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.240
bootstrapped, so that's off
of revenues that have been

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.610
generated off the game that
have been reinvested in the game

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.151
that led to larger revenues that
let me reinvest, blah, blah,

00:12:54.151 --> 00:12:54.800
blah.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.610
And then fund new games
as well, so that's

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.930
a market success for me.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.360
I think, you know,
dovetailing with what

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.030
I was saying before about
developers approaching me

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.220
and not really seeing
what I see in their games,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.130
I think it's particularly
satisfying for me

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:14.050
when we blow the doors off on
a game with a one-man shop.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.340
I mean, for me, I can always--

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.200
I can see that potential, and
that's why I'm signing the game

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.780
and working with that developer.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.890
But when the developer
kind of realizes that

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.730
and they're able to invest
in growing their business,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.200
that's great, too.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.390
One of the developers
I work with,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.240
Sebastian Davies
from Grumpy Rhino,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.300
has been able to open an
office in London solely off

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.430
of the revenues we've
generated off of his titles.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.340
So that's been totally great.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.310
I mean, that's a
real mark of success.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.540
And then something much
more mundane and practical

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.390
is, I came from
really large companies

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.750
before this, where I spent
most of my time managing people

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.200
and in meetings.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.570
A daily reminder of the success
that Iron Horse has had for me

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.130
is that I have like one
meeting a week and that's it.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.530
I don't really do calls.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.290
I just work and then I hang
out with my two-year-old son,

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.390
and it is awesome.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.870
SARAH THOMSON: Jealous, because
that sounds pretty awesome.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.894
MIKE GORDON: It is.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.560
SARAH THOMSON: OK,
so there's two things

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.221
that I want to
follow up with you

00:14:16.221 --> 00:14:18.220
on that kind of teased
out of what you were just

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.920
talking about.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.160
So one thing that was
mentioned is sustainability.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.370
So building off that
idea of success like, OK,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.410
it's one thing to launch
a game that does well,

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.370
but how, especially,
as a smaller studio,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.580
indie developers-- how do you
create that sustainability?

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.600
That's like, you know, the
million-dollar question, right?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.040
MIKE GORDON: Sure.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.430
For me, as a publisher,
being a publisher,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.470
the reason that you're
publishing games

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.330
is it distributes your risk
across a number of titles.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.030
So it's inherently
much more stable

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.590
than being an independent dev.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.280
Plus we get snapshots of the
market on a regular basis--

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.555
like, however fast
you're shipping titles,

00:14:55.555 --> 00:14:58.600
it's nowhere near how fast the
two of us are shipping titles.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.220
So literally, you know,
at least once a quarter--

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.380
most times it's multiple
times in a quarter-- we're

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.920
seeing what the current snapshot
of iOS and Android looks

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.870
like, how difficult
it is to get features,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.970
what CPIs look like with
different genres of games

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.320
and art styles.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.390
So that's an advantage
of publishing

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.910
that a lot of indie
developers don't have.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.220
One of the hybrid approaches
that we've been trying out

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.030
at Iron Horse is to
partner developers

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.850
that have had success
with new developers

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.100
that we're onboarding
for a portion

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.680
of the revenue on the new game.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.220
And the idea there is the
new developer benefits

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.260
from the experience of
the older developer,

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.600
they get more attention
than I can really give them,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.440
being a single man
publisher, and it also

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.620
helps stabilize them financially
a little bit between launches.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.960
And it's not a massive
commitment, right?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.150
They're really playing
builds, giving feedback

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.570
on art style and execution,
game balancing, monetization,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.590
stuff like that.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.500
Similar to what I do, it
gives them a little bit more

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.066
of a cash flow between
launches, and they also

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:04.690
get exposed to some
of the stuff that I

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.950
get exposed to, so they have
the added benefit of seeing

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.060
information on retention,
how ads are performing,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.067
monetization.

00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:13.900
RYAN HOLOWATY: Yeah.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.566
I would say, too, if
you're looking for,

00:16:15.566 --> 00:16:17.690
like, just as an indie
to sustain success,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.750
I think you really
need to identify what

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.020
it is you're trying to
create and how long that's

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.760
supposed to take.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.925
If you're just making,
like, one-off quick arcade

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:28.300
games and that
kind of thing, you

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.591
need to set your scope
properly, because scope creep is

00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.380
one of the worst
things in our industry

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.902
and can cost you a lot
of money, and then you're

00:16:34.902 --> 00:16:37.360
not going to make that back if
your launch doesn't go well.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.943
So understanding how you need
to release those kind of games--

00:16:39.943 --> 00:16:42.324
if you're going to be a
quick, rapid-fire, making

00:16:42.324 --> 00:16:43.990
a couple of games a
year type of studio,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.120
or are you a
two-year-long investment

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.041
kind of studio or
something above that?

00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:49.540
And then on that
situation, you need

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.504
to understand how to
build your community,

00:16:51.504 --> 00:16:53.170
how to do your user
acquisition, and how

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.910
to make that game
profitable, because you're

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.500
spending a hell of a lot
more money on that one

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.749
than you are on the small one.

00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:00.160
So you really need to
understand what your business is

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.690
and what you are
trying to achieve,

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.510
because you can't
sustain one model

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.260
by using a different
model, and the models

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.440
are changing all the time.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.770
So just ensure that
you're keeping track with

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.256
the marketplace--
what's hot, what isn't.

00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:13.089
You know, if you're
looking to, like I said,

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.417
pump out a lot of games, be on
top of what's being featured.

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:18.250
You know, look at what
Apple and Google like

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.200
to put front and
center, because they're

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.520
showcasing your game to help
represent their platform.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.496
So if it's something
that is totally counter

00:17:24.496 --> 00:17:26.829
to what they're doing, you
know, you're not playing ball

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.204
with the platforms,
and sometimes

00:17:28.204 --> 00:17:31.880
you got to play
ball to get noticed.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.620
SARAH THOMSON:
One last question.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.630
There was also a
mention around--

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.780
Mike, you've been
talking a lot about UA.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.700
There's also community-building,
which is so important,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.180
and I think a lot of
really small indie studios

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.540
struggle with building
a community, building

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.590
that loyalty, not
only around your games

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.920
but around your
studio, your brand.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.380
Talk to me a little bit
about that and your approach.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.310
MIKE GORDON: Sure.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.847
Community-building I leave up
to very capable developers.

00:17:58.847 --> 00:18:01.430
So if you're curious about how
to build up an active community

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.700
and engage with them,
you should talk to Ben.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.783
We were actually just
talking about that at lunch.

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.670
And he does an
exemplary job wading

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.400
through the trenches
with the players who

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.680
have a lot of really
pointed feedback about Ben's

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.890
game and Ben generally.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.560
So you should-- it's great.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.630
As far as marketing
and user acquisition,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.780
I think there's a lot of
mystique around it, right?

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.450
Folks think it's some
impenetrable thing that you

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.850
need years of experience to do.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:30.680
My general rule of
thumb is you should baby

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.070
step when you first start
with any user acquisition

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.790
and largely ignore what
marketing companies are telling

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.990
you.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.700
The only thing
that really matters

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.130
as far as you're
concerned is, did you

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.680
generate an equal
amount of money

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.870
or a greater amount of
money from the users

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.990
that you acquired
than what you spent?

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.752
That's it.

00:18:51.752 --> 00:18:53.960
Like, there's nothing--
they're going to try and say,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.380
oh, actually retention, because
retention is really strongly

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.680
correlated, blah, blah.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.660
Just ignore all that.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.493
It's like, did that
user give you more money

00:19:01.493 --> 00:19:02.650
than you spent on it?

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.722
Done.

00:19:03.722 --> 00:19:05.936
It's a really
simple math problem.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.310
I think from there,
you can start

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.420
doing things that are really
interesting, which is, oh,

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.450
did we have an increased
organic impact on one

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.960
platform over another?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.100
I mean, I without shame spend
a ton of money on Google Play,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.730
and one of the reasons I do
it is because the ROI's great

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.370
because CPIs are
manageable on Google Play,

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.700
but also there's a huge organic
coefficient to my spend.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.360
So I do it and I do it a lot,
and I try and maximize that

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.410
on that platform.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.750
I think you don't
get to a place where

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.890
you're spending six figures
on a platform overnight--

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.030
I certainly didn't.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.930
We started spending, I don't
know, $5,000 in a month

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.310
or $3,000 in a month.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.090
And you get a really strong
signal about what's working.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.486
So you start small, build
up on your learnings,

00:19:52.486 --> 00:19:54.110
and then scale your
spend appropriately

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.030
based on the money that you
get paid out from platforms,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.330
which is what I did.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.675
RYAN HOLOWATY: Yeah,
and I would also say

00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:02.300
know the game you're
working on and who

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.590
the players are going to be.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.740
So, I mean, obviously you're all
working on something different.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.472
You might still be making
some sort of premium title,

00:20:09.472 --> 00:20:11.180
you might be making
a free-to-play title.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.410
It doesn't really
matter, but how

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.535
you approach marketing
those games in the community

00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:16.227
is definitely going
to be different.

00:20:16.227 --> 00:20:18.560
You know, if you're in the
free-to-play space, you know,

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.240
like Mike said,
the ratio is easy.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.900
Yeah.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.750
It's the way we do it,
too, is if you spend

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.030
too much on a user,
then stop doing that,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.860
because you're never
going to make money.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.190
But you know, if you're
doing a premium game, that

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.750
doesn't really adhere,
because a $5 premium game,

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.347
you're never going to get the
rates to make that worth it.

00:20:36.347 --> 00:20:38.180
But then you have to
take a different road--

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.100
you know, get on Discord
or something and start

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.891
building a community
there about your game.

00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:43.940
Get on whatever forums
or wherever people talk

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.810
about similar games that yours
is, and start drumming up

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:47.560
interest that way.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.789
Use things like
preregistration and other ways

00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:52.580
to help, like, drive
engagement, especially

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.980
for a paid game, because
you need those users there

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.320
to know when it's out,
because it's a lot harder

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.820
sell when it's a paid
game versus a free game.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.605
And then, you know, if you
can't do any of that stuff--

00:21:02.605 --> 00:21:04.480
he maybe doesn't do as
much of that community

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.955
engagement-- we help
with some of that a bit.

00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:08.330
Again, it's better
to really have

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.950
the developers talking about
their game than a salesman.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.820
It feels a little greasier if
it's a sales guy just pitching

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.220
a game versus an actual hey,
I made this, kind of thing.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.500
But we'll work with you
on how to set that up.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.616
And yeah, it's just
important to know where

00:21:20.616 --> 00:21:21.740
the people are going to be.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.050
Maybe you want to get your
game featured on Polygon.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.841
You're probably not
going to, but you know,

00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:27.470
I can at least open
the doors for you

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.053
and we can work on
that kind of stuff.

00:21:29.053 --> 00:21:31.844
So it's things like that, like
understanding what your game is

00:21:31.844 --> 00:21:34.010
and being realistic about
that and not just thinking

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.300
that you're going to
set the world on fire

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.860
with every single game, because
again, that's not the case.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.360
There's a lot of
games that come out

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.490
and not a lot make money, so.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.980
SARAH THOMSON: My personal
favorite is Reddit.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.940
Free tool.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.850
And that's actually how I've
discovered a couple of games,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.900
and recommended folks to apply
for Indie Corner Featuring.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.080
That's a little
self-promotion there.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.740
OK, awesome.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.560
Thanks, guys.
