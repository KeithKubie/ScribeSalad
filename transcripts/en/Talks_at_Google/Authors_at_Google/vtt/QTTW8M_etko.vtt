[upbeat music plays]

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.270
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: On May 2, 2011, Nicholas
Farmer was at Professor Thom's on 2nd Avenue

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.080
in New York City. Maurice, the bartender,
nudged him and said, "Hey, Nick. There's the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.070
author of Game of Thrones." They were all
there to watch the HBO version of the book.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.500
Nicholas approached the creator and a conversation
ensued. He asked if he'd heard of Authors@Google

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.750
and if he'd be interested in speaking there.
Friendly guy that our guest is, he said, "Have

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.230
your mother contact my publicist. It's up
to him."

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.300
[laughter]

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.780
I turned to our Authors@Google network. The
publicist was contacted and the return email

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.750
offered "July 28th at noon. Work for you?"
"Yup." So, here we are today, July 28th at

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.980
noon, our first live streaming of an Authors@Google
event.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.979
Thank you all for joining us. You, the viewers,
have shaped the questions we will be asking

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.420
today. And thanks to all the people here at
Google that helped make this event possible.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.960
And now, our one and only, Dan Anthony, will
introduce today's guest.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.110
[applause]

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.899
&gt;&gt;Dan: Wow. This is awesome. We’ve got one
of the largest rooms on campus and it's packed

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.409
to standing room only. About the only thing
that would be cooler than this was if Joss

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.259
Whedon came rushing in the door and said he
suddenly had to cast a Googler to star opposite

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.659
Scarlett Johansson.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.659
[laughter]

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.279
I think for a lot of us, fantasy, our journey
into fantasy, is an individual thing. And

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:51.709
it's very much of our generation. As a child
of the '70s, like I suspect a lot of people

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.119
in this room, my first foray into fantasy
was The Sword of Shannara and I never looked

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.119
back from there.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.109
It took me a while to get to A Game of Thrones,
which as hopefully everyone knows, is the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.420
first book in A Song of Ice and Fire. And
like a lot of people in this room, I suspect

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.069
we had some of the same touch points. You
know, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, Terry

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.860
Goodkind, Tolkien, all the folks who really
make up the backbone of fantasy.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.989
But I think one thing we can all agree on
no matter how we got here is Game of Thrones.

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.920
It's certainly not The Sword of Shannara.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920
[laughter]

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.959
But it probably helps that, as a New Zealander,
fantasy is in our blood and we're used to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:33.959
weird things.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.959
[laughter]

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.261
So, not only do we have Australians to deal
with--

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.261
[laughter]

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:46.900
but we've got Orcs, Goblins, Hobbits, Dwarves,
Horselords, men in leather with swords and

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.500
whips and chains. And heck, that's pretty
much any Auckland nightclub on a Saturday

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
night.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500
[laughter]

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.379
But what we don't have is any characters as
awesome as the world's favorite Dwarf, Tyrion

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.670
Lannister. And George, that doesn't mean you
can kill him off now.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.670
[laughter]

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.140
And Tyrion is only one of many. And we have
Arya. We have Cersei, Jaime, Ned, for the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.340
ten minutes he was alive.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.050
[laughter]

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.359
And it's not just the main characters that
are really interesting. There's a whole host

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:27.239
of smaller characters: Davos, Bronn, Syrio.
And these are all compelling and ritually

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.219
realized and possibly part of that is the
way that the story is structured.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.400
When your characters have an average life
expectancy of 37 pages, you're gonna have

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.439
to have a long life cycle. But regardless,
it’s given us a really rich world to get

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.409
immersed in. And now we've got the HBO series
which is bringing a whole new realm of audience

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.599
to these books.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.379
And for those of us who are readers of the
books, it means that we now know we have to

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.200
get the next two books within six years 'cause
they need them for season 7 of the HBO series.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.250
[laughter]

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.459
But the really cool things about these books,
and I think the thing that resonates, is they

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.540
are truly a world-wide phenomenon. They're
in 22 languages, or 20-odd languages and I

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.219
just got back from a 'round the world trip
at eight different countries, four different

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.689
continents and every country, I found people
I could talk to about the books that really

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:15.709
got into it.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.874
And there's something really cool about walking
into some rinky-dink little book shop in the

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:27.130
back streets of Hong Kong, and front and center
is Game of Thrones on display. But I learned

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.600
something on the trip. So, in India, it seems
they censor HBO and they censor it quite heavily.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.530
I also learned that in India, they don't like
movies where the hero dies. So this leads

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.740
me to believe that in India, Game of Thrones
is gonna be 23 minutes long and it's gonna

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.880
be the most unpopular 23 minutes in television
history.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
[laughter]

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.160
Ladies and gentlemen, the man who's given
us one of the best fantasy series of all time,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.570
one of the most compelling reasons to watch
television today, a man who made it acceptable

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.660
for nerd to talk about fantasy in public again--

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.660
[laughter]

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:10.780
please join me in welcoming George R. R. Martin.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.490
[applause]

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.690
&gt;&gt;Martin: Thank you all. It's a thrill to
be here. This is quite a kick for me. I'm

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:28.390
on my book tour now for Dance With Dragons
and visiting a city a day. It's sort of a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.820
blur where I am right now. But I've done many
events. This is the first time I've done one

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.990
like this, however, where most of the audience
seems to have computers in their laps.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.250
That's sort of intimidating.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.210
[laughter]

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:53.321
But interesting. Very interesting. So, it's--.
I came out of the world of science fiction.

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:58.120
I wrote a lot of science fiction early in
my career and I've always gone back and forth

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.930
with those science fiction writers about whether
fantasy and science fiction are in fact two

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.340
different flavors of the same thing, which
is my contention, or whether they're absolute

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.590
polar opposites.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.410
And fantasy is corrupting the precious bodily
fluids of science fiction, which is the contention

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.900
of others. And I think the fact that I'm here
at this campus devoted to the world of computers

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.260
and the cutting edge of tomorrow and you're
all fantasy geeks, is proof that I'm right.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.260
[laughter]

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.120
And it's all one big thing.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you for coming, George. We really
appreciate it. And a token of our appreciation,

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.590
on behalf of the whole project team, presented
by the person who designed these fine t-shirts

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.590
that we're wearing.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.150
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Oh, thank you. Thank you
very much.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.050
&gt;&gt;Female Shirt Designer: It was entirely inspired
by you.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.050
[clapping]

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.810
It's our take on the wonderful mythos that
you created and we combined it with the Android.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.810
So, it's an homage.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.810
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Thank you. Great. Thank you
very much.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.810
&gt;&gt;Female Shirt Designer: Take care.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: And we do expect you to wear it on
your next television appearance.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.790
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Oh, OK.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.790
[laughter]

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, for everyone in attendance and
the folks on the stream, we have taken the

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.220
most popular questions from the YouTube page--the
moderated page--and from internal Googlers.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.140
And we'll be going through those questions
today. One of the guiding principles we have,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.430
since a lot of the folks here are gonna be
new to the series and know it either from

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.420
television or from just reading the first
book, is we're not gonna ask any questions

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.700
that touch on content matter beyond A Game
of Thrones.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:40.420
So, even if your question got bumped up, unfortunately,
we may not be asking it today. So with that,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.170
we have a question from Jigger444.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.120
[laughter]

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.640
"You mentioned you had trouble cutting down
some of the Arya chapters for A Dance with

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.940
Dragons. Would you ever post the unused material
on your website?"

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:59.970
&gt;&gt;George Martin: No, probably not. [chuckles]
I do save everything. When I cut material,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.660
I do save it because I may find a place for
it later. And there are things that I cut

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:10.150
out of the second book that I find a place
for in the fourth book. And that sort of thing

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.030
is constantly going on.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.750
But I'm still carrying forward with material
that I cut from the first book. Some of it

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.740
as short as a single, pithy sentence that
I particularly liked, but no longer fit and

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:31.580
others half chapters that I took out. And
maybe I'll find a place for that, but I have

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:38.140
a feeling that much of that and more will
still be in my files when the whole series

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.140
is done.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:48.880
But I don't know if I ever want it getting
out there. [audience laughs] It's taken out

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:58.240
for a reason. There's one chapter from the
new book, from Dance with Dragons, that I,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.260
this does go beyond Game of Thrones, but I'll
be vague. There's this Tyrion chapter that

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.970
drove me crazy all through the decade, it
seemed, that I worked on, on Dance with Dragons.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.150
That was precursor for Feast for Crows where
I kept putting it in and taking it out and

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:21.050
putting it in then taking it out. And then
I put it in as a dream sequence and I took

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.190
it out. Then, I made it a series of recurring
dreams, each one going slightly further. So

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.800
I put it in seven chapters. And then I took
it out of those seven chapters.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.730
[laughter]

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:39.420
It's one of those chapters that I think is,
by itself, is a terrific chapter. I liked

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.920
the way it came together. It's vivid. It's
kind of spooky. It's got some really great

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.640
visual imagery in it and it leads me absolutely
down a dead end, where if I take that path

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.690
I'm stuck on a detour and so, I had to take
it out.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.950
That chapter I may, I don't know, publish
at some point down the road, but not most

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.500
of the other material.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great. So the next one is a multi-part
question. And it came up a lot on the public

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.640
site and there are also some Googler questions
around it as well. "Have you ever," and this

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.220
comes from somebody whose name I can't pronounce
in Vancouver.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.270
[audience chuckles]
"Have you ever been influenced by some of

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.800
the crazy theories your fans come up with
for mysteries in the books? Have you ever

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.900
changed an aspect of your story based on fan
feedback, or if one of their theories is better

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.800
than what you originally planned?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800
[laughter]

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.580
&gt;&gt;George Martin: No. But I am concerned about
that possibility, which is one of the reasons

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.390
I don't tend to read the fan boards. I mean,
when the first fan boards started occurring

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.710
and they started theorizing and analyzing
books in such detail, and I'm going back now

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.000
to the mid-'90s, really, when the first boards
appeared.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.050
Dragon Stone coming out of Australia that
Peter Gibb ran, I think was the first board

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.740
I was aware of. And a couple others came up
after that. I was very flattered and I did

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:09.850
read all the theories. And then precisely
this point occurred where it says, "You know,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.040
what if they're guessing the things that I
haven't revealed yet? What if they guessed

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.140
them correctly? How does that affect me?"

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:21.960
Do I then say, "Oh, my God? They figured it
out already. I'd better change it. Or do I

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.240
just ignore it and plow ahead? And what if
they come up with better ideas than the ones

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.300
I had? Do I steal them?" And I didn't like
any of these possibilities.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.940
So I said it would be better for me to try
to keep my distance and not go on these boards

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.170
and try to--. Somehow, it was a futile effort
because people also write me emails and people

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.860
come to public forums like this. And they
come up to me at signings and whisper their

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.230
theories in my ear.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.230
[laughter]

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:53.340
And things like that. So, I am aware of some
of the speculation out there, but I try to

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:59.730
keep my distance from it precisely because
I don't wanna be impacted. I mean, it's one

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:07.150
of the drawbacks of the whole internet culture
in this world that you guys have created--

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.920
[laughter]

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:17.560
that something that previously maybe one reader
in a thousand would have guessed, but you

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.190
still had the other 999 who would have no
inkling until you reveal it in a book. Now,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:30.500
that one person in a thousand puts it on an
internet message board and everybody sees

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.000
it and they say, "Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right.
Now I see the clues. I got it."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.600
And pretty soon, half the readership, or at
least the internet savvy portion of your readership,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.880
knows it. But what do you do then? Do you
change it and come up with something goofy

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.540
and outlandish that you haven't lead the,
that you haven't done the foreshadowing for,

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.380
that you haven't laid the foundation for just
in order to surprise people?

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.750
I mean, sure. I could have like, aliens come
down and--

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:56.750
[laughter]

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.830
that would certainly surprise the hell out
of everybody. No one is predicting that, but

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.040
it would ruin the series.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.520
[laughter]

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.941
So, basically you can't let yourself be influenced
by this stuff. And I try not to.

00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:19.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great. So, Rita Meyer, who is a Googler
asked--as a sub question--"With the books

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.420
now being adapted for a successful TV series
that you also write for, do you think this

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.279
will have an influence on the decisions and
choices you make in the novels?"

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:34.490
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, once again, no. I hope
not. The novels are novels and the TV series

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:42.460
is the TV series. And they're two different
beasts. The TV series is very faithful so

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.541
far. I do write for the series.

00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:51.860
I do one episode per season. I'm also co-executive
producer on the series. I have great relationship

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.660
with David Benioff and Dan Weiss, who are
the show runners and the main writers on the

00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.920
series. But ultimately, that's their baby
and the books are my baby. And--

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.089
[George Martin clears throat]

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:08.440
there is the possibility, that as faithful
as we've started out and as faithful as we

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:17.870
intend to be, that changes will come into
effect--what I call the "butterfly effect."

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:23.310
Which I'm sure, being the audience you are,
you all understand because you've read Ray

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.560
Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder."

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.680
You step on a butterfly in the Pleistocene
and it seems very minor, but suddenly you

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.790
return to the future and all of human history
has changed because of that butterfly. A small

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:44.149
change can produce large changes later on.
And that's a question on the show. I mean,

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:48.690
we've already seen in the first season, as
faithful as it was, at least two significant

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.990
departures.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:15:01.080
One character, who has his tongue torn out
with hot pincers, who later in my books that

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.589
doesn't happen to him and he's around and
gets involved pretty seriously in some stuff

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:11.570
in Book Three. He's not gonna be around to
do that. So, David and Dan are gonna have

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.510
to remove that stuff or create a new character
or somehow address that problem.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:22.860
Similarly, the great scene in Book One or
in the first season where Khal Drogo confronts

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:33.180
the man Mago, the Dothraki bloodrider and
rips out his tongue. Terrific scene. Completely

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.280
made up by largely Jason Momoa and by Dan
and David. It doesn't happen in my books.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:45.400
Mago is still alive in the books and still
has yet to be dealt with, so these kind of

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.340
butterfly effect things may produce changes
down the road. But I mean, what am I gonna

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.410
do? Go back and retroactively rewrite Book
One? Maybe I should.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:56.410
[laughter]

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:02.800
That throat scene was great, but [laughs]
no. I can't let myself be affected. I am aware

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.080
what they're doing in the show. I advise Dan
and David whenever they're about to hit the

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.720
butterfly effect and sometimes they change
according to that and sometimes they plunge

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720
ahead.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.750
So, the two beasts are the two beasts and
each one is separate from the other.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:26.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK. So, coming from Tinanti in Slovenia,
"What was your favorite and--well now we know

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.650
this--what was your favorite and least favorite
scene in HBO's Game of Thrones?"

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.270
&gt;&gt;George Martin:

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.900
[clears throat]

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.060
My favorite scene--. Well, this of course,
I suppose everybody's seen this series now,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.140
so I don't have to worry about giving things
away. But, my favorite scene had to be the

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:51.320
end of Book--, end of Episode Nine, the execution
of Ned. I thought they did that very powerfully.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:17:00.330
It was not precisely as described in the books,
but it was certainly moving and evocative.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.880
The director did a great job on it. The script
writers did a great job. They added a wonderful

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:10.360
grace note, which is when Ned is being led
up to the stairs where he sees Arya and he

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:16.379
says to Yoren of the Night's Watch as he passes
him he says, "Baylor," to set in motion Yoren

00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:19.589
saving Arya, which is not in the books.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:23.799
In the books, Yoren just spots her on his
own and takes his own initiative. But it was

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:32.239
a great idea to give that little moment, that
one last heroic act by Ned. So, I love that.

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:36.350
I love what they did with that moment. But
there are a lot of great scenes that I love.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:45.610
The final scene with Dany , the season closing
episode, which I was in.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.220
Considerable trepidation about because you
know, how good were the dragons gonna be?

00:17:50.220 --> 00:18:02.659
That's a big CGI thing. [clears throat] And
it's a reality of television today that television

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:08.610
has become so good and the technical standards
have become so good that a large portion of

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:14.590
the audience is judging us on the basis of
what they're seeing on major motion pictures.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:21.049
So, we always have to run the risk of if we
do CGI, people will say, "Well, it's not as

00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:27.489
good as what I saw in Lord of the Rings, or
in the latest big budget science fiction picture."

00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:31.220
And that's so frustrating 'cause of course
those shows have immensely more time than

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:37.220
we do and they have budgets that are ten,
twenty , a hundred times our budget.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:42.369
And there was a time when the audience made
that distinction. They did not expect [clears

00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:49.200
throat] a chase scene on an episode of TJ
Hooker to match what they would see in Bullitt

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.643
or The French Connection where a major motion
picture cop scene at the time. But now they

00:18:55.643 --> 00:19:01.289
do expect it and it's a challenge for our
special effects guys and our technical guys

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:02.409
to live up to.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:07.470
We have a very sizable budget for a television
show, but it's still a television budget and

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:13.751
it's not a feature film budget. So, we're
always having to wrestle with that. Least

00:19:13.751 --> 00:19:21.480
favorite scene. You know, I don't know that
I really have one.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.989
I suppose my least favorite scene that actually
appeared on camera would be the hunting scene

00:19:28.989 --> 00:19:36.840
where Robert is boar hunting 'cause there
was like a Robert and Renly and Barristan

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.299
were tromping through the woods alone and
I talked to Dan and David and said, "You know?

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:46.760
There should be like, a hundred other guys
and horses and tents."

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.760
[laughter]

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.889
And when the king goes hunting it's not like,
"OK, I walking through the woods with a spear

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:51.889
here."

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:56.520
[laughter]

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.909
And they don't disagree with that. I mean,
they said, "Yeah, we would've liked all that

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:08.220
stuff too, but once again, it's budget. We
had an hour to shoot that scene and our horse

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.190
budget was exhausted for the season."

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.960
[laughter]

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:19.020
So, there you are. So, the reality is--. I
mean, the great thing about writing books,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:26.830
as I do now, is that my budget is unlimited.
I can write anything that I can think of and

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.609
I'm limited only by the size of my imagination,
and by the size of the imagination of my readers.

00:20:31.609 --> 00:20:35.640
[clears throat]
But when you translate it to television and

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.509
film, you have the realities, not only of
the budget, which I had mentioned, but also

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:45.289
the shooting schedule. You have to keep on
schedule and if have a lot of trouble getting

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.659
a scene you were supposed to shoot in the
morning, they give you less time to shoot

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:48.940
the scene in the afternoon.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:54.299
But you can't slop over to the next day or
you start getting a rolling effect and you

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:59.080
fall further and further behind your shooting
schedule. And then, you're more and more over-budget

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:06.940
and it becomes a mess. So, all of that impacts,
too. And this is all the kind of "behind the

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.419
scenes" technical stuff that really the viewers
should not have to worry about.

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:17.019
It's the viewers should really just have to
view the final product. But, nonetheless,

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:21.909
for those of us concerned with behind the
scenes stuff, it's a reality of life. The

00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:26.509
actual thing--. I mean, for the most part
I loved all the scenes that were in the books

00:21:26.509 --> 00:21:28.239
that they translated to the TV show.

00:21:28.239 --> 00:21:32.840
I think they did all of those great. I also
loved the vast majority of the new scenes

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:39.460
that they did. If I have any quibbles with
the show, and they are quibbles, a very minor

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.960
thing, it was the missing scenes, the scenes
that weren't there at all.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.039
As I watched the show, frequently I would
find myself thinking, "Oh, OK. Now they're

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:53.710
getting up to this scene that's really good.
I can't--. Oh. They didn't have that scene."

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.710
[laughter]

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:59.259
They skipped over that scene. And some of
them were scenes that I had seen the actors

00:21:59.259 --> 00:22:03.159
do in auditions. They had been scenes that
had actually helped the actors get their roles.

00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:07.799
So I really expected them, 'cause I already
knew, "Oh, the actor will do this great. I

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:11.559
already saw him do it in audition, sitting
in a room in front of a curtain and now I'm

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:17.190
gonna get to see him do it in costume on the
set." And then, oh. It's not there.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.190
[laughter]

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.830
So, I would've loved to have two more hours
to have a 12 episode season instead of ten.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:27.259
And of course to have an extra 50 million
dollars.

00:22:27.259 --> 00:22:28.259
[laughter]

00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:31.440
But who of us wouldn't want an extra 50 million
dollars?

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.049
&gt;&gt;Dan: They did do a great job. As a fan,
when you're only complaint is that Syrio has

00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:38.120
hair and one guy looks like Orlando Bloom,
you're doing really good.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.120
[laughter]

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.090
&gt;&gt;George Martin: We get a fair amount of people
who are upset about no purple eyes, too. I

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.299
get "Why aren't their eyes purple?" Well,
try wearing purple contacts and see how you'd

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:50.299
like it.

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:52.269
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So Dan, we have some Googler
questions that were collected through Google

00:22:52.269 --> 00:23:00.269
Moderator and we'll kick off with one of these
right now. This one's from Peter in San Francisco.

00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:06.149
He writes, "The sex, nudity, violence, and
gore in the HBO series--so, continuing with

00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:09.400
our previous question--has been very much
like the books.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.330
It preserved a similar feel. Could you please
discuss the creative process around the inclusion

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.179
of this mature content? Was there any pressure
to tone it up or down?"

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:24.299
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well Chris, there was no
pressure on me 'cause I'm hardly involved.

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:32.910
I mean, I am basically a consultant who writes
one episode per season. And so, whether there

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:40.090
was pressure on Dan and Dave to go one way
or another, I really don't know. If so, they

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.369
didn't share it with me.

00:23:42.369 --> 00:23:50.490
We did make some decisions early on that we
wanted to include that material and the biggest

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:56.850
one is where we took the show. When Dan and
Dave and I decided that we would do this project

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.920
together and I attached them, we discussed
this at some length and said, "We have to

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920
go."

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.600
HBO was our first choice and pretty much our
only choice. If HBO had said no, or they weren't

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.309
interested, yeah, we could've gone to another
couple other cable outlets, but I think we

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:16.470
were all agreed right from the beginning that
we weren't gonna go to traditional networks,

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:23.999
ABC or CBS or NBC, or any of those, simply
because they would've made us remove all of

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:24.999
that material.

00:24:24.999 --> 00:24:30.919
Everything would have been gone and much toned
down violence, no sex whatsoever, just sort

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:35.210
of a few hints of sex, and certainly no inappropriate
sex.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.210
[laughter]

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:43.039
And a fantasy series, they would have slotted
us as an 8 o'clock show. I mean, I've been

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:50.779
through this in my Hollywood years. I worked
ten years in Hollywood from the mid-'80s to

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:56.350
the mid-'90s and I worked on a couple shows,
Twilight Zone, the Twilight Zone revival and

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.739
Beauty and the Beast.

00:24:57.739 --> 00:25:03.220
Both of which were 8 o'clock shows, despite
the fact, on both shows, we kept saying, "We

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.419
don't wanna be an 8 o'clock show. We wanna
be like a 9 o'clock or a 10 o'clock show because

00:25:08.419 --> 00:25:12.340
the standards and practices--the censorship
things--are a little looser there. And you

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.600
could do a little more material."

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.789
And you know the network guys would promise
us, "Well, we know that. We really think of

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:23.429
you as an adult show, not a kiddie show, but
we have no room on the schedule, so we'll

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:26.989
put you as an 8 o'clock show, but we'll treat
you as a 9 o'clock show."

00:25:26.989 --> 00:25:32.659
And then we would be put as an 8 o'clock show
and those guys, who were the programming guys,

00:25:32.659 --> 00:25:36.980
would suddenly no longer be around and instead,
we'd be dealing with standards and practices

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.840
guys, who were censors who would say, "I don't
care what programming told you. You're an

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.399
8 o'clock show. And these are our 8 o'clock
standards."

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:49.789
So, we made a decision right away, we're gonna
go with HBO. HBO has that kind of stuff whether

00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:54.499
it's a 7 o'clock show, an 8 o'clock show,
5:30 show, they don't care.

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:55.499
[laughter]

00:25:55.499 --> 00:25:58.590
You're signing up for HBO. You're paying a
subscription. You know what you're getting

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:04.169
and what you're getting is something you can't
get on the over-the-air networks. So that's

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:05.369
part of it.

00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:12.679
And then the other big decision we have to
make to keep all that material was the ages

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:23.550
of the characters. In the books, Dany is 13
years old when all this begins. And I was

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:30.720
drawing, although my books have fantasy, they're
not historical fiction in a strict sense.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.009
They occur in an imaginary world and in imaginary
kingdoms. They're very heavily based on real

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:40.309
medieval history. And of course, I've done
a ton of research on real medieval history.

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:47.289
And basically in the Middle Ages, they did
not have our concept of adolescence, of this

00:26:47.289 --> 00:26:53.159
teenage year, in-between, where they're adults
but they're not adults and we have different

00:26:53.159 --> 00:26:59.289
ages where we're allowed to vote at this age
and we're allowed to go war and die at a different

00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:03.359
age and we're allowed to drink at another
age and have sex at a different age, depending

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.359
on which state we're in.

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:05.979
[laughter]

00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:12.950
All of that stuff. They had child and adult.
And the difference between them was the onset

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:19.929
of sexual maturity. And we still have, in
our cultures, remnants of this older structure

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:24.759
in our ceremonies, the Jewish bar mitzvah,
the Catholic confirmation ceremony, which

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:33.840
I went through it at 13, reaffirming as an
adult the vows made for me , made by my God

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.460
parents at baptism.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:42.640
The Catholics once considered 13 adulthood.
And I promise you that even when I went through

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.529
my confirmation ceremony, my parents no longer
did not consider me an adult even after I

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:53.330
went through the rite of passage. So, these
things are just remnants now, but they weren't

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.170
remnants in the Middle Ages and they're not
in the books.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:02.710
We have a very different way of looking at
things. So, I was using that based on historical

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:08.609
precedent. But there was no way that was gonna
fly in our present environment. We couldn't

00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:14.739
do that. If we had cast a 13-year old Dany
, there could have been no sexual stuff whatsoever

00:28:14.739 --> 00:28:15.979
with her.

00:28:15.979 --> 00:28:27.139
And even if we had cast like a 17-year old
actress playing a 13-year old, there are some

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:32.460
very stringent laws in like, the United Kingdom.
You can't do that even if you have an actress

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.210
whose past the age of consent playing someone
who is under the age of consent.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:42.549
You cannot have a sexual situation. It goes
against the whole child pornography thing

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:48.440
and stuff like that. So, we have a 22-year
old actress playing a 17-year old Dany, instead

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:55.389
of a 17-year old actress playing a 13-year
old Dany. And we did that deliberately so

00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:56.700
we could include this material.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.490
So, I think that speaks to the fact that we
did think it was necessary to the story we

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.330
wanted to tell and all that. Of course, once
you make that change, you have to make all

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:09.989
of the other changes and you have to age up
the other characters because Dany's birth

00:29:09.989 --> 00:29:10.989
ties to the--.

00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:16.509
You know she was born posthumously, nine months
after the Battle of the Triton and the fall

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:21.539
of King's Landing and so the ages of the other
characters has to be adjusted accordingly

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:26.570
and it becomes a whole, once again, the butterfly
effect. And so, the whole thing is a tapestry

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.190
and you can't just change one string without
the whole thing unraveling.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:37.679
So, Dan and David made this whole series of
changes. But a long answer to a short question,

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.599
I guess.
[audience chuckles]

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:46.029
&gt;&gt;Dan: Good answer, there. So, I know you've
got the prequel novellas out there, but DNJ

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:51.179
Sid and Lisa in San Diego asks, "Would you
ever consider writing a prequel to the Song

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:56.649
of Ice and Fire series once it's finally done,
such as the back story of Lyanna and Rhaegar

00:29:56.649 --> 00:30:00.249
, or Ned and Robert? I'd love to see how it
all started."

00:30:00.249 --> 00:30:03.549
And by the way, when you're answering the
questions, feel free to correct the pronunciation.

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:06.440
It's happened a few times.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:13.700
&gt;&gt;George Martin: OK. I don't have any plans
to do any of those stories, but I never rule

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.179
anything out. If I get an inspiration or one
of those stories suddenly takes hold in my

00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:21.259
imagination and won't let go, sure.

00:30:21.259 --> 00:30:27.039
Maybe I'll do something like that. One of
the things I've been trying to do with the

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:33.099
series is to tell these stories. Tell the
stories of Robert's rebellion and some of

00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:38.720
the stories of the history of Westeros in
successive revelations and flashbacks and

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.869
people remembering things.

00:30:39.869 --> 00:30:46.409
So, at the same time the story is moving forward,
it's also moving backward and gaps are being

00:30:46.409 --> 00:30:51.399
filled in and you're learning. You hear about
this event in the first book and hear a little

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:55.220
more about it in the second book. And then
the third book, you heard about it from a

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.340
different person who has a very different
version of what happened from the previous

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.909
versions you've heard.

00:30:59.909 --> 00:31:04.840
And there's this hole in it which gets filled
in the fourth book. So, I hope by the time

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.739
it's all finished, I will have expanded backwards
as well as going on forwards. And many of

00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:16.529
the gaps will have been filled in and you'll
know more about the whole Robert and Rhaegar

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:18.389
and everything like that.

00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:24.840
But it's not quite the same as telling the
story about them, I realize. I still have

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.519
two more gigantic books to write, though.
So,--

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:27.519
[laughter]

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.749
&gt;&gt;Dan: And six years to finish them.

00:31:28.749 --> 00:31:30.809
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Right. Yes. I'm very fast,
so--

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:34.789
[laughter]

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:40.999
I don't know what I'm gonna write after that.
Whatever seizes me. I mean, I like to do different

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:47.769
things as a writer. This has been a huge project.
Certainly the biggest thing I've ever done

00:31:47.769 --> 00:31:53.630
in my life or career, but I've done other
things and hope to continue to do other things.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:59.299
As much as I love Ice and Fire and fantasy,
I also love science fiction. I wanna do more

00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:04.409
science fiction work. I wanna do more short
stories. I love doing those. Wild Cards, which

00:32:04.409 --> 00:32:09.770
is a series I've been working on even longer
than Ice and Fire. I've been, in the beginning

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:12.149
of Wild Cards, I wrote a lot for it as well
as editing it.

00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:16.969
Now the series is still ongoing. Mostly I
edit these days 'cause I don't have time to

00:32:16.969 --> 00:32:21.249
write for it. But I'd love to go back and
write some more Wild Card material, about

00:32:21.249 --> 00:32:25.989
some of the characters for that. So, what
will I feel like writing after those six years

00:32:25.989 --> 00:32:28.820
are done? Who knows?

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.990
Whatever I feel like writing on that particular
day. There was someone at the podium I think

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.519
who had another--.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:41.979
&gt;&gt;Female Shirt Designer: Hi. So, we have another
question. It is, "Given HBO's history of completely

00:32:41.979 --> 00:32:47.219
changing story lines--I'm looking at you,
True Blood--how did you get them to stay so

00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:49.519
true to your complex-as-all-hell novels?"

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:51.919
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Candy and chocolates.

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:56.239
[laughter]

00:32:56.239 --> 00:33:07.409
You know, it's David and Dan really. David
Benioff and Dan Weiss are the show runners.

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:15.639
I don't have any veto power. I signed a pretty
standard contract where I gave them rights

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:22.509
to adapt this into a television series and
I got certain titles and agreed I'd write

00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:25.520
one script a year and a large dump truck full
of money.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.309
[laughter]

00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:34.789
And they can have the aliens come down next
season. [ audience chuckles] They can turn

00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:36.999
the whole cast into vampires.

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:38.489
[laughter]

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:46.239
And I'm powerless to stop them, but I don't
think they will do that. They love the books

00:33:46.239 --> 00:33:52.580
and they seem committed to telling my story
in a different medium. And I knew all that

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.529
before I signed any of the contracts.

00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:59.539
I mean, when these books started hitting the
New York Times Bestseller List, which was

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:05.169
as early as "A Clash of Kings" I was approached
by other people who wanted to adapt them,

00:34:05.169 --> 00:34:11.690
many for feature films. And I had meetings
with those people and heard their plans.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.760
How were they gonna fit this giant thing into
feature film? "Well, we're gonna make it all

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.389
about John Snow and drop all these other characters."
Or, "We'll make it all about Dany and we'll

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:26.039
drop all these other characters." They had
various schemes of how they would do it.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:33.119
Or, "Well, we'll just make the first book
up to this point and then we hope that the

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:37.829
movie will do well enough to order a second
movie." And none of these really appealed

00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:46.099
to me. So, I said no, which is--. It's always
said that no is the sexiest word you can say

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:51.929
in Hollywood. The more you say no, the more
they want you and--

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:52.929
[laughter]

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:58.080
I guess it was true 'cause they kept coming.
And eventually, David and Dan came and we

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.790
had a wonderful meeting that lasted like most
of a day. We met for lunch and we were talking

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.580
and getting all animated about how we were
gonna do the series over lunch in a crowded

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.840
restaurant in Los Angeles.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.289
And little by little, it emptied out and pretty
soon we were the only people there drinking

00:35:14.289 --> 00:35:19.540
our seventh cup of coffee and iced tea and
still talking about it. And then, more hours

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.810
passed and we're still talking and the restaurant
dinner crowd is coming in and then they're

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:25.810
setting up for dinner.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.299
I think we closed out the restaurant that
night. So, it was one of those classic meetings

00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:36.089
that you only get once in a while. But I had
a great feeling about them. I mean, if you're

00:35:36.089 --> 00:35:40.021
J. K. Rowling, you can go into a situation
where every studio in Hollywood wants you

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:44.470
and you can set very stringent terms where
you get to approve everything.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:51.839
But if you're not J. K. Rowling, and virtually
nobody is J. K. Rowling, except for J. K.

00:35:51.839 --> 00:35:57.280
Rowling, then you can't do that. And you have
to find people that you trust and put your

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:06.500
faith in them and in the understanding of
the story. Which is something that I think

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.580
I also understood a fair amount of that because
of my ten years working in Hollywood in the

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:14.039
effect that I had seen the other side of the
process.

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:19.010
Sometimes, I think some of my fellow novelists
who have not worked in television and film

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.760
are very naive about this process. They get
an offer and there's the dump truck full of

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:33.401
money and they sign it, they cash the check
and then they’re not involved in the series.

00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:38.720
They may get invited to premiere and they
come out of the premiere looking like all

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.940
of their children have just been gassed [audience
chuckles] and with a stunned look on their

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:51.049
face 'cause everything has been changed. And
it's, some of them get very upset and start

00:36:51.049 --> 00:36:53.839
writing angry editorials and things like that.

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:58.690
I haven't heard of anyone except Alan Moore
actually returning the check however. So,

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:06.960
I think there's a certain, I don't know, hypocrisy
there. It's not a secret that Hollywood does

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.380
change things and maybe they change too many
things.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:16.779
When I had my writer hat off and I put on
my reader and my fan boy hat, I get upset

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:24.170
as anyone and I can go on for a long time
about how they change things in Spiderman

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:29.609
and the Fantastic Four in ways that I don't
approve of.

00:37:29.609 --> 00:37:30.609
[laughter]

00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:34.869
But nonetheless, you gotta know the job is
dangerous when you take it, you know?

00:37:34.869 --> 00:37:41.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: Good. This one's for the nerds. So,
DanFoley182 in the UK asks, "Is it possible

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.910
to warg into a dragon?"

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.960
[George Martin laughs]

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.961
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, we'll have to see about
that, won't we?

00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:49.220
[laughter]

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:56.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Fusion, also from England, asks, "How
do you decide the characters that get to be

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.160
a POV character? I read somewhere you resisted
adding a character as a POV for a while until

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.180
finally giving in. And so, I wondered the
kind of decisions you have to make in that

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:12.280
regard. Are there certain traits that a POV
character needs, or do they just need to be

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280
surviving?"

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.280
[laughter]

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:21.280
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, I try to give each
of my POV characters a story. And I had an

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.700
occasional POV character who only lasted a
chapter and then dies. So, in that case, it's

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.099
a very short story.

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:28.099
[laughter]

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:33.839
But it's nonetheless a story. It should have
the semblance of a beginning, a middle, and

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:38.990
an end. Even if it's not connected to the
main story of the books, it should have a

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.410
certain "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead" sort of thing. I mean, that was their

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:50.599
story, which was off to the side of Hamlet's
story, but both part of the larger story.

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:58.170
I try to resist having POV characters who
are just there to be a pair of eyes. If a

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:03.400
battle is taking place, or someone is being
murdered and I don't have a POV character

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:09.940
there to see it, I tend to present that as
a report that someone receives or a rumor,

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.859
rather than just switching into third guardsman
on the left--

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:14.869
[laughter]

00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:19.080
so I can have him see that. 'Cause I don't
like that as a reader and I don't like that

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:29.250
as a writer. But one of the criteria--. So,
I guess one criteria is do they have a story

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:35.000
and what is the story of the POV character?
Another thing though is the thing of a pair

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.920
of eyes. And sometimes you need--.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.819
The question is, is it important to present
this thing on stage to dramatize it and have

00:39:42.819 --> 00:39:45.710
the reader actually go through it, or is it
sufficient that we just hear about it, hear

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:51.579
a summary? Do you need full dramatization,
or is summary narrative sufficient? And if

00:39:51.579 --> 00:39:58.670
we need the scene to be brought out then we
may need a POV character there.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:04.109
And can I get any of my existing POV characters
there? I mean, I've talked--. Those of you

00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:09.700
who read my not-a-blog will know that with
Dance With Dragons, one of the things that

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.740
I've wrestled with for a long time was what
I call the Meereenese Knot, which I can't

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:20.950
go into in any great detail without the spoiling
of tremendous things, but five years from

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:27.940
now, maybe if the next book is out or something
and everybody has read this book, I will talk

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.869
more about that in more detail.

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:37.359
But a lot of it simply had to do with a number
of POV characters being together and some

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:41.711
important events coming on, which some of
them would see from one viewpoint and some

00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:46.680
from another and some wouldn't really know
what was going on. So, how do I get these

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.710
particular sequence of events to cross with
what point of view?

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:55.130
And I would write something from one point
of view and it wouldn't quite work, so I'd

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:59.300
write it from a different point of view and
that wouldn't work either and I'd try splitting

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:06.940
it. I finally solved that problem in part
by introducing a new point of view, who was

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.790
much more centrally located, but he'd been
a character who'd been there all along and

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.650
he was deeply involved in the thing.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:19.779
And it all fell into place once I introduced
that. So, you can have that kind of breakthrough.

00:41:19.779 --> 00:41:23.750
But I do need to kill a lot more of my point
of view characters--

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:24.750
[laughter]

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:28.950
because there have gotten to be an awful lot
of them.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.170
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Who?
[laughter]

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:39.339
&gt;&gt;George Martin: So, which ones will die?
Well, you'll just have to keep reading to

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:40.339
find it out.

00:41:40.339 --> 00:41:47.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I think the character you’re
referring to is the one who was asked about.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.840
&gt;&gt;George Martin: OK. Next.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: Another Googler question.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.049
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: OK, so this question is asking
if you could take back one thing you wrote

00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:56.520
in any of your books, what would it be?

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:05.130
&gt;&gt;George Martin: One thing I wrote in any
of my books? Well, I would take back the little

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:08.441
one-page thing at the end of Feast for Crows
where I say that the next book will be out

00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:09.441
within a year.

00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:16.130
[laughter and clapping]

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:22.690
That one has gotten me into no end of trouble.
All I could say is I meant it at the time.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:28.920
I mean, I was splitting off 500 pages from
a 1500 page manuscript, so I only had to write

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.740
another 500 pages. I can write 500 pages in
a year. I've done it before.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.470
Of course, the book tended, turned out to
need an extra thousand pages, not 500 pages,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:45.570
and I would up rewriting almost all of the
500 pages that I was pulling out. So, I turned

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:52.289
out to be a lot more than 500 pages. And even
that being said, yeah I can write 500 pages

00:42:52.289 --> 00:42:53.289
in a year.

00:42:53.289 --> 00:42:58.140
In a good year. I've had good years in which
I've written entire 500-page novels start

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.940
to finish. But that's not to say I could do
it every year, regular as clockwork. I am,

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:09.289
unfortunately, a slow writer and have always
been a slow writer.

00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:16.260
But I'm a slow writer given to delusions of
optimism that I can be a faster writer [chuckles]

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:24.230
under certain circumstances. Sometimes I am,
but more often I'm not.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:30.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great. So, we had a whole bunch of
questions around this, so we had to pick one

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:36.170
of the most popular ones and go with it. BTFabian1
asks, "I'm just curious. Several authors I

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.430
read have discussed how hard it is to sometimes
kill off certain characters."

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:44.200
Which clearly is not an issue here. "You've
certainly killed plenty off in your career,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.589
both in and out of A Song of Ice and Fire.
Which character was the toughest to kill off?"

00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:54.730
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, I won't mention any
character names, but the Red Wedding was the

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.880
hardest thing I ever wrote. And those who
read the books know what I'm referring to.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.769
That chapter occurs about two-thirds of the
way through Storm of Swords, but it was actually

00:44:01.769 --> 00:44:03.400
the last thing I wrote for that book.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.970
When I reached that chapter, I couldn’t
write it. I skipped over it. I wrote all the

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:13.700
aftermath and the other things. I wrote the
other wedding. There was someone else that

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.220
dies. That one was easy and fun to write.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:21.010
[laughter and clapping]

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:30.589
'Cause everybody wanted to see that little
shit die.

00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:32.569
[laughter]

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:39.589
Actually, I'm being glib. I should say, yeah,
that was an easier chapter to write. But even

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:44.339
at the moment that that particular little
shit does die, I tried to write it so that

00:44:44.339 --> 00:44:52.900
you would feel a moment of empathy for him
in his dying and bring home the point that

00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:02.890
this, too, was a human being who was scared
and terrified and then dead.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.720
[laughter]

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.710
But only after everything else was finished,
did I go back and force myself to write the

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:15.760
actual Red Wedding chapter, simply because
it was so painful to write. I invest a lot

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.390
in these characters and particularly viewpoint
characters. I live inside their skin, so it's

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.579
a little like killing a part of yourself or
smothering one of your children.

00:45:22.579 --> 00:45:31.391
But sometimes it has to be done for the service
of the almighty god of the story.

00:45:31.391 --> 00:45:32.391
[laughter]

00:45:32.391 --> 00:45:33.910
And the story always comes first.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:39.670
&gt;&gt;Dan: And related to that, do you ever find
that it would've been more expedient had you

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.420
not killed a character off later on?

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:58.089
&gt;&gt;George Martin: No. Not really. Not really.
Sometimes my readers write me and they wish

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:04.630
I hadn't killed off a particular character,
but there was a reason for all of the major

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.850
character deaths.

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:11.599
I mean, a lot of minor characters die, too.
And sometimes, I don't even remember they're

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:12.599
dead, you know?

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:13.599
[laughter]

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:17.569
I'm saying some Night's Watch expedition leaves
out and it has Fred, Bill, and Sam on it.

00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:24.539
And Elio of Westeros points out "you actually
killed Bill two books ago." Oh, damn. I forgot

00:46:24.539 --> 00:46:26.190
about that.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.190
[laughter]

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.119
He died in a fenz attack, but fortunately
I have fans who have sharper eyes than I who

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:35.329
will point out this stuff. But the major character
deaths have all been planned or all a part

00:46:35.329 --> 00:46:39.779
of the story and I don't regret them.

00:46:39.779 --> 00:46:44.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hopefully this means Syrio will pop
back up again. Can we have another Googler

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:45.730
question?

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:52.599
&gt;&gt;Female Shirt Designer: OK, so this next
question is, "In your books, there are several

00:46:52.599 --> 00:46:57.040
religious systems, such as The Seven, The
Drowned God, The Faceless Man, The Old Gods,

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.510
etc. How do you come up with such a detailed,
yet entirely distinct, doctrines? Are there

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.569
any that aren't detailed in the books?

00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:09.920
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, yes. To start with
the last part first, yes, there are many religions

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:16.069
that are not detailed. You can see some of
them in Arya's Brava’s chapters, where she

00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:23.400
visits--, passes through the Islands of Gods
and I throw in references to 17 different

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:29.859
obscure religions that I'm probably never
gonna reveal in much detail.

00:47:29.859 --> 00:47:39.549
But some of them are, of course, little tips
of the hats to other fantasy authors and mythos'

00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:49.839
that I admire. I mean, there is both a Roger
Zelazny homage and a H. P. Lovecraft homage

00:47:49.839 --> 00:47:55.410
on that Isle of the Gods for those who are
sharp enough to see them. I do that kind of

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.730
shit all the time.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.730
[laughter]

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:03.660
The Three Stooges are in Book One if you're
sharp enough to find them. [chuckles] The

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:13.180
major religions that actually play a significant
role in the story are somewhat based on real

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.970
religions, or real religious systems.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:21.109
Although, I don't believe in just doing a
one to one transformation where I'm gonna

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:25.780
take like, Islam and file off the serial numbers
and call it Mislam or something.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.780
[laughter]

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:32.619
And pretend it's the same. I take certain
tenants of the religions, but I maybe take

00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:37.289
part of this and part of that and I meld them
together and I think about it and I add a

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:38.680
few imaginative elements.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.380
But certainly, the Old Guards of the North
with the trees worship, I mean, that's based

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:52.579
on animism and traditional Pagan beliefs of
Wicca and various other Celtic systems and

00:48:52.579 --> 00:49:00.430
Norse systems. I meld it into a construct
of my own. And with the fantasy element of

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:08.710
the Weirwood trees added as a central element
there, the faith of The Seven is very loosely

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.829
modeled on the medieval Catholic Church.

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:16.150
But again, with different elements. I mean,
of course the Catholic Church, which I was--.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.450
I'm no longer a practicing Catholic, but that
was how I was born and raised, has the whole

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:27.059
concept. The heart of the Trinity, which was
explained to me as it's three but it's also

00:49:27.059 --> 00:49:29.150
one, which kids can never get.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:32.780
It's like, "OK, we have three gods." "No,
no. You don't have three gods. You have one

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:39.759
God. He has three parts." "OK." So, we don't
have three. We just have one. It's like the

00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:47.099
shamrock that was held. The three-leaf clover.
So, I did that except I made it seven instead

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:48.099
of three.

00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:52.559
I have the whole where we have the seven gods,
we have seven personas, instead of Father,

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:56.390
Son, and Holy Ghost. We have Maiden, Mother,
and Crone, which of course I took from Paganism

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:01.680
as the traditional female thing. I hobbled
the male side together and then I added The

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:09.839
Stranger as the God of Death, who's also the
center of the Cult of The Faceless Men.

00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:16.890
I mean, I think worship of death is an interesting
basis for religion because after all, death

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:24.180
is the one universal. It doesn't seem to matter
what gods you pray to. We all die in the real

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:28.759
world and in fantasy worlds. So, if there
was one culture where you did not die, I suspect

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.161
that would be, that God would become very
popular.

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:32.161
[laughter]

00:50:32.161 --> 00:50:38.710
They will promise us eternal life, but whatever.
[audience chuckles] So my faith with its hierarchies,

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:48.109
its High Septon, and its Septs and its orders
of essentially monks and priests and so forth

00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:54.130
is loosely based on Catholicism. And then
you have the Red God, the Lord of Light from

00:50:54.130 --> 00:51:02.660
across the sea, which has a certain Zoroastrianism
elements to it with the fire worship and so

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.460
forth and the duality .

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:10.250
The Albigensian Crusade, -the Cathars, who
are exterminated by the Catholics and the

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.310
Great Albigensian Crusade. But they had the
fundamental belief, a dualist religion, that

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:19.970
there were two gods, a good god and an evil
god. And the world we live in was created

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:26.670
by the evil god, which when you look at the
world, particularly the Medieval world, it's

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:27.670
kinda persuasive.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:33.819
If, you know, what kind of good god would
create that kind of crap, you know? What kind

00:51:33.819 --> 00:51:36.769
of good god sits around saying, "Hmm, leprosy.
Good idea."

00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:37.769
[laughter]

00:51:37.769 --> 00:51:47.910
"Let's give them leprosy. Hmmm." So, the Lord
of Light. So, all the religions are based--.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:55.099
This is my general philosophy, I think, for
fantasy is base it in reality, but then get

00:51:55.099 --> 00:52:00.099
a little imaginative to it and rework the
elements and put this with that and add your

00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:01.829
own touch to it.

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:07.789
And, but the grounding it in reality, I think,
give it a certain verisimilitude, plausibility

00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:14.049
where just entirely made-up religions that
are unconnected to anything, it's much more

00:52:14.049 --> 00:52:16.609
difficult to make them plausible.

00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:27.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK. Amon Shin in Maine asks, "If you
lived in Westeros, which house would you like

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.279
to be part of, or in which area would you
like to live?"

00:52:30.279 --> 00:52:38.079
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Well, you know, there's something
to be said for being an honorable Stark, but

00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:43.089
you're kinda cold all the time and--

00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:44.089
[laughter]

00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:47.299
poor and so forth. And you have a lot of land,
but there's not a lot of stuff on it, you

00:52:47.299 --> 00:52:52.089
know? On the other hand, if you're in Lannister,
you have a nice house and all the gold you

00:52:52.089 --> 00:52:54.290
want and all of that stuff.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:53:00.910
So, there's a lot to be said for being a Lannister.
I don't know. Maybe I could probably see me

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.109
being a Lannister.

00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:04.109
[laughter]

00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:05.119
And I would always pay my debts.

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:06.119
[laughter]

00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:10.829
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great. Let's take another Googler question.

00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:17.130
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: OK, so this question asks, "How
do you keep all the secrets of the book-to-come

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:21.029
to yourself? Are you dying to tell people
what you know, or do a few people already

00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:22.029
know everything?"

00:53:22.029 --> 00:53:24.670
[laughter]

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:35.180
&gt;&gt;George Martin: I'm not dying to tell everyone
what I know. Eventually, I will have to yield

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:41.160
up on my secrets. But actually, if anything,
maybe I hold on to some of these things too

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.369
long. I don't know. There's always the question,
"When do you reveal something? How long do

00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:46.339
you draw it out?"

00:53:46.339 --> 00:53:53.630
And the books are full of little puzzles and
enigmas and reversals and how do you place

00:53:53.630 --> 00:54:00.420
those? You don't want to give it away too
soon, but if you stretch it out too long,

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:07.069
everybody's gonna guess it anyway. So, at
what point is that? But, I kind of like having

00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:10.170
the puzzles and you need to keep at least
some of the puzzles till the end.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:17.359
So, but then again, you can't keep them all
to the end, otherwise you end with a final

00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:22.030
chapter that's just one guy endlessly talking
about "well there's this, and then there's

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.029
this and the explanation to this is this."

00:54:24.029 --> 00:54:25.029
[laughter]

00:54:25.029 --> 00:54:32.990
It's a very boring and not very good chapter.
So, David and Dan know a few things, a few

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:39.950
important revelations. So, eventually if I
am hit by a truck or something like that,

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:44.089
they would know a few things, but they don't
know all by any means. And my editors know

00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:47.529
a few things and have guessed a few things.

00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:52.060
I suspect that some of the fans probably know
more than anything else. I mean, I'm gonna

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.320
be doing the concordance. The Ice and Fire
concordance is the next project in the World

00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:00.520
of Ice and Fire, which is under contract at
Bantam and Random House.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.839
And I'm doing that with Elio Garcia and Linda
Antonsson of the Westeros site. And I swear

00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:12.900
they know Westeros better than I do. I mean,
the Elio's knowledge of it is just absolutely

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.529
amazing.

00:55:14.529 --> 00:55:19.220
When I'm writing the books, I sometimes call
him up and say, "I'm about to introduce this

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:23.630
character. I think I mentioned him in Book
Three. Did I ever say what color his eyes

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:27.849
are?" And within a half hour, I get "blue-grey,
page 314, second book."

00:55:27.849 --> 00:55:28.849
[laughter]

00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:30.230
Oh, Very good. [chuckles]

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:31.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:37.579
&gt;&gt;George Martin: I hate eye colors. Everybody
should have the same color eyes. I'm constantly

00:55:37.579 --> 00:55:39.140
getting screwed up on eye colors.

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.140
[laughter]

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: Just make them all purple.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.279
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Yeah. [chuckles]

00:55:43.279 --> 00:55:47.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, we probably have time for one more
question. And I think the next one's such

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:58.150
a good one we should probably use a Googler
one.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:02.300
&gt;&gt;Female Shirt Designer: The question is,
"The women in leadership roles seem particularly

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.550
challenged. Can you share your insights about
women in positions of power?"

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:10.720
&gt;&gt;George Martin: I don't know if I have any
particular views about women in positions

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.999
of power. Although, I think it's more difficult
for women, particularly in a medieval setting,

00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:21.369
than for men because in addition to all the
usual problems of having power, they have

00:56:21.369 --> 00:56:26.049
the additional problem of that they're a woman
and a lot of people don't want them in a position

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:32.690
of power in what is basically a patriarchal
society.

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:39.170
So, that is a challenge to all of my queens
or would-be queens. And once again, I'm drawing

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:47.789
from medieval history on that. You can repeatedly
see some of the women who assume positions

00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:55.680
of power, be it Cleopatra in Ancient Egypt,
or the Empress Maude during the great English

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:00.680
Civil War, the war between Steven and Maude,
who was essentially rejected simply because

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.760
she was a woman.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.910
And even though her claim to the throne was
very clear cut and was endorsed by her father,

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:12.349
the King, and yet they turned to a cousin
instead simply because he had a dick.

00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:13.349
[laughter]

00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:20.319
Well, to be fair he was also charming and
she was sort of difficult. But nonetheless,

00:57:20.319 --> 00:57:25.549
there is that additional challenge. But one
thing that I'm trying to get at in the books--a

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:34.029
political aspect if you would--is to show
that this stuff is hard. I mean, I think an

00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:40.670
awful lot of fantasy and even some great fantasy
falls into the mistake of assuming that the

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:43.250
good man will be a good king.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:48.680
That is, all that is necessary is to be like
a decent human being and then when you're

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:56.349
king, of course, everything will go swimmingly.
And even Tolkien, who is the, I think, my

00:57:56.349 --> 00:58:01.079
respect for Tolkien is second to none and
all modern fantasy flows from Tolkien, but

00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:05.730
there's an unspoken assumption in his books
there that Return of the King.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:12.789
Aragorn is the king now. Everything will be
hunky dory. The land will prosper and it'll

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:16.290
be wonderful and the crops will be good and
there will be justice for all and the enemies

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:25.339
will be defeated. And you never actually get
into the nitty gritty of Aragorn ruling. And

00:58:25.339 --> 00:58:27.640
what is his tax policy?

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.640
[laughter]

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:31.190
And how does he feel about crop rotation?

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.190
[laughter]

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:38.329
How does he handle land disputes between two
nobles, both of whom think that they should

00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:43.039
have this particular village? So, they take
turns burning it down in order to establish

00:58:43.039 --> 00:58:44.141
this claim that--.

00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:51.029
These are the hard parts of ruling and be
it in the Middle Ages or now, and of course,

00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:56.960
it's not enough to be a good man to be an
effective ruler. And it never has been. If

00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:02.500
it has been, Jimmy Carter would be the greatest
President of the 20th Century. I mean, he's

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.119
clearly, I think, the best human being to
be President in my lifetime.

00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:13.069
But he not a particularly effective president.
For all his decency and his humanity and his

00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:16.999
compassion and his undoubted intelligence.
I mean, the man was a nuclear engineer in

00:59:16.999 --> 00:59:25.019
the Navy. But nonetheless, he failed at it.
And there are some examples of medieval kings

00:59:25.019 --> 00:59:29.569
in history who were terrible human beings,
but they were nonetheless very good kings

00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:30.920
for their country.

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:36.759
So, it's complicated and it's hard. And I
want to show not just with the women, but

00:59:36.759 --> 00:59:45.079
you see in my books repeated examples of both
kings and the hand of the king, the Prime

00:59:45.079 --> 00:59:50.890
Minister if you would, trying to rule. And
whether it be Ned Stark or Tyrion Lannister

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:58.560
or Tywin Lannister or Daenerys Targaryen,
in the latest book, Cersei Lannister in the

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.230
book before that.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:05.279
And trying to deal with some of the real challenges
that affect anyone trying to rule the Seven

01:00:05.279 --> 01:00:12.809
Kingdoms or even the city like Meereen. And
it's hard. We can all read these books or

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:16.780
look at history as, "Oh, so and so was stupid.
They made a lot of mistakes. Look at all these

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.500
stupid mistakes they make."

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.329
But these kinds of mistakes are always much
more apparent in hindsight than when you're

01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:28.930
actually faced with the decision of "My God,
what would I do in this situation? How do

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:33.329
I resolve the thing? Do I do the moral thing?
But what about the political consequences

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:39.750
of the moral thing? Do I do the pragmatic,
cynical thing and just screw the people who

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:40.750
are screwed by it?"

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:49.589
I mean, it's hard. And I wanna get to all
of that and be it a male ruler or a woman’s

01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:50.599
ruler.

01:00:50.599 --> 01:00:57.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: So everyone. That brings us to about
time. Thanks everyone in the room for coming

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:01.999
along. Thanks for submitting your great questions.
Thanks everyone on the stream for tuning in.

01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:05.730
And George, thank you so much for taking the
time out to come in, answer the questions

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.730
and--.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:14.450
&gt;&gt;George Martin: It's my pleasure. It's been
a thrill to be here and to take place in this

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:20.309
high-tech computer things. I think you should
bring some of these strange machines of yours

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:25.079
to Westeros so they could probably entirely
replace the whole thing of tying messages

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:26.079
to the legs of ravens.

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:27.859
[laughter]

01:01:27.859 --> 01:01:35.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: Great. Thanks, George.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.359
&gt;&gt;George Martin: Thanks.

01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:42.150
[applause]
