00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.771
AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME,
STREET TOUGH.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:10.377
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.546
TODAY IS SESAME STREET DAY, THE
ANNIVERSARY OF THE SHOW THAT

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.382
TEACHES KIDS IMPORTANT STUFF
LIKE "THE ALPHABET" AND "HOW TO

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:19.953
LIVE IN YOUR OWN TRASH."

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.356
"SESAME STREET" CHURNED OUT A
LOT OF CLASSIC KIDS TUNES OVER

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:26.093
THE YEARS, MOST OF THEM STUCK IN
MY HEAD.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.029
MAYBE I STILL WATCH IT EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.365
BUT MAYBE NONE MORE ICONIC
THAN KERMIT THE FROG'S "IT'S NOT

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:35.035
EASY BEING GREEN."

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:40.174
YA, THAT'S HOW YOU [BEEP] ROCK A
KERMIT.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.143
NOWADAYS, THOUGH, IT ACTUALLY
SEEMS REAL EASY BEING GREEN.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.646
I MEAN, KERMIT'S GOT AN ABC
SITCOM AND THINGS ARE GOING

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.614
GREAT WITH MISS PIGGY...AT
LEAST, ACCORDING TO THIS

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:56.523
PAINTING WE FOUND ON ETSY:
LOOK EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:57.591
THAT'LL DO, PIG.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:01:02.329
THAT'LL DO.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.098
COMEDIANS, LET'S REVISE THIS
CLASSIC KIDS SONG AND TELL ME

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:09.603
WHAT ELSE IT'S NOT EASY BEING.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.972
&gt;&gt; NOT EASY BEING NAMED DONKEY
HAMMER.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:12.940
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.107
EUGENE.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.276
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASY BEING AN
ANTHROPOMORPHIZED PIG WITH A

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.312
UNUSUALLY LARGE SEXUAL APPETITE.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:21.381
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:22.349
PHIL.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.750
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASY BEING DYSLEXIC
AND CANADIAN.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:27.221
I'M A DOUBLE THREAT AND
INTIMIDATING.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.522
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: POINTS.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.790
EUGENE.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.758
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASY BEING THE
BRUISED TIP OF JUSTIN BIEBER'S

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.694
PENIS.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:34.461
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: WHY IS IT BRUISED?

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.831
&gt;&gt; ASK THE DETECTIVES FROM THE
70S.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.199
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: EUGENE.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.134
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASY BEING A SUICIDE
BOMBER WHO GOT THE WRONG

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:42.135
ADDRESS.

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.571
&gt;&gt; CHRIS: YES.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:47.274
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASY BEING TOO LEGIT
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO WANT TO

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:47.374
QUIT.
