I think it'll be very challenging if

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
I think it'll be very challenging if
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.049
I think it'll be very challenging if
energy prices stay at a high level they

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059
energy prices stay at a high level they
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.820
energy prices stay at a high level they
will want what you and I would want

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
will want what you and I would want
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.499
will want what you and I would want
which is they will want to control their

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
which is they will want to control their
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.080
which is they will want to control their
own natural resources interestingly most

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
own natural resources interestingly most
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910
own natural resources interestingly most
of the world in fact every country I can

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
of the world in fact every country I can
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.470
of the world in fact every country I can
think about Earth other than America

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
think about Earth other than America
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.109
think about Earth other than America
actually exploits its own resources for

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
actually exploits its own resources for
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.580
actually exploits its own resources for
I do think there's me continued pressure

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
I do think there's me continued pressure
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.580
I do think there's me continued pressure
and as we've just said I think there

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
and as we've just said I think there
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920
and as we've just said I think there
will be a continued move to try to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
will be a continued move to try to
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.360
will be a continued move to try to
control those resources but they're

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
control those resources but they're
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760
control those resources but they're
still going to want to have co-investors

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
still going to want to have co-investors
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.660
still going to want to have co-investors
they're still going to want to have

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
they're still going to want to have
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330
they're still going to want to have
technical expertise shared within the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
technical expertise shared within the
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650
technical expertise shared within the
industry so I don't think it will be

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
industry so I don't think it will be
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.319
industry so I don't think it will be
fully closed off I think that they will

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
fully closed off I think that they will
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.850
fully closed off I think that they will
control the majority interest in many

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
control the majority interest in many
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670
control the majority interest in many
cases and importantly I think all of us

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
cases and importantly I think all of us
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500
cases and importantly I think all of us
are going to be in the world in a world

are going to be in the world in a world
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.819
are going to be in the world in a world
together we're going to try to be

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
together we're going to try to be
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560
together we're going to try to be
focusing on global climate change and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
focusing on global climate change and
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270
focusing on global climate change and
trying to figure out what are the right

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
trying to figure out what are the right
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760
trying to figure out what are the right
energy resources to be using it ought to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
energy resources to be using it ought to
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410
energy resources to be using it ought to
strike all of us is a bit intriguing

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
strike all of us is a bit intriguing
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299

that a number of exporting countries in

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
that a number of exporting countries in
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219
that a number of exporting countries in
the Middle East want to actually build

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
the Middle East want to actually build
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590
the Middle East want to actually build
nuclear facilities that's a bit

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
nuclear facilities that's a bit
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120
nuclear facilities that's a bit
intriguing to me when our own country

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
intriguing to me when our own country
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070

tried to shut it down the only 20th

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
tried to shut it down the only 20th
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.140
tried to shut it down the only 20th
century technology energy was actually

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
century technology energy was actually
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.789
century technology energy was actually
shut down because it worked at Three

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
shut down because it worked at Three
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219

Mile Island now we're hoping that we can

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
Mile Island now we're hoping that we can
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.789
Mile Island now we're hoping that we can
restart it again lb it way way too late

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
restart it again lb it way way too late
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920
restart it again lb it way way too late
in the meantime we burned a lot more

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
in the meantime we burned a lot more
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.770
in the meantime we burned a lot more
hydrocarbon fuels

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.550
there's definitely in the ship that

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
there's definitely in the ship that
 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.080

we're looking at the new reserves

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090
we're looking at the new reserves
 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.899
we're looking at the new reserves
because if you SAT here 30 years ago the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909
because if you SAT here 30 years ago the
 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.459
because if you SAT here 30 years ago the
international l companies would have

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469
international l companies would have
 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.809
international l companies would have
been the primary people you would have

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819
been the primary people you would have
 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.569
been the primary people you would have
looked at for the additional production

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
looked at for the additional production
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.889
looked at for the additional production
because they actually control the number

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899
because they actually control the number
 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.289
because they actually control the number
of the oil reserves even in the ones

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
of the oil reserves even in the ones
 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.669
of the oil reserves even in the ones
that are now controlled by national oil

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679
that are now controlled by national oil
 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.249
that are now controlled by national oil
companies and countries like Russia will

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259
companies and countries like Russia will
 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.889
companies and countries like Russia will
have much more direct say in what is

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899
have much more direct say in what is
 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.359
have much more direct say in what is
actually produced in terms of energy

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369
actually produced in terms of energy
 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.949
actually produced in terms of energy
conventional energy sources now I'm

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959
conventional energy sources now I'm
 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.069
conventional energy sources now I'm
talking about gas natural gas and oil

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
talking about gas natural gas and oil
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.449
talking about gas natural gas and oil
just like the Saudis have for the last

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459
just like the Saudis have for the last
 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.490
just like the Saudis have for the last
20 plus years being able to say more and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500
20 plus years being able to say more and
 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.020
20 plus years being able to say more and
with what happens in their particular

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030
with what happens in their particular
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.209
with what happens in their particular
arena and we're going to deal with that

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219
arena and we're going to deal with that
 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.679
arena and we're going to deal with that
doesn't mean the international oil

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
doesn't mean the international oil
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.029
doesn't mean the international oil
companies are going away it just means

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039
companies are going away it just means
 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.050
companies are going away it just means
that we're going to have much more

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
that we're going to have much more
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.869
that we're going to have much more
diversity I think not necessarily

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879
diversity I think not necessarily
 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.850
diversity I think not necessarily
smaller because if we if we increase

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
smaller because if we if we increase
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979
smaller because if we if we increase
conventional fuel usage by some

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
conventional fuel usage by some
 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.869

twenty-five percent over the next 20
 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.759
twenty-five percent over the next 20
years that doesn't mean we're actually

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769
years that doesn't mean we're actually
 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.500
years that doesn't mean we're actually
going to have smaller producers it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
going to have smaller producers it
 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.030
going to have smaller producers it
actually means we may have more big

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
actually means we may have more big
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.860
actually means we may have more big
producers they just happen to be

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
producers they just happen to be
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.869

national oil companies as you probably

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879
national oil companies as you probably
 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.729
national oil companies as you probably
know Exxon Mobil is not in the top oil

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739
know Exxon Mobil is not in the top oil
 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.849
