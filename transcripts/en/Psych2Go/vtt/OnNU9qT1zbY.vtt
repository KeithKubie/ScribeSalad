00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:01.715
 

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:02.935
 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.340
 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.400
working towards long terms achievements can be mentally

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.700
and physically exhausting

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.120
it can be a let down to work towards a goal

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.600
and not see results as quickly as you were hoping for

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.060
but if you work smart, achieving your goal is possible

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.460
no matter your goals

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.800
here at phych2go we have 7 tips to help you achieve that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.100
1: write your goals down

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.880
even if you know what you want

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.140
actually write down your goals has proven to be more effective

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.160
make sure that it is visible

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.100
so you will have a continue reminder of what you set up to achieve

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.280
try putting a note on your bathroom mirror, or your fridge

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.940
so you will see it every day

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600
2: be patient with yourself

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Rome wasn't built in a day

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.780
and reaching your goals wont necessarily happen super fast

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.780
it would likely take hours and hours of hardwork

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.340
the best things in life often take time

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.900
and that makes them more awarding

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.380
3: make time in your week for goals

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.280
instead of trying to rush through your projects

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.220
all yourself an hour a day or a day a week to work on

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.680
small sub-goals that will contribute to your overall vision

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.440
doing things weekly in small segments

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.840
will help prevent you from feeling

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.560
stuck or frustrated in your attempt to achieve your goal

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
4: celebrate our achievements no matter how small

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.540
sometime it can feel like it is so far from reaching a milestone

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920
and you are not any closer then when you started

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.480
but if you are actively working towards something

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.960
that's not true

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.540
remember these goals are called long term for a reason

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.300
find a way to reward yourself

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.040
with your favorite snack or activity when you finish a part of your goal

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.220
5: remember that roadblocks are't failures

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.680
we all know the phrase when one door closes

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.980
another door opens

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.520
well it is not just inspiring, it is factual

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.600
sometimes life has a different on how we achieve our goals

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so next time you hit a wall, remember to be kind to yourself

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.420
you'll never know what could be around the coner

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.480
6: listen to criticism

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.140
and do not take them personally

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.300
criticisms are not personal attacks on your works

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.580
they aren't a chance for you to get defensive

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.100
and possessive of your work and goals

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.940
instead, take the criticism and use it to  refine and improve upon your goal

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.500
and the methods of getting there

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.240
criticisms allow us to double check our works with new eyes

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and create something even more amazing

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.620
7: work with like minded people

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.080
this is an especially important tip

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.040
because it is easier to feel alone when you are in debbers

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.360
there are also other times when you will feel stuck in your efforts

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.860
to figure out solutions to the things that sat between you and your achievements

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.320
talking and collaborating with those that share similar goals

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.220
is actually a great way to see things in a different way

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.340
get inspired and maintain drive

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.440
climbing the mountain of success is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.640
is always easier when your are working as a team

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.540
