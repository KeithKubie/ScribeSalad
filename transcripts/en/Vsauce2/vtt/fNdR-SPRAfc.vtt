Vsauce!

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.229
Kevin here.

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.760
High-heeled shoes were invented by Persian
horse riders to help hold their feet in stirrups,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.490
which allowed them to stand up to shoot their
bows and arrows.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.090
Nobility in Western Europe adopted the style
as a symbol of machismo, and the higher the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.400
heels you wore, the wealthier you appeared
because they were so impractical for walking

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.029
on cobbled streets.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.570
In the 1670s, the diminutive King Louis XIV
loved how high heels made him taller, and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.610
he ordered that only members of his court
could don his trademark red heels.&nbsp;

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.829
Women began to adopt masculine fashion, including
the high heel, but by the 1740s men’s fashion

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.540
became more practical and less ostentatious
and high heels were considered foolish.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.940
It wasn’t until the mid-19th century that
high heels on women symbolized female sexuality,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.170
largely due to their use in pornographic postcards.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.720
While neckties date back to at least 210 BC
China - they were worn by the statues of Qin

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.180
Shih Huang’s 'Terracotta Army' - there’s
no evidence to suggest that neckties were

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.150
commonly worn by men at that time.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.320
The modern necktie evolved from the cravat
worn by 17th century Croatian soldiers, with

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.990
theories on their use being to hide a dirty
shirt, to provide psychological protection

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.020
of the neck during battle, to hold together
their jackets, or to distinguish themselves

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.950
from other soldiers.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.100
During the Thirty Years War in the early 1600s,
Croatian mercenaries were hired by France's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.730
King Louis XIII, and Parisians loved their
colorful knotted neckerchiefs - with the word

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.310
cravat coming from a corrupt French pronunciation
of Croate.&nbsp;

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.860
By the early 19th century, the way a man knotted
his neckwear became such an important indication

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.850
of his style that the cravat became known
more simply as a tie.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.350
And it served to separate class, as you can’t
wear one while operating machinery and it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.920
gets in the way of manual labor.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.539
The necktie is also a phallic symbol that
points directly to a man’s…&nbsp;

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.280
Codpiece - a triangular cloth covering a man’s
groin, primarily worn in 15th and 16th century

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280
Europe.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.540
Men’s hose at that time were open at the
crotch with a doublet, a tight-fitting jacket

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.349
extending to the hips, as the only thing between
the world and their manhood.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.760
As doublets became fashionably shorter, the
codpiece was needed to cover the area, but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.819
it eventually evolved from simple concealment
to fanciful embellishment with King Henry

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.379
VIII of England famously sporting a massive
codpiece.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.769
Not only did it emphasize his regal bits,
but it may have also held medicine to relieve

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.599
symptoms associated with syphilis.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.909
The codpiece craze came to a close when Queen
Elizabeth I dictated that men’s fashion

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.709
become more feminized.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.680
By the end of her reign in 1603, it was replaced
by a vertical opening concealed in folds of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.769
material that evolved into something today
you may refer to as a fly.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.069
And as always - thanks for watching!
