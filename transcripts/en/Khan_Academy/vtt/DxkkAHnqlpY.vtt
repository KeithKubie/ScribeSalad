00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.760
In the videos on massive
stars and on black holes,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.039
we learned that if the remnant
of a star, of a massive star,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.250
is massive enough, the
gravitational contraction,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.080
the gravitational
force, will be stronger

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.420
than even the electron
degeneracy pressure,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.970
even stronger than the
neutron degeneracy pressure,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.450
even stronger than the
quark degeneracy pressure.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.350
And everything would
collapse into a point.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.715
And we called these
points black holes.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760
And we learned there's
an event horizon

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.060
around these black holes.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.980
And if anything
gets closer or goes

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.140
within the boundary
of that event horizon,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.826
there's no way that it can never
escape from the black hole.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:46.200
All it can do is get closer
and closer to the black hole.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.400
And that includes light.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.066
And that's why it's
called a black hole.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.690
So even though
all of the mass is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.830
at the central point,
this entire area,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.410
or the entire surface
of the event horizon,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.190
this entire surface
of the event horizon--

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.020
I'll do it in
purple because it's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.040
supposed to be black-- this
entire thing will appear black.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.240
It will emit no light.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.170
Now these type of black
holes that we described,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.735
we call those
stellar black holes.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.730
And that's because
they're formed

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.900
from collapsing massive stars.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.210
And the largest stellar black
holes that we have observed

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
are on the order of 33
solar masses, give or take.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.270
So very massive to begin
with, let's just be clear.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.680
And this is what the remnant
of the star has to be.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.750
So a lot more of the
original star's mass

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.035
might have been pushed
off in supernovae.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:42.910
That's plural of supernova.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.450
Now there's another
class of black holes here

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.560
and these are
somewhat mysterious.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.860
And they're called
supermassive black holes.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.200
And to some degree,
the word "super"

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.720
isn't big enough,
supermassive black holes,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.200
because they're not just
a little bit more massive

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.560
than stellar black holes.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.480
They're are a lot more massive.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.640
They're on the order of
hundreds of thousands

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.060
to billions of solar masses,
hundred thousands to billions

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.629
times the mass of our
Sun, solar masses.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.920
And what's interesting about
these, other than the fact

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710
that there are super
huge, is that there

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.610
doesn't seem to be black
holes in between or at least

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.870
we haven't observed
black holes in between.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.740
The largest stellar black
hole is 33 solar masses.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.220
And then there are these
supermassive black holes

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.530
that we think exist.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.240
And we think they mainly exist
in the centers of galaxies.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.130
And we think most, if not
all, centers of galaxies

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.350
actually have one of these
supermassive black holes.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.150
But it's kind of an
interesting question,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.370
if all black holes were
formed from collapsing stars,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.360
wouldn't we see
things in between?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.140
So one theory of how these
really massive black holes form

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.680
is that you have a
regular stellar black hole

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.710
in an area that
has a lot of matter

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.860
that it can accrete around it.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.305
So I'll draw the-- this is
the event horizon around it.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.680
The actual black hole is going
to be in the center of it,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.179
or rather the mass
of the black hole

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.630
will be in the center of it.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.510
And then over time, you have
just more and more mass just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.350
falling into this black hole.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.940
Just more and more
stuff just keeps

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.524
falling into this black hole.

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:27.815
And then it just keeps growing.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.220
And so this could be a plausible
reason, or at least the mass

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.160
in the center keeps growing and
so the event horizon will also

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.090
keep growing in radius.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.980
Now this is a
plausible explanation

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.452
based on our current
understanding.

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:43.910
But the reason why
this one doesn't

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.410
gel that well is if
this was the explanation

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.910
for supermassive
black holes, you

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.280
expect to see more
black holes in between,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.550
maybe black holes
with 100 solar masses,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.490
or a 1,000 solar masses,
or 10,000 solar masses.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.050
But we're not seeing
those right now.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.070
We just see the
stellar black holes,

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.760
and we see the
supermassive black holes.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.400
So another possible
explanation--

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.170
my inclinations lean
towards this one

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.260
because it kind of
explains the gap--

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.410
is that these supermassive black
holes actually formed shortly

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.670
after the Big Bang, that these
are primordial black holes.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.990
These started near the
beginning of our universe,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.720
primordial black holes.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.170
Now remember, what do you
need to have a black hole?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.600
You need to have an amazingly
dense amount of matter

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.160
or a dense amount of mass.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.600
If you have a lot of mass
in a very small volume,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.097
then their
gravitational pull will

00:04:40.097 --> 00:04:42.180
pull them closer, and
closer, and closer together.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.810
And they'll be able
to overcome all

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.289
of the electron
degeneracy pressures,

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:49.830
and the neutron
degeneracy pressures,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.970
and the quark
degeneracy pressures,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.090
to really collapse into what
we think is a single point.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.344
I want to be clear here, too.

00:04:56.344 --> 00:04:57.760
We don't know it's
a single point.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.640
We've never gone into the
center of a black hole.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.952
Just the mathematics of the
black holes, or at least

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.580
as we understand it right
now, have everything colliding

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.780
into a single point where the
math starts to break down.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.350
So we're really not
sure what happens

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.240
at that very small center point.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.670
But needless to say, it will
be an unbelievably, maybe

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.940
infinite, maybe
almost infinitely,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.444
dense point in space, or
dense amount of matter.

00:05:23.444 --> 00:05:24.860
And the reason why
I kind of favor

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.800
this primordial black hole
and why this would make sense

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.990
is right after the formation
of the universe, all

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.020
of the matter in the universe
was in a much denser space

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.410
because the universe
was smaller.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.284
So let's say that this
is right after the Big

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:41.190
Bang, some period of
time after the Big Bang.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.240
Now what we've talked
about before when

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.670
we talked about cosmic
background is that

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.060
at that point, the universe
was relatively uniform.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.330
It was super, super dense but
it was relatively uniform.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.520
So a universe like
this, there's no reason

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.420
why anything would
collapse into black holes.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.060
Because if you look
at a point here,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.070
sure, there's a ton of
mass very close to it.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.410
But it's very close to
it in every direction.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.150
So the gravitational force would
be the same in every direction

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.210
if it was completely uniform.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.630
But if you go shortly after
the Big Bang, maybe because

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.940
of slight quantum
fluctuation effects,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.080
it becomes slightly nonuniform.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.450
So let's say it becomes
slightly nonuniform,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.150
but it still is
unbelievably dense.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.090
So let's say it looks something
like this, where you have areas

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.720
that are denser, but
it's slightly nonuniform,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.069
but extremely dense.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.860
So here, all of a
sudden, you have the type

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.320
of densities necessary
for a black hole.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.500
And where you have
higher densities,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.720
where it's less uniform,
here, all of a sudden,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.780
you will have inward force.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.880
The gravitational pull from
things outside of this area

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.880
are going to be less than
the gravitational pull

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.630
towards those areas.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.350
And the more things get pulled
towards it, the less uniform

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.140
it's going to get.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.940
So you could imagine in
that primordial universe,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.020
that very shortly
after the Big Bang

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.470
when things were very dense
and closely packed together,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.000
we may have had the
conditions where

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.340
these supermassive black
holes could have formed.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.420
Where we had so much mass
in such a small volume,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.809
and it was just
not uniform enough,

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.100
so that you could kind of
have this snowballing effect,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.460
so that more and more
mass would collect

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.360
into these supermassive
black holes that

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.600
are hundreds of thousands to
billions of times the mass

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.490
of the Sun.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.840
And, this is maybe even
the more interesting part,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.290
those black holes would become
the centers of future galaxies.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.920
So you have these
black holes forming,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.960
these supermassive
black holes forming.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.490
And not everything would
go into a black hole.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.010
Only if it didn't have a
lot of angular velocity,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.030
then it might go
into the black hole.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.620
But if it's going
pass it fast enough,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.940
it'll just start going in
orbit around the black hole.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.356
And so you could
imagine that this

00:08:00.356 --> 00:08:03.580
is how the early galaxies
or even our galaxy formed.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.315
And so you might
be wondering, well,

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:08.690
what about the black hole at
the center of the Milky Way?

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.462
And we think there is one.

00:08:10.462 --> 00:08:11.920
We think there is
one because we've

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.130
observed stars orbiting very
quickly around something

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.320
at the center of the
universe-- sorry,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.160
at the center of our Milky Way.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.780
I want to be very clear, not
at the center of the universe.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.530
And the only
plausible explanation

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.570
for it orbiting so
quickly around something

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.070
is that it has to have a
density of either a black hole

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.690
or something that
will eventually

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.820
turn into a black hole.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.980
And when you do the
math for the middle

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.669
of our galaxy, the
center of the Milky Way,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.780
our supermassive black hole is
on the order of 4 million times

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.779
the mass of the Sun.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.320
So hopefully that gives you a
little bit of food for thought.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.692
There aren't just only
stellar collapsed black holes.

00:08:54.692 --> 00:08:56.150
Or maybe there are
and somehow they

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.742
grow into supermassive
black holes

00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:59.950
and that everything in
between we just can't observe.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.430
Or that they really are a
different class of black holes.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.055
They're actually
formed different ways.

00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:06.110
Maybe they formed
near the beginning

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.030
of the actual universe.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.090
When the density of things
was a little uniform,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.940
things condensed
into each other.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.106
And what we're going to
talk about in the next video

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:19.290
is how these supermassive
black holes can help generate

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.910
unbelievable sources
of radiation,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.660
even though the black
holes themselves

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.950
aren't emitting them.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.459
And those are going
to be quasars.
