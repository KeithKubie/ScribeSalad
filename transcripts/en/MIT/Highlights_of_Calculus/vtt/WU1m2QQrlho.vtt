00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.860
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.350
Hi.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.620
I thought I'd give a short
lecture about how logarithms

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.230
are actually used.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.760
So a little bit practical.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.750
And also, it naturally
comes in, how quickly

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.720
do functions grow?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.350
Which functions grow
faster than others?

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.700
And I made a list of a bunch
of functions that

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.290
we see all the time.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.520
Linear growth.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.440
Just, the function goes up
along the straight line.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.230
Proportional to x, linear could
have been a c times x,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.240
still linear.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.990
Here that's called polynomial
growth, like some power of x.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.080
Here is faster growth.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.100
We introduced e to the x, and
I'll take this chance to bring

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.300
in 2 to the x and 10 to the x.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.180
Especially 10 to the x, because
that'll lead us to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.110
logarithms to base 10, and those
are handy in practice.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.040
So that's exponential growth.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.680
And here are some that
grow faster still.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.655
x factorial, n factorial grows
really fast. And n to the nth

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.810
or x to the xth is a function
that grows still faster.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.960
And of course, we could
cook up a function the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.140
grew faster than that.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.680
X to the x to the x power would
really just take off.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.180
And we could find functions
that grow more slowly.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.770
But let's just take these
and let x be 1000.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.770
Just to have a kind of realistic
idea of how these

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.320
compare when x is 1000.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.870
OK.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.060
So I'm skipping to c.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.390
So x will be 1000.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.360
10 cubed.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.810
Let me just write
it as 10 cubed.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.940
So x is going to be 1000.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.430
And because these are big
numbers, I'm going to write

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.170
them as powers of 10.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.280
OK.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.460
so how about 1000 squared?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.560
10 cubed squared will
be 10 to the sixth.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.030
1000 cubed, we're up
to 10 to the ninth.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.500
And onwards.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.420
Like, this is where the
economists are working.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.460
The national debt is
in this range.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.840
OK.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.070
Now fortunately, it's
not in this range.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.640
2 to the thousandth power.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.620
And if I want to be able to
compare it, I'll write that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.540
approximately as 10 to--

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.710
well, if it's 2 to the
thousandth power, it'll be 10

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.850
to a smaller power.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.980
And 300 is pretty close for
2 to the thousandth.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.150
Then e to the thousandth, that's
going to be bigger than

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.890
2. e is 2.7 et cetera.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.300
This is more like 10 to the--

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.770
I think this is right--
about 434, maybe.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.410
And 10 to the thousandth--

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.960
well, I can write
that right in.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.380
10 to the thousandth
when x is 1000.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.370
OK.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.000
So that's the one that
is exactly right.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.540
And also, I could write in 1000
to the thousandth power.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.260
What power of 10 will this be?

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.470
10 to the what?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.730
1000 to the thousandth power,
I think, is 10 to the three

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.690
thousandth.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.850
Why do I think that?

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.920
Because 1000 itself is
10 times 10 times 10.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.180
Three of them, right?

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.779
And then we do that 1000 times,
so we have a string of

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.620
3000 10s multiplying
each other.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.960
And that's what 10 to the
three thousandth is.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.120
And you might wonder about
a thousand factorial.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.695
Let me make the rough
estimate.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.010
A big number in factorial,
order of magnitude, is

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.220
something like, it doesn't grow
as fast as this, because

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.480
this is x times x minus
1 times x minus 2.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.990
1000 times 999 times 998.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.710
So we're not repeating
1000 every time.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.150
And the difference--

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.630
it turns out that this number
divided by this number, x to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.130
the x over e to the
x, is the right

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.700
general picture for factorial.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.490
So that would be, if I divide 10
to the 3000 by 10 and this

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.550
power, what do I do?

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.320
In a division, I do a
subtraction of exponents,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.530
because I have that many fewer
10s multiplying each other.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.300
So I think it would be 3000,
but I don't want the full

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.530
3000, because I take away e to
the thousandth, 434 of them.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.520
So that's about--

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.750
2566 is close enough, anyway.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.190
OK.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.440
Giant numbers.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.320
Giant numbers.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.970
And of course you saw that I
didn't write it out with 1 and

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.375
3000, or whatever, zeros.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:43.530
Hopeless.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.780
OK.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.800
In other words, it's the
exponent that gives me

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.350
something I can really
work with.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.850
And the exponent is
the logarithm.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.150
That's what logarithms are.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.690
They are the exponents.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:05.190
And when they're the exponent
with a 10, I call 10 the base.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.290
And I'm speaking about
logarithms to the base 10.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.850
Can I just copy those
numbers again?

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.250
And then I want to write their
logarithms. Because it's the

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:21.210
logarithms that kind of remain
reasonable-looking numbers but

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.180
tell you very nicely what's
growing fast.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.340
So let me write out again.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.380
10 cubed, 10 sixth, 10 to the
ninth is polynomial growth

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.670
starting with the first power.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.800
Then I'll write down 10 to
the three hundredth,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.280
approximately.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.920
10 to the 434, I think,
is about right.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.760
And then 10 to the 1000.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:53.910
And then I had 10 to the 2566
as something, roughly 1000

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.370
factorial, and then
10 to the 3000.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.660
OK.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.120
I just copied those
numbers again.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.660
And now I plan to take their
logarithms. I can see what's

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.360
happening with logarithms.
The logarithm of 10

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.750
to the ninth is--

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.090
if the base is 10--

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.070
the logarithm of 10 to the
ninth is the nine.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.170
This has logarithm 6.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.000
This has logarithm 3.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.700
So you see--

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.970
well.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.220
If we took the logarithm of the
national debt, it wouldn't

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.250
look too serious.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.540
It would just be up around
9 moving toward 10.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.510
But what I'm using it for
here is to get some

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.990
reasonable way to see--

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.840
300.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.355
Of course, that's big.

00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:46.370
For a logarithm, that's
a very big number.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.190
434, 1000.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.310
These are climbing up.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.910
2566 and 3000.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.280
OK.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.530
So these are the logs.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.100
Just to repeat.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.200
If I wanted this growth, this
list of functions by how fast

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.440
they grow, where would
log x appear

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.580
in my list of functions?

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.310
It would be way at
the left end.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.840
Slower than x.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.980
Much slower than x.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.040
Log x grows very slowly,
as we see here.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.590
And then if you wanted one that
really grew slowly, it

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.080
would be log of log x.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.180
That creeps along.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.590
Eventually gets to--

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.940
passes any number.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.400
But x has to be enormous.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.946
And one more little comment
before I begin to use some

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:43.120
things graphically.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.445
Because that's the other part
of this talk, is log--

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.850
the graphs.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.810
Using logarithms in graphs.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.240
A little point.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.340
You might ask, what about
functions that decay?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.850
What would be the corresponding
functions here

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:01.890
that decay?

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.460
Let me write them here.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.710
Decay.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.610
By that I mean, headed
for 0 instead

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.110
of headed for infinity.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:17.110
Well, 1 over x, 1 over x
squared, 1 over x cubed.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:27.080
Those functions go to
0 faster and faster.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.410
Now, what about these?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:33.190
The next list would
be 1 over--

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.070
I'm dividing, but 1
over 2 to the x.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.370
1 over e to the x.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.970
Can I write that in
a better way?

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.880
e to the minus x.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.980
1 over 10 to the x.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.290
Those are going to
0 like crazy.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.730
And of course, if I keep
going, even worse.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:59.430
So like, x to the minus x power
would be really small.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:05.220
So my point is just that we
have a scale here that not

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.720
only gives us a handle of how
to deal with things that are

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.130
growing very fast, but also
things that are going to 0

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.920
very fast. The other, the
negative logarithms. The

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.590
logarithms of these things would
be minus 3, minus 6,

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:25.260
minus 9 and so on, if
I divide by one.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.120
Good.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.630
All right.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.610
So that suggests the idea.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:36.000
Now I want to introduce the
idea of a log scale.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:48.475
So I'm just going to think of
a usual straight line, on

00:10:48.475 --> 00:10:54.290
which we usually mark out 0,
1, 2, 3, minus 1, minus 2.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:04.170
But on this log scale, the
center point, the 0, I'm

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.140
really graphing the logarithm
of x instead of x.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.250
That's the point.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.640
That in this log scale,
what I'm picturing

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.890
along here will be--

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:22.680
this number will be 10 to
the 0 power, which is 1.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.270
The next one will be 10.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.180
The next one will be 100.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.890
The next one will be 1000.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.850
So you see, within
this picture--

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.440
on a graph that we could
draw and look at

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.370
on a printed page--

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:44.000
we can get big numbers by going
from the ordinary 1, 2,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.900
3 scale to the log scale, which
puts these points in

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.430
this order.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.150
And let me put some
of the other ones.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.080
Now, what one point
goes there?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.860
1/10.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.640
Every time I go that far,
I'm multiplying by 10.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.850
When I go this way, I'm
dividing by 10.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.970
Up there, this is the number
1/10, which is the same as 10

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.720
to the minus 1 power, right?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.850
Here is one hundredth.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.080
Here is one thousandth.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.610
And so on.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:24.820
So this log scale is able to
deal with very small numbers

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.540
and very large numbers
in a reasonable way.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:35.530
And everybody sees the point
here that really, what it is

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.170
is the logarithms.
So this is 0.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.550
This is 1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.500
Minus 1, minus 2, minus 3.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:51.350
If I'm graphing, really, these
are the logarithms of x.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.470
And I'm doing logs to base 10
again, because that gives us

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.630
nice numbers.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:57.705
OK.

00:12:57.705 --> 00:13:00.560
By the way, what's
that number?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.355
What's that number, halfway
between there and there?

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:13.910
It's not halfway between 1 and
10 in the ordinary sense,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.760
which is whatever,
5 and a half.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.020
No way.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.520
Halfway between here is--

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.580
you know what it will be?

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.870
It'll be square root of 10.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.840
10 to the 1/2 power.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.720
The half is here.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.720
The log is a half, so
the number is the

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.490
square root of 10.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.760
That's about 3, a little
more than 3.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.000
And what would be here, would
be 10 to the minus 1/2.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.450
1 over square root of 10.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.800
So you see that picture.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.840
Oh, I have another question,
before I use the scales.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.900
What if I like the powers
of 2 better?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.320
In many cases, we might
prefer powers of 2.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.370
Well, if I plotted
the numbers--

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.620
I'm looking at this log scale.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.050
And suppose I plot the numbers
1, 2, 4, 8, whatever.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.720
16.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.520
What could you tell
me about those?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.890
Well, I know where 1 is.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.370
It's right there.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.780
That's a 1.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.900
Well, two would be a little
further over.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.590
Then 4, then 8 would come
before 10, and 16

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.280
would come after 10.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.020
I pointed there, but 16
would not come there.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.390
16 would be a lot closer,
I think, in here.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:43.720
What's the deal with 1, 2, 4,
8, 16 on this log scale?

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.970
They would be equally spaced.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.350
Of course, the spacing would be

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.810
smaller than the 10 spacing.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.520
If every time I multiplied by
2, I go the same distance.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.500
After I'd done it
about 10 times--

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.690
multiplied by 2 10 times-- so
that's 2 to the tenth power is

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.060
close to 1000.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.445
So 10 powers of 2 would bring
me pretty near there.

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.760
Anyway.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.830
And here's one more question.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.850
Where is 0?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:25.140
If my value that I wanted to
plot happened to be 0, where

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.530
is it on this graph?

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.670
It's not there.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.270
You can't plot 0
on a log scale.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.780
It's way down at the--

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.620
you know, it's at the minus
infinity end of the graph.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:48.390
Infinity is up there at that
end, and 0 is down here.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.800
OK.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.330
Good.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.930
So can we use that log scale?

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.780
How do we use that log scale?

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.790
Let me give you an idea
for what use that

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.710
log scale might be.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.520
Practical use.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:08.600
Suppose I know, or have reason
to believe, that my function

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:17.580
might be of the form y is
something times x to the nth.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.030
I have some quantity y.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.880
The output when the
input is x.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:31.450
But I don't know these,
that number a.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.960
So I've done an experiment.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.930
And I would like to know
what is a, and

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.420
especially, what is n?

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.920
I would like to know how the
growth is progressing.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.220
And I'm just taking simple
growth law here.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:50.870
OK.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.960
I would graph it.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.710
I'd get a bunch of points, I
put them on a graph, and I

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.410
look at the graph.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.080
Now if I just graph these
things, if I just graph that

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:10.410
y, here is x and here's
y, suppose n is 1.5.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.680
Suppose my growth rate,
and this is very

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.440
possible, is x to the 1.5.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.460
And a is some number--

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.500
who knows.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.910
Could even be 1.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.160
Suppose a was 1.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.110
So then I'm graphing
y as x to the 1.5.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.060
What does that look like?

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.890
Well, it looks like that.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.260
The problem is that if
the real growth--

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.660
the real good relation--

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.530
see, I would have a few
points that might be

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.750
close to that curve.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:18:01.480
But if I'm looking that curve,
I frankly could not tell 1.5

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.490
from 1.6 growth rate.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.600
The truth is, I couldn't
tell it from 2.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.290
I couldn't tell what the actual
growth rate is from my

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.630
graph, which has a little error,
so I'm not too sure.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.450
And the point is x to the 1.5
and x to the 2 would be all--

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.060
If I sketch the graph, it
would look like that.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.460
But go to the log scale.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.090
Go to a log log graph.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.220
So I'm going to take logs
of both sides, and

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.890
look and plot that.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.180
So I take the logs of both
sides, so I take the log of my

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.980
outputs y, and now this is a
product of that times that.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.030
What's the rule for
logarithms?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.590
Add logarithms. So this
would be log a plus

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.990
log of x to the nth.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.370
But now what's the log
of x to the nth?

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.570
Beautiful again.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.630
This is x times x
times x n times.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.000
At least of n is an integer.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.170
Think of it as x multiplied
by itself n times.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.400
When I take the logarithm,
I add n times.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:21.550
Log of x to the nth
is n log x.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.980
Now that, let me
graph that now.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.280
This is now a log picture.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:38.520
So I'm graphing log y against
log x, which was the whole

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.450
point of my log scale, to
think of doing this.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:53.300
And what kind of a curve will
I see from this equation on

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.550
this graph paper?

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.170
A straight line.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.620
That is some constants
plus some slope.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.070
n will be the slope
times the x.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:17.360
It's like capital Y is capital
A plus n times

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.900
capital X or something.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.910
But better for me to
write log, so we

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.190
remember what it is.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:26.890
So on this paper, suppose--

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.430
I did the example
x to the 1.5.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:31.850
OK.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:37.820
So in this example, a
is 1 and n is 1.5.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.090
So what would my points
look like here?

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:46.260
Now remember, I should really
allow negative logarithms.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.450
Because this is the
point, right?

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.270
This is x equals 1 here.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.565
The log is 0, but
the number is 1.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.890
Ha, OK.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.090
So when the log is 0, you
see, it's going to

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.770
be a straight line.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.460
And actually, when I took a to
be 1, its logarithm will be 0.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.560
The line would go right
through there.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.230
It would have a slope
of 1 and 1/2.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.240
My points will be really
close to line.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.280
I measure out, if I go out a
distance 1, then I go up a

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.458
distance 1.5.

00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:26.536
Right?

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:27.786
Up 1.5.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.720
When I go across by 1 on
the log picture, it

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.160
could be down here.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.540
My numbers could be
smaller or larger.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.470
A straight line.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.280
I can get out a ruler and
estimate the slope far more

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:55.970
accurately than I could hear
with a lot more software.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.075
OK.

00:21:56.075 --> 00:22:03.500
So that's an important, very
important instance in which we

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.180
wonder what the rate of
growth is, and the

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.460
graph shows it to us.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.290
But just make a little point
that I've put some points

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:18.420
here, like near a line, and
that raises another graph

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.260
question of very great
importance.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.890
Suppose you have some
experiments that put points

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.420
close to a line, but not
right on a line.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.700
You want to fit a line
close to them.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.950
You want to fit the best line
to the experimental points.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.830
How do you fit a
straight line?

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.220
That's an important thing.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:48.040
And let me save that for a
future chance, because I want

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.740
to tell you about it.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.460
The best, the standard
way is what's

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.480
called the least squares.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.520
So least squares is a very
important application.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.970
And the best line, it turns out,
is a calculus problem.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.580
So for the moment let's
pretend they're

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.570
right on the line.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:13.100
Its slope, which we easily find,
tells us this number.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.780
May I mention one
other behavior?

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.190
So another possibility.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:24.320
If y is not growing
polynomially, but suppose y is

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.560
growing exponentially--

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.460
I'll just put it here,
because it's not

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.290
going to be a big deal.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.410
y is some--

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:41.250
call it b, e to the c x.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.830
So that's a different
type of growth.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.000
That's the big part of the
today's lecture, is to say,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.510
this is a quite different
growth.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.930
But it would be equally hard--

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.480
or even harder--

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.230
to find this growth rate c
from an ordinary graph.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.530
The graph would take off even
faster than this one.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.130
You couldn't see what's
happening.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:09.550
The good idea is, take
logarithms. But what do we

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.610
want to do?

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.950
We'll take the logarithm
of y--

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.930
log y, as before--

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:24.590
will be the log of B plus
the log of e to the cx.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.700
Oh, maybe I should have made
this 10 to the cx, just to

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.640
make it all--

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.850
instead of the e, I
could use the 10.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.040
Whatever.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.540
Because I've been talking about
logarithms to the base

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.260
10, so let me use the
powers of 10 here.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.790
What's the logarithm
of 10 to the cx?

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.190
When the base is 10, the
logarithm is the exponent.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.770
c times x.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.450
So what am I seeing
in this equation?

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.370
That's an equation when I've
taken logarithms, my big

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.950
numbers become reasonable.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.060
And also, very small numbers
become reasonable.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.990
And I get a straight
line again.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.170
I get a straight line.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:20.640
But it's not in this
log paper.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.290
The logarithm of y, the y-axis,
the vertical axis, is

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.630
still log scale.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.130
But you see it's ordinary
x there now.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.440
So I don't use log
x for this one.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.510
Just ordinary x.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.780
It's semi log paper.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.060
Logarithm in the in the vertical
direction, ordinary

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.970
in the x direction.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.720
OK.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.950
Good.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:52.380
Now I just want to add
one sort of example.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.083
Because it's quite important
and also quite practical.

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:57.333
May I tell you about--

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.520
Let me ask you the question,
and see if you get an idea.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.150
Because this is like
basic to calculus.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.880
Let me talk about--

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.860
this e will stand for error.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.075
Error e.

00:26:19.075 --> 00:26:21.760
And what error am
I talking about?

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.120
I'm talking about the error as
the difference between the

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.490
derivative--

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.920
I have some function f of x.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.000
And there's its derivative.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.420
And I compare that with
delta f over delta x.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.230
So what do I know?

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:52.240
I know that as this is a
function of delta x, I'm

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.410
comparing the instant slope
versus the average slope over

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.040
a distance delta x.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.680
So it's not 0, right?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.040
This one is a finite movement.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.050
Delta x produces a finite
moment delta f.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:20.180
As delta x goes to 0, that
does approach this.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.720
So here's my question.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.990
My question is, this is
approximately some constant

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.680
times delta x to some power.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.815
And my question is, what is n?

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:41.940
How close?

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.340
What's a rough estimate of how
near the delta f over delta x

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.860
is to the actual derivative?

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.180
OK.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:56.240
So I have to tell you what I
meant by delta f over delta x.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:05.040
I meant what you also meant, f
at x plus delta x minus f at x

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.850
divided by delta x.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.720
In other words, that's
the familiar delta f.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.470
Moving forward from x, I would
call that a forward

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.930
difference, a forward delta f.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:21.180
Because I'm starting at x, and
I think of delta x as moving

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.940
me a little bit forward.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.240
So I get the delta f, I divide
by the delta x, and that's

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.560
what this thing means.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.040
And do you know what n is?

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.590
Let me connect it
to my pictures.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.345
If I tried to graph this,
I'd have a graph.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.690
You know.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.720
Here's my delta x
and here's my e.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.750
This difference says delta x
goes to 0, it goes to 0.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.370
You know, if delta x is
small, e is small.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.390
If I divide delta x by 10,
e divides by something.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.320
I don't even know if you
see it on the camera.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.800
The graph has gone into a--

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.210
well, a black hole, or
a chalk hole, or a

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.740
white hole, or something.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.550
It's just completely
invisible.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.940
I can't see the slope
of this thing.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:26.720
But if I did it on log log
paper, I'd see it clearly.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.420
And the answer would be 1.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:37.100
The error, the difference
between derivative and average

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:43.210
slope, goes like delta
x to the first power.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.680
And then we can see later where
that 1 comes from, and

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.800
we can see where that a is.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.690
It's all in Taylor series.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.150
But here's my practical point.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.820
There is a much better delta
f than this one.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.290
A much better delta
f over delta x.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:09.090
An average slope that's much
more accurate, and that in

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.730
calculation I would
always use.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.900
And the trouble with this
one is, it's lopsided.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.920
It's one-sided.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.160
I only went forward.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.200
Or if delta x is negative,
I'm only going backwards.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.920
And it turns out that the
average of forward and

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.200
backward is like centered
at difference.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.070
So let me tell you a center
difference. f at

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.230
x plus delta x.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.690
So look a little forward, but
take the difference from

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:41.940
looking a little backward.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.380
That would be my change in f.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:54.720
But now what do I divide by
to get a reasonable slope?

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:00.050
Well, this is the change in f
going from minus delta x--

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.370
delta x to the left of the point
to delta x to the right

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.350
of the point.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.840
The real movement there in
the x-axis was a movement

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.090
of two delta xs.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.200
So I would call this a
center difference.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.099
Can I write that word
"centered" down?

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.810
And if I use that, which is a
lot smarter if I'm practically

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.050
wanting to get pictures,
then what happens?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:37.350
So if this is now instead of
this, instead of choosing this

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:45.200
lopsided, simple, familiar but
not that great difference, if

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:53.710
I go for this one, the answer
is, n changes to 2.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.350
n is 2 for this one.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:03.960
The accuracy is way, way better
for center differences.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.510
And the point about the log
graphs is, if I plot those

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:14.170
points on the graph I would see
that slope of 2 in the log

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.460
log graph, it would be again--

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:22.780
in ordinary graph, it would
become invisible

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.690
as delta x got small.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:30.120
But on a log scale, I'd
see it perfectly.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.300
OK.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.650
Some practical uses of
logarithms. Now that we no

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.550
longer use slide rules,
this is what we do.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.650
Thanks.
