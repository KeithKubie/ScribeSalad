00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's think about how hydrogen
bromide might react with this

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.920
thing right here.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.390
Let's think about what
this would be called.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.210
We have one, two, three,
four, five carbons.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.800
It has a double bond right here,
if we start numbering at

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.240
this end, because that's where
the double bond is.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.490
Then this would be pent.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.510
The double bond starts at the
number one carbon, pent-1, and

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.080
it's obviously an alkene.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.330
It has a double bond,
so it's pent-1-ene.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.490
Sometimes this is called
1-pentene, either way.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.830
So let's think about how these
two characters might react

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.930
with each other in some
type of solvent.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.090
Usually when a solvent's not
specified, it's usually water

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.880
or alcohol.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.810
If this was water, then we
would have a solution of

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.700
hydrobromic acid, but
let's not worry

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.420
about that right now.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.520
Let's just worry about how these
two characters might

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.920
react with each other.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.440
Now, the first thing we might
look at is this hydrogen

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.500
bromide right there.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.920
And as you get more experience
there, you'll say, well, you

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.290
know, bromine is much more
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.090
It likes to hog electrons
much more.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.090
If that's a completely foreign
concept to you, I'll do a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.010
little bit of a review.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.610
This is the Periodic Table.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.900
Electronegativity increases from
the bottom left to the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.950
top right of the
Periodic Table.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.200
Electronegativity.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.180
And really, that's just a fancy
way of saying how much

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780
does an atom like to
hog electrons.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.570
So, for example, fluorine loves
to hog electrons and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.350
calcium doesn't like to
hog electrons so much.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
So if we think about hydrogen
bromide, hydrogen's way up

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.110
here on the left side of
the Periodic Table.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.680
Bromine's all the way
to the right.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.460
Bromine is much more
electronegative.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.710
So in this situation, since
bromine is more

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.890
electronegative, it will hog
the electrons in this bond.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.640
And since it's hogging the
electrons in this bond, you'll

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.960
have a partial negative charge
on the bromine end, and you'll

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.090
have a partial positive charge
on the hydrogen end.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.110
And, whenever you do these
reactions, actually, it's

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.789
useful to draw all the
valence electrons.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.120
So bromine right here has an
atomic number of 35, which

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.980
means it has 35 electrons
in its neutral state.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.610
And we don't have any
charge here, so it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.160
in a neutral state.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.010
But you can look at its group.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.540
It's in Group Number 7.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.070
If you just count from here,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.360
six, seven, or has seven
valence electrons.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.440
Let me draw that.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.470
Seven electrons in its
outermost shell.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.100
Let me draw them right here.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.330
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, and then the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.530
seventh is in the bond
with the hydrogen.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.180
Hydrogen obviously
has one electron.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.750
It's right there.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.380
So these two guys are bonding
with each other and they both

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.960
allow each other to pretend that
they're part of a pair.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.070
And that's what gives it a lower
energy level or makes it

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.770
a little more stable.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.910
That's why the bond forms
in the first place.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.780
But anyway, let's think about
what might happen here.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.030
This guy is really
electronegative, so maybe he

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.590
wants to take this electron
away, this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.720
green hydrogen electron.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.130
And maybe that happens.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.250
Let me just draw it out.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.910
So maybe that happens.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.360
So he takes that electron, that
green electron, away.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.780
It's just getting closer
and closer.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.810
If there was only some other
place that this hydrogen could

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.170
get an electron from, then this
guy could just go to the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.940
bromine, which is what bromine
really wants to happen,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.410
because it's so electronegative.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.640
So where can the hydrogen get an
electron to replace the one

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.320
that it's about to lose?

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.820
Well, we have a double
bond here.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.020
And maybe one of these carbons
lose an electron.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.220
And in future videos, we'll talk
more about which one is

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.830
more likely to give up
the electron at this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.650
stage of the reaction.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.360
But just for simplicity, let's
assume that this carbon right

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.880
here gives up an electron.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.410
Where are its valence
electrons?

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.250
And just as a bit a review,
here's carbon on

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.710
the Periodic Table.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.200
it has six protons and six
electrons in its stable state.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.945
Two are sitting in its first
shell and then the other four

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:07.920
are its valence electrons.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.870
And you can see that.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.310
It's in Group 4, right?

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.775
One, two, three, four.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.310
We can ignore these for now, and
usually you're not going

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.620
to be dealing with-- well, we'll
ignore those for now.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.670
It has four valence electrons.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.620
Most of what you're going to
deal with, you just have to

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.890
count the group numbers
like this.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.290
We won't worry too much about
all of the metals and all of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.930
those right now.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.340
And that's four valence
electrons and you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.980
see it right here.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.470
It has one, two, three, four
valence electrons.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.700
It has two in its one shell,
so it actually has six, but

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.720
you only draw the
four out there.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.890
So what we're saying is this
green electron can go to the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.480
bromine as long as the hydrogen
can take an electron

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.710
maybe from this carbon
right here.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.120
So let's draw that.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.070
So this electron right here is
going to go to the hydrogen.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.100
And when that electron goes to
the hydrogen, simultaneously

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.770
that will allow this electron
to go to bromine.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.080
And, obviously, they won't be
this far when it happens.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.900
There would be some type of
collision that would have to

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.180
occur in just the right way with
just the right level of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.510
energy for this to occur.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.970
Maybe the hydrogen is getting
really close to this part

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.930
right at the right moment when
this electron is being sucked

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.960
away from the bromine, so this
has a partial positive charge

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.170
attracted to the electron.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.630
That electron goes over there.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.350
It won't always happen,
but this is a

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.010
potential reaction mechanism.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.730
But this whole step
happens at once.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.180
This electron goes from this
character to the hydrogen at

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.210
the same time as hydrogen
loses its

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.600
electron to the bromine.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.150
So what's going to happen
right after this step?

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.500
So right after that
happens, what will

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.150
everything look like?

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.900
Well, the bromine will have
gained the electron, so it's

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.806
now a bromide ion.

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.700
So let me draw it like this.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.140
So it had its original seven
valence electrons, one, two,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.650
three, four, five, six, seven,
and now it just stole an

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.650
electron from the hydrogen.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.950
It was able to swipe an electron
off the hydrogen.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.250
That's the electron it swiped
off the hydrogen.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.020
And now what will this thing
that was 1-pentene or

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.790
pent-1-ene, what will
this look like now?

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.080
Let me draw it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.710
So we have a carbon and a
hydrogen and a hydrogen, and

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.710
then you have a carbon, and then
a hydrogen, and then you

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.550
have the rest of the chain
right over here.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.360
But this double bond
was broken.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.410
This carbon lost an electron,
went to the hydrogen.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.010
So this bond right here now
forms between this carbon and

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.730
that hydrogen.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.980
So let me draw that bond.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.490
You have this electron
right there.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.640
That electron will now
be with the hydrogen.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.270
So let me draw the electron.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.340
And now we have that
orange hydrogen.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.250
I'll try to keep the colors
consistent so that we know

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.490
where things came from.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.070
And then we have this bond
now to the hydrogen.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.580
Now, this carbon now only has
three valence electrons.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.380
One, two, three.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.240
It has two sitting in its first
shell, so it actually

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.590
has a total of five electrons.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.350
It has six protons, so it
has a positive charge.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.900
This carbon right here has
a positive charge.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.040
And another way to think about
it is it was completely

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.780
neutral and then it
lost an electron.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.290
So now it will have a positive
charge right over there.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.960
So this is what we
are left after

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.980
that step of the reaction.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.560
Oh, and of course,
we can't forget.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.730
Bromine over here was neutral.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.950
It had seven valence electrons,
and that's when

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.550
bromine is neutral.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.950
But now it has eight,
so now this will

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.200
have a negative charge.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.290
This will have a negative
charge, because

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.800
it gained an electron.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.450
And in general, your total
charge-- over here our total

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.630
charge is zero, So?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.310
Our total charge will
still be zero.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.820
We have a negative and
we have a positive.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.240
They would cancel out, so our
total charge is still zero.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.610
So what's likely to happen for
the next step of our reaction?

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.340
Well, we have this positive
thing here.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.430
Maybe bromine just bumped, just
the right way, to let go

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.020
of this guy and steal
his electron.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.820
But now you have this guy who's
negative and this guy

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.740
who's positive.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.400
Maybe they'll be attracted
to each other.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.240
Maybe they'll just bump
into each other at

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.340
the exact right way.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.270
And if they bump in the exact
right way, maybe this guy can

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.300
swipe the electron from the
bromide ion, from this

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.750
negative ion right here.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.710
And you might say, hey, isn't
bromine more electronegative

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.190
than carbon?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.500
Well, it might be, but this
guy's electron rich.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.220
It's not just a regular
bromine atom.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.190
This is a bromine plus
an extra electron.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.774
So he's already hogged
an electron, so

00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:36.750
he's electron rich.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.549
So in this situation,
he's negative.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.700
He's positive.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.360
He can give this guy
an electron.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.940
So if they bump in just the
right way, this electron can

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.070
be swiped by this carbon
right over here.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.780
And this positive carbon, just
so it gives you a little

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.590
terminology, and we'll go over
it in more detail in future

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.270
videos, is actually called
a carbocation.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.370
It's a positive ion of carbon.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.160
That's where the word
comes from.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.680
But anyway, if this electron
gets swiped by this carbon, it

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.720
will then form a bond.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.780
Because remember, this was the
electron that was originally

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.730
in a bond with this hydrogen.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.110
It's still going to be, you
could imagine, paired up with

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.000
this other purple or magenta
electron right over there.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.370
So if that happens, then we're
going to be left with-- so the

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.190
next step is going to be-- so on
this end of the molecule we

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.540
have C, carbon, hydrogen,
hydrogen.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.360
Then we have this orange
hydrogen that we stole from

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.270
the hydrogen bromide.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:39.440
Then we have this carbon
right here.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.700
It has a hydrogen.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.020
You have the rest of the
chain, CH2-CH2-CH3.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.380
And now, since this guy stole an
electron, a bond will form

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.500
with the bromine.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.670
Let me draw it.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.620
So he's going to steal this--
let me draw it this way.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.640
So a bond will form.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.340
He's stealing this electron, so
now this electron is with

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.250
this carbon, so I can do it
as one end of the bond.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.970
The other end of the bond will
be that magenta electron right

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.340
there on the bromine.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.490
And now the bromine lost an
electron, so it's neutral.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:18.140
It once again has one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.410
valence electrons.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.660
Carbon is now neutral, because
it gained an electron.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.930
It once again has one, two
three, four electrons.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.640
So now everyone is
happy again.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.360
In this video, we were able
to get a mechanism.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.200
We can talk in the future about
how likely it is to

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.060
happen, how quickly
it might happen.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.520
We were able to start with
hydrogen bromide and

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.720
1-pentene, or pent-1-ene, and
get to this thing, just by

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.050
pushing around electrons and
just thinking about what is

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.630
likely to happen based on what's
electronegative and

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.135
what might be able to gain
or lose an electron.

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:50.500
And just a bit of a review, what
is this thing right here?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.420
This might be-- This is
one, two, three, four,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.590
five carbons still.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.620
So it's going to be a pent.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.910
It's now an alkane,
no double bond.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.750
So it's pentane.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.370
And it has one group on it, so
we'll start numbering closer

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.810
to the group.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.350
So one, two.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.600
It's 2-bromopentane.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.250
So we were able to figure out a
reaction mechanism to get us

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.550
from hydrogen bromide and
1-pentene to 2-bromopentane.
