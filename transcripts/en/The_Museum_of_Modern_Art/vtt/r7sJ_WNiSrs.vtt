00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.340
You should really have a lot of fun
this week because we'll be exploring some

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.689
really wonderful viscus and
fluid paints here.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.500
The whole range of painter's materials.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.070
We're exploring the work of Willem
de Kooning this week, certainly, one of the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.130
masters of
the New York avant garde.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.470
And you can see in front
of me a lot of paint.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.610
A lot of oil paints
straight out of the tube.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.640
We have a lot of linseed oil here,
we have some damar varnish here.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.710
And I do have one typical baker's pan
here, which I'll be using as a pallet for

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.289
one color, but
really we're in the realm of kitchens now.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.550
And if you have some old bowls or
old cans, or what have you, this is really

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.719
the quantities of paint
that we're going to be working with, if you're

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.960
going to be working
with a large format painting.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.179
de Kooning painted with his whole body,
he was a gestural painter, he was an action

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.179
painter.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.579
And really using really large
quantities of liquid paints here, allows the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.299
body to trace these huge marks,
powerful strokes across the canvas.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.760
So let's get started.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
What I'm going to do, essentially,
is to build my entire palette first, before

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.899
even approaching the easel,
that way I know what I'm working with.

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.530
Let's start off with a cobalt blue.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.990
A vast majority of the paints I'm working
with are going to be really low viscosity,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.590
allowing them to be quite fluid, and really
translate the power

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.450
of my gestures on the canvas.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649
In other words, I'm not going to
paint with this really thick, toothpaste thick

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.720
quality of artist's
oil grade paint right out of the tube, I'm

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.700
going to douse it
with some nice oil there.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.500
And I'm really going
to cut that viscosity, make it a lot more

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.650
flowable on
the surface of the painting.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.679
There is something really gorgeous,
really wonderful about this gooey quality

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.600
of oil paints, which you just can't get
in the rather plastic realm of acrylics.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.900
So, here, kind of a medium speed paint,
if you will.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.829
It's not super thick, but it's not super
fluid, it's not running off of my brush.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.149
And I'm going to vary my consistency of
different paints here, some of them medium

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.299
like this, some of them, as you'll see,
will be a lot more fluid than this.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.229
So I'm just going to save that for later.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.310
Now, let's work on another one, and
let's work with some kind of flesh tone.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.110
Now, for a kind of basic Caucasian flesh
tone, it's nice to use some buff titanium.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.220
This is actually the same thing as
titanium white, it's just not bleached.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.550
So both of these, buff titanium and
titanium white, this one gets bleached, titanium

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.450
white, buff titanium has
more of a neutral tone to it.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.181
And then to get a decent kind of
Caucasian flesh tone, believe it or not, you

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.470
add a little bit of red for
warmth.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
You add a little bit of yellow for warmth.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.740
And then you add a little bit of green for
depth.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.790
And again, once I add a little bit of
varnish into there, make it nice and glossy,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.150
this is Dammar varnish,
it's a natural resin, comes from trees.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.650
Dammar is D-A-M-M-A-R.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.140
Let's add a little bit of
linseed oil in there as well.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.660
And then let's add a little bit of
mineral spirits, or turpentine.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.560
And let's choose a nice brush for flesh.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.760
How about this one?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.050
We'll start getting some of
these colors mixing here.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.290
Now, that mixture of solvents and media
that I added here, remember that's dammar

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.980
varnish, linseed oil, the typical vehicle
or binder of oil painting medium.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.670
And some solvent, some mineral spirits,
that's to do a couple of things.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.390
First of all, it's to make it a lot
thinner on the brush, a lot faster, and here

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.320
I am getting sloppy,
this is just the beginning, you'll see.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.880
To make the viscosity lower,
to cut that viscosity.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.860
Another role of that combination
is to make it glossy, and shiny and these

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.920
wonderful fluid
paints that de Kooning worked with are often

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.110
extremely glossy in character.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.930
Okay, so here's the second
color of my palette here.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.200
Kind of a murky,
mean looking skin tone here.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200
I like this.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.421
This is going to look really nice when
contrasting with some really hot colors, some

00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:07.850
nice warm red colors.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.200
So let's make one of them.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.810
going to be working with
cadmium red hue here.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.519
Any time you see that word hue that means
well, you cheaped out a little bit.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.320
Cadmium is a heavy metal, it's expensive.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.500
Cadmium red hue is an organic,
read cheap, substitute for it.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.320
Now, it's okay because the hue
of that color is going to be exactly the same

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320
as cadmium.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.630
In other words, gorgeous,
stop sign red, or Coca Cola red.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.980
We're going to add a little
of linseed oil, and then we're going to add

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.980
some water.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.120
You're thinking whoa,
whoa wait a minute water and linseed oil,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.430
what is this guy doing?

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.650
Well, de Kooning liked to violate
these rules because he liked to have really

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.600
interesting paint textures,
sometimes frothing up on the surface.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.190
Now, because I've mixed water and oil, you
can see this texture

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.280
is an unhappy texture.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.810
It's really not a solution as
much as it is a suspension.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.250
In other words, it's just a physical
mixture of these things that don't like each

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.600
other,
they don't play nicely together.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.120
But this weird alligator skin kind of
texture here is going to be really active

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.740
and
really interesting on our surface.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.740
Let's make some nice
hot light yellow color.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.720
And since we already have a little
bit of white going, let's add to it.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.780
And now to this one I'm going
to add just mineral spirits.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.320
No additional vehicle or binder this time.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.190
Just some solvent,
a fair amount of it in fact.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.080
Then the reason I'm doing this,
is that I want this paint to quite thin,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.700
thinner than the paints we've made so far.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.810
Now when you add binder to a paint,
in this case, that's linseed oil, you make

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.030
it more
transparent and you cut the viscosity.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.840
When you add solvent to the paint, mineral
spirits here,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.040
you make it more into a stain.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.650
It doesn't have any additional gloss like
linseed oil will provide, but it really makes

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.550
it incredibly low viscosity,
so it'll absorb into the ground or even sometimes

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.990
the under paint layer that
is beneath it, so what you have left with

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.360
is a super thin application of really
fast, really runny, consistency of paint.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.830
What I'm going to do to speed
up this process a little bit is just to transfer

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.360
this into a mixing bowl.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.590
Just out of convenience.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.610
This is going to help me blend this
paint a little faster, a little better, a

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.230
little stronger, so it's not
splashing all over the studio floor.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:41.910
And if you can hear that sound, that's
what a de Kooning painting sounds like, liquid,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.919
fluid, runny, kind of,
wonderful viscous kind of materials.

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.639
Okay, so we have a nice pallet going here.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.230
Let's move to the easel.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:01.139
Okay, so large format canvass, a little
small here, but roughly human scale here.

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.169
Interesting to note,
that recent research at Guggenheim Museum

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.160
on a painting
by de Kooning from the 1970s, 1975, if I'm

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.470
not mistaken,
called Who's Name Was Writ on Water.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.139
We looked at that painting, an abstract
painting, in infrared light and actually found

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.200
an under drawing.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.230
Now, usually an under drawing is made and
then a painter exactly paints over that

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.930
drawing but, of course, for an improvised,
gestural abstract painting,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.330
why would you use an under drawing?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.370
It's actually akin to a dancer
warming up before performing.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.610
It's a way to get loose.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.900
It's a way to stretch, to get limber.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.820
And to kind of rehearse some of
the same physical gestures that you're about

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.770
to perform, not with a drawing tool,
but with a loaded brush.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.710
Now, before I start to warm
up with that under drawing, I'm going to sand

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.710
the support.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.139
And this time I'm using some
very rough sandpaper, 40 grade.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:55.420
This is the stuff that if you
rubbed on your own hand would hurt.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.229
And what I want to do is, basically
make this canvas very absorbent, rub off any

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:11.690
sheen so that my paint is going to
be nice and roughly attached to it.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:18.970
[SOUND] And now I'm going to get lose a little
bit, warm up on the canvas here, and start

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.740
thinking about some of the gestural marks
that I will be performing with oil paint.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.310
But now just kind of, I get use to that
idea, get use to those range of motions.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:40.779
But now, with charcoal.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:09:51.610
[SOUND] [SOUND] [SOUND] All right, a good
time to step back from

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.430
the painting and take a look.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.459
And this is actually really important and
underestimated aspect of de

00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:59.050
Kooning's approach to painting.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.490
We all think about these
explosive moments, these active moments of

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.079
painting and
you just witnessed some.

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:10.029
But really, de Kooning alternated those
with some very long, very patient, very critical

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:13.679
periods of careful
looking at his paintings and trying to understand

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.269
what
the painting wanted to do next.

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:19.369
Because this is really not the kind
of painting that you can push around.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.269
It's one that you really
need to listen to.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:24.149
So what I'm looking at,
when I'm seeing this painting, are a couple

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:26.959
things that are working and
a lot of things that aren't.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.560
What's really sticking
in my eye first of all, is this very artificial

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.740
line
coming straight down here.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:37.149
Now, when I was painting, that didn't even
occur to me, I was so close to the canvas.

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:42.610
But stepping back, there is a very
linear element of all these different gestural

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.579
marks aligning in a vertical way,
this is artificial and it looks bad.

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.319
It catches the eye in an aggressive way.

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:52.110
Similarly, there's a little bit too much
parallel stuff that's going on here.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.800
Although there are some nice moments of
paints mixing, wet in wet into each other.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.199
Some of these really nice color
combinations working here.

00:11:00.199 --> 00:11:03.990
This, kind of,
beautiful mark here, wet in wet, blue into

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.600
it's complement yellow,
some gorgeous mark making.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.319
Also, there are very flat planes of
color that need to be worked in.

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:14.040
But, essentially, what you saw me do in that
first step

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.160
here, is to knock out all the white.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.899
To start bringing this painting forward,
in space, together, to really understand

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:22.620
what is going to happen next.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.399
Now, it's also really important to
understand that in de Kooning's painting technique,

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:31.899
there's as much
subtraction of the painted material, as there

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.899
is addition.

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:37.410
In other words, a lot of the marks
that are made in the finished product are

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.470
a function of labor, of putting paint
on, scrapping it or smearing it back off.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:52.560
So let's get into some
of those activities now.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:12:04.279
[SOUND] And already, what you see me do there,
is edit out some of the areas

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:06.489
that I didn't like, that I thought were weaker.

00:12:06.489 --> 00:12:09.220
Wow, they just got a lot stronger for
a couple of reasons.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.600
First of all, colors are mixing
in a really interesting way.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.670
Look at this chaos here, gorgeous.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.629
Also, bringing back
the drawing into the equation.

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:21.300
Skinning, flaying some of the white of the
canvas here and giving us some transitions

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.949
between thickly painted, thinly painted,
opaque, translucent, luscious, fat paint,

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:30.380
glossy, and dry,
scratched kind of texture here.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.490
All of these variables here that we're
exploiting are really going to allow this

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:41.300
painting to come together as a whole.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.050
Another technique that de Kooning would
use is to take some turpentine, or in our

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:50.259
case, some mineral spirits, on a
rag and just scrub back into the surface.

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:59.050
And this is really going to remove paint
and also make the paint bleed together, very

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.370
aggressively.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.759
[SOUND]
And already the painting is way more active,

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:08.720
way more alive, way more variety going on.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.119
Now, there are areas now that
are bothering me that didn't bother me a minute

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:14.119
ago.

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:16.699
The reason is,
I just attacked the problems, but guess what,

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:17.699
now there are new problems.

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:21.040
These problems weren't as
strong as the original set, but now they're

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.689
the strongest ones left,
so time to attack them, too.

00:13:27.689 --> 00:13:33.879
[NOISE] Wow, and now we have a nice start
to a painting.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:38.899
What before looks red or
spare and artificial, almost hackneyed or

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.079
almost sarcastic.

00:13:40.079 --> 00:13:44.160
Now we're starting to really embrace
with the physicality of the medium and things

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.009
are starting to happen.

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:51.720
de Kooning was a huge fan of really,
really long brushes.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.149
This is a pretty long brush,
it's a 35 brush size, here.

00:13:56.149 --> 00:14:00.139
But de Kooning had brushes that literally
were as tall as I am, six feet tall, something

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:01.139
like that.

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:05.399
The reason was, he liked to be
painting on a canvas from a distance.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:06.399
Why?

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:10.749
Because he wanted to have this global
perspective over the work while he was working.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:14.369
I'm going to do my best
approximation here and start painting from

00:14:14.369 --> 00:14:15.930
arm's length anyway.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.769
Remember, that de Kooning is taking
advantage of this distance, but from even

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:23.699
further back to really
understand how the entire painting is evolving

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:37.499
as he's adding or
subtracting gestural marks to it.

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:42.220
Some of this accepted chaos, as this drip
is just cascading down the surface here, is

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.310
how some of the most beautiful
marks evolve in de Kooning's work.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.939
Now one thing that will tend
to happen when working with so much alla prima

00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:52.550
technique,
or wet in wet technique, as I'm working with

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.470
here, is that your
oil paints will gradually get muddy.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.630
And, in fact, if you've gotten
this far into your de Kooning, you may have

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.600
already lost it
in some very dark colors.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.129
Now, there are two ways to rectify that.

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:05.170
One, scrape it off.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.830
This is the wonderful thing about
oil painting, you don't like it, well, get

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.830
rid of it.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.670
Number two, you can wait for
that paint to dry.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.089
Now, this is oil paint,
it's going to take awhile.

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:19.690
We're using a really high quantity of oil
that makes the drying time even longer.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.259
But when that paint does dry, well then you
can work in

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:25.040
any color you want over top.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.170
Because since this paint is already dark,
if I add, well this kind of magenta color

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.851
to it, it's going to stay that dark and
I'm going to lose this lovely magenta hue.

00:15:33.851 --> 00:15:38.660
If this dries first, that will not
happen since they won't blend together.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.980
It's often said of de Kooning,
that he never finished a painting, just sometimes

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.359
his paintings
escaped from the studio.

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:48.300
He was relentless in his editing going
back and forth and back and forth.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.019
And speaking of back and forth, he also
alternated between activities of not only

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:56.980
painting and looking, but
between painting and drawing, and then back

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.589
to painting again and
then back to drawing again.

00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:04.769
So let's do some more gestural
mark making with a hard tool, in fact, soft

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:05.769
charcoal here.

00:16:05.769 --> 00:16:09.689
Now, when drawing into wet paint,
you lose your mark quickly but you begin to

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:15.299
gouge into the surface and
some interesting things can happen.

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:20.499
[SOUND] So these little bits of
charcoal that are left there, you'll often

00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:23.189
find in de
Kooning's paintings.

00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:27.369
When the paint is completely dry, that charcoal
remains

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:29.089
embedded into the surface.

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:32.100
Now, how to think about
what kind of marks to make?

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.059
I'm thinking as much about the mark
I'm making as I am my own body, and how I'm

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:37.059
moving in space.

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:41.290
For example, I see there's some kind of
residue of this kind of a mark, a down and

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.540
then back up, so
I'm going to reenact this mark now, but with

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.519
a hard tool rather
than that wide fluid brush.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:55.299
And you can see that the edge here is
far sharper than anything I did before, as

00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:01.220
that's the point where the elbow
is driving back up off the canvas.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:07.569
What I'm trying to do,
is to enmesh all of these marks so they don't

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.730
look like individual planes of
color, but they start to wrap together.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.730
So what you can see is
that I pulled this color, not only combining

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.189
with this
maroon purplish color, but I brought it back

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:21.870
into the canvas,
commingling with some other colors here.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.610
But also starting to highlight that
beige tone, which is found scattered throughout

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.850
this entire painting now,
which ties things together visually and allows

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:36.840
these to exist in the same space,
rather than all these interdependent, or I should say independent kind of

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.350
tectonic plates of color
sliding over each other.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.100
Now they're becoming
enmeshed in each other, since you see that

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.780
color
throughout the work.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.409
Following that same logic, I have
a lot of the yellow on the left hand side

00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:49.250
of the painting,
especially at the bottom.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.960
None on the right, none at the top.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.160
Well, let's take care of that.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.080
And I think this is a good
time to call it quits.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.520
Now, let's talk about how this painting
can grow, since, in all honesty, no exaggeration,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.799
paintings stayed
in de Kooning's studio for sometimes two years

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.640
as he
actively worked on them.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.000
So, of course, when looking at
this painting, it looks thin, it looks simple

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.169
compared to a de Kooning,
for a couple reasons.

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:41.770
This is all done alla prima,
it's all done wet in wet.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.230
And really de Kooning alternated periods
of working wet in wet within working wet over

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.429
dry and having some harsh,
scraped kind of marks here, but, because it’s

00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:53.620
wet,
it starts to all mix together.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.769
de Kooning would build up these
heavily encrusted surfaces so that by the

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.830
end of them,
they're two inches thick full of paint.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.210
They're very heavy paintings,
physically, to carry around.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.309
But as you can see here, really, as much paint
comes off of

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:11.080
this painting as goes back on.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.909
Really get involved in this process,
not only the physical process of painting,

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:18.760
but this back and
forth looking, analyzing, and then diving

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.269
back into the action
painting phase of the work.

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:26.741
So here we have a very promising, but
a very brief start, to a painting that, in

00:19:26.741 --> 00:19:30.240
de Kooning style, should really
be allowed to grow in the studio for a month,

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.269
if not really a year.
