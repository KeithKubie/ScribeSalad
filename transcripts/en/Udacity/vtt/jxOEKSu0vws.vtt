Okay, let's do a quick demo, remember when we played around

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.230
on Telnet in Unit One to, to manipulate Web servers directly? I'm

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.540
going to go ahead and do that here, and we can look

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.485
at some more HTTP headers. So, if I were to Telnet to

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:14.560
google.com, you know, port 80, as we've been doing. So, we

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.130
do our HTTP request to get the front page remember our host

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.930
header. We see our results, we scroll up to the top of

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.220
this, we can our our header. So here's the request I made,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.100
and here are the headers and here are a couple set cookie

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.450
headers. So in this one, this sets a cookie named pref, to

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.230
this value and it's actually Google's doing a very typical Google thing,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.570
and storing multiple pieces of data in one cookie. So this is

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.390
the equal sign that's part of the cookie header, and this equal

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.290
sign is actually part of the cookie value. This is the end

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.720
of the cookie value here, we've got a semicolon and then we

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.380
have some extra parameters that we haven't talked about yet. We have

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.640
an expires time, and this is when the cookie expires. So after this date, April

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.980
19th, 2014, this cookie will no longer be

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.750
sent and this cookie is relative or relevant

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.450
to the path slash so you can restrict cookies to specific paths and this cookie

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.450
is specific to google.com. So this basically means

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.270
that anybody at google.com will receive this cookie.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620
Here is a, another, another cookie this one's called NID. And

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.160
you know, you can see the value comes all the way

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.410
down here, to the first semicolon. Expires time of its own

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.520
a path, a domain, some extra constraints. This cookie's only and relevant

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.840
to http which, which, is, is just another, another cookie Option

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.880
you have at your disposal. I want to show you one quick thing

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.440
while we're in the terminal here. If you're on a Mac

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.398
or Linux you can use the Curl Cmd which is pretty cool.

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:44.800
Say, curl -I, which basically says, get me the headers.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.180
curl -I google.com, and that'll just run the headers. I'm

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.650
not going to quiz you on that, but if you're on

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.320
a Unix machine, you can use Curl instead of Telnet, and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.600
you don't have to type so fast and type so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.540
much stuff. So anyway, curl -I, handy little tool for

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.030
viewing HTTP headers. I'll show you one last way to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.650
inspect cookies this may not work for everybody, but it's another

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.240
neat experiment. Your on in Chrome I'm in you know special

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.440
private browsing mode which is what all this is talking about. Basically

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.210
I'm in the Private browsing mode because I'd, I don't want to have

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.880
any cookies, and that's generally what this Private browsing modes do, is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.750
they throw away all your cookies. So I'm going to, I'm going to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.980
do something here, I've open up to the Bug tools in Chrome,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.890
this are in Developer tools that are built in the Chrome, you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.790
can Google around for, how to show this in Chrome or you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.460
know Safari and Internet Explorer also have, a similar feature so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.980
you can kind of watch requests. And I'm going to go to google.com

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.160
and on here I can see all of the requests we

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.060
made at google.com and one thing I can do is I can

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.980
actually view the headers. We can actually view the request header

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.520
I made for Google.com and you can see we, we sent some

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.990
various headers. We didn't send any cookies, cause we don't have any.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.360
And if we scroll down a little bit, we can see you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.110
know one of the cookies that got set, right here. This

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.150
is one of the cookie headers, so that cookie. If we

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.250
were to reload this page now, our browser, Chrome here, has

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.680
stored this cookie. If we were to load this page, we should

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.650
see a new request header, I will do that now. I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.710
have reloaded the page and now we see the request we made

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.460
for the google.com the request has a cookie header and this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.610
says the exact same context as the sec cookie. Well at least

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.370
the name here, and the value is the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.630
same. You don't have to resend Path and Domain

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.240
and all those other Options, those are just

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.160
for the browser to know when to send the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.280
cookie. If, if, if you're feeling adventurous, you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.430
can find a, a Debug mode in your browser

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.860
and experiment with this sort of stuff. It's kind

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.550
of, it's kind of neat to see what's there.
