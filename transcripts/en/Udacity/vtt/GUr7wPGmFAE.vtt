00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.190
The trait of red green color blindness in the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
pedigree that we looked at earlier, we've now characterized

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.640
as an allele on the OPN1LW gene, an allele

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.020
that's recessive and a loss of function. Now we noted

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.626
in the pedigree that red green color blindness. Is

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:18.630
a sex-linked trait, in this case. And that the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.510
gene OPN1LW is on the X chromosome. And based

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.640
on what you know about an X-linked trait, would it

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.560
even be possible for females to be affected

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.820
by the C739T allele of the OPN1LW gene?
