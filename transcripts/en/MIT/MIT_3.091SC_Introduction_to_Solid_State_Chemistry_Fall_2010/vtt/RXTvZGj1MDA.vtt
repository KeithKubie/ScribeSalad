00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.830
SAL: Hi.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.340
I'm Sal.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.720
Today we're going to be solving
problem one of exam

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.790
three of fall 2009.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.680
Now before you attempt the
problem, there's a couple of

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.040
things that you should know or
have background knowledge of

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.000
these materials before
starting.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.760
First thing is understanding
the properties of crystal

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.820
defects and for this problem
particularly, Frenkel defects,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.800
which we'll talk about.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.420
The formula, which is an
Arrhenius relationship, as a

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.340
function of temperature and
energy enthalpy of the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.880
fraction of vacancies that are
formed in a crystal and the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.420
conversion again between
one electron

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.440
volt and to the joule.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.730
This will help you solve
the problem.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.130
So the problem reads
as follows.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.520
Silver bromide, which
is AgBr, has rock

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.440
salt crystal structure.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.800
So it's an FCC Bravais lattice
with the ion pair Ag plus and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.320
the Br as the basis--

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.920
Br minus the basis.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.840
The dominant defect in AgBr
or silver bromide

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.300
is the Frenkel disorder.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.050
So it's telling you what the
dominant defective is.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.570
So the question asks, for part
A, so I'll put A here.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.860
Part A for the question asks,
does the Frenkel disorder in

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.520
silver bromide create vacancies
of silver plus,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.020
vacancies or Br minus or both?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.220
Explain.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.830
Dionic radii are 0.67 Angstroms
for silver plus and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.390
1.96 Angstroms for
bromine minus.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.740
So that's data that's
given to us.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.820
I'm going to go ahead
and write that down.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.180
So I know from reading about
point defects and crystals

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.380
that a Frenkel defect is pretty
much formed when you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
have an ion pair of
dissimilar sizes.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.710
So if one of the radii--

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.300
like, say, your anion is a lot
bigger than the radius of your

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.980
cation, then one should expect
that you would have a Frenkel

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.670
defect to form.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.680
And what a Frankel defect is--
which you should know from

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.020
reading the material--

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.070
is that it's when one of the
ions in your crystal leaves

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.260
and leaves back a vacancy--

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.470
so just migrates--

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.730
just hops out of its lattice
site and leaves back empty

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.020
spaces, which is called
a vacancy.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.200
So we're given two things.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.660
If I draw a little picture--

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:03.550
I can call this my silver and
I'll call this my bromine.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.670
And I'm given the fact that the
radius of Ag plus is equal

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.570
to 0.67 Angstroms--

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.200
and an Angstrom is just 10
to the minus 10 meters--

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.280
very small number.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.850
And I'm also given the radius of
bromine, the anion, is 1.96

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.240
Angstroms. Now I would argue
that these two have very

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940
dissimilar radii.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.010
Obviously, the bromine looks to
be about three times bigger

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.450
than your silver.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.130
So by understanding the
definition of a Frenkel

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.950
defect, I can claim that I would
expect the smaller ion

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.680
of the two to be the one that
leaves the vacancy behind,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.730
hence forms the Frenkel
defect.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.400
So for part A, do I expect
it to create silver plus

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.520
vacancies or Br minus
vacancies or both?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.370
I would expect just to be silver
plus, given the size of

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.860
your cation.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:26.130
So if you were to write on this
problem, just expect only

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.370
Ag plus, which is your silver
cation, or the smaller one.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:50.380
Expect Ag plus smaller ion to
create a vacancy and hence,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.770
this leads to the
Frenkel defect.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.240
So yes, I should expect it
to form a defect now.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:11.430
If I was given a cation that had
a similar radius that I--

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.330
I wouldn't know if I could argue
the fact that this will

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.350
form a Frenkel defect or not
because the conditions are

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.570
that you have to have the
similar radius between your

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.680
cation and your atom--

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.880
and it makes sense because
the fact that

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.790
your silver is small--

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.070
it has more freedom
to hop around.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.420
So it requires less energy for
this smaller atom to then

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.680
start hopping around your
lattice site without penalty

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.240
or without major penalty
compared to your bromine ion.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.000
So therefore, this is the
one that should be

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.180
expected to form that.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.640
OK.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.580
So that's part A.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.140
And part B reads--

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.000
calculate the temperature at
which the fraction of Frenkel

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.850
defects in a crystal with silver
bromide exceeds one

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.690
part per billion.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.600
The enthalpy of Frankel defects
and formation, delta h

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.960
sub f, has a value of 1.16
electron volts per defect.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.220
And the entropic pre-factor
A has a value of 3.091.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.440
So it's giving you data.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.370
Now the way I would solve this
problem is that the first

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.780
thing I would do is that
I would write down

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.880
what my data is.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:28.400
So I'll call this data and the
first thing is that our

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.270
fraction of vacancies that are
formed in silver bromide is

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.670
one part per billion--

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.540
so 10 to the -9.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.690
That's a fraction so no units.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.500
The second thing that we're
given in the problem is that

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.320
our energy of formation--

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.390
our enthalpy energy--

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:54.960
is 1.16 electron volts
per defect.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.770
This is the energy penalty for
every time one of your silver

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.270
cations jumps out of sight
to create that.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.270
Nothing is free.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.240
Everything requires energy.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.090
We're also given the fact
that A, the entropic

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.620
pre-factor, is 3.091--

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.510
with no units--

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.680
and given our equation
that I showed you

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.250
on the bullet point.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.170
That you should know--

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.160
you can go ahead and
see what's missing.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.570
So if I write down
my equation--

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.390
this is all--

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.080
I'll box this off as my data
because I'm going to refer to

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.280
this to solve the problem.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.880
And the problem talks
about temperature.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:45.450
So I know that f sub v is
going to equal to the

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.003
pre-factor times the exponent
of negative delta h, of

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:55.990
formation over kb t.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.895
Now you notice that kb wasn't
given to you and kb is both in

00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:01.040
its constant.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.230
Now a lot of student forget
that they have a table of

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.820
contents in front of them and
that value is in there.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.510
So if you don't know it by
heart, then you want to make

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.870
sure that you reference to that
table because a lot of

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.570
information will be given to
you, because you're expected

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.513
to look at the table
of contents or

00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:19.830
your periodic table.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.490
But if I include this
as my data--

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.340
I'm going to go ahead and
write it over here--

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.760
that kb--

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:37.350
half the value of 1.38 times
10 to the -23 and this has

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:42.020
units of joules for
degree Kelvin.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.700
So this is something that you
should pay particular

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.940
attention to because now kb is
in joules for Kelvin, but our

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.200
energy was given in
electron volts.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.270
Now this is the number
one thing that

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.770
will take off points.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.490
You'll get points taken off if
you don't notice this-- that

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.040
you need to go ahead and do the
conversion from electron

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.540
volts to joules or joules
to electron volts.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.500
Either which way, you're going
to get the answer.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.800
But the problem asks, calculate
the temperature.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.210
The very first sentence.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.040
So what does that mean?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.880
Well, I'm going to go ahead and
look at my equation and

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.620
I'm going to look at the data
that I have and the constants

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.800
and see if I'm missing
anything else because

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.010
obviously you can't solve an
equation that has two unknowns

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.290
and just one equation.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.100
Solve the equation, you've got
to only have one unknown for

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.280
the equation.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.320
So f sub v--

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.830
no.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.530
Check--

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:32.860
no.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.310
That's given.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.620
Is A given?

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.430
It's right here.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.520
That's given as well.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.640
What about delta A sub F?

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.100
Well, that's the energy--

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.870
the energy penalty to create a
defect and kb, which we got

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.740
from our table of
contents, and t.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.340
So this concludes that the only
thing we're not given is

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.730
temperature because that's what
we're asked to solve.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.580
So I need to do some math on
here to go ahead and solve for

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.220
temperature.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.670
And the first thing I want to do
is take the natural log of

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.550
both sides.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.270
So by taking the natural
log of both sides--

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.710
so natural log of f sub v--

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:20.210
this equals to natural log of A
plus the natural log of the

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:27.260
exponent part and we know from
math that the natural log of

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.510
an exponent cancels each other
out because they're inverses.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:37.740
So the natural log of exponent,
of negative delta h

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.860
sub f, over kb t--

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.870
this cancels that and we just
get the natural log of A plus

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.700
negative because you have
a negative up here--

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.900
delta h of formation
divided by kb t.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.600
So the only thing we don't
know here is temperature.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.320
So if I can rearrange this
equation and solve for

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.480
temperature, I can
get an answer.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.552
So if I do that--

00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:11.940
what's the best way
of doing that?

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.150
Well.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.900
I can add--

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.770
I can move this to the other
side and move this to the

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:23.780
other side and that gives me
delta h sub f divided by kb t

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.800
equals natural log of A minus
natural log of your vacancy

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:36.990
fraction and I can then multiply
both sides by t so it

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.580
cancels this one and it arrives
over here and then

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.150
divide both sides
by ln of this.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.360
So I'll go ahead and do that.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.680
So I'll multiply this by t.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.120
Multiply that by t.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:58.990
So that cancel that and I end up
having delta hf over kb t--

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.790
the t got canceled--

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:06.740
this equals to the natural log
of A minus the natural log of

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.490
your vacancy fraction times t.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:15.940
So now if I divide both sides
by this factor, I solve for

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.490
temperature.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:29.320
So this gives me an isolation
that t ends up being delta hf

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:39.245
over kb times the natural log of
A minus the natural log of

00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:41.160
the vacancy fraction.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.460
Now all we have to do is plug in
the numbers, but again, if

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.260
you look at the units of
Boltzmann's constant, which

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.750
are joules per Kelvin and the
value that we're given up here

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.640
is electron volts for defect,
we want to go ahead and

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.200
convert the electron volt to the
joule because it'll just

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.910
be easier to do the
math that way.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:06.110
So I can go ahead and write
it out and I do that by

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.470
multiplying the top by that
conversion factor and if I do

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.170
the math, t ends up being--

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.580
we have 1.16 of this--

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:29.090
has units of electron volts for
defect and then I want to

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.400
get joules because that's what
Boltzmann's constant has.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.730
So in order to get joules,
if I multiply this by the

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.980
conversion factor which is
1.6 times 10 to the -19--

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.770
this has units of joules
per electron volt.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.540
Now the electron volts
cancel and I get--

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.810
the numerator has units
of joules per defect.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.000
That's good because that's going
to cancel with the units

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.130
in Boltzmann's constant.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:02.860
And then I put in 1.38
times 10 to the -23--

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.500
this is joules per Kelvin--

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:19.840
and this factor is multiplied
by the natural log of 3.091

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:26.920
minus the natural log
of 10 to the -9.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.900
So unitless--

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.700
so if you do the math out, you
end up getting a value that at

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.490
the end of the day,
your temperature--

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.790
this t right here--

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.070
will be equal to--

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.810
let's go ahead and write
it over here.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.670
So now that we go ahead
and do the math--

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.020
that way it's nice and clean.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.940
We know that the t, the
temperature that we got from

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.950
plugging all that math--

00:14:53.950 --> 00:15:00.340
ends up being just 615 Kelvin.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.630
And where did the Kelvin
come from?

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.570
Well, it came from your joules
per Kelvin, from your

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.290
Boltzmann's constant, because
that's what the dimensional

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.880
analysis does.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.650
So this is the answer.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.330
This is good.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:17.870
The problem doesn't say show the
answer in degrees Celsius,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.040
but since everybody knows
degrees Celsius--

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.260
everybody in science relies
on degrees Celsius--

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.300
you can just convert this over
to degrees Celsius, which

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.830
happens to be 342
degrees Celsius.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.740
So this right here is your
answer to part B.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.020
And again, I want to express
again that the crucial part in

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.750
getting this is knowing the
fact that you're given an

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:51.000
energy in electron volts, but
the constant that you use has

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.500
units of joules.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:59.080
So you need to convert to get
the right unit out or else you

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.930
will get not Kelvin--

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.180
you would get something
different here, which wouldn't

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.850
make any sense given the
question that was asked.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.600
So with that, again I advise
that-- always read

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.760
the problem in detail.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.760
Look at the units that you're
working with and make the

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.050
appropriate conversions because
everything should be

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.280
on your table of contents.
