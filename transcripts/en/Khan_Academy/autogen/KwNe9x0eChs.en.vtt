00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:01.757
 In this video I will tell 

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:05.885
 for the processes that make up the whole life, 

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:07.373
 as we know it. 

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.868
 Its most important component is metabolism. 

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:13.561
 Metabolism. 

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.603
 It is a process of energy absorption in various forms, 

00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:19.436
 in which it is transformed into building elements, 

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.678
 and then forms these elements in ways that are useful to us - 

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.050
 useful for energy, for our structure, 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.006
 thanks to which we can actually live, 

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.751
 to grow, to reproduce 

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.802
 and coexist with our environment. 

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.661
 Now we'll meet you 

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.962
 with a series of examples related to metabolism. 

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:41.161
 Metabolism in its essence represents two different processes. 

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.582
 Degradation of substances 

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.248
 to simpler ones, in which 

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:47.704
 energy is released, 

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.186
 is called catabolism. 

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:52.409
 Catabolism. 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.473
 This is the decomposition of the substances. 

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:57.490
 Once we have degraded the substances, 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.215
 we are ready to absorb them, 

00:00:59.215 --> 00:01:01.070
 as this will contribute to fabrication and renewal of tissues, 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.031
 which is actually anabolism. 

00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:06.996
 Anabolism. 

00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:11.094
 Anabolism, with emphasis on and. 

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:12.485
 An example of how to imagine it is, 

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.405
 imagining that someone has built something with a Lego constructor - 

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.644
 and we also want to build something with Lego. 

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.331
 Okay, we're going to Lego the constructor 

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.968
 and we want to dismantle it, 

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.142
 but not completely. 

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:24.260
 For example, we will not get to the point where we melt the plastic. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.658
 We will disassemble it in its separate parts 

00:01:26.658 --> 00:01:28.409
 and then we will build it again 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.211
 in what form we actually want. 

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:33.385
 And we may not even have to disassemble it 

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.178
 all of his Lego parts. 

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.414
 You may even have built elements in the first built Lego Palace, 

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:41.602
 which are useful to us. 

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.642
 So let's think now how it all starts. 

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:48.934
 The exciting thing here is that it all started 

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:53.657
 or starting from the stars, from the synthesis processes in the stars. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.766
 And here is a star image, 

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.227
 a very familiar star for us. 

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:00.896
 It is the Sun. 

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:03.289
 Maybe you do not realize the sun 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.324
 is just one of perhaps a few stars, 

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:08.539
 which are an important part of and for our existence. 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.423
 The sun is the most direct source of energy for us 

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:12.901
 for the greater part of the life we ​​know. 

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.709
 There are some types of bacteria 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.624
 and organisms that can live away from sunlight 

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:19.580
 at the bottom of the ocean, due to the heat that is given there, 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.373
 but the Sun remains our main source of energy. 

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:25.168
 If I claim that other stars may be sources of energy, 

00:02:25.168 --> 00:02:28.243
 including dead stars that have been in existence for billions of years, 

00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:31.085
 that is because I take into account the complex elements we have created 

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.267
 or those who are among us in the environment 

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.919
 such as carbon, oxygen and so on, 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.924
 generally anything other than hydrogen 

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.346
 is constructed from synthesis processes of hydrogen 

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:43.403
 inside the stars. 

00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:47.762
 So we're really made of stardust. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.585
 And here we are, we are on Earth. 

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.992
 Earth is all this condensed matter 

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:54.891
 four and a half million years. 

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.649
 Probably, some supernova holds all this powder, 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.355
 who built a previous star, 

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:03.501
 to merge this way, and so radiation is formed. 

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:05.187
 So energy from the Sun also arises. 

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:07.930
 And once again, this energy comes from synthesis processes 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.993
 and is what makes the simpler elements into more sophisticated, 

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:14.253
 so the Sun also builds more sophisticated elements, 

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:15.536
 but this energy, 

00:03:15.536 --> 00:03:18.194
 this energy is making its way to the Earth. 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.363
 And so the organisms are formed 

00:03:21.363 --> 00:03:24.908
 such as plants that use solar energy, 

00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:28.035
 to convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds, 

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.147
 food, we would say, 

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.745
 which will eventually reach us. 

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.686
 And this process, which you may be aware of, 

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.474
 is called photosynthesis. 

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.689
 And now we will discuss some more in-depth details. 

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.823
 Synthesis. 

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.781
 As the photo word suggests in photosynthesis 

00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.923
 the main elements of light are transformed 

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.358
 and there is one thing I like to ask people about, 

00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:50.312
 when they first encounter the term photosynthesis, 

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:51.995
 namely that we can see how grass grows 

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.283
 or how wheat grows, 

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:54.902
 or how a tree grows, 

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:57.210
 but where do these elements come from? 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.728
 And the most common answer is e- 

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.342
 "Somehow comes from the ground" 

00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:03.146
 there are some nutrients that keep their origin from the ground, 

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.492
 but it's actually a carbon fix 

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:07.054
 and we will talk a lot about it, 

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:09.665
 especially in the carbon cycle. 

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:13.244
 Generally there is carbon dioxide in the air, 

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:14.932
 so there is carbon 

00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:17.142
 there is, I will just write it in the following way. 

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:19.483
 There is carbon dioxide in the air 

00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.908
 and what photosynthesis allows plants to do, 

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:26.954
 is to convert carbon into carbon dioxide 

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:28.402
 and form compounds with it, 

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.426
 turning it from gaseous to solid, 

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:34.736
 in glucose molecules, then use this glucose, 

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:38.759
 to build cellulose and other forms of starch 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.228
 and whatever else. 

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:42.549
 So he uses the molecules that are in the air ... 

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.508
 I will draw them here ... 

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.555
 Uses these molecules, 

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:48.103
 who are in the air, 

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:51.399
 and solar energy to fix them 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.831
 and in fact to form compounds 

00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.307
 between carbon and other substances. 

00:04:57.307 --> 00:04:58.936
 As we have said, we are built mainly of carbon and hydrogen 

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:00.451
 and we have oxygen inside, 

00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.603
 but we are able to form these elements. 

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.883
 And now other living organisms, 

00:05:05.883 --> 00:05:07.563
 which are the simplest single-celled organisms, 

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:08.723
 such as bacteria, 

00:05:08.723 --> 00:05:10.288
 and any other types of building blocks. 

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:13.174
 I remind you, you know that photosynthesis 

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:16.777
 is not just a process involving light and carbon dioxide. 

00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:19.840
 It also includes water. 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.403
 So water is also involved in this process. 

00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:24.909
 Water also participates. 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.821
 We therefore have carbon dioxide, 

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:30.501
 CO2, sunlight and water. 

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.436
 Thanks to these elements, nutrients are supplied to the Earth. 

00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:38.407
 And from this can be build substances such as 

00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:40.514
 for example plant substances, 

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:41.928
 which use solar energy 

00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:44.813
 and are a building block of some foods like bread, 

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:47.708
 and there are also other animals that eat some things 

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:51.038
 like lawns, and later begin to degrade them 

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:54.351
 in their own way, accompanied by bacteria 

00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.053
 and then these nutrients begin to be contained 

00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:59.199
 in the cow, in the milk. 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.912
 And what this cow does, 

00:06:00.912 --> 00:06:03.187
 is to metabolize this grass. 

00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:05.890
 It can break it down, 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.237
 to lead different molecules in the grass to catabolism or decay 

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.529
 and turn them into building blocks, 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.205
 which will then build the cow, 

00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:17.604
 milk and everything else. 

00:06:17.604 --> 00:06:20.603
 And maybe you're wondering exactly what these molecules are, 

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:23.122
 which we continue to degrade, 

00:06:23.122 --> 00:06:25.056
 and then we rebuild them again. 

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:27.339
 These are carbohydrates. 

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:29.941
 Carbohydrates, 

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:31.275
 and you will also see most of the molecules, 

00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:32.622
 for which I intend to speak. 

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:34.888
 Honestly, they are all part of the nutritional content on the back of the pack, 

00:06:34.888 --> 00:06:36.671
 because that tells us what's inside the food. 

00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.591
 What nutrients will exchange your body through metabolism, 

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:39.566
 when he eats that, 

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.572
 what's behind the pack? 

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.401
 Carbohydrates are either just sugars 

00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:48.156
 such as glucose or fructose, 

00:06:48.156 --> 00:06:51.494
 or polymers of these sugars, which are called 

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.544
 polysaccharides. 

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.357
 It may be starch, 

00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:57.158
 made of many elements. 

00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:00.705
 Or many other different types of simple sugars. 

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:02.462
 We could talk about lipids. 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.468
 Lipids. 

00:07:04.468 --> 00:07:07.547
 Therefore, fatty acids, we could also talk about cholesterol. 

00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:09.507
 These are important elements, 

00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:10.872
 which are also essential for 

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:12.575
 series of biochemical reactions 

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.895
 in the cage, 

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:16.375
 another such element is the protein. 

00:07:16.672 --> 00:07:17.868
 These are 

00:07:18.256 --> 00:07:20.072
 proteins made of amino acids. 

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:22.179
 Sometimes people claim that the reason why we need proteins 

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.721
 is because it contains amino acids. 

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.304
 And so we can degrade these proteins, 

00:07:26.304 --> 00:07:27.781
 to get our amino acids and digest them 

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.208
 in the form of new proteins. 

00:07:29.557 --> 00:07:32.000
 Proteins and amino acids. 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:34.252
 And all these substances are present 

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:37.218
 in food, 

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:38.335
 the food we eat, 

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:39.769
 which we consume 

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:41.255
 and whose substances are then metabolized by metabolism. 

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:44.381
 First, the catabolism process is carried out and we break down the substances, 

00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.228
 then we use these building blocks, 

00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:48.014
 to absorb them. 

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:51.073
 And so at the end of the day these substances provide the building blocks, 

00:07:51.073 --> 00:07:53.423
 which make up our bodies. 

00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:55.598
 They allow us to interact with the environment 

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.647
 and provide us with energy, 

00:07:57.956 --> 00:07:59.959
 which energy at the end of the day, 

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:03.292
 is formed due to the presence of the molecule, 

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:05.937
 called ATP. 

00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.168
 Here you can see the depicted ATP molecule. 

00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:11.541
 Adenosine triphosphate. 

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:14.672
 And the answer to why ATP is the molecule containing it 

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:17.643
 energy-rich connections is in the three phosphate groups. 

00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:19.463
 It contains these three phosphate groups, 

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:22.117
 for which we have a whole video 

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:24.705
 or actually several series of videos, 

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.416
 but the main answer 

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:27.837
 lies in the fact that there is a lot of energy 

00:08:27.837 --> 00:08:31.184
 mostly in the last phosphate group, as I suppose. 

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:33.726
 And this energy and this compound, 

00:08:33.726 --> 00:08:36.572
 as the phosphate group interrupts it, so can it separate it, 

00:08:36.572 --> 00:08:39.448
 to provide all kinds of life mechanisms 

00:08:39.448 --> 00:08:42.360
 including the ability of the body to exchange substances through metabolism. 

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.836
 Here we can see ATP, which is the presence 

00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:47.107
 of energy in our lives. 

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:48.680
 And this is actually an interesting molecule. 

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.479
 Looking at, for example, that part of it, 

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.666
 Looking at, for example, that part of it, 

00:08:55.976 --> 00:08:58.254
 it really looks like part of RNA. 

00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:00.341
 Looks like you're taking ... 

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:02.441
 You have ribose, adenine 

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:03.708
 phosphate group 

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.787
 and can actually be used to build elements like RNA 

00:09:06.787 --> 00:09:08.055
 and even DNA, 

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:11.069
 beyond that it serves for the availability of energy. 

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:13.430
 It's fun to see how all these parts interact with one another, 

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:14.698
 how they can be broken down. 

00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:17.126
 We observe these processes over and over again 

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:19.658
 in biological systems which 

00:09:19.658 --> 00:09:22.954
 consist of degradation 

00:09:22.954 --> 00:09:25.812
 and the absorption of carbohydrates, lipids, 

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:28.407
 fatty acids, cholesterol, other substances 

00:09:28.407 --> 00:09:32.030
 and proteins / amino acids. 

00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:34.175
 And all this process, which we already know, constantly accompanies us, 

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.071
 so pay attention to your day, to the things you consume, 

00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:39.471
 and you will see this process over and over again. 

00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:40.625
 which is actually a bit maddening, 

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:41.647
 because in the end 

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:44.725
 the energy comes from the synthesis reaction in the stars 

00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:46.969
 and all the intricate elements around you 

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:48.662
 or even less complicated, 

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:50.483
 all carbon, oxygen, 

00:09:50.483 --> 00:09:52.567
 and all non-hydrogen elements 

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:56.119
 have been formed in the course of synthesis reactions 

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:59.985
 in the stars that probably exist 

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:01.310
 billions of years ago, 

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.842
 so you can already feel a slightly stronger relationship 

00:10:03.842 --> 00:10:05.440
 with the universe.
