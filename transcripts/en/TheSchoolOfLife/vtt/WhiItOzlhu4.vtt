00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.420
There are friends who are very well meaning

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.920
but who nevertheless have a habit

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.420
of responding in unfortunate ways

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.520
when we reveal a trouble to them.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.400
They try with considerable vigour to cheer us up.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.240
We may appreciate their underlying good nature,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.360
while nevertheless profoundly resenting their particular technique.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.960
For what we may want from them above all

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.880
is not a swift enjoinder that our problems are in fact, despite appearances, easily solvable

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.860
but rather a shared moment of sadness and mournful sympathy.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.720
There are times when we can't believe in quick answers

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.020
but we want company nevertheless.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.820
We want to give way to a low-level muted sadness

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.140
and a joint acceptance that life is inherently difficult.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.620
Sadness isn't always a disorder that needs to be cured.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.760
And yet, the dominant tone of many friendships

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.780
continues to be cheerful or, its more brittle cousin, cheery.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.900
A good mood that tolerates no other.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.920
This falsely presumes

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000
that the best way to please others

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.280
must always be to impose a vibrant frame of mind

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.920
when, in fact, admission of despair is a key tool in the process of friendship properly reimagined.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.360
In a discussion of parenting styles

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.640
the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.780
once identified a particularly problematic kind of child carer -

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.480
the person who wants to "jolly" babies and small children along,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200
always picking them up with exaggerated cheer,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.860
bouncing them up and down, and pulling wide funny faces,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.040
perhaps shouting "Peekaboo!" repeatedly.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.660
This criticism might feel disconcerting.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.120
What could be so wrong with wanting to keep a child jolly?!

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.580
Yet Winnicott was worried by what effect this would have on a child.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.640
The weight was subtly not giving the child any chance to acknowledge its own sadness-

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.080
or more broadly, its own feelings.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.780
The jollier doesn't give the child an opportunity to set the tone.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.900
He or she just wants to impose a mood which may have no basis in the child's reality.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.940
The jollier doesn't only want the child to be happy-

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.760
more alarmingly, it can't tolerate the idea

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.000
that it might be sad.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.720
So unexplored and potentially overwhelming

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.100
are their own feelings of unresolved disappointment and grief.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640
Childhood is necessarily full of sadness...

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.020
As adulthood must be too, insisted Winnicott.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.460
Which means we must perpetually be granted

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.680
the possibility of periods of mourning -

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.960
for a broken toy,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.760
the grey sky on a Sunday afternoon,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.540
or perhaps the lingering sadness we can see in our parents' eyes.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.780
The friend, no less than the carer

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.820
needs to remember

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.860
how much of life deserves to have solemn and mournful moments-

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.880
And of how much loyalty

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700
we will always be ready to offer those

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.380
who don't feel aggressively compelled

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.300
to deny our melancholy.
