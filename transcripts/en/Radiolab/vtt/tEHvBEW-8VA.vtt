1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.330
We're back blue. Tell us who you are.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.960
I am Bruce Burningham. And where do you teach?

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.920
I teach at Illinois State University. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad. I'm Robert.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.090
So Bruce, he's a a scholar, a language professor.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.090
And I called him up because Jed and I were having a little disagreement,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.760
friendly one. Okay. We're having an argument here.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.080
I said that when you get the hip hop in the wrestling and the novels and all

8
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.690
that, you're getting a sort of a a moment,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
contemporary moment where people are fascinated by authenticity.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.780
And then Jad my partner says, I don't know,

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.600
maybe people have always been interested in authenticity.

12
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.620
And this has just comes with being a human. It's nothing about now,

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.740
it just about us. I mean that's, that's it's,

14
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.780
it's new in the sense that this generation of which we belong has become very

15
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:52.590
interested in these kinds of questions. But Bruce told me this preoccupation.

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.500
It's not really new. In fact, at least in book form,

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.480
it goes back way longer than you think. 1605 well,

18
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.740
before wrestling and before Fleetwood Mac and before Jimmy Fallon began laughing

19
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.480
at his own jokes, there was Miguel Servon, his book Don Quixote. Yeah.

20
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.860
So the first book really is about authenticity from like from the get go,

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.630
you opened this book Don Quixote by Miguel de Seventies and right away the

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:19.290
narrator says,

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
I'm going to tell you a story which I actually gathered from other authors from

24
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.760
a bunch of different historical documents. So I'm not really the author.

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.290
He says things like, well, some books say the first adventure was this,

26
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.810
and some say that. So even from the start,

27
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:37.500
you have a very unreliable narrator who then proceeds to tell the story of a

28
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.850
very unreliable, if not completely crazy, he character don Quixote,

29
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.970
who is dry with capricious and filled with in constant thoughts,

30
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.440
never imagined about anyone else.

31
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.480
So Don Quixote believes that he has been set on earth to rescue widows,

32
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.230
princesses, and P and be kind to orphans. He's like a delusional,

33
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
totally delusional. And he is. He's essentially a guy who's,

34
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.430
who's read too many Zane Gray novels and decides he needs to be a cowboy.

35
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.470
He thinks herds of sheep are attacking armies. He thinks windmills are giants.

36
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.600
At the same time, he has this savvy assistant,

37
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.140
central Panto who seems to know what's really going on and they're constantly

38
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:19.530
arguing about what's real and what's not. And then in chapter eight,

39
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.860
something really strange happens one day,

40
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.360
Don Quixote and Santo pans are traveling down the road and they see a carriage

41
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.650
with a woman inside just an ordinary woman going, you know, to meet her husband,

42
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.430
Don Quixote, whatever, for no reason at all. Uh,

43
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.270
the size that she is a woman in distress needs to be rescued.

44
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.300
And he spies this man standing right next to the carriage. He's,

45
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.380
he's a Basque guy, sees this guy and he decides that he's a,

46
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:49.890
he's an enemy who needs to be confronted. And so they start fighting.

47
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.850
Don Quixote was charging the, where it Basque with his sword on high,

48
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.990
determined to cut him in half. And the Basque was waiting for him.

49
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.160
His sword also raised and in mid swing when both swords are in the air,

50
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.560
the narrator stops and says, and I don't know where this goes from there,

51
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.150
I've run out of material and you just sort of stopped scenario and this is what,

52
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.310
16 oh something 1605 the book stops. It's just stopped me.

53
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.820
That's the end of the book. Well, no.

54
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.090
So you turn the page and you're in a new chapter and now the narrators is

55
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:20.700
telling you how as luck would have it,

56
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.880
he found this manuscript one day when I was in the OCA, not market until late.

57
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.650
Crazily enough. He's out a bizarre, I guess what have you.

58
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.090
I was shopping kind of buys and he sees this pile of old papers and books

59
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.590
together in a basket and he's rifling through it and he sees a picture of

60
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.910
[inaudible]. I was astounded and filled with anticipation there.

61
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.380
IPAAS apparently a real historical account in which the stupendous battle

62
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.610
between the governed busk and the valiant man chicken has concluded.

63
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.890
The problem was it was in Arabic.

64
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.010
And so then he hires a local Maurisco who is a Christianized more to translate

65
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:57.370
it for him. Alright,

66
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.030
so you now got a guy who's writing a book from historical sources.

67
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.420
He's run out of one, he's found another, but now that one has to be translated.

68
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.470
And on top of that you frequently inserts commentary about the translation.

69
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:12.190
And we'll say stuff like, well, [inaudible] says this,

70
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.280
but we all know that Arabs can't be trusted. So you know,

71
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.160
take that for what that's worth. That doesn't, I'm reading and I'm thinking,

72
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:18.701
wait a second.

73
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:23.701
This was written in 1605 what did people make of a book that didn't seem to have

74
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.100
any author, had author upon author upon offer?

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.500
Like were they horrified what I'm, the book was a bestseller.

76
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.020
It was hugely popular.

77
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.940
Apparently people found all these layers and these ambiguities a laugh riot.

78
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.940
Oh yeah. They gobbled up and they left as hard as they could.

79
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.060
This is Howard Manson, Savante scholar at Purdue and doe.

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.420
Kyoto was translated into English in 1612 into French in 1614 into Italian in

81
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.960
1622 everybody read it, including in the new world, by the way,

82
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.710
how many copies of the first edition of donkey hilltoppers were shipped to the

83
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:00.790
colonies? Wow. So the book is a world wide bestseller,

84
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.380
maybe the first of its kind. I meant 10 years later, 10 years later,

85
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:06.940
sort of on these rights, a sequel,

86
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.280
which kicks up this narrative weirdness to a completely new level. In part two,

87
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:14.640
part two, Don Quixote of lunch,

88
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.260
he introduces a new character named Samson Carrasco.

89
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.380
He actually visits Donkey Hill Day in sand show to tell them that part one

90
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:27.910
exists. It's a bestseller. And so in the very early chapters,

91
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.080
or part two donkey halt this.

92
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.720
So it'd be like walking up to huckleberry Finn and says, oh, by the way,

93
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.390
you're living here in Hannibal, Missouri. But you're now a famous boy.

94
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.210
That's exactly what happened. Everybody he meets,

95
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.420
knows who he is because they've read part one and now it gets even stranger.

96
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:41.590
Because in real life,

97
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.770
during that 10 years that it took of days to write his second book,

98
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.820
a person who goes by the pseudonym of Alonzo Fernandez, day of Ayurveda,

99
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.110
published his own second part of Don Quixote before Serantes could get his own

100
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:56.690
second part out. Wait, so this is, this is an unofficial part too.

101
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.410
Today we'd recognize it as, as, as sort of fanfiction or,

102
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.970
or somebody's attempting to steal George Lucas's idea and come up with our own

103
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.440
star wars installment. So there's this unauthorized part to floating around.

104
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.200
Miguel on days is very annoyed by it, I'm assuming.

105
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920
So in his official sequel to Don Quixote,

106
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.020
there is this scene where Don Quixote is at an inn and he overhears a character

107
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:25.640
talking about his relationship with, with this, suppose that Don Quixote.

108
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.630
Wait, so this guy,

109
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:29.690
this guy that Simon Adler who sat in on the interview with me,

110
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.160
this guy existed in the fake Quixote.

111
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:38.680
Number two is a character in that and is now appearing in the real Jay.

112
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.890
Number two Serantes serantes steals him. If you're gonna steal my character,

113
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.680
I'll steal yours back right now.

114
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.570
You got the real bunk yoke that he's bumping into a character stolen from a fake

115
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.220
book of donkey. Okay, so,

116
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.370
so why don't you hook it then decides to confront this person.

117
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.230
He might just drive up to the guy and he says,

118
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.150
<v 1>I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,</v>

119
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.620
the same one who is on the lips of fame and not that unfortunate man who has

120
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.800
water to use their my name and bring honor to himself with my thoughts. And so,

121
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.630
and it's the climax of that scene, which is just wonderful, is he?

122
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.960
He forces this other character who he's stolen from the unauthorized CQL who

123
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.830
cirrhotics has stolen to admit that the donkey haute, they,

124
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:21.590
he knows from the unauthorized sequel is not the real one.

125
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.170
And that the one he's currently talking to is the real one.

126
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.640
I am co yoke grace for the sake of what you owe to your being a gentleman to

127
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.430
please make a statement to the magistrate of this village.

128
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.370
And as a matter of fact, he, he forces him to sign an affidavit to that effect.

129
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.960
<v 0>Okay. So he busts him, he busts him, right? In the novel, in the novel,</v>

130
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.700
you've got a story about a guy that then becomes a part to a story about the

131
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:47.690
story about the guy,

132
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:52.130
including false guys inside the story about the false guys from another book.

133
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.213
Right?

134
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.790
So why even bother trying to figure out what's real. Exactly right.

135
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.430
Anything like this come before this. No.

136
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:05.960
He's really sort of inventing this whole meta-narrative game that,

137
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.830
that is so popular today. You met a narrative. What, what of, well,

138
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.580
up until that point, most stories are simply,

139
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.560
they purport to be what they are. I'm telling you a story, but don't key haute.

140
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.820
They pretends to be something other than what it is.

141
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.630
It really is the start of modernity, our modern sense of the world.

142
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.580
So yogi with Jad, Ben, and this is like, this is,

143
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.300
this is not co Waxton Wayne this particular year or because I will,

144
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.090
it has weight. It has waxed and waned. I mean,

145
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:35.930
the donkey Hook Day has been read by different generations for different

146
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:36.620
reasons.

147
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.860
Bruce says he thinks the people who were reading the book originally at the time

148
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:44.120
have survived this. They actually reveled in, in the the multilevels of fiction.

149
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.360
They loved the metastases,

150
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.130
but during the romantic period and and well into the early 20th century,

151
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.460
people were less interested in all these narrative layers and they were more

152
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:57.000
just thrilled by the romantic don Quixote or the dream or Don Quixote.

153
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.280
<v 1>This generation of which we belong has become very interested in this terrain</v>

154
00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.180
that serantes charted a long time ago.

155
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.770
<v 0>You see it in the cinema of the late nineties in movies like the Matrix and then</v>

156
00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:11.960
later adaptation of that inception, flooring,

157
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:14.390
the concept of a dream within a dream.

158
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.920
See it in Seinfeld, what's going on,

159
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.350
what we're going to shoot the pilot and then it's going to be on TV the

160
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.200
following way. Yeah. Oh, there's this comedian Jerry Seinfeld,

161
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.930
who's playing a character that happens to be called Jerry Seinfeld,

162
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.400
who's making a show within the show about a character who's,

163
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:31.820
who's Jerry Seinfeld.

164
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.700
<v 1>And so you have reality nested three times.</v>

165
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.730
But I guess I'm interested in this idea of why is,

166
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.000
how is this happening again and why is it happening again? Well,

167
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:46.001
my sense of things is that both of these moments are moments of intellectual

168
00:09:46.131 --> 00:09:50.210
crisis. Back in the Servon, this time coming out of the renaissance,

169
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.290
you have all of this new scientific knowledge that is calling into question the

170
00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:57.620
foundation that everybody was building their lives on.

171
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.680
So suddenly the earth is no longer the center of the universe.

172
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.190
It's now just one planet among several orbiting the sun.

173
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.290
So you have people coming to terms with a worldview that they can no longer

174
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:13.940
sustain. And as for us now, in the last hundred years, you have Darwinism,

175
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.460
you have relativity, you have quantum physics.

176
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.430
I mean cognitive scientists are telling us that we have no free will because

177
00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:23.420
they can sort of chart the chemical reaction that happens milliseconds before

178
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.280
we, we think we decided to do something.

179
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.420
All of these things tell us that the world that we think we see is not what it

180
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:33.380
is. And I think that inspires people to then start asking these questions. If,

181
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.880
if what I'm seeing is not real, what is, who am I?

182
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.820
And so I think to a great extent it's,

183
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.780
it's a reaction to a moment of intellectual crisis. Wait, but okay,

184
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.060
let's say that I like professional wrestling a lot.

185
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.290
I don't know anything about any of the research you're telling me about why the

186
00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:54.380
hell do I like professional wrestling and why did I like it more when they

187
00:10:54.381 --> 00:10:58.340
started blurring these lines? Hard question.

188
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.620
Well, I would say humans are humans and one of the things that we do is,

189
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.900
is as opposed to as far as we know,

190
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:10.400
what other animals on this planet do is we are aware of our own contingency.

191
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.070
<v 0>Meaning we can imagine radically different possibilities.</v>

192
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:18.540
We could imagine worlds where we don't exist or maybe we only think we exist.

193
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.560
I can remember

194
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.580
<v 1>being a a child four and five years old and going to a fabric store with my</v>

195
00:11:24.581 --> 00:11:25.091
mother.

196
00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:29.500
And there were two mirrors set against opposite walls and I was just fascinated

197
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:33.250
at standing in between them and watching the infinite regress go in each

198
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.240
direction. Um, you know, and I, I had not even started kindergarten yet.

199
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:38.020
So I think,

200
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.850
I think humans have this fascination with infinite regress and with embededness

201
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.540
<v 0>and with the questions that it forces you to consider,</v>

202
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.300
like where does everything begin and where does it all come from? I mean,

203
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:54.100
the question at the heart of donkey realizing

204
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.090
<v 1>that he's a character in a novel is who stands above you.</v>

205
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.920
The author stands above you.

206
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:03.640
And so that author has a kind of godlike relationship to you,

207
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.100
but that very question starts to make you ask who stands above that author?

208
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.920
And if you start asking that question, it goes on forever in every direction.

209
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.123
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

210
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.550
<v 0>[inaudible] thank you to Rupert Boyd for coming and playing the Spanish guitar</v>

211
00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:59.240
for us in the space on very short notice and to recorded books for giving us

212
00:12:59.241 --> 00:13:03.740
permission to use George Greenhouse's. Wonderful read of the book.

213
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.450
[inaudible] he's really good. Okay, well, I guess we should go then.

214
00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:10.670
We should say you should go goodbye. Say Goodbye.
