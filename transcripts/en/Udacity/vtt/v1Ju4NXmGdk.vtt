00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.030
In general, coding region SNVs are more likely

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.570
to cause problems than non coding SNVs. Because there's

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.760
more of a risk of changing the amino acid

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.010
sequence of proteins. Which is going to alter their function.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.300
For example, take this sequence from the ABO gene

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.180
that determines blood type. We talked about this gene

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.800
in lesson three. Now, if this particular sequence. Were

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.150
transcribed and translated starting right here at the start,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.080
code on region ATG. Based on the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.580
genetic code that we learned about previously in

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.360
lesson three, we would obtain a protein sequence

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.800
of methyianin, valine, arginine, valine, valine, and threonine.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.230
We got this by essentially dividing our sequence

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.550
up into codons that we could read with

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.640
our genetic code. Now take a look at

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.350
these three different mutations from the original sequence.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.820
I want you to rank these single nucleotide variatons in

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.020
order of what you think the most severe change would be,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.730
by numbering at number one. To the least of your

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.140
change by numbering it number three. Use the numbers one, two

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.920
and three to put into these boxes right here, ranking

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.320
these particular SNVs. And don't forget to use the genetic code.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.490
There's a link to it on this page but you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.960
can look it up or you can print it off and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.340
keep it handy because we're going to need it

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.720
for the rest of this lesson for sure.
