00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.450
Find the solution set for x.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.420
I've already entered x for you.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.990
Then pick one of these inequality
signs and enter the number

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.200
that x is greater than or equal to or
less than or equal to, in this box.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.940
And remember, whenever you multiply or
divide both sides of

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.960
an inequality by a negative number,
you flip the inequality sign.
