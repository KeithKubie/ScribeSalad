00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Hello, and welcome back to the lab where we take your questions and turn them into experiments

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.700
My name is Mitch - and I'm Greg and what if I told you that there was a list of questions that could make you

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.620
fall in love with a stranger

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.299
Well it turns out there was actually a study done where they took a specific set of 36 questions

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.199
had two complete strangers

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.389
ask them to each other and it increased the likelihood that they would fall in love

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.059
And obviously in general just doing one experiment doesn't prove anything

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.550
But we thought it would be awesome to get to strangers in here, forced them to do this experiment and see what happened

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.669
So this is what happened. - My name is Cam, and I'm 24. - My name is Emily, and I'm 22 years old

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.860
I'm nervous about today to be perfectly honest. - I really want to see if the study works

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.360
I think it'll be, you know, what if we hate each other or we don't like what we're saying

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.300
I I think it'll be cool to see if it's effective. -Hey, how's it going? -Great, how are you? -Good. Emily, right? -Yes, Cam. -Cool

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.980
Very nice to meet you. - Yeah, nice to meet you too. Are you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.920
Nervous at all for this? -Yes. -Yeah me too. We can just get started. So the first question

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.890
Given the choice of anyone in the world who would you want as a dinner guest?

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.479
Instinctually I want to say Clint Eastwood

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:10.979
Nice

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.249
I would say probably like Neil Armstrong or something like that. Think I would

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.469
Like to be famous, I guess. Not an a-list celebrity or anything like that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.789
Maybe a D-list one, where some people will know who you are. You know, you'd be that guy

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.868
I sung to myself on the car ride over here. I was listening to Taylor Swift. - Nice, what song? - The whole album

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.839
Oh nice. - And like Fearless not even her new stuff, so - They're keeping the questions pretty light as you could see it

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.099
I used to think I was gonna die really young like in high school when I was angsty I was like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.649
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna..? That's gonna happen, but then I hit 18 and I was like forget that Emily

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.179
You're gonna live to a hundred you're making the century club. - I've always wanted to be a good artist

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
I'd like to be maybe a bit more

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.299
Assertive

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.569
Maybe not too much so though. I don't want to push people into doing anything

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.750
They don't want to do

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.839
My most terrible memory was the morning my sister called me to tell me that my mom had had a heart attack

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750
Yeah, she's okay

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.859
Ok it's good that she's okay, but I can imagine that is terrifying. - Yeah, that was a bad memory. - She's doing... She's

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.658
Yeah, she's doing well. She's doing very well. - I would say mine

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.159
would be when

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.749
My Grandma's mind just kind of started deteriorating

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.470
Because she lived with us for

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.739
my whole life you know to see her forget who I am and you know call me a different name and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.989
She would wake up some days

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.849
And you know and she's a 90 year old woman and wonder why she didn't have school. That whole

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.060
Part is pretty terrible. I would say so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300
That would be really hard

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860
I know people need affection and I do too

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.150
But I have to like more think about sometimes my actions people need validation sometimes and they need to hear that or see

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:11.989
You by touch stuff like that. Romantic love hasn't been a big role in my life for the past

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.720
A little over a year now. I'm

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.889
trying to

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:24.168
Be a bit more cautious about who I give and receive that love from because it is so important

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.419
I have a stuffed animal Buster. He's a dog

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.500
So I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
probably might save

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.179
Buster. - Mine's Fluffy, he's also... - Oh, ok. Buster &amp; Fluffy should meet one day

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.260
I was worried about this coming into it because I can be a little bit awkward

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.940
But you make me feel at ease. - You know you seem very cool and calm and very confident at the same time

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.569
so I guess that's

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.089
Three but yeah you have a... you definitely have a good personality. - I also like what you're wearing

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.659
oh, thank you - I think those colours really compliment you and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.260
Make you look handsome. - Cool, thank you. - You're welcome

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.580
Um I like your face, it's a nice face. - Your face is very symmetrical which...

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.639
- Nice. - Is something

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:14.749
We subconsciously look for but because I know that I consciously look for - I say like a lot like like this like that

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.358
But you're very very well spoken. - I actually swear all time. I'm trying really hard - Shit

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.950
Fuck, alright, curse like a sailor? - yeah. - it would be nice

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.890
To have someone that you could literally

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.280
Say anything and everything and they would still

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.659
Like you and respect you and not think you're a big weirdo. You have a very very nice smile. I would definitely make out with you

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.799
Okay, yeah, I was kind of thinking about that like on our break. I was like yeah, I would definitely make out with him

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.709
Yeah, I think he's pretty attractive. We have a lot of things in common, and I like what I like

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.450
so it was a good thing. I think it's a good thing that you know kind of a lot of stuff in common

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.039
I expected it to be a lot more awkward, but it was it was more just exciting. - Hmm, yeah, I like you. You're cool.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.639
Yeah, thank you

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:14.288
Uh yeah, I was interesting getting to know a lot about you because a lot of those questions aren't necessarily stuff

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.549
You'd say right away or even sometimes ever to someone

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.788
Yeah, I would like to see him again. - okay um and if you guys want to, and there is no pressure

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:29.788
You guys can kiss if you would like

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.840
Sure

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.840
Sounds good

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.980
Okay you guys, so maybe we'll follow up in like a few months
