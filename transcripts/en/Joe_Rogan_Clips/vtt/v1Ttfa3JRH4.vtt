1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.980
What led him to move to Colorado.
Oh,
he was losing his shit in San Francisco.

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.440
It was that night on the fucking motorcycle or I mean,

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.460
but how did he choose Colorado?
So this is a great story.

4
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:16.050
And like the early sixties,
Thompson had had a chance to drive,

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.090
um,
I don't know,
some sort of cargo.

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.410
I got friends car out to Colorado on his way to San Francisco in 1960 he ended

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.870
up doing a road trip up and down to San Francisco after he passed through

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.540
Colorado.
But he stopped in Colorado because,
um,

9
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:30.600
he had to drop off a friend's car and there was a woman there,

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.490
piggy Clifford who was a journalist and was his good friend at the,
um,

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.000
at the Aspen,
um,
daily times.
And she was older.

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.900
She saw him like after driving 20 hours,
she's like,
Hey,
come in my house,

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.750
hang out.
And she lived right in Aspen and woody creek.

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460
And so then in 1963 after sandy was pregnant,

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.760
Thompson came back from South America where he was a reporter and did a

16
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:57.570
wonderful job like reporting on how democracies were falling apart down there.

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.260
Him and sandy wanted to move west because the national observer was the

18
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.410
newspaper Thompson worked for.
They wanted to give Thompson,

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.420
I'm a position to be at Western reporter.

20
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.550
He was thinking of wanting to San Francisco,

21
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:13.551
but instead he chose to stop first where Peggy Clifford was stopped in Aspen and

22
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:15.900
Woody Creek.

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
And so he was living in an aspen and woody creek from August of 1963 to February

24
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.990
of 1963 and he was there.
This is where free kingdom begins.

25
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.230
He was there when John F.
Kennedy was assassinated,

26
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:31.620
and he's sitting in his living room.
It's,
you know,

27
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.240
10:00 AM 11:00 AM Pacific Time.

28
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:36.270
And he gets a knock on the door and it's this rancher named Wayne Vagner,

29
00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:40.380
which is an old aspen family.
And the ranchers like the president's been shot.

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.650
Like,
what's more,
he's been murdered each debt and Thompson just like,

31
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.170
let's out a Saab.
And he begins to fucking swear.

32
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.010
And then he fucking calms down and he goes downtown,
um,
woody creek,

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
he goes to aspen and he just gets notes from people what their responses are.

34
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.940
And so when he then went to San Francisco to become the correspondent for,
um,

35
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.650
for,
for the magazine that he was working for,

36
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.460
he was having a tough time.

37
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430
He was already wanting to flee because he got hell's angels.

38
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:13.140
He was able to stay in San Francisco longer,
right.
Report on them.
But by 1966,

39
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.160
67,
he was like,
this city is not a good place for me.

40
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.500
He has a great quote about like,

41
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.860
what would have happened if he stayed in San Francisco from 67 odd?
He's like,
no,

42
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.410
I would have burned up.
Like I would have been emulated right there.

43
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.780
And so when it was time to leave,
he thought again of,
um,

44
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.820
woody creek and of Aspen,
which was so different then than it is now.
And,
um,

45
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.960
that was the place that he decided to,
um,

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.750
move and rent for a little while at first.

47
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:38.600
But then because of the success of Hell's angels,
he was able to buy Al Farm.
Um,

48
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.300
Aspen's very different.
But Woody Creek is not that much different.

49
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.710
Woody Creek is still pretty.
That's great.
But Solomon,
Woody Creek are great.

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.820
There's a great,
there's a place called the temporary.

51
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:51.480
They did an event with Juan Thompson and I like did a reading at it and like a

52
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.090
lot of Thompson's friends were there.
So I'm like,
I'm some fucking young.

53
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.260
I didn't know Thompson,
like I'm an interloper,
you know,
and like I'm out there.

54
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.690
And it was great to talk to everybody that knew him and to go through it.

55
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.523
And that's why I,

56
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.430
that's why this book almost killed me because I did a note for every sound,

57
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.230
smell,
our sight or comment.
Like if I wrote,
and at the moment Thompson felt,

58
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.840
what the fuck am I doing here?
I had the quote where he said,

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.300
I looked around then and I felt,
what the fuck am I doing here?

60
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.190
And I had that in the notes so people could see it.

61
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.490
And it was because I wanted those people that knew him well and respected him

62
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.510
and trusted him to not think that I was in any way trying anything,

63
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:28.450
but to make good art off of his life and who he was trying to respond to.

64
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.010
My fucking view of Trump right now and my love of his work in this moment.
Um,

65
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.510
why,
why do you say it almost killed you?

66
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.560
It's not possible to write a narrative and then also site every detail of a

67
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:41.230
narrative.

68
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.230
So each day I would spend nine hours researching and outlining with citations

69
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.870
ever.
I wanted to read it like a novel.
I want it to be like,
you know,

70
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.510
and at that moment I felt like I,

71
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.890
and I see the machine oil from the bay was coming off.

72
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.690
I wanted to read it vividly.
I knew that I had to support all of that.

73
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.210
And so I would spend eight or nine hours every day just on the pure,
um,

74
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.450
arrangement and research.

75
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.940
And then for the next six or seven hours or eight hours,

76
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.570
I would write the narrative and then I'd sleep for five or six hours.

77
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.190
You know and get up and I would do it again.

78
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:15.160
And I did this for four or five months,
you know,
after I was deeply into it.

79
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.410
And I don't think that's sustainable.

80
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:21.040
I think it's better in retrospect to go and report somewhere,
you know,

81
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.230
to like go and be at the middle of the Congress and take notes.

82
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.660
But to try to write something with the dramatize nature that I think Thompson

83
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:29.890
wrote well and having my protests on nothing like his,

84
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.410
I wanted my pros to sound nothing like the way he wrote,

85
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.680
but then to also have almost as many pages of notes showing my work,

86
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.800
you know,
like showing the math that went behind it.
So if I'm wrong,
I'm wrong,

87
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.160
but at least you can see it.
I think that was morally correct,

88
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.820
but I think that was too much effort when it comes to [inaudible] as you were

89
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.500
trying to do in a short period of time.

90
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.500
Did you have a crazy deadline or something?
Yes,
but I also,

91
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.970
I had a year and so on and I had a family and I had a,
a professor,

92
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.810
like I just,
I'd never,
when it came to writing,

93
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.730
had to do both those things,
which was to try to write it in a,
in a,
um,

94
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.930
novelistic way,

95
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.370
but then to also make sure that any question the reader would have,
but like,

96
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:16.480
why did you think that the dinner was at 5:00 PM?
You know,
or like,
you know,
why,

97
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.530
why did you think that the sun was coming up in this way at this moment to make

98
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:21.760
sure?
Because out of respect,

99
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.100
because with Thompson talked about was people are making money off.
I'm like,

100
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:25.780
Doonesbury yeah.
You know,

101
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:28.420
like that's what he talked about was people trying to make money off them.

102
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.110
And if I was gonna read this book,
it could have,
it couldn't be in that space.

103
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.690
Didn't he have a lawsuit against Gary Trudeau?
He thought about it,
I think.

104
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.310
I don't think he ever did it.
He talked about it publicly.
I think it was just,

105
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.090
well,
he became that guy.
Unfortunately.
That's what's really weird.

106
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.940
What happens slowly become a caricature of ourselves.
It's really scary.

107
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.780
Do you know,
um,
well,
it,
it's,

108
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:54.190
what's weird about it is that he kind of knew that it was happening.

109
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
Like there's that famous interview where he's talking to that British guy who

110
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.060
did a documentary about him practice with hunter maybe or no,
but yeah,

111
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.470
one of them,
one of them,
but he's,
he's rolling a joint,
uh,

112
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.890
on the grass somewhere with that Las Vegas visor on,
and he's,
you know,

113
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:17.891
talking about how he's really become this caricature and it would be actually be

114
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.440
better if he wasn't alive anymore,
you know,

115
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.020
then it's breaking up with his wife during that.
It was really sad.

116
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.870
There's a scene in that where he hides where he's at like a parking lot.

117
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.700
He doesn't want people to see him and he's standing against the wall and people

118
00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:30.860
are like,
come on,
we got to go.
He's like,

119
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.210
I just don't want anybody to see me right now.
