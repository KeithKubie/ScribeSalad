00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the second final exam problem, we're looking at something that set the outside boundaries

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of the material that we've looked at so far.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to investigate the decay chain of Uranium-238.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This chain contains a number of different steps from one isotope down to the next.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Say for example we have Uranium-238 to a string of other things

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that we're not going to think about right now until eventually we got to Bismuth-210

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
plus some radioactive radiation over here that we're not going to be concerned about.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Bismuth-210 has a half-life of 5 days and eventually decays to Plutonium-210 plus again some radiation

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and this has a half-life of 138 days.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
After sometime, it decays to Lead-206 and you can see that in general, the average lifetime

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of the given isotope is equal to its half-life divided by the natural log of 2.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you want to figure this out, you're welcome to or you can just trust me that it's right.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It'll be useful for us to think about how the number of atoms at any given sample changes every time.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you think that the initial amount of atoms is equal 100% of that amount

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and then t equals the half-life, we have half of those atoms left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Over here, well we see the atoms lifetime worked out.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Of course, there are still some atoms left, but many of them are already decayed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Looking at the supplied code, we can see that they are actually ignoring the part of the chain

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that starts with Uranium-238.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In the beginning, I set it with the Bismuth isotope.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
All initial values showed up all of the atoms are Bismuth at first

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and later the Plutonium and then the Lead.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What we would like you to do is to the backward Euler--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
remember backward Euler is not the same as forward Euler--to show how this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
decay process happens for each population of atoms.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now more hint, think about how the ideal logistic growth applies to the situation

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and how it's going to affect the different rates of change of these populations.
