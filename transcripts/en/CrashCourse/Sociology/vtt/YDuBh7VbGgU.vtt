00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
Every year we consume immense quantities
of goods that make their way from one side of
the planet to the other.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.140
But have you ever wondered how this enormous
flow of goods is organized, so that stuff made in
China is available in stores in rural Montana?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.220
It happens because formal organizations make
it happen.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.320
Our world is structured by formal organizations,
and life as we now know it can’t exist without them.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.000
But it's not all rainbows and butterflies
and incredibly extensive trade networks,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860
because within these organizations lurk some
pretty substantial dangers.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:38.020
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.220
OK so when I talk about formal organizations,
what does that mean?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.920
Like, I gotta wear a cocktail dress
or a black tie?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600
And is there, I dunno, a casual organization
that I can be part of instead?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960
Where people just wear flip flops and maybe
go floating?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.860
Well, sociologists think of formal organizations as
groups that are organized to achieve goals efficiently.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.960
Now, that’s obviously incredibly broad.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.640
That’s why formal organizations are so
diverse – they include everything from the
IRS to Google to your local PTA.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.060
But you can understand these kinds of
groups a bit better, by thinking about the three
main types of formal organizations:

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.320
Utilitarian organizations, for example, serve
some function for their members.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.380
Businesses pay their employees, and schools
teach their students – and also pay their teachers.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.460
Normative organizations, sometimes called
voluntary associations, are organizations
that people join as volunteers.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.980
They're called "normative" because people
join them to pursue some goal that they think
is morally worthwhile.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.800
This includes charities like the Red Cross,
but also political parties and religious organizations.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.660
Finally, coercive organizations are ones
where you don’t have a say in whether you’re
a member or not.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.939
People are coerced into joining these organizations,
often as punishment – as in prisons – or

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.320
treatment – say, through involuntary commitment
into a psychiatric hospital.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.620
Now, these are all modern-day examples,
but formal organizations have been around
basically forever:

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.600
They built the pyramids, they collected
taxes across the Roman Empire, and they helped
organize monasteries and convents.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.640
But, there is a major difference between those
formal organizations and modern ones.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.120
And that difference is between traditional
and rational worldviews.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.780
This goes back to our friend Max Weber, who
you (hopefully) remember from episode 9.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.480
A traditional world view takes the basic set-up
of the world as given:

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.840
The way previous generations did things
– their values and techniques –
is thought to be basically the right way.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.500
A rational world view, on the other hand, sees everything as up for grabs, and tries to find the most efficient way to accomplish a given task through critical thinking and calculation.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.140
It's the transition from traditional to rational
worldviews, or the rationalization of society,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.600
that ushered in modernity for Weber, and we can
see this rationality at work in an especially pervasive
kind of formal organization: the bureaucracy.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.220
A bureaucracy is an organization that’s
been rationally constructed to do things efficiently.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.440
And according to Weber, every bureaucracy has
six main things in common, which we introduced
in episode 9, but to recap:

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.800
Its members each have specialized roles that
fit together in a hierarchy –

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.980
that is, a clear chain of command linked by
formal, written communications.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.420
Members of a bureaucracy also complete their work with technical competence, treating colleagues and customers without regard for their individual, personal traits:

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.020
That is, everyone’s treated
impersonally.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.100
And all of this functions according to detailed
rules and regulations, literally "by the book."

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.160
These six traits make bureaucracies extremely
efficient at what they do.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
But the very things that make bureaucracies
effective also cause their share of problems.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.280
One problem is just that, sometimes, bureaucracies
are not actually that efficient.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.920
Since bureaucracies are strictly hierarchical
and rule-based, those rules can sometimes
get in the way.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.080
This is what people mean when they talk about
bureaucratic "red tape."

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.520
And that focus on rules leads to another kind
of inefficiency: bureaucratic ritualism.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.180
In this case, the rules become a kind of
end in themselves, ultimately interfering with
the organization's goals.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.640
Faith in the rules can become just as damaging
as faith in tradition ever was.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.880
And a group’s goals can even shift so much
that it comes down with what’s known as
bureaucratic inertia.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.600
This is where an organization’s ultimate
goal becomes just to perpetuate itself, to
keep existing.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.980
This can be an intentional choice,
made by those who have the most to lose if
the organization were to disappear.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.640
But it can also happen just because its members
believe that the organization does good work.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.510
And it's not just that bureaucracies aren't
always efficient, or that their goals change:

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.240
Their hierarchies create another problem,
the problem of oligarchy, or the rule of the
many by the few.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.080
Now, of course a hierarchical organization
is going to be an oligarchy.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.980
After all, in a hierarchy, the people at the top
make decisions for everyone else to carry out.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.040
This is partly what Weber thought helped make
bureaucracies so efficient.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.480
But in a lot of bureaucracies, like democratic
governments, the people at the top of the hierarchy are
elected, or are appointed by people who are elected.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.140
So even if they're giving orders, it should still be
considered a democratic organization, right?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.920
Well, here's where another sociologist, Robert
Michels, saw a problem.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.120
He called it the iron law of oligarchy.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.440
He argued that regardless of how democratic
a bureaucracy is in theory, in practice, it always
tends toward pure oligarchy.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.280
The people at the top may be elected, but
because of their position of power, they're actually
insulated from the people who elected them.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.380
And even if the people in power are voted out,
those who replace them just become like the ones they
replaced, because of the way the system is structured.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.540
Finally, what Weber saw as the worst
danger of bureaucracy was something called
bureaucratic alienation.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.940
Bureaucracies are supposed to run with machine-like
efficiency, consistency, and calculability.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.860
But people aren’t machines.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.200
So, bureaucracies can be dehumanizing to those
who work in them and those they serve.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.120
When a clerk at the DMV can’t help you
because you didn’t follow some obscure rule,
they’re doing their job right.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.270
And if they exercise their personal, reasoned
judgement and ignore the rule, they’re doing
their job wrong.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.920
To be a good bureaucrat is not to think for
yourself, but to be a good cog in the machine.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.200
Despite all these problems, we still see rationalization
all over the place, including in the workplace,
through what’s known as scientific management.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.160
Scientific management is a system devised by
American engineer Frederik Taylor, who, in the early
1900s, sought to make industry work more efficiently.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.260
He came up with a process in which
management closely observes and systematizes
how workers do their jobs,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.940
so that those jobs could be refined
over time, making them more efficient.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.620
Taylor’s ideas were incredibly influential, and
in time, companies across the US adopted them.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.980
So, from governments to corporations, the
bureaucratic model of formal organizations has
taken hold to be a regular part of modern life.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.100
But in addition to the problems that bureaucracy
can cause, American formal organizations in particular
have faced many challenges over the last century,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.840
due to changes in what's called
the organizational environment.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.800
Simply put, that’s just the environment
in which organizations exist and operate.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.160
The organizational environment includes things
like technology, political and economic trends,
and population patterns.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:32.000
And in the US, one the main challenges that formal
organizations have faced is the growing recognition that
many of them were either racist or sexist or both.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.740
Following the civil rights and feminist movements
in the 1960s and 70s, hiring practices that excluded
people who weren't white men came under
increasing fire.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.820
While excluding job candidates on the basis
of race or gender might seem to go against
Weber's idea of technical competence,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.640
it's important to understand that that's not
how those doing the hiring saw it.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.980
Often, they believed that those who were excluded
were simply incapable of doing the work.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.200
Until they were forced to do otherwise by
changes in the organizational environment,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.100
many were quite happy to go on excluding large
swaths of their talent pools.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.400
More recently, another challenge has come
in the form of big economic shifts, and the
changing nature of work itself.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:15.360
As the US transitions from an industrial to postindustrial economy, there are fewer manufacturing jobs, and more jobs based around creating and processing information.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.980
Frederik Taylor’s vision of work – as a
series of discrete, rote tasks – might have been
a good way to improve assembly lines.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.460
But applying it to things like programming,
design, or marketing just hasn’t worked.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.360
As a result, we’ve seen a lot of important
changes in the organizations that house these
of newer kinds jobs:

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.160
Workers have more creative freedom, and
more flexibility around when and where they work,
and organizational hierarchies have flattened.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.900
Compared to old style bureaucracies, average
employees in the information industry have a much
more direct connection to their leadership.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.900
But not everything has changed in the American
workplace.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.380
While big changes have taken place in
high-skill jobs that require creative work,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.180
lower-skilled jobs, which are now mostly in
the service sector, are just as amenable to Taylor's
scientific management as ever.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.840
And rationalization is alive and well in many
other aspects of society, too.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.140
If anything, it continues to spread.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.340
Sociologist George Ritzer has called this
the McDonaldization of Society:

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.920
the process by which the principles of
the fast food restaurant have come to
dominate the whole of society.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.220
Few things, after all, are more hyper-rational
than fast food.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.200
The whole industry is based on the principles of
efficiency, predictability, uniformity, and control.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.540
The point of fast food is that you get your
food quickly, and just as you expect it.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.940
And that’s because the way the food is made
is precisely controlled.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.220
And Ritzer argues that these principles are
having an growing impact in our society at large.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:41.360
In education, for instance, we see more emphasis on
standardized tests and tightly controlled curricula that
run students through the system in 4 years flat.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.200
All of this brings us to what Ritzer calls
the irrationality of rationality.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.020
As we saw with bureaucratic ritualism
and alienation, rational systems are often
unreasonable, impersonal.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:58.780
The reliance on rules and procedures can leave no
room for independent judgment, basically denying
people their status as independent thinking beings.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.480
So, rational formal organizations are a necessary
part of our world.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.080
They’re how goods from all over the world
end up on shelves here in Montana.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.020
But they're also a part of modern life that
deserves our close attention.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:12.100
Today we learned about formal organizations.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.740
We talked about the historical process of
rationalization and its impact on organizations
in the form of bureaucracy.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.540
We discussed how organizations change in response
to their organizational environment.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.290
Finally, we talked about the negative consequences
of rationalization in organizations.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:32.960
