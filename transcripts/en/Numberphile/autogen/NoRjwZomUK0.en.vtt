00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 align:start position:0%
square which is 112 by 112 so it's
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
square which is 112 by 112 so it's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 align:start position:0%
called a squared square why have they
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 align:start position:0%
called a squared square why have they
picked<00:00:41.129><c> this</c><00:00:41.430><c> as</c><00:00:41.700><c> their</c><00:00:42.300><c> logo</c><00:00:42.570><c> for</c><00:00:43.079><c> their</c>

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 align:start position:0%
society their nerves well yeah and that
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.959 align:start position:0%
society their nerves well yeah and that
and<00:00:47.510><c> because</c><00:00:48.510><c> it</c><00:00:48.930><c> was</c><00:00:49.320><c> Trinity</c><00:00:50.129><c> math</c><00:00:50.430><c> students</c>

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 align:start position:0%

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 align:start position:0%
and because it was Trinity math students
that<00:00:51.329><c> solved</c><00:00:51.989><c> this</c><00:00:52.230><c> this</c><00:00:52.949><c> one</c><00:00:53.129><c> is</c><00:00:53.280><c> actually</c>

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
the smallest possible squared square so
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 align:start position:0%
the smallest possible squared square so

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
network and what you do is you connect
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.370 align:start position:0%

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
two horizontal lines if the square are
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.890 align:start position:0%
two horizontal lines if the square are

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 align:start position:0%
so from going from here we've got a nine
 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.730 align:start position:0%
so from going from here we've got a nine
we've<00:04:51.030><c> got</c><00:04:51.270><c> a</c><00:04:51.450><c> seven</c><00:04:51.840><c> which</c><00:04:52.050><c> makes</c><00:04:52.290><c> sixteen</c>

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
we've got a seven which makes sixteen
 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.470 align:start position:0%
we've got a seven which makes sixteen
and<00:04:52.920><c> then</c><00:04:53.580><c> I</c><00:04:53.670><c> go</c><00:04:53.820><c> in</c><00:04:53.910><c> the</c><00:04:54.000><c> opposite</c><00:04:54.300><c> direction</c>

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
and then I go in the opposite direction
 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.380 align:start position:0%
and then I go in the opposite direction
here<00:04:55.320><c> so</c><00:04:55.710><c> this</c><00:04:55.860><c> is</c><00:04:55.980><c> a</c><00:04:56.010><c> minus</c><00:04:56.220><c> sixteen</c><00:04:56.970><c> so</c>

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 align:start position:0%
here so this is a minus sixteen so
 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
here so this is a minus sixteen so
