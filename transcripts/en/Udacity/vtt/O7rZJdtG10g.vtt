00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.130
So Cameron, why are we here?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.660
&gt;&gt; I'm just checking out this soccer, I mean football scores.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.450
&gt;&gt; And how does that relate to JavaScript?

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.660
&gt;&gt; You'll see.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.500
Okay. So if I ask you whether or

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.630
not the US won any of these games, how you would respond?

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.200
Let's start with this first one against Ghana.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.570
Did we win?

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.410
&gt;&gt; True.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.750
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.850
Okay.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.470
What about this one, against Belgium?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.590
False.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.700
&gt;&gt; Also correct.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.060
All right. One last one.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.403
What about that one, against Argentina?

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:33.903
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:36.460
We didn't even play them.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.650
&gt;&gt; correct.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.518
And JavaScript gives us a way of expressing this, as Undefined.

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:43.694
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.450
I see what you're getting at.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.330
True and False isn't as cut and dry as our football chart.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.270
JavaScript has a set of values that can evaluate to true or

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.150
false, but many not equal true or false.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.500
Because of this, we call these values truthy and falsy.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Under truthy, we've got true, non-zero numbers,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.540
strings with a length of at least one, objects, arrays, and functions.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.662
And under falsy, we've got false, zero,

00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:23.540
empty strings, undefined, null and Not a Number.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.450
&gt;&gt; Undefined means that the variable doesn't exist and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.280
the interpreter doesn't know what you're referring to.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.460
Null means that the variable exist, but has well no value.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.850
It's usually used as a placeholder.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.430
And Not a Number is not a number or a result that isn't a number.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.570
&gt;&gt; There's a link in the instructor's notes comparing Truthy and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.500
Falsy values in Python and JavaScript.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.600
Let's take a quiz to make sure you got them all.
