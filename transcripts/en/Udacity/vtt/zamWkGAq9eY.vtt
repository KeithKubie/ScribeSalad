00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.480
You've heard a lot about UX design and

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.120
I'd like to discuss where we are in
the course and what you can expect next.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.520
You've learned about the definition of
user experience from Richard Fulcher and

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.130
you learned the importance of designing
with accessibility in mind from

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.530
the very start.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.050
The rest of this lesson is setup, so

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.150
that you can see examples of
great user experience design.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.073
And hopefully,
you'll start to gather ideas for

00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:21.456
what your product might look like.

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:24.614
Ultimately, this lesson will
help you think like a designer.

00:00:24.614 --> 00:00:28.290
It will help you prepare and plan your
own design sprints in lesson three.
