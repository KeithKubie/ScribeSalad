00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.610
To recap, you made a new app called Festival

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.930
app. And when you created that app, the platform automatically

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.360
created an object to track Festivals. You added fields

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.550
to capture the start and end dates, and then you

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.450
created a record for a specific festival, which Samantha

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.870
and Andy called Cloudstock. Objects, fields, records. These terms might

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.290
still be a little unfamiliar to you. If that's confusing,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.360
let's step back for a moment and relate this model

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.990
to something you're probably already comfortable with, spreadsheets.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.630
If you were to track this same information with

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.990
a simple spreadsheet, it might look something like this.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.272
You'd create a new spreadsheet called Festivals. And you'd

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:40.470
add a column for Festival Name, Start Date, and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.880
Date. Then you'd add Cloudstock as a row under

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.040
those headers and complete the dates. You can add

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.400
many different festivals as new rows on that spreadsheet.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.710
Now this is starting to make sense. Based on this analogy, how do these

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.470
terms objects, fields, and records correspond to

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.340
tables, columns, and rows on a spreadsheet?
