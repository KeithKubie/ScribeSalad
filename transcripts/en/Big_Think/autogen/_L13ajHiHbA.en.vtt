00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.970
I think the question of acceptance of LGBT
folks really does depend on geography.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.320
In some places on Earth I would say, when
it comes to legal equality and cultural acceptance

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.539
absolutely there’s been this revolution,
and progress has occurred at a pace that even

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.279
in our own lifetimes was almost inconceivable
in terms of how quickly things had evolved.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.040
At the same time, just today 2.8 billion people
live in countries around the globe where being

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.020
gay is a crime.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.600
And in some places like India progress toward
equality has actually been reversed.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.550
So back in 2013 India’s supreme court recriminalized
sodomy and same sex activity, which had become

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.550
legal.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.520
So there are examples of countries where progress
has actually been reversed.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.439
When we talk about how have things changed
in terms of equality or the movement toward

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.930
equality for LGBTQ folks I think the biggest
and most dramatic example is marriage equality

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.730
which somewhat miraculously I think—and
not inevitably—did become the law of the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:31.100
land, and all 50 states thanks to the Supreme
Court and the Obergefell decision are now

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.310
required to recognize same sex marriage.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.670
But I think it’s important to remember that
marriage equality does not mean or is not

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.530
synonymous with full equality in terms of
constitutional protections.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.570
And it is in fact true that a couple could
get married on a Sunday and then one of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.979
partners goes to work on Monday, puts a picture
of his husband or her wife on the desk and

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.850
gets fired, because in the majority of U.S.
states it is still completely legal for people

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.470
to be fired on the basis of sexual orientation.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.990
And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 doesn’t
cover sexual orientation or gender identity.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.480
There’s a movement among activists and gay
rights organizations to expand the scope of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.409
the 1964 Civil Rights Act to go beyond race
and gender and color and national origin,

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.189
which are covered categories.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:38.709
But at this point sexual orientation is not
covered by the 1864 legislation.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.279
I guess the context is, it wasn’t until
1973 that the American Psychiatric Association

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:51.230
came to the conclusion that homosexuality
in general is not a mental illness, and that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.840
was the year when the APA voted to take homosexuality
out of its diagnostic manual.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.489
Until that point every gay person, no matter
how well adjusted or healthy or functioning,

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.530
was considered mentally ill.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.230
So that’s the background, and really that
wasn’t so long ago that our most progressive

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.319
doctors were under the assumption or were
working on this theory that homosexuality

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.209
was, in fact, a mental disease.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.469
So I think conversion therapy is kind of the
contemporary cousin to that belief that gay

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.189
people are sick, and that they can be cured
or that they need to be cured.

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:39.239
And certainly, you know, dozens of medical
establishment organizations ranging from the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.419
AMA to youth organizations have condemned
conversion therapy.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:51.999
But this idea that people who are gay can
be converted into not being gay is indeed

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.930
still alive.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:01.159
My sense is that at this point seven states
have outlawed conversion therapy among minors,

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.959
meaning that in the other 43 states it’s
still allowed for parents to send their children,

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:20.510
their minor children into this kind of therapy
and to require that kids under 18 go through

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.599
this process.

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.289
There have been studies of people who have
undergone the therapy and consistently there’s

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:35.330
this sense of finding that therapy not only
doesn’t change people from being gay to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.880
straight but inflicts its own harm and trauma.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.620
And there is federal legislation being considered
where there would be an national ban, which

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.610
again I think is common sense.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.110
And I hope that as we see a new generation
of young people becoming more open and more

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.009
accepting, and the sense of allies among teenagers
and young people, I think that’s the key

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.970
to ultimately ending conversion therapy.
