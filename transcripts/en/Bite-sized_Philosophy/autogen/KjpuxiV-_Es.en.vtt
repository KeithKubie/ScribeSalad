consequence of that and you do that for
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.310
consequence of that and you do that for
you and you do that in a way that makes

it better for other people and then that
works and one question might be well how

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
works and one question might be well how
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500
works and one question might be well how
well does it work and the answer is you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
well does it work and the answer is you
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.749
well does it work and the answer is you
the only way that you can find out is by

the only way that you can find out is by
trying it that's it

trying it that's it
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799
trying it that's it
if that's the extension element of it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
if that's the extension element of it
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.860
if that's the extension element of it
the proof is to be derived by the

that sort of criticism you're it's

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070
that sort of criticism you're it's
 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.280
that sort of criticism you're it's
blindness and it's the same thing with

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290
blindness and it's the same thing with
 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390
like it glistens in front of you and you
 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.449
like it glistens in front of you and you
can criticize it it's like fine put the

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459
can criticize it it's like fine put the
 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.760

cart before the horse and and see how

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770
cart before the horse and and see how
 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.760

far you get so I thought to bring full

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770
far you get so I thought to bring full
 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.100

closure to the class I was trying to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110
closure to the class I was trying to
 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.390
closure to the class I was trying to
solve this terrible puzzle that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400
solve this terrible puzzle that
 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.120
solve this terrible puzzle that
confronted me for and many other people

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130
confronted me for and many other people
 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.430
confronted me for and many other people
about how it was that human beings got

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440
about how it was that human beings got
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.170
about how it was that human beings got
themselves in such a tangle about what

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180
themselves in such a tangle about what
 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.420
themselves in such a tangle about what
they believed such a tangle that we were

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
they believed such a tangle that we were
 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.000
they believed such a tangle that we were
pointing the ultimate weapons of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010
pointing the ultimate weapons of
 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.650
pointing the ultimate weapons of
destruction at one another which by the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660
destruction at one another which by the
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.030
destruction at one another which by the
way we are still doing

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040
 
 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.430
 
and I thought okay well I understand

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440
and I thought okay well I understand
 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.020
and I thought okay well I understand
that we need your belief systems they

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030
that we need your belief systems they
 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.170
that we need your belief systems they
orient us and that means there will be

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
orient us and that means there will be
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.060
orient us and that means there will be
conflict between belief systems and that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070
conflict between belief systems and that
 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.100
conflict between belief systems and that
can be a catastrophe and that's being

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
can be a catastrophe and that's being
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.840
can be a catastrophe and that's being
played out everywhere again in very many

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850
played out everywhere again in very many
 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.990
played out everywhere again in very many
ways what's the solution to that well

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000
ways what's the solution to that well
 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.420
ways what's the solution to that well
one possibility is there's no solution

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430
one possibility is there's no solution
 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.270
one possibility is there's no solution
it's just mayhem all the way around

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280
it's just mayhem all the way around
 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.540
it's just mayhem all the way around
could be the case but it seemed to me as

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550
could be the case but it seemed to me as
 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.130
could be the case but it seemed to me as
I delved into it that the proper

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140
I delved into it that the proper
 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.370
I delved into it that the proper
solution to that was to live properly as

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380
solution to that was to live properly as
 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.200
solution to that was to live properly as
an individual because you're more

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210
an individual because you're more
 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.600
an individual because you're more
powerful didn't you think way more

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
powerful didn't you think way more
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.190
powerful didn't you think way more
powerful than you think I mean god only

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200
powerful than you think I mean god only
 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.550
powerful than you think I mean god only
knows what you are in the final analysis

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560
knows what you are in the final analysis
 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.710
knows what you are in the final analysis
you're blind to your own weaknesses but

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720
you're blind to your own weaknesses but
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.180
you're blind to your own weaknesses but
you're also blind to your own strengths

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190
you're also blind to your own strengths
 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.460
you're also blind to your own strengths
and so then I think well if you've got

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470
and so then I think well if you've got
 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.930
and so then I think well if you've got
your act together it'd be better for you

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940
your act together it'd be better for you
 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.640
your act together it'd be better for you
and instantly it would be better for

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650
and instantly it would be better for
 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.210
and instantly it would be better for
your family

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220
your family
 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.830
your family
assuming they wanted you to get your act

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840
assuming they wanted you to get your act
 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.750
assuming they wanted you to get your act
together and not everyone does but and

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760
together and not everyone does but and
 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.400
together and not everyone does but and
then it would be better for the

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410
then it would be better for the
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.960
then it would be better for the
community it's like how far could you

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970
community it's like how far could you
 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.060
community it's like how far could you
take that if you stopped wasting time

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070
take that if you stopped wasting time
 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.350
take that if you stopped wasting time
and if you stopped lying and if you

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
and if you stopped lying and if you
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.420
and if you stopped lying and if you
oriented yourself to to the highest

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430
oriented yourself to to the highest
 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.100
oriented yourself to to the highest
possible good that you could conceive of

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110
possible good that you could conceive of
 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.410
possible good that you could conceive of
and you committed to that how much good

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420
and you committed to that how much good
 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.190
and you committed to that how much good
could you do well I would say why don't

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200
could you do well I would say why don't
 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.460
could you do well I would say why don't
you find out so that's what I think you

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470
you find out so that's what I think you
 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.340
you find out so that's what I think you
should do you should find out you don't

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350
should do you should find out you don't
 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.510
should do you should find out you don't
have anything better to do and there's

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520
have anything better to do and there's
 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.190
have anything better to do and there's
nothing in it as far as I've been able

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200
nothing in it as far as I've been able
 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.590
nothing in it as far as I've been able
to tell there's nothing in it but good

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600
to tell there's nothing in it but good
 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.310
to tell there's nothing in it but good
so maybe you could sort yourself out so

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320
so maybe you could sort yourself out so
 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.910
so maybe you could sort yourself out so
that you wanted nothing but the good and

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920
that you wanted nothing but the good and
 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.590
that you wanted nothing but the good and
and then maybe you could help make that

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600
and then maybe you could help make that
 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.560
and then maybe you could help make that
manifest in the world and maybe we

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570
manifest in the world and maybe we
 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.580
manifest in the world and maybe we
wouldn't have all these terrible

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590
wouldn't have all these terrible
 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.250
wouldn't have all these terrible
problems then at least we'd have fewer

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260
problems then at least we'd have fewer
 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.600
problems then at least we'd have fewer
of them and that would be a start so

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610
of them and that would be a start so
 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.400
of them and that would be a start so
it's the it's that the answer to the

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410
it's the it's that the answer to the
 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.580
it's the it's that the answer to the
problem of humanity is that is the is

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590
problem of humanity is that is the is
 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.690
problem of humanity is that is the is
the integrity of the individual that's

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700
the integrity of the individual that's
 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.070
the integrity of the individual that's
the answer so and states that are

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080
the answer so and states that are
 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.600
the answer so and states that are
predicated on that realization are

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610
predicated on that realization are
 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.070
predicated on that realization are
healthy so n states that aren't are

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080
healthy so n states that aren't are
 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.500
healthy so n states that aren't are
doomed to stagnation and catastrophic

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510
doomed to stagnation and catastrophic
 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.700

predicated on
self tyranny and the tyranny of others

self tyranny and the tyranny of others
 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.440
self tyranny and the tyranny of others
are doomed and doomed to collapse so and

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450
are doomed and doomed to collapse so and
 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.180
are doomed and doomed to collapse so and
then you think well what's the barrier

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190
then you think well what's the barrier
 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.920
then you think well what's the barrier
and the barriers are you willing to

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930
and the barriers are you willing to
 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.650
and the barriers are you willing to
accept the responsibility and part of

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660
accept the responsibility and part of

accept the responsibility and part of
the answer to that is reduce the dam

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610
the answer to that is reduce the dam
 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.150
the answer to that is reduce the dam
responsibility until it's tolerable you

don't have to fix everything at once you

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170
don't have to fix everything at once you
 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.510
don't have to fix everything at once you
could just start by fixing the things

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520
could just start by fixing the things
 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.450
could just start by fixing the things
that you can fix or you could even do it

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
that you can fix or you could even do it
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.460
that you can fix or you could even do it
more you can do it with even less

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470
more you can do it with even less
 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.170
more you can do it with even less
self-sacrifice you could start by fixing

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180
self-sacrifice you could start by fixing
 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.900
self-sacrifice you could start by fixing
only the things that you want to fix God

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910
only the things that you want to fix God
 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.470
only the things that you want to fix God
you can get a massive way that way so do

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:16.480
you can get a massive way that way so do
 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.050
you can get a massive way that way so do
it see what happens that's what you

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060
it see what happens that's what you
 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.400
it see what happens that's what you
should have been taught in university

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410
should have been taught in university
 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:21.420
should have been taught in university
right from the beginning

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430
right from the beginning
