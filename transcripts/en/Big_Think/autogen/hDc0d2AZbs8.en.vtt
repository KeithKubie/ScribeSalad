think is eight and a half months and we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
think is eight and a half months and we
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.520
think is eight and a half months and we
elected on our own to try a totally new

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
elected on our own to try a totally new
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.790
elected on our own to try a totally new
manufacturing method for the wings and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
manufacturing method for the wings and

something that hadn't been done before

something that hadn't been done before
 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.850
something that hadn't been done before
something that may not work something

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
something that may not work something
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.350
something that may not work something
that was really exciting and interesting

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
that was really exciting and interesting
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.420
that was really exciting and interesting
and if it did work its breakthrough

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
and if it did work its breakthrough
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.030
and if it did work its breakthrough
stuff and we decided to use it on a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
stuff and we decided to use it on a
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.949
stuff and we decided to use it on a
program that had a real tough schedule

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959
program that had a real tough schedule
 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.460
program that had a real tough schedule
and you know at times you could question

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
and you know at times you could question
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.400
and you know at times you could question
the sanity of that but when people dig

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
the sanity of that but when people dig
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.539
the sanity of that but when people dig
in there and knowing that they have to

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549
in there and knowing that they have to
 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.960
in there and knowing that they have to
achieve that goal a lot of times you'll

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970
achieve that goal a lot of times you'll
 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.030
achieve that goal a lot of times you'll
find engineers in there at Friday nights

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
find engineers in there at Friday nights
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890
find engineers in there at Friday nights
and Sundays and there in the shop

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900

themselves building in and trying to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
themselves building in and trying to
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.410
themselves building in and trying to
make it work and and and in general we

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
make it work and and and in general we
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.550
make it work and and and in general we
we do make it work

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
we do make it work
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.140
we do make it work
so a lot of it depends on what the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
so a lot of it depends on what the
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.610
so a lot of it depends on what the
customer demands are

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620
 
 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.930
 
well um I encourage and it seems

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
well um I encourage and it seems
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.280
well um I encourage and it seems
backwards you think you get real

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
backwards you think you get real
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.850
backwards you think you get real
conservative as an old guy but I did

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860
conservative as an old guy but I did
 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.119
conservative as an old guy but I did
some of it just today typically I'll

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129
some of it just today typically I'll
 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.270
some of it just today typically I'll
look at the work done by the by the new

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
look at the work done by the by the new
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.160
look at the work done by the by the new
engineers and we've got a lot of them

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
engineers and we've got a lot of them
 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.430
engineers and we've got a lot of them
who are just just a year or two or three

who are just just a year or two or three
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.420
who are just just a year or two or three
out of out of college and they tend to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430
out of out of college and they tend to
 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.289
out of out of college and they tend to
do things that are sometimes complex

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299
do things that are sometimes complex
 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.720
do things that are sometimes complex
just because complexity looks cool and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
just because complexity looks cool and
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.960
just because complexity looks cool and
it looks like a more significant design

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970
it looks like a more significant design
 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.020
it looks like a more significant design
result if something's complicated but

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030
result if something's complicated but

what I try to encourage people to do is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190
what I try to encourage people to do is
 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.330
what I try to encourage people to do is
to have a breakthrough by finding a way

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
to have a breakthrough by finding a way
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.520
to have a breakthrough by finding a way
to do it more simply and even if the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
to do it more simply and even if the
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.200
to do it more simply and even if the
real simple one has a chance of not

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
real simple one has a chance of not
 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.200
real simple one has a chance of not
working because it's too simple we'll

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210
working because it's too simple we'll
 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.610
working because it's too simple we'll
try it anyway because in trying it

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
try it anyway because in trying it
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.680
try it anyway because in trying it
sometimes you'll stumble on to a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690
sometimes you'll stumble on to a
 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.560
sometimes you'll stumble on to a
solution on why it wouldn't work and now

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
solution on why it wouldn't work and now
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.719
solution on why it wouldn't work and now
you've really add a big gain now you

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729
you've really add a big gain now you
 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.029
you've really add a big gain now you
have a simple thing that does work and

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039
have a simple thing that does work and
 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.640
have a simple thing that does work and
that's that's the real real challenge

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650
that's that's the real real challenge
 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.409
that's that's the real real challenge
now you can always make something work

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419
now you can always make something work
 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.469
now you can always make something work
by adding complexity but you can never

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479
by adding complexity but you can never
 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.719
by adding complexity but you can never
make something affordable by adding

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729
make something affordable by adding
 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.339
make something affordable by adding
complexity

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349
 
 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.249
 
aesthetics play a role when you have

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259
aesthetics play a role when you have
 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.109
