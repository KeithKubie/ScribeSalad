00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.440
Although George Gamow thought information would be stored

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.090
most efficiently in the overlapping model. In reality

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.770
the triplet code is read in the non-overlapping

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.160
fashion. Actually, the less efficient method. Now, obviously, if

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.520
we were designing a system, this doesn't make

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.850
a lot of sense, as far as efficiency's sake,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.050
right? We can get more information stored in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.370
this overlapping model than compared this non overlapping model

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.140
where each codon has to be its own individual or its own discreet unit. And

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.000
it turns out that this messiness, this

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
inefficiency is a result of evolution. And in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.330
particularly some molecular constraints of the system

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.950
that are slightly beyond the scope of our

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.570
material here. So that means that we're left

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.770
with 64 possible combinations of three nucleotides and

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.750
each set of three is referred to as a

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.900
codon. So we have 64 possible codons. And a codon

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.950
is just a sequence of the three nucleotides that

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.970
are part of the genetic code. And, it took years

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.580
of experiments to finally determine which codons code for

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
which amino acids. And this information is referred to as

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.220
the genetic code. Although it took many years and a

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.705
lot of hard work to come up with this information.

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm giving it to you, right here, summarized for free in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.350
less than a few seconds. Here is all of the magic of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.900
the genetic code. You'll going to have to get quite familiar with

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.220
this table so, I hope it doesn't scare you away too fast.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.070
I've color coded it to try to make it a little

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.760
simpler for you. And I'll explain to you how to read it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.920
in just a moment. But the first thing that I want

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.690
you to do is actually just stare at it for a minute.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.510
Try to read it. First letter in the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.930
codon, second letter in the codon, third letter in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.350
the codon. We have UCAG, UCAG, and then

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.520
each combination for every row here. And then you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.360
can see each codon is spelled out. In

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.130
the individual box and then beside it is the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.650
amino acid that it codes for. What patterns or

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.290
features stand out to you about this genetic code?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.500
Is there anything interesting that you notice? I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.789
want you to use the text box here

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.410
to describe any kind of response you have

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.460
that might answer this question. And don't worry about

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.970
getting this right or wrong. I just want to see what you pick up on. You

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.380
could always go to the forum and see

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.690
what other people think about the genetic code too.
