00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.080
&gt;&gt;Luiz Barroso: My name is Luiz Barroso and
thank you for coming here and helping me welcome

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
Jonathan Koomey to Google today.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.900
Many of us here have known Jon for a very
long time because Google and many of us share

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.320
the passion for understanding the impact of
computing technology in the world.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.340
Jon's been working on this for a very long
time.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.609
For those of you who are not in the audience
and are from Google and, therefore, are tired

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.910
on knowing this, Google has cared about the
energy efficiency and our impact on the environment

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.970
for quite awhile.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.470
I believe Google's been carbon neutral since
2007.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.320
We have, by now, invested nearly a billion
dollars in renewable energy products and we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
have been able to share with the industry
and the academic community some of our findings

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.980
in how we are able to achieve a very high
efficiency in our daily centers as well.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.320
Now, Jon has been very influential figure
in this field at least over the past decade

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.749
or so and even though his very data driven
approach may be considered a little bit old

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:14.090
fashioned these days-
[Laughter]

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.219
&gt;&gt;Barroso: given how quickly some of our political
candidates divorce themselves from factual

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:21.979
data.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.499
&gt;&gt;Barroso: Jon really likes data and he likes
principled analysis.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.750
Some of you may be familiar with some of the
studies he did that are closer to what we

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.539
do here at Google estimating energy consumption
of servers and data centers.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:44.590
To both studies, the one in 2007 as well as
one, another one last year, are very widely

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.030
cited and respected as good data points in
this area.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.609
Jon is here today to talk about computing
energy efficiency and you see the title, The

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.840
Computing Trend That Will Change Everything.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.601
After many years at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratories he has just joined, let me make

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:11.379
sure I say that correctly, Steyer, The Steyer
Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.300
at Stanford University as a research fellow.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.750
He has co authored dozens of research publications
and has been the single author of at least

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.939
two books one of which is recent and is here
right now; "Cold Cash, Cool Climate."

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.689
We happen to have copies of the book here
available for purchase after the talk and

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.380
Jon will be happy to sign them.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.810
Please help me in welcoming Jon Koomey.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.810
[Applause]

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.299
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Luiz, thank you very much for
that gracious introduction.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:51.620
So in the technology industry there's always
a lot of loose talk about revolutionary change.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.319
Iâ€™m convinced that we're on the cusp of
a revolution worthy of the name and it's one

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.599
driven by the energy efficiency of computing
and communications.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:14.900
Those trends and the efficiency of these devices
are enabling a proliferation of gadgets that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.749
are cheap, that are smart, that are small,
that are connected and that are so low powered

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:27.500
that often times they can scavenge the energy
they need from ambient energy flows.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.310
So as an example of what's becoming possible,
this is a company called Proteus Biomedical.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.910
They've created a one cubic millimeter device
that goes inside a pill.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.819
This pill, in its current carnation, is a
placebo pill that's taken along with other

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.739
medications.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.870
When it hits your stomach, the digestive juices
in your stomach allow it to generate just

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.120
enough power to send a signal to a patch that
you have on your skin near your stomach and

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.459
that then tells the doctor when you took your
pills.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.879
Now, for most of us it's not a problem to
remember when to take your pills but there

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.329
are large classes of populations where you
actually need to know this and for certain

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.000
kinds of diseases this is very, very important.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.410
So this is a tiny thing, it uses very little
power, it scavenges the energy it needs from

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.220
your internal workings and it will transform,
ultimately as more sensors are added to this

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.740
kind of device, it will transform the way
we understand the human body.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.650
So this is just one of many examples, I'm
in the process of compiling case studies of

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.320
different technologies and business models
that are enabled by the trends that I'm gonna

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.120
talk about for the rest of this discussion.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.610
So the research question that I wanted to
answer was how has the energy efficiency of

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.520
computing changed over time?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.210
At the end of the talk I'll discuss what I
think some of the implications are of that

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.950
and I'll ask for your help because all of
you have lots of interesting ideas that I

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.340
don't know about on technologies and business
models that are potentially relevant.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:19.710
So if you have examples for me, by all means,
come up after the talk or send me an email.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.240
So everyone knows about Moore's Law.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.979
It's not a law in the physical sense it's
an empirical observation about economics of

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.370
chip production.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.160
In 1965, he looked at, Gordon Moore looked
at the trends in the production of chips and

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.720
he found that the component density was doubling
roughly every year.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.370
In 1975, he revisited that because of changes
in the economics, the trend moved to doubling

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.240
every two years and that trend in density
has helped for more or less the last 30 plus

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.240
years.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.699
Now it's a characterization of the economics
of chip production not physical limits and

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.990
it's often imprecisely cited.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.949
So for those of you who are interested in
understanding how this, the law as it's precisely

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.879
stated, evolved over time, there's a great
article by Mollick in 2006 in the IEEE Annals

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.280
that I heartily recommend.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.539
So this is Moore's original graph and on the
Y axis, we have the relative manufacturing

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.430
cost per component, on the X axis the number
of components per integrated circuit.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.770
Over time each of these curves is a snapshot
in a particular year and the minimum point

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.129
of this curve is the point of lowest cost
production.

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:49.319
As you can see over time the cost per component
goes down and from the progress in the minima

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.370
of these curves we get, what's now known as
Moore's Law.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.349
[Coughing in background]
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: This has led to more popular

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:58.361
presentations of this.

00:06:58.361 --> 00:07:03.110
This is a graph most of you have seen, number
of transistors per chip over time and this

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.819
is from data from James Larus.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:13.340
It's from '71 to 2006, the doubling time is
about every 1.8 years for transistor density.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.090
So originally when I started looking into
this question of transit efficiency I wanted

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.699
to replicate some work I had done for servers
where I looked at energy efficient-, energy

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.460
use, cost and performance.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:34.319
In the research for this later work I actually
found a great article by Bill Nordhaus who's

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.139
an economist at Yale.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.379
And his, most of his academic work is actually
in the climate area, he's done a great deal

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:46.020
of work on the economics of climate mitigation
but he's also an aficionado of the history

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.020
of computing.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.349
And he compiled a long term trend in performance
and cost for computing that I was able to

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:54.349
build upon.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:58.449
So once I found that work I realized that
it didn't make sense for me to go into the

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:04.139
cost side but instead I wanted to focus just
on energy and performance.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:10.699
So I started looking into this, this was my
calculation from two computers that I had

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:18.530
at my house that had some data on the cost
of the old IBM PC XTAT and the cost of ENIAC.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.320
So this was kind of exploratory.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.180
It looks, more or less, like a straight line
on a log plot.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.290
That's fine, that's cost, calculations per
second, per dollar of per purchase cost.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:36.160
Then I made this graph, computations per kilowatt
hours, similar sort of picture.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.210
But it was this graph that really sent me
down the path to understanding what was going

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.160
on with efficiency of computing.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.420
So my friends at Lawrence Berkeley Lab who
run their super computer group, they had some

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.310
estimate data on the power use performance
of their devices.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:57.330
So they had a Cray-1 back in the day, these
Nurkse machines are a set of gradually more

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:03.560
powerful super computers that they had installed
at the lab and that, that really peaked my

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.670
interest and I said, "Okay, maybe if I fill
in data in this graph I'll learn something

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.000
interesting and important."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.800
So the method that I used here was to focus
on the peak performance of the computers and

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.140
the energy use at peak performance.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:26.650
So number of computations per hour at full
load divided by the measured electricity consumption

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.530
at full load, so full load, full computing
load, maximum performance.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.960
So this says nothing about the machine powering
down this is all about the active performance

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.170
at highest output as well as the energy use
at that period.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:48.420
So I, when you see computations per kilowatt
hour, that's what this means.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.040
Now the Nurkse data, it turns out I didn't
actually end up using those data cause they're

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.090
not measured.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.340
So every point on the graph that I will show
you is measured data for electricity consumption

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:06.370
and performance that's been normalized to
Nordhaus' database or taken directly from

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.920
it for purposes of the performance side.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.070
So there's a lot of different published data
on power use.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.780
There's a great set of reports that was done
for the Office of Naval Research by Weik in

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.710
'55, '61 and '64.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.970
That was back in the day when you could actually
count the number of computers there were and

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.260
there were dozens or low hundreds.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.440
I also visited various archives and people
who had old computers.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.470
In general, when I was doing these measurements
the computer was fully utilized for portables.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.540
There are a few in the database I subtracted
out the screen power.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:52.210
Not it's an important caveat, all of you know
this, but actual performance trends with real

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:57.510
software in use are not necessarily the same
as performance trends as measured from benchmarks

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.870
and those are not the same as transistor trends.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.820
There's often a lot of confusion in the popular
discussion of this, it's important to state

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.070
that up front.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:11.930
Now in the PC era, starting with microprocessors,
performance per computer doubled more or less

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.640
every year and a half.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.710
So this is something that I call the popular
interpretation of Moore's Law, when you talk

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.480
about Moore's Law with most folks that's what
they say.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.930
But Moore, to my knowledge, never talked about
performance just density of components.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:32.410
This is a graph of computations per second
per computer, the maximum computing output

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.450
for a variety of different devices over time.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.770
Most of these data come from the Nordhaus
work.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:44.270
There's several dozen more that I added to
the database but you can see a clear upward

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.820
trend as you'd expect.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.810
You also see this interesting result here.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:54.560
In 1960 around the time of the shift to transistors,
you start to see a bit of a jump in performance

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.250
and we'll see that again in the efficiency
curve as well.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.560
So I did a variety of measurements on different
computers.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.010
I visited the Microsoft computer archive which
is a temperature and humidity controlled vault

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:18.450
that has many old computers including an original
Mac, Fat Max, original IBM PCs and a variety

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.520
of other devices.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.880
I crawled under the desks of some of my colleagues
at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab because

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.360
they had dozens of computers that I could
easily get access to.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.810
My in-laws are photographers, they had some
high powered computers as well and then we'll

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.660
see in a second, Erik Klein is a history of
computing buff and he had a variety of computers

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.170
in his own archives that I couldn't find anywhere
else.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.820
The Computer History Museum here in Mountain
View, I'm sure all of you have visited there,

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:50.170
if you haven't it's an amazing resource and
there's still lots of online activity from

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.180
people who are aficionados of old computers
and, so, people who actually understand how

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.770
vacuum tubes work were very patient in educating
me as to the subtleties.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.940
So does anyone know this computer?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.470
You recognize this?

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: Altair

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.490
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Altair 8800.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.160
This was a kit computer.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:15.112
It appeared on the cover of "Popular Electronics"
in 1976 and it sold 10s of thousands of units.

00:13:15.112 --> 00:13:17.950
It was the first recognizable personal computer.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.890
It looks a lot different than what we're used
to nowadays.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.150
How about this one?

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: Osborne.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.670
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Osborne, yes.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.450
This is what passed for a portable computer.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.470
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: I'd say luggable is more like

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.470
it.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.920
The screen is about four inches, diagonally
it's a monochrome screen and you have to plug

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.970
it in.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.290
So it was really for people who were using
it on site and they had power, they needed

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.550
to carry a computer with them.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.860
This one's obvious, the old Apple 2.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.660
It brings back memories, I did my senior thesis
in college on an Apple 2E.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.200
So this is just, this is Erik Klein, he has
a garage full of old computers, some of which

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.380
I just showed you.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.440
So this is the bottom line result from that
analysis.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.880
The efficiency of computing defined as the
number of computations you can do at full

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:15.370
load divided by the kilowatt hours used during
that same period has doubled more or less

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.050
every year and a half since the 1940s.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.110
So longer than Moore's Law starting with vacuum
tube computers.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:28.380
This results in about a hundred fold improvement
every decade in the efficiency of computing

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:34.930
and, in essence, this trend enabled the existence
of laptops and smart phones.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:42.190
So for the statistics whizzes in the audience,
a good correlation here R squared at .98 for

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:47.120
all computers, .97 for PCs, these statistics
are good as well.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.160
Erik Brynjolfsson is a friend at MIT.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.160
I ran my regressions past him just to make
sure I had done it right and he said, "Yeah,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.930
it all looks good and damn I wish my regressions
looked like that, too."

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.740
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: but doubling time for computations

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:07.220
per kilowatt hour, 1.6 years or so for all
computers, 1.5 years for PCs and slightly

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.260
fast improvement in efficiency during the
vacuum tube era.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:19.440
There's a big jump, as you can see, when we
switch from tubes to transistors.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:27.180
So typically for, on a per switch basis, transistors
are 10 to 20 times more efficient than tubes

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:33.180
but what you see here is a more, is about
a 2 order of magnitude, maybe a little more

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.440
jump in the efficiency.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.720
What I think is going on there, it's not just
having more efficient transistors but it's

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:45.250
also innovation in the way people were using
and designing these devices that led to an

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.950
increase in performance.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:52.280
So not as many devices in the discrete transistor
era but then, of course, by the time we got

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.000
to microprocessors, there were more computers
to measure.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.510
So here are some summary implications, the
things you do to improve performance, at least

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:08.170
over the period I analyzed, almost invariably
improve computations per kilowatt hours.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.330
So for transistors you make them smaller,
you have shorter distance from the source

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:17.010
to the drain, you have fewer electrons in
the transistor that all reduces power use.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.610
For tubes, it's a similar story.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.180
You make them smaller, they have lower capacity
and slower currents that all reduces power

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.730
use as well.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:30.300
The trends that I'm describing here make mobile
and distributed computing ever more feasible.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.930
So I you think about it in terms of a device
that has a battery, the battery life improves

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.390
100 fold per decade at constant computing
power.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:44.140
So this is one example of the result of this,
these trends.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.740
So this is installed base of personal computers,
laptops and desktop.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:54.840
In 2009, for the first time according to IDC
data, laptops outsold desktops.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.360
So this is, this graph shows installed base
but just to give you the perspective here,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.039
laptops outsold desktops in 2009 and they
will continue to do so going forward.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:11.970
So this trend toward more and more laptops
in the installed base is only going to continue

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.669
and increase.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:19.600
This is another interesting example, this
is the full belly, sorry, the big belly trash

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.209
compactor and this is an example of both computing
and communications reducing environmental

00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:28.919
impacts in other parts of a business process.

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:33.320
So these are installed typically in parks,
places where a truck needs to go around and

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.500
pick up the garbage and first off it compacts
the trash five times.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.009
So right off that's five times fewer trips
for the big garbage trucks but it also, it

00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:45.370
sends a text message when it's full.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.240
So it's actually better than an 80 percent
improvement.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.559
And it generates its own power from a photovoltaic
panel on top.

00:17:54.559 --> 00:18:00.919
So self powered device would not be possible
without very efficient information technology

00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:02.529
as well as efficient compacting.

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:06.740
So this is an economic and environmental home
run, clearly.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.740
What it does is it allows you to substitute
bytes for atoms and any time you can do that,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.900
almost invariably, that improves environmental
performance.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.900
So here's another example.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:22.049
I'm going to visit these folks on the 17th
of September, Josh Smith, at University of

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:23.929
Washington, used to be at Intel.

00:18:23.929 --> 00:18:30.509
He's designed sensors that scavenge energy
from stray radio and TV signals.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:37.309
So in active mode these are using 60 microwatts
for similar kinds of devices there are other

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:43.850
possible power sources so light, heat, motion,
bodily fluids as we talked about.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.410
But, clearly, by the time you start getting
useful computing work being conducted at the

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:54.860
microwatt level, you are starting to imagine,
you can start to imagine applications that

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.570
we could never ever do before and that's ultimately
what I think the source of the revolution

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.750
will be.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:10.899
So, other implications here, there's a lot
of focus on big data but Erik Brynjolfsson

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:16.840
at MIT likes to talk, instead, about nano
data, data that's focused on specific transactions

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.220
and specific individuals and our ability to
do very detailed monitoring of transactions

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:30.220
and characteristics of people and institutions
will actually give us great insight invisibility

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.240
into what's going on there in a way that we
never could before.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:40.519
We'll have ever more precise control of processes,
we'll have better ability to do real time

00:19:40.519 --> 00:19:45.679
analysis, what's actually happening in the
world and it will, of course, enable the internet

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.330
of things to come about.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:55.440
So bottom line on the implications here will
have better matching of energy services demanded

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.820
with those supplied.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.309
So people always talk about the end of Moore's
Law and Luiz and I were talking earlier about

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:08.629
the end of Dennard's Scaling, most folks when
they talk about that, they talk about it from

00:20:08.629 --> 00:20:13.830
the perspective view saying, "Here's our technology
as we have it now.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:17.659
We're seeing real problems in how we implement
this going forward and increased density is

00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:19.820
increased performance.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.509
What are we gonna do to fix that?"

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:25.330
I'm gonna take a different view here using
historical perspective here.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:31.809
Back in 1985, Richard Feynman the physicist,
he calculated a theoretical limit to the efficiency

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:32.809
of computing.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:34.610
Now he did it by making an assumption.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.840
He said, "Let's assume a three atom transistor."

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.620
If I do that, using my computation wizardry,
I can come up with if the ultimate physical

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.990
limit for computing.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.990
He did that.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.940
I plotted it on this curve, so here's that
same graph that we saw.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:58.370
If you were to extrapolate the trend out to
that physical limit, it would take us about

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.080
three decades, so to 2041 or so.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.870
What this graph tells you, and it's the same
story you're getting from the folks worried

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.980
about Dennard scaling, is that sometime in
the next few decades we are going to have

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.799
to radically change how we do computing.

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:17.220
So this take comes at it from the theoretical
limit perspective rather than looking at our

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.980
current technology.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:25.220
Now, one interesting little clever tidbit,
earlier this year, researchers at Purdue,

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:30.070
the university not the chicken company, and
the University of New South Wales created

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.379
a reliable one atom transistor.

00:21:32.379 --> 00:21:36.879
It uses electron energy levels within one
atom to do switching.

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.910
Now, it runs at liquid helium temperatures.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.759
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: But what it says is that if

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:49.230
we're, you know, if we, again, can radically
change how we do this computing then there's

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.519
a potential for much higher efficiencies.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:55.059
But, again, we're gonna have to change what
we're doing.

00:21:55.059 --> 00:21:58.080
So there are some big unanswered questions
here.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.019
One, to me is, are there innovations either
in software and hardware that will allow us

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:08.659
to substantially exceed this historical rate
of change in efficiency of computing?

00:22:08.659 --> 00:22:13.019
Conversely, what road blocks might get in
the way and prevent the trends from continuing

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:18.029
after this current innovation pipeline of
the next five to ten years is exhausted?

00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:22.881
And then, of course, what do we do after we
reach Richard Feynman's theoretical limit

00:22:22.881 --> 00:22:24.600
or the one atom transistor limit?

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:31.399
Obviously, you know, I don't have the answer
to those questions but I wanna summarize what

00:22:31.399 --> 00:22:36.750
I think some of these, the big picture, implications
are.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.499
So, it's not just about computing efficiency.

00:22:40.499 --> 00:22:43.409
Low power is actually more important than
efficiency.

00:22:43.409 --> 00:22:48.269
You can make slightly less efficient devices
that are really low power that perform useful

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:55.220
computing service, you can put them in places
like pills or in every device here giving

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:02.360
an IP address to the lights and other things
that don't need to be connected by wiring.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.070
The revolution that I'm talking about is being
driven by a confluence of trends.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.730
So it's the efficiency of computing but also
the efficiency of communications and the efficiency

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.850
of sensors.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:19.909
So as we get MEMS devices that can do sensing
at very low power levels then you get all

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:22.850
sorts of interesting things that we couldn't
do before, and then, of course, efficiency

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.249
of controls.

00:23:24.249 --> 00:23:28.960
As soon as you starting getting these really
low power devices energy storage becomes really

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.880
important and the energy harvesting becomes
important as well.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.419
In most of these devices, the bulk of the
electricity use is actually in idle mode.

00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:44.840
So the active power is not the most critical
thing in many cases, it's actually how fast

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.390
can you put the device to sleep and how low
can you make the power use go?

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:56.190
So the engineering challenges are different
from building the fastest computer at its

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:00.759
peak output, that's a very different set of
engineering challenges than building one that

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:06.640
is elegantly simple, that powers down quickly,
that has very low idle power, it's a kind

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:14.369
of elegant simplicity that's a little different
than the focus on ever more powerful active

00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:15.950
mode performance.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.889
So let me just summarize results, here, so
we leave time for questions.

00:24:19.889 --> 00:24:25.840
In the PC era, the performance per computer
doubled every year and a half.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.679
The efficiency of computing also doubled every
year and a half during that period.

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:32.369
So those things are connected.

00:24:32.369 --> 00:24:36.440
From ENIAC to the present, computations per
kilowatt hour doubled, more or less, every

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.610
1.6 years.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:45.350
And the things you do to improve performance
also almost invariably improve energy efficiency

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.350
of computing.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:51.090
We're far from the theoretical limits but,
as all of you know, there are some technological

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.360
challenges that we're facing in the coming
years.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.350
The biggest implications of these trends is
from mobile technologies, distributed technologies

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:07.250
that are small and cheap and connected and
the focus now, not just in the popular press

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:13.309
but in the engineering world, is a focus on
low power, figuring out ways to make tiny,

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:19.149
cheap, low power devices that can be self
powered and put in places that we never could

00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:20.940
imagine putting them before.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.990
And that's, as I said, a different set of
engineering challenges.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.460
Some of the best engineering talent in the
world is now focusing on that area and I think

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.369
great things will come from that.

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:36.909
So, uh, my three year old, three and a half
year old twins have better Spanish pronunciation

00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:39.740
than I do but, Viva la Revolucion!

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.490
This is where I wanna ask for your help.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:47.760
So, if any of you are aware of technologies,
business models, companies doing interesting

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.279
work enabled by ultra low power, ultra high
efficiency, energy scavenging devices, I would

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:55.440
like to hear about it.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.659
So come up after the talk, send me an email
and let me know what you're thinking.

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:07.529
With that I will say thanks to my funders
and coauthors and ask any quest-, answer any

00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:08.630
questions that you may have.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.990
&gt;&gt;male #3: Have you done any comparisons between
the rise in efficiency and the rise in the

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.129
total energy use of computers?

00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:22.230
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: So the question is, have I looked
at the relationship between the rise in efficiency

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.769
and the rise in total energy use of computers?

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:30.000
The most recent work that I've done on total
energy use is in data centers alone.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.899
So I haven't done careful analysis on the
whole IT picture.

00:26:34.899 --> 00:26:36.809
That's, I think, what you're getting at, right?

00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:41.950
Because as you have more and more distributed
devices there's more energy associated with

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.320
these different devices.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.250
So back in 2000 or so, there were a couple
of guys running around talking about how the

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.669
internet was gonna use half of all electricity
in ten years and we did pretty careful analysis

00:26:56.669 --> 00:27:02.179
to summarize for PCs and all office equipment
and data centers, everything else, the number

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:06.299
for the US was around three percent of all
electricity use.

00:27:06.299 --> 00:27:10.850
My bet is that that's a little higher now
but it's probably still single digit percentage

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.460
because we're, what's happening is we're at
the same time as we're increasing our usage

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.480
of computing but we're also starting to shift
towards technologies that are more efficient.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:25.429
So a shift away from CRT screens, shift towards
laptops, more computing being done on hand-held

00:27:25.429 --> 00:27:26.950
devices.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.370
So you have counter veiling trends that it's
clear that there are, that there is, we're

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:36.299
using a little more electricity for IT than
we did in 2000 but it's not exploding in the

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:39.769
same way as the amount of information services
is exploding.

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:44.739
&gt;&gt;Luiz Barroso: One of the, we're looking
at these from a technology standpoint, you

00:27:44.739 --> 00:27:51.860
sort of understand the economics better than
I do, Chuck Moore, another Moore not that

00:27:51.860 --> 00:28:01.869
one, an architect at AMD used to talk about
this virtual cycle in computing which new

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:07.019
technology was created, that created devices
that were totally amazing and those devices

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:13.179
had a market value that allowed you to get
a lot of money to invest in new technology,

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:15.809
right, and this kept going forward.

00:28:15.809 --> 00:28:21.759
At the time that he mentioned that at first,
he was concerned that, then being in the PC

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:28.399
business, that perhaps computers are fast
enough and therefore this virtual cycle would

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:34.570
end due to the fact that it was harder and
harder to create new value on top of what

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.120
they had already at that point.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.370
What do you, what do you think of that?

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:46.780
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: So the question relates to the
idea that somehow as you, you reach kind of

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:53.289
a saturation in the performance of the, I'm
sorry, the need for people's, for computing

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:58.290
for people that the PC business in particular
would be effected by this.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.290
That's one way to-

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.290
&gt;&gt;Luiz Barroso: That's one example.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.290
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: That's one example.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:08.809
So what I think you're seeing is devices that
are coming closer and closer to tasks.

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:14.239
So the PC is a general purpose device and
I think we have saturated, for most folks,

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:19.409
you know, my mom using email, she doesn't
need much more performance, right?

00:29:19.409 --> 00:29:24.190
But what we do need is distributed performance,
distributed computing that is much closer

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:30.820
to the actual tasks that we're trying to perform
and can help us make decisions in real time.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.840
You aren't gonna carry your desktop computer
with you all around but you have your phone.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:41.610
So I think, I don't think it's going to result
in a slower innovation path or less value,

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.649
it's just gonna be value to different companies.

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:51.559
Companies who are able, then, to create innovation
for particular sets of users, for particular

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:56.140
kinds of tasks and deliver that innovation
to folks who need it.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:03.039
So, a strange example, I saw a scale that
is connected via Wi-Fi to the internet.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.039
&gt;&gt;Luiz Barroso: I have that.

00:30:04.039 --> 00:30:05.039
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: You have that scale.

00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.039
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Okay.

00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:09.989
So this is a very interesting thing because
you, how much do you think a scale costs?

00:30:09.989 --> 00:30:11.249
Just a normal scale.

00:30:11.249 --> 00:30:12.249
&gt;&gt;female #1: 20 bucks.

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:13.590
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: 20 bucks, 30 bucks.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.519
How much do you think they sell these scales
for?

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:16.559
&gt;&gt;Luiz Barroso: $100.

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.610
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: $100.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:24.330
Okay, so, here is an example where, this is
pretty much the same device, it has a very,

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:29.450
you know, some chips, a few other little things
that maybe cost 5 or 10 bucks but they're

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.480
delivering customer value that makes you wanna
pay 100 bucks for it.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.830
So you can't lie about your weight anymore.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.269
But you have, you know, automatically it comes
up to the Cloud and it, you know, creates

00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:44.380
a nice graph for you of what's happening over
time.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.809
So I think that's an example where the customer
value that you're creating is because you're

00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:53.590
really close to their need for information
and their decision and that's a different

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.220
thing from creating a general purpose computing
device.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.509
I think we're gonna really focus much more
on that need for specific, focus on specific

00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:03.509
tasks.

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:06.240
&gt;&gt;male #4: Yes, hi, I had a quick question
for you.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.239
Could you comment on the trends in the chemical
batteries?

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:11.659
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Chemical?

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:16.460
&gt;&gt;male #4: Batteries, cause I can see that
there's this like, on a log scale you have

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.519
this straight line for computing power increasing
over the decades but what's been the situation

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:24.519
with the batteries innovation in chemical
batteries?

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:32.070
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: OK, so the question is on the
rate of innovation in chemical batteries and

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.340
obviously the trends are, the changes are
much slower.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.489
So we're starting to see people, and that's
gonna be part of the case study work that

00:31:39.489 --> 00:31:44.179
I'm doing is to show those trends as well
over time, for batteries.

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:50.480
But, much, much slower and what, because the
computing trends improved so fast we're getting

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.960
now into the regime where current battery
chemistries can allow us to create really

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.600
small devices.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.730
So we're getting a little bit better and as
people focus more on, for example, lithium

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:06.480
ion batteries and other similar technologies
for cars, we're starting to see real R and

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.750
D going into this in a way, you know, 40 years
ago there just wasn't that kind of R and D

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.609
going into batteries in the, at the same scale.

00:32:13.609 --> 00:32:19.779
So I think there will be improvements there
but because the computing trends improved

00:32:19.779 --> 00:32:24.730
so fast that's where most of the change is
gonna happen and it will start to bring more

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.160
and more applications into the realm of feasibility
for certain battery chemistries.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.919
You're also starting to see people playing
around with flow batteries and fuel cells

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:39.980
and other things like that and so, I visited
MIT about a month and a half ago and one of

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.740
their scientists there showed me a device
they were gonna use for a space mission.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.629
The only way they could get it to operate
for 5 years was a little fuel cell.

00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:53.779
No battery technology was gonna do it and
so I think that there's certainly a trend,

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:57.649
you know, there's ways to improve battery
chemistry stuff but really the action is on

00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:58.649
the electronic side.

00:32:58.649 --> 00:33:02.710
&gt;&gt;male #5: So, I think you mentioned this
a little bit already but I was wondering if

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:11.570
you could say more about the, the trends that
we've seen in both aggregate and energy consumption

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:16.039
and the use of electronics and computers and
things like that as a relative percentage

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:21.869
of that and also the trade-offs in energy
consumption we see as more and more things

00:33:21.869 --> 00:33:24.539
go virtual and go online and go to the Cloud.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:27.179
Do you have data or research on either of
those things?

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:32.279
Like, I'm thinking for example in my home,
you know, I've got a lot more gadgets now

00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:36.999
than I used to but the total power I use in
my house hasn't changed that much over time

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:42.070
and the bulk of it is, you know, goes to lighting
and appliances and things like that that are

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.070
completely different technologies.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.580
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: So you have a bunch of things
going on there, so the question relates to

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.200
what have been these kinds of aggregate trends
in total electricity use and how does that

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.429
relate to our increased use of competing technology?

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:54.899
&gt;&gt;male #5: Right.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:59.710
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: So, my best guess now is we're
talking single digit percent in the US for

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:08.149
total direct electricity used by IT equipment
but what you're seeing is, let's call it five

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:09.690
or six percent.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.860
You've got that five or six percent of direct
electricity used for computing, couple percent

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:20.260
of that is data centers, but we also have
the other 95 percent which is being effected,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.450
in many cases, by the IT equipment.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:28.670
And you also have the rest of fuel consumption,
non electricity consumption, that could potentially

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.179
affect it as well.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:35.770
So I think it's important to track the total
electricity used by IT, I think it's something

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.169
I've done, you know, something I've done for
a long time, I think it's important to do

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:45.110
but I think it's also important to try to
understand the effect of that IT on the rest,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.950
the other 95 percent.

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.960
And that, to me, is the more interesting question.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:56.440
So one example that I did, that I worked on
recently relates to a trade-off between buying

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:03.040
music on a CD versus downloading it and we
found that even in the best case for CD, sending

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.800
a CD compared to the worst case for downloading,
that it was still a 40 percent savings and

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.450
it's much likely to be in emissions, it's
much likely to be more than that.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.630
So I think that it's important to start to
do more and more case studies like that to

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:22.340
understand these systemic effects because
direct electricity use, while it's more important,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.760
it's not something we should be getting very
excited about because it's, at the end of

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.390
the day it's a pretty good use for the electricity,
in my view.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:35.790
And on the data center side, you've got, let's
just call it 90 percent of data center floor

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:40.780
space is in house data centers in companies
whose main business is not computing.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.720
It's, in general, very, very inefficient.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:50.110
Utilization for servers of five to 15 percent,
a number of comatose servers not doing anything

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:55.320
but still using electricity, 20, 25, 30 percent
of the servers.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.220
Huge inefficiencies there as there'll be a
shift more towards Cloud implementations there'll

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:06.190
be actually a reduction, increase in the efficiency
of producing those services as a reduction

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.190
in energy use.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:11.860
So there's a huge potential for improvements
in data centers simply by shifting towards

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.440
a more efficient way of delivering the services.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.660
So there's a lot of moving parts in this but
you're asking the right question I just think

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.340
the focus really needs to be on the other
95 percent and what the IT can be doing for

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.340
that.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.190
&gt;&gt;male #6: When you mentioned five to six
percent usage by IT does that count the cooling

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.780
of those data centers or is it-

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.780
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Yes, so the two percent-

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.780
&gt;&gt;male #6: so it's the total.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.730
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: for data centers, two percent
for data centers includes everything related

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.730
to the infrastructure.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.730
&gt;&gt;male #6: Okay, thank you.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.430
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: The cooling, fans, pumps, everything
like that.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.910
&gt;&gt;male #7: I had a similar question about
your data set that span many decades, did

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:50.620
you try to make, include in some way the cooling
or other overhead outside of the, you know,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.620
the ENIACs and the-

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.280
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: So that's a good question, actually,
for this particular set of trends I did not

00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.360
include cooling cause I wanted to get at the
characteristics of the IT equipment itself.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.280
&gt;&gt;male #7: I wonder if the effective efficiency
doubling time for some periods of history

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.370
actually been shorter.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.860
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: it's a good question.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:16.720
I think that there's been changes in the way
that services have been delivered that would

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.290
be hard to track but I agree that it's something
that should be looked at.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:24.460
&gt;&gt;male #8: Have you looked at the delivered
computation as opposed to the computational

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.460
efficiency?

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.110
In particular what I'm thinking of is the
software efficiency, now, 20 years ago I had

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:35.370
a Window Manager that was about as responsive
as the one today but it takes way more instructions.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:40.840
&gt;&gt;Jon Koomey: Yeah, so the question relates
to looking at software efficiency as opposed

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.910
to hardware and this is to me, actually this
is a fascinating area because in the past

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.690
we've mainly thought of performance as a question
of hardware.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:53.440
We said Intel will give us or AMD will give
us more performance, we just don't have to

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.520
worry about our code.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.550
Well I think that's changing particularly
as the need for parallelism, you know, you

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.500
have a lot of cords you have to change your
software that's very important.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.911
It turns out that there are big potential
gains there.

00:38:04.911 --> 00:38:08.980
There are some folks at LBL that have looked
at what's called code design of software and

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.980
hardware.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.550
This is a term that comes from the embedded
system space but they're starting to apply

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:18.750
into the super computer space because when
they came to Steve Chu when he was the director

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:25.640
of the lab there and said our new super computer
is gonna use 200 megawatts and they said,

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:33.390
Steve Chu said, "No, go back and redesign
it" and they started to look at ways to co-design

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:38.300
the software and hardware and they were finding,
you know, tours of magnitude improvement in

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:43.420
the efficiency just because they optimized
the software and the hardware together to

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.180
attack certain kinds of problems.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.320
They were gonna see a lot more of that and
it's really true, I think everyone here has

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.980
a story about, you know, we're doing the same
basic thing using a whole lot more cycles.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.420
And part of what I think goes on is that the
costs of inefficient code are not being brought

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:04.920
to bear on the people who are designing it
and as soon as you can get to the place where

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.300
someone selling data centers services is able
to give that information to the people using

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:15.470
the services, when we get to that point, then
you're gonna start to see much more optimization.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:20.790
We're not there yet but you can imagine it
being done to technology that exists today

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.120
and that's where I think we need to get to
so that people actually understand the true

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.960
total cost of a computing cycle when they're
using it and then they'll change their behavior.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.960
Thanks to all of you.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:31.961
[Applause]
