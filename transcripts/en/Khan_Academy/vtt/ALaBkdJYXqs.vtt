00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.377
Now that we know that we can
treat units algebraically,

00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:04.960
let's see if we can
use that knowledge

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.280
to figure out what the
units of a variable

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.110
might be from some formula.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.520
So let's say that I am given
this formula, that capital K is

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.380
equal to lowercase
b over s squared.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.530
And let's say that
we are also told

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.360
that b is going to
be in centimeters,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:39.160
and s is going to be in
grams per centimeter.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.670
So that's the units of s
is grams per centimeter.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.870
B is in centimeters.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.140
What is the units
of K going to be?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.120
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.490
and think about this.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.200
Well, let's try it out with
just some value and some values

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.770
for b and s, and
see what happens.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.420
Let's say that b is
equal to 1 centimeter,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.290
and I'm just using 1, because
it makes the math really easy.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.140
And let's say that s is
1 gram per centimeter.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.880
So, we know that
K is going to be

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.550
equal to 1 centimeter-- that's
b-- over 1 gram per centimeter

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.050
squared.

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:30.980
Now, we've already
talked about the idea

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.720
that we should treat our units
like algebraic quantities,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.660
so this should be equal to
1 centimeter over-- now,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.460
you could treat this
as 1 squared times--

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.410
let me rewrite this.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.370
You could rewrite this
as 1 squared times grams

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.310
per centimeter squared, and
this just comes out of the idea

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.010
that if I have a
times b to some power,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.080
say, the second power, that's
equal to a squared b squared.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.220
And we also know that if I
have a/b to some power, say,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.100
squared, that's the same thing
as a squared over b squared.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.800
So I could rewrite
this as this is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.390
going to be equal to 1
centimeter over-- 1 squared is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:28.036
just 1-- 1 gram squared
per centimeter squared.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:29.660
Now, what is this
going to be equal to?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.620
Let me write it over here.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.730
Well, that's going to be 1
centimeter in our numerator.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.472
Let me do it in that
green color, just

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:38.690
to keep track of things.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.060
1 centimeter from our numerator,
instead of dividing it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930
by 1 gram squared
centimeter squared,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.400
I can multiply it times
the reciprocal of this.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.945
So times 1/1, which
is just going to be 1,

00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:55.410
but let me just
write it that way

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.670
just so that you get that I'm
taking the reciprocal of 1.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.580
So 1/1 times the reciprocal of
grams squared per centimeter

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.080
squared.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.788
Well, that's just
going to be centimeters

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:09.720
squared per grams squared.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.380
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.990
Well, I have 1 times 1, so if I
take the numeric parts, 1 times

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.320
1, it's just going to be 1.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.280
And now remember, we can
treat the units algebraically.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.980
I have a centimeters
times centimeters squared.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.290
Well, that's going to get me to
centimeters cubed, centimeters

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.640
to the third power.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.190
And this isn't c times
n to the third power.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.897
This is centimeters
to the third power--

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:39.480
or you could write
it like this if you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.140
wanted to be clear about it--
per-- and over here we still

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.680
have grams squared--
per grams squared.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.680
So the units, I just picked
the numbers 1 arbitrarily,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.390
so the 1 isn't
what matters here.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.144
I just picked those numbers.

00:03:54.144 --> 00:03:55.810
What matters here is
what are the units.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.810
What are the units
for this formula when

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.200
b is in centimeters and s
is in grams per centimeters?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.180
We see that K is
going to be expressed

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.820
in terms of cubic
centimeters per gram squared.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.830
And I can't tell
you offhand kind

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.730
of an intuitive physical
representation of that,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.760
but you at least know the units.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.160
You have cubic
centimeters, which

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.030
you can view as a volume--
divided by, I guess,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.170
a mass squared.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.560
And a mass squared is a little
bit less intuitive for me,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.450
but at least we know
what the units of K

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.940
would be in this formula
given the units of b and s.
