TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.173
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:06.160
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.010
We recently announced
a set of new features

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.430
to make it easier for users to
find, interact, and reengage

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.590
with your app on
Google Assistant.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.280
Details are on the post,
linked the description below.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.730
Back in September, we worked
with Hackster.io to encourage

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
y'all to build smart, connected
devices using Android Things

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
and post your projects to the
Developer Challenge for Android

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.470
Things.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.250
The winners are in, and you can
check them out on this post.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.050
The developer preview
of TensorFlow Lite

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.350
is now available.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.960
It's TensorFlows
lightweight solution

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.610
for mobile and
embedded devices that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.910
enables low latency inference
of on-device machine learning

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.910
models.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.597
Tensorflow Lite is lightweight,
cross-platform, and fast.

00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:48.180
Take a look at the
post for everything

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.010
you need to get started.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.050
As part of TensorFlow
Lite, we also

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.750
released an on-device
conversational model

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.020
and a demo app that provides an
example of a natural language

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.884
application powered
by TensorFlow Lite.

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:02.550
We hope this will
make it easier for you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.890
to build new machine
intelligence features powered

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.990
by on-device inference.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.610
SLING is an experimental system
for parsing natural language

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.090
text directly into a
representation of its meaning

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.370
as a semantic frame graph.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.470
The output frame graph
directly captures

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.360
the semantic
annotations of interest

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.930
to the user while avoiding the
pitfalls of pipelined systems

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
by not running any
intermediate stages.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.280
DialogFlow Enterprise Edition
is now available in beta.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.500
It expands on all the
benefits of DialogFlow,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.020
offering greater
flexibility and support

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.330
to meet the needs of
large scale businesses.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.630
We also announced speech
integration within DialogFlow,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
enabling you to build rich,
voice-based applications.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.450
Check out the post
for more details.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.550
Cloud Spanner multi-region
configurations

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.260
are now generally available.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.450
With this release, we've
extended Cloud Spanner's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.790
transactions and
synchronous replication

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.310
across regions and continents.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.140
That means no matter
where your users may

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.380
be, apps backed by Cloud
Spanner can read and write

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.009
up-to-date data globally, and
do so with minimal latency

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.810
for end users.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.940
Container-diff is a tool
for quickly comparing

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.210
container images, and
it's now open source.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.980
The GitHub link is on the post.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.830
Firebase Cloud Messaging is
a cross-platform messaging

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.220
solution that reliably
delivers messages at no cost.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.430
It sends over 400
billion messages per day.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.760
We've recently announced a new
RESTful API, the Firebase Cloud

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
Messaging HTTP v1 API that
makes it safer and easier

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.510
to send messages to your
cross-platform applications.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.350
Examples are on the post,
linked in the description below.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.690
We're excited to announce
Google Developers Launchpad

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.150
Africa, our new hands-on
comprehensive mentorship

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.020
program tailored exclusively
to startups based in Africa.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.830
Applications are due on December
11, 9:00 AM Pacific time,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.920
and the first class will
start in early 2018.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.550
Please like,
subscribe, and share.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.410
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.020
Thanks for watching another
episode of The Dev Show.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.290
If you'd like to catch some
of our previous episodes,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.360
