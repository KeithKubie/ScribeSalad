revenue side that meant that it wasn't
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700

sustainable and so I needed to look very

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
sustainable and so I needed to look very
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.700
sustainable and so I needed to look very
carefully at what the realities were and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
carefully at what the realities were and
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229

I had the sense in the first year like

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
I had the sense in the first year like
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.029

can't do five operas for 30 million
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869
can't do five operas for 30 million
dollars the answer was that they didn't

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
dollars the answer was that they didn't
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520
dollars the answer was that they didn't
do 16 hours for 40 million dollars they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
do 16 hours for 40 million dollars they
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.680

oddly though troubling that information

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
oddly though troubling that information
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420
oddly though troubling that information
was it was a relief because it meant I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
was it was a relief because it meant I
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280
was it was a relief because it meant I
wasn't being held to a standard that was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
wasn't being held to a standard that was
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.760
wasn't being held to a standard that was
unachievable rather that it costs more

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
unachievable rather that it costs more
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250
unachievable rather that it costs more
money the flip side of that was that I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
money the flip side of that was that I
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100
