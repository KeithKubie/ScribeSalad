[Norvig] So now I'm ready to tackle the main function, poker.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And we said it takes as input a list of hands,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it's going to return the best hand.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So it takes as input the list, returns the best hand.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I haven't quite figured out how to write the function itself,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but at least I've got the prototype going.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, out of a list of hands we want poker to return the highest ranking hand.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Do we know of something that will help us do that? Think about it.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Do you know of a built-in function in Python that selects the highest ranking item from a list?

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you do, go ahead and give its name.
