00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.660
23andMe is not the only service out there that

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.700
offers ancestry testing. There are other companies like ancestry.com which

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.540
also have very large databases for comparison. But either way,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.980
finding long lost relatives can really be tricky business, and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.210
you might want some more expert help. At least

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540
more than you can find on a company's website. So

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.080
I think it's time we actually met CC Moore, a

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.550
genetic genealogist who runs the popular blog, Your Genetic Genealogist.
