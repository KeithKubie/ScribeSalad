00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.640
Let's say that the economy
of country A is stagnating.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.150
It may be facing a
deflationary crisis.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.240
So central bank tries
to print as much money

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.440
and lower interest rates
as much as possible.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.650
And an investor can
go into country A

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.950
and borrow in A's currency
at a 1% interest rate.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.990
Let's also say that in
the rest of the world,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.750
and in particular, in
country B, one can actually

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.580
make relatively, or what you
perceive as safe investments

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.040
at a higher interest rate
in country B's currency.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.820
So let's say that you
can get a 5% return.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.490
So you could imagine some
opportunistic investors might

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.720
say, wow, I could borrow
in country A's currency.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.620
And so let's say they go into
country A. They borrow at 1%.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.160
In particular, they borrow 100--
and I won't call them dollars

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.960
or yens, I'll call them--
or anything, or euros,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.190
or anything else- I'll call
them 100 A's, where the name

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.730
of A's currency is an A. So they
borrow 100 A's, and let's say

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.470
the conversion rate
is-- at right now,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.160
at this point in time,
one A is equal to two B's.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.887
So they go into
currency markets,

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:03.970
and then they exchange it.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.280
For every one A,
they get two B's.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.880
So they exchange it for 200 B's.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.430
And then they go and invest it.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.710
They are investing in B's.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.500
So this is-- they're borrowing
in A's and they're investing

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.400
in B's.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.750
And so what would happen?

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.680
Well, they're going to get
5% on their money in B's.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.060
So 5% of 200.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.510
They're going to get 10 B's--
let's say that's per year--

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.980
so they're going to get 10
B's in interest every year.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.310
And then they can convert that.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160
They can convert
those 10 B's, if we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.240
assume the exchange
rate holds constant.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.790
And that is a big assumption.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.260
They can convert
that to five A's

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.270
based on the same exchange rate.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.490
And so that will be
five A's, but they only

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.430
have to pay one A in interest.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.770
So let me divert some over here.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.190
So they only have to
pay one A in interest.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.510
And so they're just going
to get four A's per year.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.780
If we assume constant
exchange rate,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.380
they're going to get four A's
a year for free-- assuming

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.919
that they could
continue to do this.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.580
And then they could take those
four A's and convert them

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.470
to B's, or whatever
other currency they want.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.350
So they could
just-- you could say

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.250
they're getting four
A's for free every year,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.130
or they're getting eight
B's per year, every year.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.540
And this little process,
this little trade,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.500
this little perceived
arbitrage that's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.100
going on right over here, this
is called the carry trade.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.310
And you might think about well,
where would this break down?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.390
Well, the main area where
this would break down

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.690
is while you are borrowing
in A and then investing

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.850
in B, if A's
currency appreciates,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.400
especially relative
to B's currency.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.990
Because then what happens, even
though you have this interest

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.580
rate discrepancy, and
even though you feel like

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.060
you're getting a lot of 10 B's.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.490
Those 10 B's are going to
give you fewer and fewer

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.910
A's if A keeps appreciating.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.680
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000
you're going to, in terms
of B's, even though you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.070
think you only owe 1% interest,
A is also going to appreciate.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.510
So in terms of B's, you're
going to owe more and more

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.240
B's every year if A appreciates.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.954
Now what's worked out
in the carry trade,

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:13.620
or at least the most
famous of the carry

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.930
trades, where in starting
in the mid-90's, people

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.780
started borrowing in Japan
because they had low interest,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.630
and then investing other
places like the US,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.150
and especially other
places, like Iceland,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.710
is that the more people do
this-- so you can imagine,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.730
if a lot of people
keep doing this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.520
and it becomes kind of a big
herd affect, what happens?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.780
You have a bunch of
people borrowing in A

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.010
and then converting it to B.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130
So they're taking this
currency and converting it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.070
to the magenta currency.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.980
And if that happens,
then you actually

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.280
have the opposite effect.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.090
Then you get a benefit on top
of the interest rate discrepancy

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.920
because that means the demand
for B's currency goes up,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.810
and demand for A's goes down.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.800
And this is essentially
what happened,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.210
relative to Japan-- and a
lot of the rest of the world

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.750
when Japan had it's
lower interest rates, all

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.320
the way until really about 2008.
