00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.460
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.921
Doug?

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.133
To see what kind of lethal
damage your halberd will do,

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.551
we'll take your
halberd and deliver

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:12.971
thrust, hacks, and
attempt to dismount

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.889
that dummy with its hook.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.765
Phil, you're up first.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:16.516
Are you ready for this?

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.559
Yes, sir.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.852
Let's do this.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.311
I spent a long time
making that thing

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.396
and I want to see it work.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.413
All right, Phil,
your spear tip

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.916
is sharp, not only at the
point but its edges also.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:46.838
Your ax head, not only did
it begin and break the ribs,

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.590
it went in and cut
the internal organs

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.884
that were behind the ribs.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.636
And your hook blade,
it dug into the ribs

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.389
and dismounted the
dummy from the horse.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.601
Overall, your weapon
here will kill.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.935
- Thank you.
- Good job.

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.145
All right, Jonathan,
you're up next.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.688
You ready?
- Let's do it.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.106
My halberd's a brute.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.941
I'm excited to hear Doug
tell me it will kill.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.276
That will make my son happy.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.778
I want to see some
blood and gore and guts.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.672
All right, Jonathan, on
the thrust your spear tip

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:33.802
right here penetrated deep and
created a deep wound channel.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.930
Your ax head here,
pretty much it was just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.432
the tip that penetrated
into the chest,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.100
and also it's the diaphragm.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.479
Your hook broke the ribs,
got into the organs,

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.982
and dismounted the whole
dummy from the horse.

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.776
The most important thing
about this whole thing

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.320
is it will kill.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.448
All right, bladesmiths,
next up is a strength test.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.283
Ben?

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.911
To test the strength and
durability of your halberds,

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.455
I will be chopping into
this corrugated sheet steel.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.916
Remember, this test is
all about what the steel

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.209
does to your
halberds and not what

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.377
your halberds do to the steel.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.336
Phil, you're up first.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.504
You ready?
- Yes, sir.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.571
Well Phil, your halberd
held up perfectly.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.198
All of the faces on it
are still razor sharp.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.826
There's no deformation
that I can see.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.452
Overall, very well done.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:42.620
Thank you.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.621
Jonathan, you're up.
You ready?

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.205
Get you some.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.019
Well Jonathan, on the hits,
your edges held up pretty well.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.979
I don't see any
problems with them.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.647
The one thing that does
concern me is the blade

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.858
has taken a bit of a
bend to one side here,

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.568
but the edges and the
points seem to have done

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.320
pretty well in the penetration.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.739
The whole thing held
up, still solid.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.782
Well done.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.869
Phil, Jonathan, you've
both done some amazing work

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.579
on your German halberds,
and they performed

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.539
very well in our weapons tests.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.750
However, in this arena
of competition only

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.252
the best weapon can win.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:40.470
And our next "Forged in
Fire" champion is Phil.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.681
Congratulations, you are our
new "Forged and Fire" champion.

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:46.601
Jonathan, unfortunately your
weapon did not make the cut.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.771
Ben Abbott's going
to tell you why.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.482
Jonathan, at the end of the
day your halberd was heavy,

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.776
more difficult to wield, and
took a bend in the strength

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.488
passed, and for those
reasons we had to let you go.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.741
Jonathan, please
surrender your weapon.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.368
I feel honored
to have competed

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:06.329
with Phil and the other two
guys in this competition.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.664
I had a good time.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.167
If you do compete
in this, be ready.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.168
Have your skills on point
because you will be tested.
