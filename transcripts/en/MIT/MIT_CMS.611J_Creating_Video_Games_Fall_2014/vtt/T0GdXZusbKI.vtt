PHILIP TAN: So
one thought that I

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.420
have for educators who are
running those classes is

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.190
be very clear to yourself and
then to the students about

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.320
whether you are running a
class about game design,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.840
or game programming,
or project management.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.657
When we started
this class, we were

00:00:25.657 --> 00:00:27.740
trying to be as clear as
possible to the students.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.650
This is a class
project management.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.460
You will do all
those other things

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.560
in the process of this
class, and many of you

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.720
are here for that reason.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920
But that's the important thing
that we want you to understand.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.490
And it is important because
it gives you clarity

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.080
as an educator on
how you're going

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.663
to be assessing your students,
how you're going to be teaching

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:51.710
your students, what you're going
to be valuing over the other.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.350
The game can be poorly
designed and maybe have bugs,

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.010
but the team clearly
understands how

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.460
to communicate with each other.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.900
Well, that is a
team that should be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.360
awarded for their work, at least
in the version that we teach.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.752
Other schools are
definitely free to have

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:13.085
a different perspective on this.

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:14.790
It could be about
the quality of code.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.520
It could be about how
brave the students were

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.970
when it came to design.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.580
And you can award
it accordingly,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.830
but you've got to be very,
very clear both to yourself

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.790
and to the students.
