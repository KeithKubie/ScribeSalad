for gaining more than

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.441 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
7% of their original

earn small paychecks

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.379 line:0%
than average size women.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.748
- That's right, that's right.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:17.784 align:start size:84% position:16%
You're momma's so
fat she suffers from

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.519
systemic bias in
a job market that

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.654 align:start size:88% position:13%
marginalizes her just
based on her appearance.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.789
Oh!

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.159
(audience laughing and clapping)

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.862
- My worse thing, we
going to be hungry.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.297
That was the worst
feeling in the world.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.532
That was devastating.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.034
You know, when you
go to be hungry,

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.869
it's just like, it's
a nightmare. You know.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.104
And you have these dreams
that you eating stuff,

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.273
waking up, your pillow gone.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.775
You know.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.278 align:start size:94% position:6%
- If there was a pill
that you could take, okay.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.413
That would mean
you could get out

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.947
of your wheelchair for good,

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.616
but it would mean
that you would be

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.318
irreversibly obese for
the rest of your life,

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.387
would you take it?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.022
- Oh, ah. No.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.457
- [Larry] Keep it 100.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.726 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No, I wouldn't, because
I don't know where

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.695
I'd get all my comedy from
cause my parents love me, so.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.831 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey America,
