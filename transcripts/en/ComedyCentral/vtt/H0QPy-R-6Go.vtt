If you think Wawa is a store,
you won't mind prison.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.137
Yeah, that's actually been
our motto our whole-

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.505
But if you've been having
a personal chef,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.240
like an omelet chef
every morning.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.676
If you think Wawa's a store,
you're just correct.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.313
And you've just have traveled
this great land.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.349
If prison food is like
Wawa food,

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:18.151
well then sign this guy up.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.319
I'm gonna shoot this guy
in the head right now.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:22.021
What do you want me to do?
Off DJ Lou?

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.756
Yeah, I'll do it on camera.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.024
I'll do it on camera.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.261
You tell me I get Wawa every day
and I get to talk to the cause.

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.331
I get to write my slam poems.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:35.101
But you know somewhere there's
a lab for all the Wa food.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.937
And there's a moment where one
of the heads of the company

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.042
is trying the new hamburger.
He'll be like this is fantastic.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:45.445
You know there's a massive
process for every product.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.314
Yeah absolutely and they do
little test tube drops.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.683
Now that tastes like ranch.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.423
I did a commercial for Doritos.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.724
It was that Super Bowl
commercial thing

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.359
that everyone does every year.
Do you know about ...

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.995
I remember when you did that, it
was you and Matt McCarthy right?

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:06.666
Yeah, it was Doritos beer
is the spot that we won with.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.900
We didn't win
the whole thing.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.403
So we got to go and they were
giving us a tour of Frito

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.538
Lay Doritos
employees and stuff.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.440
And one guy was like yeah
we can make a Dorito

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.342
that tastes like anything.
I was like what do you mean.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.144
And he was like
fresh mown grass.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.679
I was like that's
pretty interesting.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.514
And he was like we made one
that tastes like fear.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:22.748
What?

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:24.817
Because fear is like
a pheromone you release.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.886
We made a chip
that tastes like fear.

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.821
And then he goes we made one
that tastes like mother.

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:30.056
What?

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.657
That is like what do you mean.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.859
Terrifying.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:36.028
He goes it tastes like the
sensation of being a child

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.132
with your mother, that pheromone
that your mom releases

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:40.433
when she's breast feeding.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.269
They were like would
that be a popular flavor.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.805
Just breast milk, they just have
a bunch of ladies with udders

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:48.141
sitting there getting pumped.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.043
They go mother's
almost ready for tasting.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:54.647
I don't mind so much, I read my
red book and just sit here.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.917
Oh you just got out
of the milking station.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.452
They could do a combo flavor

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:01.787
that makes you feel like
you're afraid of your mother.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.089
Oh, that's what it is, yeah.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.724
Or they could just have
my mom raise you

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.058
and you could just live
in constant fear of her.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.493
Is that why you know
what gen pop is?

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my mom used
only prison terms

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.532
when she was breaking me in.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.567
She goes all right,
time for the yard.

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:18.738
That's a cold hose Trish.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:21.407
Your mom didn't raise you
she broke you in.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.775
She broke me,
she made me obedient.

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:23.976
Watch this.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.680
That's so funny.
Now that's ranch.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.983
God gives me the babies
and I sort em out.

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.085
She goes well, if he's
a little bit of a stickler.

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.887
Is this a real headline?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.957
Bill Cosby to get first
serving of Jello in jail

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.093
Thursday, will have access
to TV and email.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:43.629
I tell you what, not a bad life.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.665
He finally has something
to email people.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.768
Isn't it weird that you could
rape just so many people

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.503
and then the day
you get to jail,

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:53.272
he's just like who's gonna
set up the wi-fi?

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:54.473
Yeah.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.709
Why does he have mail
and email and ...

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.879
Yeah, email and TV? That's like
a sustainable ...

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:02.615
he has such minimal time
left anyway.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.551
That he doesn't need
more than those things.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:07.186
And I bet at 81 years old

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.722
he's happy someone else
is controlling the TV.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:11.057
He's that age where he's like

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.092
I don't know
how to shift the channel.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.228
I'm afraid of the Internet
you see.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.597
Could someone read me
my Internet mail.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.034
Are the demons in the box,
the boopin and the pipin.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:24.170
Do you remember when Bill Hicks
was really mad that

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:26.405
Jay Leno
did a Doritos commercial?

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:29.242
The Joey Lawrence thing where
he says he kills himself, yeah.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.610
What?

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.312
Yeah, he says you're off
the artistic roll call

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.014
when he did the Doritos, yeah

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.849
Bill Hicks, that's what
he says about Jay Leno.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.251
That's how much the world
has changed

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:42.922
where there's literally nobody
not doing a Doritos commercial.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.591
And that was a big thing,
like he sold out.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:46.792
He was furious.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:49.462
Yeah about Jay Leno
doing a Doritos commercial.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.731
I would love to do it,
I'll do it for fear and mommy.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.833
I'll fucking push
whatever chip they want.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:58.605
So most of your listeners
listen on Sirius radio.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.575
But you like to do
a lot of visuals.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.876
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.177
No that's basically
our number one note

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.546
from our executive producer is
we need to stop watching videos.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.482
To which we say shut up.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.618
We said go to @thebonfire,
him or Christine is non-stop

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.887
during the show putting up
these companion pieces

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.322
to see what we're talking about.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:18.524
'Cause a lot of people listen
on demand or steal it

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:20.426
and we're fine with both.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.128
And then they can sync up
with our Twitter

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:23.462
and see all the pictures
and videos.

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:25.398
Remember when Netflix was like
steal it, we don't care.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.666
Do they still feel that way?

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.835
Oh about the discs, that's when
they used to mail you the DVD's.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:31.103
Yeah, I still have one.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.338
What do you have?

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.806
What's the late fee on that?

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.542
Well remember when you used
to go to ...

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.811
what was the video store?

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:40.079
Blockbuster?

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:41.814
Blockbuster.
You would forget to return it

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:43.716
and they would charge you
like $75.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.786
And that's why they went
bankrupt because everyone,

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.087
the second they had
another option

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.288
they were like fuck you
for screwing me-

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:50.556
Spiteful.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:51.891
So many times.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.125
I spent a night in jail.

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:54.460
I spent a night
in jail for that.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:55.728
What?
In gen pop?

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:56.929
For not ... gen pop.

00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:58.464
C-Block, good call,
that's how he learned it,

00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.765
in gen pop for sure.

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:01.567
Frozen bologna sandwich
the whole nine.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.835
Why's that?

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.970
For not returning video tapes

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:06.372
and then this particular
video store,

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:07.973
it wasn't Blockbuster
it was a mom-and-pop store.

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.208
That's where you had
to go to

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:10.409
Hollywood Video?

00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:12.411
No, it was one of the ones
where you go to get ...

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:14.647
there were some saloon doors
you could blow open.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.915
Oh adult videos.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:18.150
Adult films, took them,
never returned them.

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:21.721
That guy, didn't know this,
he would take people to court

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:23.989
and you really wouldn't ...
I wouldn't be paying attention

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:27.393
at like 18 years old for court
documents coming to my house.

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:29.895
And you'd find out he took you
to court and you lost

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:31.130
because you didn't show up.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.099
And you have a bench warrant
for not showing up in court.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.333
That's cra-

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.102
When you get pulled over
for whatever,

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.071
your tail light's out
or some nonsense,

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:42.041
the cop runs your thing and you
have a warrant for your arrest

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.409
and they take you in.

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:45.845
So you went to a night of jail.
Do you remember what movies?

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.446
Something-
Prison lesbians I hope.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.714
You know what I think it was.

00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:50.683
I think I used to get
these videos, they were weird.

00:05:50.716 --> 00:05:54.387
They were like home videos
that would be like Mardi Gras

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.189
or these weird festivals
around the country

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:58.657
where they would have people ...

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.761
it was like
Girls Gone Wild but dirtier.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.562
Girls Gone Wild was
more of the showing tits-

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:04.797
Girls Gone Very Wild.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.999
Yeah, Girls Gone
Extraordinarily Wild.

00:06:07.032 --> 00:06:08.968
Nuts, these girls
have gone nuts.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.703
Girls Gone Bat Shit.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.139
I've told this story,
I'm embarrassed how many times

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.340
I've told this story to you

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:18.577
Jay, is that when
I was super Christian,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.913
back when you knew me.
When you first met me.

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:22.915
And this is what
Crashing is about,

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:24.717
that guy trying to be in comedy.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.652
You and I walked from
the cellar to the corner

00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:28.521
and I'll never forget it,

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.890
you go let me see
that Club magazine.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.091
The guy give you Club-

00:06:32.124 --> 00:06:33.359
Club.

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:36.929
Which is just stills of porn.
It's not like a studio.

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:39.198
It's not a nude magazine,
it is a hard core pornography.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.933
No, it's like here's
some butt holes.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:44.370
And you flipped through it,
for what I don't know,

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:45.571
and then handed it back.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:46.772
Yeah, I got it.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:50.075
And I was there like I am
so ashamed

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:53.212
I've ever masturbated
and this guy's like maybe

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:54.580
I'll take some mental pics
for later.

00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:55.948
Dude I love that.
Jay goes through it-

00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:57.183
Or it didn't do it for you.

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.350
Like the Economist.

00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:00.820
You go hm, all right,
that's going on there.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.788
Have you ever asked
for a magazine,

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:04.657
any magazine, flipped through it
and given it back.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.858
No.

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:08.694
Club magazine, you're like yeah
that's about right.

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:10.062
Sometimes
they give you a free DVD.

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.931
A young Samantha Fox
was a part of Club.

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.332
Hey naughty girls need love too.

00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:14.567
I mean you want to judge
the place

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.669
but let's just say a young
Samantha Fox was involved.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.338
Even the covers are hard
core pornography.

00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:22.541
This is like Jugs.
You can't say give me the Jugs.

00:07:22.574 --> 00:07:24.410
This is why they keep them
in plastic bags usually.

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.644
This guy's like-

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:26.946
Do they have to open
a plastic bag?

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.180
That place didn't.

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:30.550
Jay knew.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.751
Wait, Ariana Grande's
not on a Club.

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:34.019
Okay, that's
a different magazine.

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:35.287
Club something.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.489
There's different Clubs.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.090
It's Club X.

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:39.325
Oh buddy.

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:41.827
By the way, for the record
before we let you guys go.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.096
I'm gonna go steal
Maureen McCormick's

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:46.031
probably getting the biz
before Eve Plumb

00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:47.867
but Eve Plumb's
right in there.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.069
Is she older
than Maureen McCormick?

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:51.370
Like in real life?

00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:52.605
I don't know.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:53.839
And where's Cindy?

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.741
I'm an Alice guy.

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.476
You've always been an Alice guy.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:58.711
You held firm on that always.

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:02.014
Dude I told you man,
right now, as a young boy I said

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:04.383
Sam the butcher's
a lucking fucking guy.

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.585
She takes care
of the Brady family.

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:08.921
Me and Dan would be a good crush
and push team through the 90s

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:12.925
especially 'cause I'm all Six,
Dan's Blossom.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.094
Oh six.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:18.998
Jennifer von O   thin waist,
big old booty.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.299
I'm Six, you're Blossom.

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.634
No, no, no, Dan's coming in
for Blossom

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.868
because she has
big Jewish titties.

00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.069
That's his words.

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:25.304
I'm more Johnny Bravo.

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.806
Johnny Bravo?
Yeah, barrel chest, I get it.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.108
Strong forearms.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:32.378
Strong, strong forearms.
Crashing.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.947
How much did we like Six just
'cause she was named Six though?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.315
Oh it was cool and the hats.

00:08:36.348 --> 00:08:38.050
And the hats.
