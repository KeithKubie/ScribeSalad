many people ask the question well

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709
many people ask the question well
 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.980
many people ask the question well
professor how do you know how do you

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990
professor how do you know how do you
 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.019
professor how do you know how do you
know that the universe is expanding how

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029
know that the universe is expanding how
 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.790
know that the universe is expanding how
do you know that it came from a Big Bang

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
do you know that it came from a Big Bang
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.580
do you know that it came from a Big Bang
can you project so far into the future

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590
can you project so far into the future
 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.890
can you project so far into the future
billions to trillions of years into the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900
billions to trillions of years into the
 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.380
billions to trillions of years into the
future well one way we do this is by

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390
future well one way we do this is by
 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.540
future well one way we do this is by
looking at the Doppler shift

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550
looking at the Doppler shift
 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.459
looking at the Doppler shift
now the Doppler shift is something that

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:30.469
now the Doppler shift is something that
 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.920
now the Doppler shift is something that
even children are familiar with when

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
even children are familiar with when
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.720
even children are familiar with when
children play star wars with each other

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
children play star wars with each other
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.470
children play star wars with each other
they go on with their rocket ships right

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480
they go on with their rocket ships right
 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.209
they go on with their rocket ships right
well what makes that year sound it's the

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219
well what makes that year sound it's the
 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.209
well what makes that year sound it's the
Doppler effect when a car moves toward

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219
Doppler effect when a car moves toward
 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.250
Doppler effect when a car moves toward
you the pitch is higher when the car

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260
you the pitch is higher when the car
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.110
you the pitch is higher when the car
moves away from you the pitch is lower

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
moves away from you the pitch is lower
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.860
moves away from you the pitch is lower
and it sounds like this yeah we've all

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870
and it sounds like this yeah we've all
 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.459
and it sounds like this yeah we've all
heard it

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469
heard it
 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.069
heard it
same thing with starlight when yellow

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079
same thing with starlight when yellow
 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.860
same thing with starlight when yellow
light moves toward you it turns greenish

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
light moves toward you it turns greenish
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.770
light moves toward you it turns greenish
and blueish when yellow light moves away

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780
and blueish when yellow light moves away
 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.710
and blueish when yellow light moves away
from you it turns reddish now how can

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720
from you it turns reddish now how can
 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.750
from you it turns reddish now how can
you memorize this well I was reading

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760
you memorize this well I was reading
 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.880
you memorize this well I was reading
paper a few years ago and I read this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890
paper a few years ago and I read this
 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.249
paper a few years ago and I read this
fascinating story of a high school

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259
fascinating story of a high school
 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.560
fascinating story of a high school
physics teacher who got a speeding

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570
physics teacher who got a speeding
 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.420
physics teacher who got a speeding
ticket for running a red light

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
ticket for running a red light
 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.130
ticket for running a red light
the physics teacher went to the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140
the physics teacher went to the
 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.830
the physics teacher went to the
blackboard and said your honor my car

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840
blackboard and said your honor my car
 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.609
blackboard and said your honor my car
was moving toward yellow light light is

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619
was moving toward yellow light light is
 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.889
was moving toward yellow light light is
compressed in the forward direction when

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899
compressed in the forward direction when
 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.080
compressed in the forward direction when
he moved toward it and therefore it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
he moved toward it and therefore it
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.200
he moved toward it and therefore it
turned green this is the Doppler shift

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210
turned green this is the Doppler shift
 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.880
turned green this is the Doppler shift
he said and he went to the blackboard

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
he said and he went to the blackboard
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.709
he said and he went to the blackboard
and he correctly wrote down all the

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719
and he correctly wrote down all the
 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.590
and he correctly wrote down all the
equations of the Doppler shift and then

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
equations of the Doppler shift and then
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.120
equations of the Doppler shift and then
this high school physics teacher said

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
this high school physics teacher said
 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880
this high school physics teacher said
your honor I do not deserve a traffic

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
your honor I do not deserve a traffic
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.580
your honor I do not deserve a traffic
ticket well the judge scratched his head

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590
ticket well the judge scratched his head
 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.859
ticket well the judge scratched his head
and according to the article the judge

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869
and according to the article the judge
 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.319
and according to the article the judge
said well I guess there is a law higher

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329
said well I guess there is a law higher
 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.389
said well I guess there is a law higher
than the laws of the state of New Jersey

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399
than the laws of the state of New Jersey
 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.669
than the laws of the state of New Jersey
and these are the laws of physics but

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679
and these are the laws of physics but
 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.709
and these are the laws of physics but
then according to the article there was

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719
then according to the article there was
 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.840
then according to the article there was
a high school kid in the courtroom and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850
a high school kid in the courtroom and
 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.510
a high school kid in the courtroom and
he raised his hand and he said your

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520
he raised his hand and he said your
 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.149
he raised his hand and he said your
honor I'm just a high school kid but I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159
honor I'm just a high school kid but I
 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.739
honor I'm just a high school kid but I
happened to be in his high school

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749
happened to be in his high school
 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.010
happened to be in his high school
physics class and he just taught weeks

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020
physics class and he just taught weeks
 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.230
physics class and he just taught weeks
ago that this only happens when you

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240
ago that this only happens when you
 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.630
ago that this only happens when you
approach the speed of light

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
approach the speed of light
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.229
approach the speed of light
end of article 2 this day I still don't

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239
end of article 2 this day I still don't
 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.699
end of article 2 this day I still don't
know what happened to that poor high

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709
know what happened to that poor high
 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.460
know what happened to that poor high
school kid but I tell my students

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
school kid but I tell my students
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.500
school kid but I tell my students
then if I'm ever in court arguing a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
then if I'm ever in court arguing a
 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.630
then if I'm ever in court arguing a
speeding ticket for red light they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640
speeding ticket for red light they
 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.310
speeding ticket for red light they
better not raise their hand if they know

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320
better not raise their hand if they know
 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.720
better not raise their hand if they know
it's good for them and they know what's

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
it's good for them and they know what's
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.110
it's good for them and they know what's
good for their grade so when we look in

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120
good for their grade so when we look in
 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.940
good for their grade so when we look in
the heavens we look at star light

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
the heavens we look at star light
 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.190
the heavens we look at star light
emitted from distant galaxies and we

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200
emitted from distant galaxies and we
 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.260
emitted from distant galaxies and we
find that the light is slightly reddish

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
find that the light is slightly reddish
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.960
find that the light is slightly reddish
redder than it's supposed to be that

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970
redder than it's supposed to be that
 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.150
redder than it's supposed to be that
means that these objects these gigantic

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160
means that these objects these gigantic
 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.550
means that these objects these gigantic
galaxies are moving away from us and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
galaxies are moving away from us and
 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.910
galaxies are moving away from us and
therefore the universe is expanding well

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920
therefore the universe is expanding well
 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.070
therefore the universe is expanding well
we can run the videotape backwards and

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
we can run the videotape backwards and
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.350
we can run the videotape backwards and
by running the videotape backwards we

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360
by running the videotape backwards we
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760
by running the videotape backwards we
can then calculate when all these

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770
can then calculate when all these
 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.980
can then calculate when all these
galaxies came from a single point and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990
galaxies came from a single point and
 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.350
galaxies came from a single point and
that's how we calculate the age of the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360
that's how we calculate the age of the
 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.810
that's how we calculate the age of the
universe by simply hitting the rewind

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820
universe by simply hitting the rewind
 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.540
universe by simply hitting the rewind
button when we calculate the expansion

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550
button when we calculate the expansion
 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.060
button when we calculate the expansion
of the universe oh by running the video

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070
of the universe oh by running the video
 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.190
of the universe oh by running the video
tape backwards we see that the universe

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200
tape backwards we see that the universe
 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.090
tape backwards we see that the universe
is about 13.7 billion years old plus or

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100
is about 13.7 billion years old plus or
 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.500
is about 13.7 billion years old plus or
minus 1% so we now know the age of the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510
minus 1% so we now know the age of the
 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.280
minus 1% so we now know the age of the
universe 13.7 billion years by running

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290
universe 13.7 billion years by running
 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.020
universe 13.7 billion years by running
the video tape backwards but what

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
the video tape backwards but what
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.840
the video tape backwards but what
happens if we hit fast-forward what

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850
happens if we hit fast-forward what
 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.580
happens if we hit fast-forward what
happens if we go forward in time

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
happens if we go forward in time
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.520
happens if we go forward in time
billions of years well here it gets

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
billions of years well here it gets
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.180
billions of years well here it gets
murkier but by analyzing how the burst

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190
murkier but by analyzing how the burst
 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.310
murkier but by analyzing how the burst
has been expanding in the past we used

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320
has been expanding in the past we used
 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.400
has been expanding in the past we used
to think that the universe is slowing

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
to think that the universe is slowing
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.229
to think that the universe is slowing
down we used to think the universe is

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239
down we used to think the universe is
 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.120
down we used to think the universe is
ageing and therefore it's slowing down

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130
ageing and therefore it's slowing down
 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.720
ageing and therefore it's slowing down
running out of steam wrong we now

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730
running out of steam wrong we now
 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.150
running out of steam wrong we now
believe that the universe is speeding up

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
believe that the universe is speeding up
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.420
believe that the universe is speeding up
it's actually accelerating isn't the way

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430
