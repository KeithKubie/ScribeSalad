00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.650
After working in
R, you often want

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.930
to save your work so that you
can easily re-run commands

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.910
and rebuild models.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.660
There are several
ways of doing this,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.990
but the method we
recommend is by using

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.540
what's called a script file.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.680
Let's open a new script file.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.580
Go to File, New Document, on
a Mac, and File, New Script,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.590
on a PC.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.140
This will pop up a
blank script file.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.940
You can copy and
paste any commands

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
that you've run in your
console into the script file.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.620
For example, say we want to
save the table commands we ran.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.670
Let's Copy the
first table command

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
and then Paste it
into the script file.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.760
We can also take the
first tapply command

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.980
we ran, Copy and Paste
it into our script file.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.440
Now, if you highlight
these lines of code

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.670
in the script file and press
Command-Enter on a Mac,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.950
and Control-r on a PC, it
will run these lines of code

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.990
in your R console.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.960
So if you save this
file and then reopen it

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.280
when you start R next time, you
can easily rerun any commands

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.760
that you ran in this R session.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.260
A lot of times it's
easier to just write

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.120
commands in your script file
and run them in your console

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.180
because then they'll always
be saved in your script file.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.370
You can add comments
in your script file

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.000
by using the pound sign.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.100
If you type pound,
and then some comment

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.120
describing your script file, and
then highlight the whole thing

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.520
and press Control-r
or Command-Enter,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
you'll see that the comment
runs in the console,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.009
but nothing happens.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.880
R recognizes this as a comment.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.900
If you want to save the
output of your R session

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.500
in your console, I recommend
just saving it as a text file.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.760
In your console, you can
go to file, Save to file,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.460
and this will save your
output as a text file.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.470
You won't be able
to easily rerun

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.140
this in R like the
script file, but it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.620
will have the summary
output of what you did.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.680
When you close R,
it will ask you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.900
if you want to save
your workspace.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.820
Make sure you have everything
you want in a script file

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.380
and then don't worry about
saving your workspace.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.430
These are the basics
of R. We'll see

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.780
a lot more in the
rest of this class.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.829
But hopefully you've
seen in this lecture

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.960
how powerful R can be.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.920
In just one lecture, we
performed insightful data

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.360
analysis on an
interesting data set.
