We are also live streaming.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.350
I think that's what it's called,
live streaming to four cities.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.630
And we practiced saying hello to
you guys in these four cities.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.020
So, we're going to say hello to
the young people in Richmond,

a nap after this.

And she's going to take questions.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.780
So, I'm going to throw it over
to Ms. Meg, take it away Meg.

morning everybody [foreign word].

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.000
A couple of things before we
start reading, because we have to,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.530
we're in the library so we're going

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.600
to have a story time
all of us together.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.990
But first I want to say how
exciting it is to be at the Library

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.080
of Congress in a room specially
for young people with our brand new

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.520
and wonderful librarian of
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.510
so I want to give her a huge.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.210
And thank you for making the
library a really welcoming place

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.510
for young people.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.480

people in the back shh.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.340
All those adults back there, shh.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.160
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: They're
always a problem the adults.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.470
I want to give a shout out,
because as some of you know my work

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.600
and I write for kids who
are 4, and 5, and 6, and 7.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.360
But I also write for kids who are
8, and 9, and 10, and 11, and 12,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.450
and 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.890
So, just this month a new book
came out called "Flying Lessons

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.160
and Other Stories" and this is for
kids who are in elementary school.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.760
And it's a collection of stories
written by authors from all kinds

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.700
of backgrounds, and I
have two special friends

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.840
who came to the library.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.320
And they're ready to tell
you all about this book.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.560
One is Ellen Oh, who is the
editor, and Ellen is going to stand

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.860
up back there [applause].

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.360
So, please make sure you talk to
Ellen about the fantastic stories

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.250
in this collection by Jackie
Woodson and Kwame Alexander,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.070
and Tim Federle, and all
other fascinating people.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.460
And next to Ellen is
my other good friend,

Lamar Giles, standing up back there.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.320
And he will be the editor of
the next book in that series.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.870
Instead of middle grade stories,
it's going to be YA stories,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.470
meaning stories for teens.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.260
So, be on the lookout for "Flying
Lessons and Other Stories."

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.990
But we have business to attend
to this morning my friends.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.010
Raise your hand if you
have a grandma or grandpa.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.270
Raise your hand, if you
have a grandma or grandpa.

Or a [foreign word].

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.760
Yes. I did too.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.280
And here's what I remember
about that experience,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.570
that when I was five, do I
have anybody who's five here?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.910
Do this is you are five, okay.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.060
When I was five, my [foreign
word] came to live with us.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.700
MY [foreign word] and my
[foreign word] they came from Cuba

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.590
and I hadn't met them before.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.410
And I was very worried about them.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.040
So, all these years
later when I grew up,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.280
I decided you know what I'm going
to write a story about a girl

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.690
and her grandmother,
her [foreign word].

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.990
And they're going to have
a very special problem

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.640
that my grandmother
and I sort of had.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.590
And that's this, that [foreign
word] spoke Spanish really well

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.890
and really quickly.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.530
And it sounded to me
like this [babbling].

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:29.360
And I spoke English really well
and really quickly and it sounded

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.810
to her like this [babbling].

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.190
And when we met each
other and we wanted

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.940
to be friends we were
like, oh, uh-oh.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.110
So, I wrote a book.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.860 position:56%
Now here's the deal about this book.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.340
Right now I speak Spanish
and English.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.940
So, I'm going to read
the book both ways.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.730
And on this screen you're going to
have the pictures and you're going

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:02.860
to have the words in English and in
my lap, I have the book in Espanol.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.380
So, we're going to
have to be patient,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.170
which is a really good quality
when we're talking about people

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.630
who speak other languages.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.130

watching the live stream,

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.620

to hear it in Spanish,

they're going to wait
really patiently.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.180
And when I finish English
and I go to Spanish,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.590
you're going to wait
really patiently and look

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:36.000
at the pictures drawn by
my friend Angela Dominguez.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.750
Yes? Okay.

over there and I need a person

with long arms, [foreign
word] thank you.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:09:00.420
Okay. So, this will be a trick,
I've never done this this way,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.690
so remember the word here,
patience [foreign word].

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.000

taped in our classroom to help Kim.

time that I was very little

that speaking two languages
was just having more words.

things you can do I think.

reading and letting people find

out about things and helping
them find out about things.

And I say what's new, what's good?

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.140
And they always give
me the best advice.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.190
And the other thing I love
about librarians is that it's

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.550
like they're opening a
magic door for me to walk

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:49.190
through and experience a story.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.760
So, I'm so glad you're a
librarian and that there are

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.280
so many good librarians out there.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.510
Thank you, librarians.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:33:03.150
[ Applause ]

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.440
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yeah,
librarians are wizards of words.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.150
So, we have Harry Potter
and it is just a joy.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.630
Now, we have another question too.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.130
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: We have
questions streaming

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.840
in from our friends
who are watching today.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.930
This one is from Maddie, 6 years
old and she's in Princeton.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:22.810
And this is a question for both of
you, Maddie says I read every day.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.110
Do you?

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.830
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yes.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.360
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: I'm
never not reading.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.030
Never not reading.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.330
I love it, love it.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:35.400
In fact, when I don't read, I don't
feel well does that happen to you?

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.700
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Right.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.350
When I'm very, very tired,
I can tell I'm really,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.080
really tired because I can't read
and that's when I need to take

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.620
that nap, I need to do
something because I love to read,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:53.180
well can I share with you my
favorite place to read, in bed.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.480
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Me too.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.930
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: It's
the best thing.

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.580
And sometimes I wake up and
there are books and magazines

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.500
and stuff in the bed with me.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.490
And it's so cool.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.610
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Do you know, I had
a neighbor once, her name was Liz

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:14.110
and she had three little kids and
one of her daughters, I remember,

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:18.070
that young woman is in her
twenties now, but as a little girl,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:22.640
she could only go to sleep if
her bed was filled with books.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.340
And she read until the moment
her eyes dropped and she'd wake

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.640
up in the morning touching those
books, I think her name was Kate,

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.580
if I'm not mistaken, and
I've always remembered that.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.880
I read in bed too.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.180
It's such a comfort.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.300
And I like going to sleep
with my imagination.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.320
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And sometimes
it's better than a movie,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:47.240 position:56%
because the movie's in your head and
you can make up whatever you want.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.580
You can make the pictures
yourself sometimes.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.720
So, it's really kind of cool.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.020
Another question.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.920
Oh, right here.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.570
Or, you could just say stuff too.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.960
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 4: Why did you want
to speak Spanish in the book?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.480
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Why did she
want to learn to speak Spanish?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.050
She wanted to be able
to talk to her grandma.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.750
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 4: I mean why did you
decide to do the book in Spanish.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:31.700
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Oh why, a
more discerning question.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.000
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: That's right.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.300
She got the story.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.600
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Thank you now.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.900
Thank you for that clarification.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.030
Well, miss, thank you very much.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.110
That's a really good question
and here's why, because I think

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:51.970
that there are a lot of kids in the
US who speak English and Spanish.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:57.300
And lots of families where some of
the people speak English and some

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.870
of the people speak Spanish.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.020 position:56%
And I like to give them books where,

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:06.360
no matter what language
they're most comfortable in,

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.680
they can come together
around the story.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.320
The hard part, when I'm
reading is waiting, right.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.960
It's hard to be patient.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.200
And that's true when we're
reading books in two formats.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.670
It's true when someone is new to
English and they're trying to talk

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.810
to you and you're listening really
carefully and trying to be patient.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:33.250 position:56%
But they're trying to tell you
their story, even if it's a sentence

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.540
that they want to tell you.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:43.110
So, for me I like including
everybody that I can in the story.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.700
Good answer?

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.590
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: We have
a question over here.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.460
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And we need more
stories in other languages too.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.110
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 5: All right go
ahead and ask your question.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:37:00.960
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Why did they give
the hamster to her, to the grandma.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.200
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Say that
question one more time, why?

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.830
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Did they give
the hamster to the grandma?

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.140
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Why did she
have a hamster in the story?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.570
Why was there?

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.870
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 5: No.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.350
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Oh,
I'm not doing well

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:19.200
with like interpreting questions.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.770
Okay I'm paying attention now.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.770
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Why did they give
the hamster to the grandma?

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.870
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Oh, well
she already had Edmund.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.350
She already owned him.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.640
Edmund was her pet.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:37.150
And so, she wanted to
add Mango the parrot.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.460
She didn't add Edmund.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.040
Edmund was already hers.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.540
Do you have a pet?

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.840
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Yeah.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.140
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: What do you have?

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.440
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: A dog.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.740
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Me too.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.040
What's your dog's name?

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.340
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: Onyx.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.640
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Onyx.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.060
My dog's name is Hugo and
he's a big black shaggy dog.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.790
What does your dog look like?

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:05.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: He's black
and he has light brown feet.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: He must be beautiful.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.500
And I like that name, Onyx.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.830
Other questions.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:14.850
Oh, a wizard.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:22.090
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 7: Well, just like
her dog, her dog's name is Onyx.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:28.040
My dog's name is Donyx.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.920
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: And we have
one question over here.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.780
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 8: Why did
you make two books?

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.190
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Why did I?

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:43.860
I think because I can't not do it.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.880
When I don't write I
don't feel very well.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.880
So, I love to write stories.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.870
I like to, when I was little
I liked to hear stories.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.610
And now as an adult, I
still like to hear stories,

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.920
I still like to read stories, but
now I like to write them also.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.850
Do you like to write stories?

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.080
Yes. So, you know what
happens to people like you?

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.880
You become people like me, or you
become people like Dr. Hayden,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.820
like book lovers we become
librarians, we become authors.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.820
If we like to draw the pictures
we could become illustrators,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.740
the person who draws stories.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.400
So, there's lot of stuff
for book loving people.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.090
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Batman
has a question.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.900
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Oh, Batman, yes.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:34.690
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 9: Why we get
the grandma in the story?

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:41.180
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Why did I write
a story with a grandma in it?

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.480
I like grandmas.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.460
I think grandmas, and
grandpas, and aunts, and uncles.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.860
I think family is really important.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:55.390
So, I like to write stories where
we get to see people's families.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.360
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And there are
all types of families, too.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.160
That's what I've learned, too.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.960 position:56%
There's all kinds of families and it
doesn't matter and its really cool

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.230
to have all types of
people in the family.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.590
I had a rabbit, Auto
was in the family,

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.910
but everybody can be in a family.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.570
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: We have
another question.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:22.500
Yes, this is a question from
Zeke who is 7 years old.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.830
And he is Orange County Library
System, Orlando, Florida.

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.060
This is for Dr. Hayden.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.050
How many books are
there in your library?

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.260
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: I know
that one [laughter].

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:38.380
There are, and think about this,
and that's why we're so excited

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.880
that you're going to be
here more and more and more.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.080
Thirty-two million books.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.500
Just books.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:54.310
Then there are, I even, it's
so much to even say how much,

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.330
a hundred million other
things, comic books, games,

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.800
all types of photos, everything.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.050
That's a lot of stuff, isn't it?

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.030
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Thank goodness
you have it because you know

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.780
when I write books, I come to
the library to do research.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:14.740
So, I came to this library,
to the Library of Congress

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.820
when I was writing me,
I have novel called

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:20.090
"Burn Baby Burn" for teenagers.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.520
And I came right across
the street and spent a lot

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.250
of time doing research here.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.800
And the other thing that I
don't know that they can see,

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.580
but maybe they could do a
virtual tour on the website.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.880
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: We're
working on that.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.820
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Is how beautiful
the Library of Congress is.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.380
It's two buildings.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.890
We're in the Jefferson Building,
and there's the Madison building.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.580
But this building where we are.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.880
There's three buildings?

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.410
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Three
buildings right around here.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.270
There's another one.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.850
You've got to go to that
one too, the Adams Building.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.580
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Thank goodness
I have tutor on the side.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.660
There are three, but I
knew there were two, but.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.760
The Jefferson Building you
just shouldn't miss it.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.300
And you should go up into
the rotunda and just look

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:11.320
at how beautiful a monument
it is to books and knowing

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.110
and thinking and learning.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.960
And that really matters.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.880
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And the cool
thing is that it's your library.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.820
This is everybody's library.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.540
So, Florida, New Jersey, New York.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.200
This is your library too.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.660 position:56%
And I'm glad you said that about
the virtual tour, because very soon,

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.290
you will be able to take a virtual
tour of all three buildings.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.760
And there's even another
one in Virginia [laughter].

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.220
All three buildings.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.190 position:56%
You'll be able to look and it's 3-D.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.260
and walk about, so
we're working on that.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.170
So, wherever you are you
can tour the buildings.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.470
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Yeah.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.770
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Great.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.070
Oh, now there's some.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.370
Look we must be having too much fun

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:56.670
because now the adults
want to ask questions.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.190
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Yeah, they want
to get in on the action now.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.040
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Okay we'll
let him, we'll him here you go.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.340
He's going to ask a question/

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.690
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 10: Dr. Hayden could
you tell us what was President's

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.520
Jefferson's involvement

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.560
in establishing the
Library of Congress?

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.860
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Wow.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.280
Now you could tell that
was an adult question.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.390
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: And I'm
so glad it's yours.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.700
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And I
happen to know that one too.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.900
Because what this gentleman wanted
to know is why is this even called,

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.440
the building that we're in now
is the Thomas Jefferson Building

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.370
and he said what was,
how was Thomas Jefferson?

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.320
He was a president a long time ago.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.150
Very, very important president
because he thought about a lot

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.890
of things when the country
was getting started.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.680
And one of the things he said
was, this is a new country.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:57.490
It was new 1796, way back, he said
you know what a new country needs?

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.760
It needs a library.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.650 position:56%
And he made sure that books form his
library were given to the country

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.980
so we could have this
wonderful thing now.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.380
So, thank you for asking that.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.360
And thank you Thomas Jefferson.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.140
We got another one from our?

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.320
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: We do this
one is from New York.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.620
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, New York City.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.920
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: New York.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.220
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Amsterdam Avenue.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.520
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Queens, New York.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.730
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Queens,
that's Jamaica, New York.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.350
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: They actually want to
know if you miss living in Queens,

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.750
and also the real question is,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.520
Jessica wants to know
is there a difference

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.790
in how you write chapter
books and picture books.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.090
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Yes.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.300
And I am from Queens,
I'm from Flushing Queens.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.600
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, I
thought you said Jamaica.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.600
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: No, that, you see
there's Queens peeps everywhere.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.380
Flushing Queens is where I'm from.

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.640
And there is a difference in
how you write every kind of book

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.740
because you have to think
about who's reading the book

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.530
and how long the book can be.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:05.840
How many words that reader has
to be able to unlock your story.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.120
Is somebody going to be reading the
book with them, or are they going

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.100
to be reading by themselves.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.600
So, there are all kinds
of things that I think

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.150
about that have to do with this.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:23.580
The first thing I ask myself is
what story do I want to tell.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.860
The second thing is
who am I telling it to.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.290
And then the third thing is
what's the best way to tell

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:35.620
that story to that person.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.140
So, I have to match
those three things up.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.810
Sometimes I make a mistake.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:46.150 position:56%
And I try it in one way and I go no,
no it doesn't make sense this way,

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:50.830
it's much better as a novel, or
as a picture book, or whatever.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:55.150
But those three things in
some way have to line up.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.630
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Wow, that
takes a lot of thought.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.930
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: It does.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.230
It's a brain buster.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.310
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: It looks
so wonderful and everything.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.970
Wait a minute is there
a metal on that book?

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.070
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: There is a
metal on that book my friend.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:12.910
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, could you
tell us, whenever you see this kind

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:17.770
of metal on a book, that
means that it won a prize.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:19.350
So, could you tell
us about the prize?

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: I can and I'm glad I
can and I'm glad I can tell you this

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.660
with the question from New York.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:30.650
Because this book won a prize
called the Pura Balpre Award,

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:34.220
the honor for writing
and for illustration.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.950
And I was not the illustrator,

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:41.210
the illustrator is a wonderful
woman names Angela Dominguez

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.770
who is also a writer and writes
and illustrates her own books.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.390
So, find her stuff.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.460
Pura Balpre was a librarian.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:58.240
She was the first Afro-Latino
librarian in Harlem,

00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.760
I believe in the twenties.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.870
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Yes, 1920s.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.170
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Yeah.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:07.360
And she looked out at her
students and she looked at them,

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.550
and she looked at the kids who
were in the pages of the books

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.190
in her library, and
said wait a minute.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.760
This doesn't exactly match.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.120
We need more stories and more books

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.890
that have all kinds
of people in them.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:32.610
So, she dedicated her whole
life to diversifying, to create,

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.390
getting stories and books
that reflect all people.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:41.730
And so, when the book comes
out, every year books publish,

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.300
there's a committee called the Pura
Balpre Committee and they read,

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.030
and read, and read,
and read, and read.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:51.170
And they're looking for books
that celebrate Latino life

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.710 position:56%
and experience in the United States.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.910
And then they pick a
winner for illustration,

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.900
and they pick a winner for writing.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.380
And I'm so proud that this
book got that last year.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.550
Not this year, but last year.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.850
Thank you for asking.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:12.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And I remember when
I was 7 years old in Jamaica Queens,

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.030
and there was a little
store front library right

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.690
across from my school, PS 96.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:23.580
And I went in and a librarian
gave me a book called

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.200
"Bright April" and
I lived that book.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.920
I loved it so much
I got library fines.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.320
Yes. You know why I loved it?

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.020
Because it was about a little girl
who was seven or eight years old.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.770
And she looked just like me.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.830
She was brown, she had
pigtails, she was a brownie.

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:48.540 position:56%
And I just loved it because I
looked in the book and I saw myself.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.710
And I said, it must be pretty
good if I can see myself.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.350
And it meant a lot to me to
just have that and I hugged

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.110
that book, and hugged it.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.440
I think I still have fines.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.700
But I loved that book to this day

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.110
because I could see myself
in something I loved.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.530
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: I love that
you're from Jamaica Queens,

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.810
I went to PS 22, where did you go?

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.110
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: PS 96.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.250
Public school is public school.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:17.720 position:56%
Public school and in New York that's
what you do PS 96, but that meant

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.330
so much to me because I was
already looking at books to find

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.860
out about other people and I
loved books and I love reading.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.670
But I never saw myself in a book.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.910
So, it meant a lot.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.030
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: The next one is
going to be the last question.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:34.330
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Oh, we
have one more question

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:37.630
and then we have, we
have two questions.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.600
Okay three last questions.

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.530
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: All right, three
super-fast last questions.

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.930
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Okay, here's
the first one right here.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:51.380
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 11: When
you're little did you

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.890
like to read and write a lot?

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.190
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: Yes.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.680
To become an author, yes.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.730
Really to be anything.

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.850
It pays to read and write a lot.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.990
And it's also super fun.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.490
So, you really don't mind doing it.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.390
But yes you have to good reader.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:11.580
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And then
we have another person.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.880
A teenager.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.980
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 12: So, first
of all good morning.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:20.660
All right so, like I'm
from Missouri, right?

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:27.220
And I'm an artist, yeah, and I
consider writing to be like art.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.150
So when I'm doing my thing, like a
make music and I paint and stuff,

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.540
so like when I'm doing my thing
on an instrument or something,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.460 position:56%
I feel like it comes best to me like
when I'm a vessel and it just pours

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.410
out of me, it's like spontaneous.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.410
So, I want to know like
what's your method of writing

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.900 position:56%
like how do you get the stories out?

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.700
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: So, I love the
fact that you have all kinds

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.230
of arts at your disposal.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.530
And you're right, there's a whole,

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.470
as an artist there's
a whole time period

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.790
where it's just coming out of you.

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:58.620
And how that looks for me is
that it will be a sentence

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.290
that I write down somewhere.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.890
Or it will be a photograph
that I see somewhere

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.790
that I cut out and I hold on to.

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:12.650
When I wrote the book, "Tia Isa
Wants a Car" for a long time,

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.210
that sentence just
kept coming up to me.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:16.850
Tia Isa wants a car.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:18.300
Tia Isa wants a car.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.950
I have a Tia Isa, she did
buy the first family car.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:28.170
And for some reason that
sentence kept jamming in my head.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.930
And you probably have
the same thing,

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.810
a phrase that you can't get rid
of and then it becomes something.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:39.080
The important thing is, is that
you follow it, just follow it.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.960
But thank you so much
for your question.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: And before we have.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.770
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 12: Thanks for
being here, I appreciate it.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:48.380
&gt;&gt; CARLA HADEN: Isn't this cool to
have people who create and write

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.430
and all of that and we're going
to have more and more of this

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:58.290
on Saturdays, let's give a
hand for Saturdays [applause].

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.570
Saturdays are good days.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.490
And it's a time when
you can do things.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.950
So, we're going to actually
do something really fun.

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.230 position:56%
We have one more question from our
friends and we're just going to wave

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:14.040
to her before we go because we
have a special ribbon cutting.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:21.630
We are going to cut the ribbon
to this room to say it's open

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.310
on Saturday, come and everything.

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.580
We have scissors that are this big.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.540
We have two teenagers
from our advisory board.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.410
We also want you to know
that we want you to come back

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:35.710
and tell us what other
things would you like to see

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.140
in this Children's
Center and Youth Center.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.420
So, we're going to be getting
a lot of ideas from people.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.210
We hope that we can have more
authors like Ms. Medina to talk

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:48.360
to you wherever you
are on a regular basis.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.660
That would be good.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.490
So, we have one more question from?

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:52.790
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: This
is from Princeton.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.620
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Princeton,
New Jersey.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.000
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: And this one is
from Marissa, nine years old.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.840
Meg Medina, what is
your next book about?

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.230
&gt;&gt; MEG MEDINA: My next book?

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:08.020
My next book the main character's
name is Marcie Suarez and she lives

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.390
in Florida with her mother, and
her father, and her brother,

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.480 position:56%
and her grandmother, and her
grandfather, and her [foreign word],

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:20.470
and two really pesky
twins, Lao and Thomas.

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:24.560
And everybody is just
in her affairs.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.470
And she's 12, and she's
going to a new school.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.380
And at the same time, she's
noticing somethings changing

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:40.150
with her friends, changing with her
grandfather, changing with herself.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.020
That's a much as I got.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.880
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: So, stay tuned.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.100
Well, thank you MS. Medina.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.610
We just can't thank you enough.

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:57.400
We're going to cut the ribbon
and we are going to look,

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.810
I'd like to have our
two helpers come up.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:05.750
We have, and I mentioned we have
an advisory board here and all

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.020
of you are going to be helping us

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:12.850
from the Richard Wright Public
Charter School here in Washington.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:22.010
An 11th grader, Veronica Payne, and
another 11th grader, Edward Tolson.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:26.040
Now, kids everywhere,
everywhere we are.

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.490
We're going to need your help.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.380
So, who wants to come
and help hold the ribbon?

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:37.270
Come on. You're going
to hold the ribbon.

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:42.250
Okay. Now, we've got all the
cameras and we're going to do this.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.570
And then we're going to count
down, Ms. Medina, okay you got it.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.010
Where are the big scissors?

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:50.180
Have you ever seen
scissors this big?

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:53.700
These are big scissors.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.120
Now, we got to be careful, though.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.610
You know you got to be
careful with scissors anyway.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:02.740
So, when you have super
big scissors, okay.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:07.440
So, we are going to have
someone help us cut here.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.260
You want to help?

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:15.600
Okay now watch Batman,
watch it, okay be careful.

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.900
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: 5.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.770
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Count
down everybody.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:24.510
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:33.810
[ Applause ]

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.110
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Thank you.

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:36.410
And guess what.

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:39.640
Our 11th graders are
going to say something.

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.580
You guys were really good
at this ribbon cutting.

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.880
The scissors were good.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.870
Who's going to speak first?

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:50.540
Veronica's going to speak.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:54.540
&gt;&gt; VERONICA PAYNE:
Good morning everyone.

00:55:54.540 --> 00:56:00.470
How are y'all today?

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:07.600
Okay. Well, my name is Veronica.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:11.000
I attend Richard Wright
Public Charter School.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.130
And I am also a part of
the teen board program here

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.510
at the Library of Congress.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:22.070
[ Applause ]

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:26.360
First, I want to start off with
how great I think this program is.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.830
Ms. Cathy and the other
staff work really hard

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.590
to make sure we're
comfortable and engage

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:33.880
in the discussions we
have at each meeting.

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.640
If I wasn't already a book lover,
I would be after spending a day

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.800
with Ms. Cathy because her
enthusiasm for books is inspiring.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:48.360
Because of this program, I've met
new authors, read amazing books,

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.790 position:56%
and enjoyed some pretty good snacks.

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:54.530
I've never left our meetings
without learning new things,

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.700
whether it be about books or
other students in the program.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.850
That's what I like about
the teen board program.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:06.050
I'm surrounded by people
that may be unfamiliar

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:09.430
but enjoys books just
as much as I do.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.930
This program is a place where
young people can freely express

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:16.870
themselves, just reading,
writing, and talking about books

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:18.980
without fear of judgment.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:22.060
That's why I'm very thankful
for the team board program

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.510
and everything I've learned
an experienced from it.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:32.380
[ Applause ]

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.260
&gt;&gt; EDWARD TOLSON: I'm 16
years old and I'm a Junior

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.440
at Richard Wright Public
Charter School

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.280
for Journalism and Media Arts.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.640
The Young Readers' Center Teen
Board has been a great getaway,

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.250
where I can read, envelop my
thoughts and express myself

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:51.100
through reading literature.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.400
I've been a part of the Teen Board

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.080
of the Young Readers'
Center for two years now.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:57.110
In my opinion, the Young Readers'
Center just keeps getting better

00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.300
for me along with the selection
of books that are available.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.720
When I joined the teen
board program,

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:04.570
my first impression was it was
going to be your average book club,

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:07.450
where you write summaries
of books written years ago.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.770
This is because it was being
housed in the Library of Congress,

00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:12.320
where lots of old books are housed.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.760
However, that was not the case.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.880
The Young Readers' Center Team
Board itself is multidimensional.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.840
We are exposed to new
books every month.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.990
Distinguished authors
have visited and amazed us

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:25.030
with how they got started writing
and enthusiastic librarians

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.890
that forged the way for us to have
great snacks and wonderful books

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:34.030
from various genres for
our reading pleasure.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.600
I continue to enjoy our
teen board monthly meetings

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:37.980
where we discuss our books and hear

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.130
about what other students have
read while enjoying the embracing

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.930
environment and loving cultural
of the Young Readers' Center.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.000
The Young Readers' Teen
Board is a great program

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.460 position:56%
for young readers everywhere looking

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.910
to embrace literature while
cultivating their minds

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.510
and expanding their
horizons through reading.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:56.710
[ Applause ]

00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:01.320
&gt;&gt; CARLA HAYDEN: Now, there's a
reason why we wanted you to hear

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:06.190
about the teen advisory board and
how much fun that is, the snacks,

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:08.880
you'll be getting some
snacks yourself.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.860 position:56%
And we think, and what do you think?

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:14.860
How about a kid board?

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:19.130
Right. The teens are
having all the fun,

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:21.870
we think the kids should
have some too, right?

00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:27.330
So, we want you to think about
being part of the new kid board.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.100
Give yourselves a hand, I think
you all have good questions.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.450
You can do it.

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:35.060
And to celebrate that and to
celebrate Ms. Medina being here

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.400
and all the cools stuff
because we're going

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.130
to really renovate
and fix this place up.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.620
We're going to throw stuff
around, and make a mess.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.560 position:56%
Yeah, we're just going to make amess

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.260
and have a good time
and have refreshments.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.540
So, now somebody, who's going to
tell us how we're going to do this?

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:57.900
Because we're just going to;
okay, are you going to show us?

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.880
Okay, we're going to count down
again and thank you for all

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.250
of our friends in New Jersey,
and New York on Amsterdam Avenue,

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:11.990
Florida, one more; South Carolina.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.310
Let's say good-bye to
everybody [applause].

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:20.760
Thank you and we hope to see you
soon and come help us make amess.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.220
Come on; 1, 2, 3 yeah.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:31.270

of the Library of Congress.
