00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:07.372
We're introducing <i>Android Jetpack</i>,

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:09.710
our next generation
of components and tools

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.441
along with architecture guidance
designed to help you accelerate

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.318
your Android development.

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:16.720
You told us it was hard to do
backwards compatibility,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.626
so we build the support library.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.253
You told us it was hard to manage
your app as data changes,

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.211
so we built the architecture components.

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.169
And we heard you wanted more,
so we're building more.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.339
(Sumiran Pradhan) Android
architecture components gives us

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.409
a template to write 
production-ready Android code,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.125
which helps us 
on-board new developers faster.

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:38.520
<i>Jetpack</i> is made up 
of components in four categories:

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.772
foundation, architecture, 
behavior, and UI.

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:43.812
Each component is individually adoptable

00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:46.251
and built to maintain 
backwards compatibility.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.277
(Andy Lawton) Android architecture 
components are very modular.

00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:53.205
So we're allowed to pick and choose
what feature sets we want

00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:55.221
that are applicable to our app.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.079
(Karen Ng) Lifecycle-aware observers
and observable components

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.833
allow for a separation of concerns
that create testable,

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.019
robust, high quality apps.

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.750
One of the most important things
that we don't have to worry about is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.852
what code goes where.

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:12.309
So that helps us test a few models.
It helps us build robust code.

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:14.470
We do not have to be lifecycle-aware

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.161
and just helps new devs come in

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.821
and then write a proper
modulized production-ready code

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.373
without having to add
all of these extra different subjects.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.637
It also takes advantage 
of <i>Kotlin</i> language features

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:27.222
that make you more productive.

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:29.129
Jetpack manages tedious activities

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.197
like persistence, background tasks,
navigation, and life cycle management.

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:36.827
So you could eliminate boilerplate code
and focus on what makes your app great.

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:40.500
(Andy Lawton) Database persistence
has been a nightmare

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.552
for the Android community for years
and <i>Room</i> is a huge improvement.

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:46.315
And <i>Room</i> was thought out
with testability in mind

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.810
so we're able to add test covers
that we weren't able to before

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.900
on the persistence layer
without having to build

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.698
any infrastructure around that.

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:56.808
(Karen Ng) With Android <i>Jetpack</i>,
we're eliminating whole classes of issues

00:01:56.808 --> 00:01:59.399
and making your code easier to maintain.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.338
Since <i>Zillow</i> has been using
Android architecture components,

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:05.807
users has been experiencing
a lot less bugs in the app.

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:07.710
We'll keep adding
new functionality to <i>Jetpack</i>

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.008
across the entire Android surface.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:11.280
It's easy to get started.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.698
You can update your own app

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:14.780
at your own speed
and all of these components

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.381
will work on older
versions of the platform.
