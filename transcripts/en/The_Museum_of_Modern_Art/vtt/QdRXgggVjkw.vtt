00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.329
I think it’s okay with a little wind.

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.769
It’s kind of blustery in the fall and that’s
nice.

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.470
Hi, my name is Corey D’Augustine from the
IN THE STUDIO series here at MoMA.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.000
I want to welcome you back to the Museum.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.630
In fact, we’re in the Sculpture Garden today.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.500
Hope everyone had a great summer.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
It’s definitely fall here in New York.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.920
It’s kind of cool and windy and drizzly—you
can probably tell here.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.890
School is back in session, and just want to
let you know how we’ll be starting that

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.699
off next Thursday, September 14, 3:00 p.m.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.920
New York time, we will have our second live
Q&amp;A session.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.990
We’ve had some great questions over the
past couple months.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.369
We’ll be addressing a lot of those.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.030
Also please feel free to leave questions down
below on this video, and in addition we’ll

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.390
be taking live questions of course.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.180
We’ll have some announcements about additional
IN THE STUDIO videos that are coming your

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.380
way.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.680
And please be sure to click SUBSCRIBE below
so you don’t miss any of those episodes.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.960
Again, that’s Thursday, September 14 at
3:00 p.m. East Coast time (New York time).

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.280
Looking forward to seeing you then!
