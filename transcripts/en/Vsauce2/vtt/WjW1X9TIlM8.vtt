Vsauce!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Kevin here.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.580
It's Spring Cycle Learn Time.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.100
Spring Fever is not listed under a real diagnostic
medical category but is often associated with

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.620
increased birth rates and the lifting of winter
depression.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.740
However, its original connotation may have
literally been with actual sickness.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.369
It's said American colonists coined the term
to describe weakness and fatigue after months

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.990
without fruits and vegetables - symptoms attributed
to scurvy.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.010
An advanced symptom of the condition which
peaked during Spring - being fever.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.180
The cycle of seasons from Winter to Spring
is marked by the vernal equinox - the day

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.070
when the Earth's axis is pointed parallel
to the sun making day and night close to equal.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.250
But not exactly equal because the sun's ray
are bent by the Earth's atmosphere so we can

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.200
actually see the sun before it rises and after
it sets.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.600
If we lived in a world without air - then
the equinox would truly be an equal night.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.420
The singing of Winter birds like chickadees
and mockingbirds is one of the earliest signs

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.780
of Spring but baby birds need to learn how
to sing.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.960
Like human infants they start out babbling
before learning to string together different

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.390
sounds correctly.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.050
Baby birds raised by humans are often unable
to sing as adults, but can learn from hearing

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.040
recordings of adult birds of the same species.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.380
The reason for Daylight Saving Time is to
make better use of daylight and it was first

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.090
suggested by Benjamin Franklin.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
London builder William Willett spent a fortune
advocating for it because he noticed people

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.950
wouldn't wake up earlier to use the daylight
but could take advantage of it in the evening.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.490
Despite being controversial with people like
farmers who wake at dawn - it was enacted

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.590
as law by governments to save energy during
World War I and again in World War II in which

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.310
a year round Daylight Saving Time in the US
was called "War Time".

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.960
Which equals - Spring Clean Time

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.659
Spring cleaning has deep roots around the
world including Middle Eastern tradition where

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.509
it's thought to bring vibrancy to the new
year, Jewish tradition where every single

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.370
crumb of unleavened bread must be removed
before Passover and in Chinese tradition as

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.140
a means of removing misfortune that may have
accumulated during the year.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.900
Scientifically, in cold winter climates the
air is dry which leads to dry skin for you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.030
and your pets which leads to flaking and therefore
more dust building up in your home that has

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.720
closed windows and doors.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.920
So once its warm enough to open those up - it's
time for spring cleaning.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.610
And as always - thanks for watching.
