00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:43.128 line:0%
and I just wanted to remind you

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:44.530 line:0%
vote for Hope,

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.866
and in case you forgot,
I have buttons.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.601 align:start position:0%
Thank you so much.
We need you this campaign.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:50.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
I need you.
All right?

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.671 align:start position:0%
Vote for Ilo.

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:54.173
Maybe, you know,
I think this would look great

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:56.575
on this adorable jacket
of yours.

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.844 align:start position:0%
Let's make Rochester
great again, all right?

00:07:58.877 --> 00:08:01.213
Ladies, make your voice
be heard in this school.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:02.849
Wouldn't you like that?

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:05.818
Great!

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.254
Well, happy knitting.

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:14.193
[Farrah]
<i> Bridge is a ruthless game.</i>

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:16.529
<i> It's not just dumb luck.</i>

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.765
<i> To win takes an acute ability
 to read people.</i>

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.807 align:start position:0%
So, guess who may have been
the last person

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.175 align:start position:0%
to see Chadwick alive?

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:31.744 align:start size:66% position:34%
How do you know that?

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.012
Just got back
from Cowher's office.

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:35.214 align:start size:41% position:59%
Two club.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.783 align:start size:47% position:53%
So, do we
have a scandal?

00:08:37.816 --> 00:08:39.251 align:start size:44% position:56%
Three diamond.

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:40.853 align:start size:91% position:9%
Seems like it.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:44.924 align:start size:88% position:13%
Um, four heart.

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:47.192
[Farrah]<i> That split-second eye
 meant Jayne With a Y</i>

00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:49.929
<i> stretched her bridge bid
 too far.</i>

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.765
<i> She went for the overkill
 instead of just the kill.</i>

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:53.766
<i> Again.</i>

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
Pass.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.769
Pass.

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:58.003 align:start size:31% position:69%
Pass.

00:08:58.036 --> 00:08:59.638
Your contract.

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.608
Let's play some bridge,
bitches.

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.710
[Farrah]<i> The Y in her name
 makes her too aggressive.</i>

00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:08.013
<i> She has this completely
 unmerited superiority complex</i>

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:11.684
<i> over Plain J-A-N-E,
 which is a weakness</i>

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.752
<i> in both of their personalities
 to exploit.</i>

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:15.854 align:start position:0%
Hurley, stop
staring at Y's rack.

00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:19.191 align:start position:0%
You're like Sophia Loren in
that famous picture with, uh...

00:09:19.224 --> 00:09:20.960 align:start size:78% position:22%
- who was it?
- Jayne Mansfield.

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.828
You know I was named after her.

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.763 align:start position:0%
She had the Y, too.

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:26.198
Hmm.

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:30.136 align:start position:0%
Plain,
play your eight of hearts.

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:34.773
Ooh, wasted a trump card.

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:36.775 align:start size:69% position:31%
[grunts] I figured
the line was too long,

00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:37.943 align:start size:75% position:25%
so I brought a few over.

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:39.345
We're on a cleanse.

00:09:40.712 --> 00:09:41.781
Okay.

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:45.250
Well, that was nice of him.

00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:47.786
Nice doesn't win our vote.

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:49.822
- Vodka?
- [choking]

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.824 align:start size:47% position:53%
How'd you know?

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
That must have taken five cases
of vodka to pull off.

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:55.628 align:start position:0%
Where'd he get
all that booze from?

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.396
Where do you think?

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.831
I'll be right back.

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:04.169
[background chatter]

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:07.206 align:start size:91% position:9%
Must be pretty important
to get the outdoor treatment.

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.942 align:start position:0%
One would assume
you're responsible

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:11.744 align:start position:0%
for the vodka thing.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.778 align:start size:28% position:72%
N-n-n-no.

00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:13.879 align:start size:69% position:31%
Doesn't sound like me.

00:10:13.912 --> 00:10:15.414 size:81% position:41%
What I don't understand is

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:17.850 align:start position:0%
why would you be
backing Ilo?

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:21.020
Of course.

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.821
You're backing both.

00:10:22.854 --> 00:10:25.958 align:start size:94% position:6%
Student council runs
11 to 13 school events a year.

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:28.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would like some influence
in those events.

00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:30.229 align:start position:0%
Gotta respect
the business model, Hook.

00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:33.198 size:81% position:41%
Costs you some cheap vodka
up front and you get an in

00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:35.334 align:start position:0%
to all the student
council-run events.

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
I mean, the whole deal
offers someone like you

00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:39.038 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways
to make some cash.

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start size:78% position:22%
We made a lemonade stand
together in second grade.

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.275 align:start size:72% position:28%
Not all that different.

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:44.877 size:88% position:44%
So, what did you offer Hope?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.245
The Stoners.

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.414 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That dipshit agreed to that?
- Yeah.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:49.982 align:start size:78% position:22%
[snickers]
It's unprovable.

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:51.450 size:78% position:39%
She has no way of knowing
if you delivered or not.

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:54.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
Maybe I happened to speak
with her at the exact moment

00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:56.789 align:start size:88% position:13%
she saw Ilo speaking
privately with the Hipsters.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.957 align:start position:0%
You set her up.
Very slimy.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.926 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's actually no slimier
than waiting to back someone

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.861 align:start size:94% position:6%
until the very end of the race
just so you can leverage

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:04.897 align:start size:63% position:38%
the most last-minute
desperation.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.299 align:start size:91% position:9%
I wonder who Stacey Moorehead
is voting for.

00:11:07.332 --> 00:11:10.135
You know, her nose has a higher
Q-rating than you right now.

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:11.237 align:start size:69% position:31%
Oh!

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.373 align:start size:44% position:56%
Just admit it.

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.341 align:start size:84% position:16%
You also want the president
in your back pocket.

00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:18.377 align:start size:72% position:28%
You're just waiting on
the best possible deal.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.013
I think you're confusing
strategy with apathy.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.186 align:start position:0%
[Stacey]
I suck at cards.

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:29.154 align:start position:0%
I mean, I lose at War.

00:11:29.187 --> 00:11:31.023
The guys at the summer camp
I worked at this summer

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:33.325
tried to make me play strip
poker with them all the time,

00:11:33.358 --> 00:11:35.260
and I was like, guys, come on.
This is camp.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:37.863
[giggles]

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:39.798 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm sorry.

00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:41.266 align:start position:0%
I'm in your seat.

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:44.203 align:start size:63% position:38%
Stacey,
did you lose weight?

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.205 align:start size:41% position:59%
You look...
so different.

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
You know
I got my nose done.

00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:50.042 align:start size:22% position:78%
Right.

00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:51.810 align:start position:0%
[sighs] Yeah, there was
this little blurb about it

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:53.245 size:84% position:42%
in The Crotch this morning.

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:57.049 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you saw it,
but I was like, whatever.

00:11:57.082 --> 00:11:59.284
Well, it is cute
as a little button,

00:11:59.317 --> 00:12:00.486
and so natural.

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.788 align:start size:63% position:38%
I forgot what your
old one looked like.

00:12:02.821 --> 00:12:04.957
What was wrong with it again?

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.091 align:start size:94% position:6%
Farrah...

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:07.259 align:start size:31% position:69%
Oh, right.

00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:10.429 align:start size:63% position:38%
It had a little bump
right here.

00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:13.799 align:start size:78% position:22%
And weren't your nostrils
a little different, too?

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:15.167 size:75% position:38%
I had a deviated septum.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.804 align:start size:38% position:63%
Right. Wink.
Insurance.

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:19.972
[laughing]

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:22.908 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go.

00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:24.210
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
Hey, good for you for
having the guts to go through

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:31.183
major surgery instead of just
living the way that you were.

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:36.422 align:start position:0%
Really brave.
So brave.

00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:40.793
Bless her heart.

So, Hope, I heard Ilo teed up
Dipankar Ghosh this morning.

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:06.285
First the Comicons,
now the Indians,

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:08.420
and I'm hearing
he's moving on the Ligbits.

00:13:08.453 --> 00:13:09.588 align:start size:66% position:34%
You're getting killed
in the minority vote.

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:11.390 align:start size:75% position:25%
Tell me you have a plan.

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.226 align:start position:0%
I've got the Knitters
and the Dramas.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:15.327 align:start position:0%
I've been working
other angles, too.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.529 align:start size:38% position:63%
Like who?
The Stoners?

00:13:17.562 --> 00:13:20.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ilo's vodka stunt
just won their drunk asses.

00:13:20.498 --> 00:13:23.335 align:start size:53% position:47%
The way I see it,
you need me.

00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:25.003 align:start size:91% position:9%
Obviously.

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:27.606 size:81% position:41%
I'm standing in the middle
of suicide office. So...

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:30.275 align:start size:66% position:34%
So, I assume you read
that the school

00:13:30.308 --> 00:13:33.145 align:start size:94% position:6%
- isn't replacing Chadwick.
- And?

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:36.548
I want your speech to propose
using last year's budget surplus

00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:40.219 align:start size:66% position:34%
to turn the scene of
this horrible tragedy

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:41.987 align:start size:75% position:25%
into something positive.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.522
Like what?

00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:45.991 align:start size:56% position:44%
A private
handicap bathroom.

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:49.061
I get losing the Curry
and Fag blocs are big,

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:51.630
but why would I go for
the Retard and Wheelie vote?

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.599
I mean, that's like two people,

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.500
and not the most
reliable ones at that.

00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:57.069 size:84% position:58%
Do you want my vote or not?

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.437
I don't get it.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.639
What do you get from
a handicap bathroom?

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:03.308
A place for handicapped people
to go to the bathroom.

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:05.143 align:start position:0%
Come on.
What's the real reason?

00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start size:50% position:50%
That's it.

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:08.881 align:start position:0%
Look, I'd love to
make you a deal,

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.949 align:start position:0%
but I already
promised it to the band.

00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:13.418 align:start position:0%
There's like 20-plus votes
in the woodwinds alone.

- How could I just say--
- I get it.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
The band's
the biggest bloc in school.

something else

Oh, I know I wanted to say
that thing that would make it

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.027

Hmmm, and I'll assume
you'll want a key

Ah, seems too easy.

Why didn't Hope make
that deal with you?

00:23:01.612 --> 00:23:03.415 align:start size:69% position:31%
She already promised
the space to the band.
