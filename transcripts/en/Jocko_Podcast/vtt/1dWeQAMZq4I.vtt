00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.060
How do you get over feeling like an impostor?
As a new manager,

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.940
I feel like I'm about to get found out.
Welcome to leadership,

3
00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:13.480
my friend.
Here's the thing,
here's what you're actually scared of.

4
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:18.481
What you're scared of most likely is them knowing and finding out that you don't

5
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.290
know everything.
Right?
That's what people don't like to admit when they're wrong.

6
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:27.760
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah,
and the thing that you need to know is it's okay.

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.190
It's okay not to know everything.

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.450
It's perfectly normal to be in a leadership position and not know everything in

9
00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:35.050
the world.

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.130
You don't have to know everything about this particular job that you're going

11
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:41.830
into or what the,
you don't need to know everything.
You don't need to.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.630
What you need to do is go in,
ask questions,

13
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.440
listen to people and say,
Hey,
you know what?

14
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:52.300
I haven't done this procedure before.
I've never,

15
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:54.100
I never worked with this piece of equipment for it.
Can you show,

16
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.630
can you walk me through it?
Can you show me how to do it?

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.250
I just want to make sure I understand what you're doing.
Make sure I get it.

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.520
Oh,
okay.
Now,

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.690
it's not an excuse to not know anything because if you're in a leadership

20
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.021
position,

21
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:12.490
you should be studying and reading and learning about whatever the role you're

22
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.470
in is that you can understand it all.

23
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.790
Study the manuals and the regulations and the procedures,

24
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.650
and I'm not saying to follow all those things blindly without common sense.
No,

25
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:26.710
that's not what I'm saying,
but there's a knowledge base that you should,

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.850
you should acquire very quickly when you roll into a leadership position.

27
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:33.520
So put the work in and then apply common sense,

28
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.880
but this is the same thing that I say every time somebody asked me about how do

29
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.460
you lead this or how do you lead that?
Or how do you lead New People?

30
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:42.280
Or how do you lead senior people?
It's the same answer every time.

31
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.870
Be Humble and listen to them beyond time.

32
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.410
Work hard,
treat people with respect,

33
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.410
weigh the decisions carefully.
Talk to people and then make a good decision.

34
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.470
Empower your folks to lead.
Don't micromanage them,

35
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.130
but give them at the same time,
clear guidance about what the expectations are.

36
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.230
It's just leadership.
And when you're a new leader,
it's all good.

37
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.970
You don't need to know everything.

38
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.040
You're not expected to know everything and showing that you can admit that you

39
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:20.680
don't know everything isn't going to hurt your reputation.

40
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.880
It's actually going to help you reputation.
And some go in,
be humble,

41
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.640
ask some good questions,
learn as fast as you can,

42
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.070
and it's okay.
And you know,
I was thinking about this,

43
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.470
um,
in the 80s,

44
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.471
and perhaps even in the 90s when guys were losing their hair and going bald,

45
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:44.800
right?
They do a comb-over.

46
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.190
So they try and pull their hair over their balding scalp.

47
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:53.110
So it did look like they were going bald.
And I'm telling you as a leader,

48
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.160
don't do a leadership comb-over do what guys do now,

49
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.000
which is they just shaved their head.
Right?
Hey,
you know what?
I,
I'm,

50
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.860
I'm going a little,
a little fed up top.
All good.
Just going to shave it off.
Yeah.

51
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.470
Hey,
I'm your new leader.
Don't know everything.
It's all good.
Here's where I,

52
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.280
here's where I'm weak.
Give me a hand.
Yeah,
no big deal.
That's a good analogy.

53
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.320
By the way,
don't do too little silver call over

54
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.670
the what?
Tell me if you would agree with this.
Generally speaking.

55
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.963
Um,

56
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.460
you're watching a movie demolition man with the as the best alone Wesley snipes.

57
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700
Negative.
Anyway,
Dennis,
I think his name is Dennis leary.

58
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.060
It doesn't seem like your kind of movie,
but maybe it would be,
I don't know.

59
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.230
Anyway,
densely or he's this kind of underground,
um,

60
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.190
rebel cause basically La is,
this is a long explanation.

61
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.510
I'll make you sure.
Don't want to,
Shit.
It has to do with leadership though for,

62
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.200
okay,
I'm ready.
So I'm all about leadership.
Basically the,
you know,

63
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.020
it's in the future,
whatever.
And um,
the,

64
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:56.350
the world is turning into this like over sensitized.
Like you can't swear,

65
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:58.660
he can't eat junk food.
It's the law.
Like,
you know,

66
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.420
so everyone's all nice and real weak and stuff like that.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.320
But there's a group of people who rebelled against it,
went underground,
right.

68
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.680
And the leader of those guys is called egg Edgar friendly.
Right?

69
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.680
And so they go down and he's regarded as this huge criminal,
right?

70
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.250
The demolition comes back.
Long story about him.
But anyway,

71
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.360
he's back to help rid the world of these criminals.
So he goes in,

72
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.090
he encounters Edgar friendly,
and they're not rebel.

73
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.980
They're not these evil people.
They're just like,

74
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.270
just trying to live basically a freedom of free life,
you know?
And they're like,

75
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.320
oh.
He's like,
Hey,
well why don't you lead these people outta here?
Right.

76
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.480
And he's like,
I'm the leader.

77
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.530
Sometimes I do some shit and people come with me.
Right.

78
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.200
That's kind of what he says.
So isn't this his?
So here's the question.

79
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.320
Sorry for long explanation.
Here's

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.651
how this guy's,

81
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:55.360
he's kind of like worried about people finding him out that he's not a leader.

82
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.680
Right?
Isn't that like a huge sign of humility that he's like on the inside,

83
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:02.950
he's not.
I know everything,
you know,
and that's Kinda like,
man,

84
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:05.440
I don't know it all,
you know,
and I'm worried about this.

85
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.120
It's actually a good sign.
You are correct.

86
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.420
It's a good sign when you've got someone who's like,
man,
I want to do good.

87
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.190
He wants to do a good job.
He wants [inaudible],
he wants to good job.

88
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.520
And he's like worried about it,
so that's,
that is good.
That is a good thing.
Yeah.

89
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.960
It's like his humility is like,

90
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.460
it's so genuine that that's one of his many worries of being a leader.

91
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.580
You know that it's a good sign.
It's better than someone says,

92
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.970
you know what I'm about to take over as a new leader.
Yeah.
And I'm on this thing.

93
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.823
I'm going to own

94
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.620
everything and no one knows anything that I know.
So it's gonna Right?
Yeah.

95
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.490
You don't want to be that guy.
