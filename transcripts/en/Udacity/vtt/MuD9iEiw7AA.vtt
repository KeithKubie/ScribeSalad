00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.470
So the FGFR3 mutation is enough to cause smaller bones, but,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.000
would two alleles cause even smaller bones in the smaller person?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.140
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question. It turns out that the effects of

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.470
a single allele are so significant that if you have two copies of

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.730
the homozygous dominant condition, it would

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.240
actually be lethal. Because it, the effects

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.040
would be so severe and cause even bigger defects in bone cells and elsewhere.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.330
&gt;&gt; Do you mean lethal during prenatal development lethal?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah. In the case of a chondroplasia, you can actually be

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.000
born as a homozygous dominant. But you don't live for very long after.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.625
&gt;&gt; So all little people with achondroplasia are heterozygous for the

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:40.970
FGFR3 mutation. And that means if they mate with an individual of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.090
average size who doesn't have the FGFR3 mutation, there's a 50%

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.740
chance that they, themselves will have a little person as a child.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.180
&gt;&gt; And if they have children with somebody with the FGFR3 mutation,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.710
they have a 25% chance of having a child with a homozygous

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.070
combination, which is lethal. Now that's a lot to think about. I'm curious

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.510
what you think you would do if you knew that there was

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.280
a 50% chance that you would have a little person as a child.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.940
&gt;&gt; But, what if you knew that there was a 25% chance

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.070
that you would have a child that may die as an infant.
