00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.630
Typically in Hollywood movies, no matter what
kind of obstacles are thrown in the hero’s

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.619
way, they find a way to come out on top.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.930
James Bond always lives to fight another day,
Superman sends Lex Luthor to jail, and the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.779
crew of the Starship Enterprise goes off on
another mission through the Final Frontier.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.430
As feel-good as this can be, it does run the
risk of getting stale, and sometimes the filmmakers

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.030
have to mix things up.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.300
Every once in a while, the villain gets the
upper hand to make life truly miserable for

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.420
the protagonist and leave audiences feeling
dire.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.780
Here are 10 famous movies where the bad guy
actually wins.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.980
Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.510
Just from the title, you knew things weren’t
going to go well for the Rebel Alliance in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.730
this Star Wars sequel.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.649
Darth Vader and the Imperials rebounded strongly
following their defeat in the Battle of Yavin,

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.150
wiping out the Rebel presence on Hoth, capturing
Han Solo and freezing him in carbonite, and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.540
besting Luke Skywalker in a lightsaber duel.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.430
Just about everything went the villains’
way in this film, except for Luke joining

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.530
the Dark Side of the Force.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.020
They say the second chapter in a trilogy is
usually the darkest, and that tradition arguably

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.120
started with this movie.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.660
When the credits rolled, many wondered how
the heroes could ever come back.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.729
The Dark Knight

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.880
The Joker’s goal in this critically acclaimed
crime drama is to prove that deep down, everyone

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.830
is corruptible and can commit heinous acts
like he does.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.580
By the end of the film, it’s safe to say
he was successful in those goals.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.760
Through his intricate plan, the Clown Prince
of Crime brought Harvey Dent down to his level,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.610
transforming the district attorney into the
evildoer Two-Face.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.540
And when Dent goes on a homicidal spree following
his transformation, Batman takes the fall

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
for the crimes, essentially lying so the people
of Gotham can maintain their vision of hope.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.869
Anyone who can make the Caped Crusader become
a Gotham police target clearly didn’t lose.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.030
No Country for Old Men

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.189
One of the most chilling villains in recent
memory is Anton Chigurh, who became the film’s

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.549
most memorable character thanks to an unforgettable
turn by Javier Bardem.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.970
The hitman’s mission is to track down and
recover a briefcase of money, and he becomes

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.200
a thorn in the side of Llewelyn Moss and Sherriff
Ed Tom Bell.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.330
In the end, he bests all the come through
his path, killing Moss and leaving Bell to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.509
face retirement having failed his last case.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.450
It’s true that Chigurh is brutally wounded
in a car accident near the film’s end, but

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.180
he got away alive – and nobody saw him.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.010
The Silence of the Lambs

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.561
You know things have gotten dire when the
authorities need the help of a serial killer

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.980
to track down another serial killer, and that’s
what happens in this film.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.450
Hannibal Lecter is an extremely cunning villain,
and through a series of events, he’s able

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.480
to escape incarceration and makes his way
back into the free world.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.180
The cannibal promises to not pursue Clarice
Sterling, but he cannot make that exception

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.900
for everyone involved with the FBI.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.310
With the infamous line, “I’m having an
old friend for dinner,” audiences know that

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.030
Hannibal got what he wanted and is ready to
unleash his terror on the world again.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.030
Gone Girl

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.180
A truly sadistic individual, Amy Dunne’s
shocking master plan is one of the cruelest

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.620
we’ve seen in some time.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.590
Faking her own murder and making her husband
Nick appear responsible, she has a very unique

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.750
way of seeking revenge.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.580
Yes, Nick was unfaithful, but he didn’t
deserve to be put through this kind of hell.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.540
To top it all off, Amy’s shocking revelation
that she’s pregnant with what is most likely

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.200
Nick’s child all but forces the “happily”
married couple to stay together despite their

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.460
multitude of problems.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.240
Once Nick tearfully apologized on TV, that’s
what Amy wanted, so she was getting her way

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.760
no matter what happened in the story.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.989
The Usual Suspects

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.530
This twisty mystery film is fueled by one
key question: Who is Keyser Soze?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.840
The police attempt to learn the truth by interrogating
the con man Verbal Kint, who tells his questioners

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.330
a complex story about how a band of criminals
ended up working together under Soze’s command.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.519
Once Verbal’s bail is posted, he leaves
the station, and the cops learn that Kint

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.440
had fabricated everything he said, coming
across as a naïve low-rate bad guy instead

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.080
of the mastermind that he really is.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.519
Verbal is actually Keyser Soze, and he got
off Scott free, riding away in a car as the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.650
police scramble to bring him to justice.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.650
Seven

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.690
Most serial killers have their own trademark,
and John Doe models his murders after the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.340
seven deadly sins, showing that humanity has
become desolate and dark.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.159
His actions draw the attention of Detectives
Somerset and Mills, and their paths intertwine

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.720
in a truly tragic way.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.530
Doe completes his masterpiece by killing Mills’
pregnant wife and placing her head in a box,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.690
which sends Mills into a fit of wrath.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.590
Doe realizes that he represents envy, since
he is jealous of Mills’ life and begs to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.130
be shot by the detective.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.959
Mills obliges and will obviously never be
the same again.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.510
Doe may have been evil, but he had a point.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.510
JFK

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.620
It’s not a typical tale of good vs. evil,
but if there are villains in Oliver Stone’s

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.269
film, it’s the government officials that
Jim Garrison tries to convict as he unravels

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.090
the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.990
To him, the evidence is clear and he makes
an impassioned speech to the jury about how

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.069
there was a second shooter and Lee Harvey
Oswald could not have acted alone.

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.720
There’s no denying he makes a compelling
case, but in the end it was all for naught.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.169
The judge rules that Clay Shaw is not guilty.

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.219
Even if the argument could be made for a conspiracy,
there wasn’t enough there to tie Shaw to

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:40.219
it.

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.659
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.499
Even though Koba dies at the end of this sequel,
it’s safe to say that he won in his battle

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:46.499
against Caesar.

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.319
The ape community had become divided as Koba
and Caesar disagreed over how to handle the

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.599
surviving humans on Earth.

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.689
Koba, who was used frequently in lab experiments,
believes violence is the answer, while Caesar

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.389
is a pacifist and wants peace.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.439
Koba’s philosophy ultimately prevails as
he attempts to assassinate Caesar, blames

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.419
the humans, and leads a destructive conflict
that spawns a war.

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.400
Caesar now has to take part in something he
never wanted, and it will be interesting to

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.330
see how his character evolves in the next
film.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.599
Captain America: Civil War

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.900
In a film with two teams of Avengers fighting
each other, Zemo is the main antagonist pulling

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.189
all the strings.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.669
Seeking vengeance for his deceased family,
Zemo sets out to tear Earth’s Mightiest

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.029
apart by exposing one heartbreaking secret.

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.389
Through a careful plan, Tony Stark learns
that Steve Rogers’ best friend Bucky was

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.110
the one who murdered his parents – which
only worsens his guilt.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.919
Though nobody was killed, Zemo was still successful
in fracturing the team, and it won’t be

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.379
easy for them to get back together in Infinity
War.

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.210
There are a lot of personal issues left to
be worked out, and hopefully future films

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.639
explore this further.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.150
Those are just some of the films where the
villains ended up winning.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.490
Are there any we missed?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.800
Which ones are your favorites?
