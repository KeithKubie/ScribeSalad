- HEY! YOU GUYS SAID YOU
NEEDED LIGHTING FOR YOUR MOVIE,

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.232

BLACK LIGHT.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.567

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.280
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS.
WE'RE NOT FILMING A PORNO.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.182
- WELL, WE MIGHT HAVE TO,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.850
TO SHOOT ALICE'S DUMB,
STUPID SCRIPT.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.785
- IT'S REALLY DUMB.
IT'S REALLY STUPID.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.787
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
OUR OWN ORIGINAL IDEA, MAN.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.323
- OKAY, YES. NO.
WE'RE GONNA DO OUR MOVIE.

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.991
NOT ALICE'S.
NOT A PORNO.

- OKAY, WELL--

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.461
