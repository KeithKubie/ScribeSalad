00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.563
(upbeat organ music)

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.940
- Welcome to a Conversation with History,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.840
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.450
of International Studies.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.710
Our guest today is James O. Freedman,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.340
who is the president
of the American Academy

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.340
of Arts and Sciences, from 1987 to 2000,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.030
he was president of Dartmouth College,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.740
and from 1982 to 1987, the president

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.900
of the University of Iowa.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.560
His publications include
Crisis and Legitimacy:

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.200
The Administrative Process
and American Government,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.990
and Idealism and the Role of Education.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.520
Mr. Freedman, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.580
- Thank you very much.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.530
- You write in your book,
Idealism and Liberal Education,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830
which I will show here, you say,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.830
sometimes lives do seem
to be framed by a theme,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.830
and you pose as an important question

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.930
to identify the forces
that created and shaped

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.590
that defining theme, so I think it's fair

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.310
for me to first ask you, what has been

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.697
the defining theme of your life?

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:36.700
- Well, that's a good question.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.590
I think back to when I was,
probably in high school,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.040
and one of the books we were asked to read

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.500
was Macaulay's essay on
Johnson, a short essay,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.390
and we were told to go home one night

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.580
and to find the sentence in that essay

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.690
that best capsulized the theme
of Samuel Johnson's life,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.470
and I've always remembered that sentence,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770
because Macaulay's
sentence that is the pivot

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.770
is that the force of his mind
overcame all impediments.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.240
So when I look at lives, including my own,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.770
I do try to think about
what the themes were.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.140
I think, in my life, there've
really been two themes.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.400
The first has been the
question of education.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.360
I fell in love with
education as a young person.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.580
I loved to read, I loved to go to school,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.690
I didn't wanna leave college,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.070
I didn't wanna leave law school.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.810
That's certainly one of the themes,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.790
and I think the other theme has to do with

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.178
whatever influences there
were on me in growing up

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:33.420
in a Jewish home in a
small New Hampshire town,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.720
with a very small Jewish population.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.010
And there's, of course, a very common,

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.120
a really mundane theme
of Jewish kid striving

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.080
to make their place in American society.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.080
- And how did your parents
shape you in this regard?

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.640
- Well, I think, my father
was a high school teacher,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.950
he taught junior year in high school.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.820
I think they shaped me
primarily by reading.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.210
We always had books in the
house, always had magazines.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.550
For my father, the life of
literature was wonderful.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.030
He, because of the way
high schools bought books,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.880
you tended to teach the same book

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.330
as long as they had 40 copies
year after year after year,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.660
and he taught every year
Idylls of the King by Tennyson,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.770
he taught Macbeth, he taught
The House of Seven Gables

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.990
by Hawthorne, and he was
in love with those books,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.110
and he did not get bored
or tired, year after year,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.740
in teaching them.
- Did you have any teachers

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.161
as a young person that
really influenced you,

00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.540
talking now about high school, not later?

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.307
- I can't say in high
school, there were teachers

00:03:38.307 --> 00:03:40.490
whom I thought were very
good, and whom I liked,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.210
but I was still, I wasn't a
reader yet in high school,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.820
I was too interested in the
things young adolescent kids do,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.960
but reading wasn't one of them.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.110
I really didn't start to
read in a serious way till,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.480
in a way that, in a loving
way, until I got to college.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.440
- And talk a little about your mother

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.800
and her input into the
shaping of your character.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.150
- Well, my mother, I think,
had a profound input.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.820
She was the daughter of immigrants,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.777
she grew up in New York, she
never had the opportunity,

00:04:09.777 --> 00:04:11.951
as women usually didn't in those days,

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.100
to go to college, but she was
profoundly ambitious for me.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.870
There was nothing too
high for me to aim at.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.439
She, I think it was her ambition,

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.430
and my father's kind of love of literature

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.879
and things intellectual,
that kind of merged

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.500
to fuel where my energies were put.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.370
- And what about conversations
at the dinner table?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.630
Was there a lot of the discussions

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.090
that go with Jewish idealism,
concerns about social justice?

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.923
- No, there wasn't.

00:04:42.923 --> 00:04:46.770
I mean, I really, we were
not a heavily observant

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.388
Jewish family, my mother, indeed,

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.480
would not be observant at all.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.320
Her parents, I suspect, were socialists

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.020
who'd come over from Europe.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.140
Religion, to her, was indeed probably

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.518
the opiate of the masses,
if she could know that term.

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:02.600
My father cared, and I
was, of course, bar mitzvah

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.300
and we went to shul on the
high holidays and the like,

00:05:06.548 --> 00:05:07.850
but I really wasn't aware until,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.240
I would say just in the last 10 years

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.650
of what a profound effect it had on me

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.460
to be the only Jewish kid
in my class from K to eight,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.952
and one of the two or three in a class

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:20.150
of 300 in high school.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.470
I mean, it's only in recent
years that I've looked back

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.260
and seen how important being Jewish was,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.630
how outside, how much
of an outsider I felt,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.930
although at the time, I did not.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.930
- And you, in one of your
essays, you actually talk about

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.130
Justices Frankfurter and Brandeis,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.130
and the consequences of their Jewishness

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:49.810
for the way they viewed the world

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.117
and their concerns, actually,

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:54.570
and this outsider theme emerges in that.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.602
- Well, that's right,
the theme of that essay,

00:05:57.602 --> 00:05:59.243
in a sense, is that some Jews have wanted

00:05:59.243 --> 00:06:01.600
to be insiders and some
Jews have preferred

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.000
to remain outsiders, and I don't know

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.470
that I had any conscious preference,

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.210
but I was probably an outsider

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.860
until, I would say, 10 years ago,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.670
and it's in the last 10 years

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.453
that I have become, in my own mind,

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.860
very identified with Jewish causes.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.290
I'm now very active in the
American Jewish Committee,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.570
and I do, I'm on the board of Brandeis.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.140
I care now, deeply, about Jewish causes

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.290
but I did not until I was
probably into my mid-50s.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.140
- Do you think you've been influenced

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:33.310
by the focus on cultural identity

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.307
that is so much a part of
American pluralism today?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.750
- No, I think I've really,
it's been, I think two things.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.120
It's, first of all,
I've discovered the joy

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.280
and beauty of Judaism and
the threat that it is under

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.240
in a country, in the United States,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.290
not principally, from anti-Semitism,

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.950
but from intermarriage, that the values

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.560
of the Jewish community
and of Jewish religion

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.030
seem to me very important, and I think,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.610
we risk not being able to perpetuate them

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.710
if we don't identity as Jews.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.490
I think the other thing is
that I really went through

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.400
my life without ever facing anti-Semitism,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.640
and it's only in the last 10 years

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.280
that I've come to appreciate
how much my parents'

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.420
generation did suffer from that,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.057
and I've come to be much
more conscious of that.

00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:25.170
- Let's go back a minute,
'cause you touched on this,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.881
but as I look at your
life and your writings,

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.620
it's really a story, as you said,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.687
of understanding how to educate yourself,

00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:39.280
how to create a community of education

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.000
and how to secure an
environment in which students

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.030
will be prepared for life.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.920
So let's talk a little
about this love affair

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.740
that you have with books,
which I think is a phase,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.260
in that you are a collector.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.910
Tell us a little about books
and what they have meant

00:07:57.841 --> 00:07:59.500
for you beyond just reading them.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.770
- Well, there are, of
course, single books,

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.180
individual books that all
of us find at some point

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.280
in our life, and we read
once every two or three years

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.600
for the rest of our life,
and I have a half a dozen

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.900
of such books, but I have
loved collecting books.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.200
And I don't know how
that relates to being,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.100
as some people are, a collector
of stamps or of antique cars

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.720
or of pressed flowers or
what, but I have loved

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.050
collecting books, and I
have an elaborate scheme

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.600
of organization and codification,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.771
and have something now on
the order of 6,000 books.

00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:32.604
- Oh my goodness.
- Although, every two,

00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:34.620
three, four years, I
sell a thousand of them

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.170
because I just don't have room.

00:08:37.175 --> 00:08:40.470
And it's like giving up a child,
but I just don't have room.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.040
And your interests change, and books

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.260
that interested you 30 years
ago interest you less today.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.100
- What writers stand out in your mind?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.120
I mean, there must be an enormous number

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.010
for someone like you,
but sort of key books,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.410
pivotal books?
- Well, key books,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.180
I would say Camus is one, and The Plague

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.230
would be the pivotal book,
Faulkner is of course one,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.739
and gosh, anything of
Faulkner is wonderful.

00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:07.480
I love the short stories of Faulkner.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.600
I love Hawthorne, and I love, oh,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.200
The Blithedale Romance even more

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.103
than I love Scarlet Letter,
both wonderful books.

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:18.080
I very much like V.S.
Naipaul, and I think his books

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.880
are just just brilliant books,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.960
but there are many, the
authors could go on.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.170
- And what, you say,
you write in your book,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.850
books earn their claim on our lives

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.140
by their power to help us to think,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.930
to care and to acquire standards

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.850
of judgment and appreciation.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.670
So it's really a program of
continuous education, really?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.530
I think it is, and the phrase,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.480
books claim, make their
claim on that power,

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.350
all of us have read books
that we never quite forget.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.310
I mean, I saw a reference a
day or two ago in some place

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.319
in the papers to Of Mice
and Men, the Steinbeck book,

00:09:58.319 --> 00:10:00.600
and Lenny in there.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.410
After you've read that book,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.700
you never again can be quite as callous

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.559
as perhaps you once
were to people who are,

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:10.890
perhaps, a bit retarded,
perhaps a bit slow,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.970
but are kindly and nice people.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.420
It affects you, it affects everything

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.723
you look at after that.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.570
- And it partly, the story,
the idea that moves you,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.100
but it's also the use of
words, the use of language?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.410
- Oh, sure it is.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.850
I mean there's not a parent, I think,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.100
who, if you read King
Lear in your adulthood,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.910
doesn't ask himself lots
and lots of questions

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.520
of how did Lear go wrong
with his daughters.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.260
And, gosh, the lines
from Lear that come out,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.910
How sharper than a serpent's tooth

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.820
it is to have a thankless child.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.280
I mean, the language is not beatable.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.830
As an undergraduate, I had two
courses with Northrop Frye,

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.530
the great scholar of
so much of literature.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.060
And he used to say that
an economy of words

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.970
in expressing a thought is
one of the great achievements.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.950
And, of course, the
quintessential example is,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.390
To be or not to be.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.700
You probably can't
express that idea better

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.563
than that brief collection of words.

00:11:14.263 --> 00:11:19.200
- You are a craftsman with the
word, as I read your essays.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.360
- Thank you.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.250
- Do you think that that comes from,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.970
to use the metaphor you used yesterday,

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.040
the passing of the Jade, that
you have acquired a skill

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.070
with writing by reading so much?

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.580
- I don't know if it was that as much

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.300
as it was going to law school.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.300
I think law school makes
you aware of words.

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.640
There was a famous episode, I'm not sure

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.640
that it's in the book, when Abe Fortas

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.960
was being nominated for the Supreme Court,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.620
and he was asked a question
in the Judiciary Committee

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.190
about a phrase like due process of law,

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.720
and he couldn't answer it,
or he wouldn't answer it.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.420
He didn't believe it wise to answer it,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.370
and the senators kept pressing him.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.740
Look, it's only a few
words, I mean, after all.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.627
And Fortas replied and said,

00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:05.853
"Sir, I have made my living with words,

00:12:05.853 --> 00:12:10.447
"and I can tell you every
single word is tricky,

00:12:10.447 --> 00:12:11.767
"and it's a well of meaning

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:13.620
"and you've got to be very careful."

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.310
So I think law school really made me

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:19.300
conscious of how to use
words, and it made me aware

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.900
that you need 10 drafts
of anything you write,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.210
and it does get better.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.410
You put the adjectives in
and then you take them out.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.740
- So what is the most important thing

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.840
a student must know about writing?

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.399
That is, the patience, the perseverance,

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:35.640
the need for rewrite?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.520
- All of those, but I think
most of all, the right word.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.730
I mean, I, again and again
am puzzled in my own writing

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.410
by how to find the right adjective.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.440
Did someone say something sharply

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.250
or bitterly, or quickly or glibly?

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.370
I mean, to find the right adverb,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.304
I find enormously
challenging and difficult.

00:12:56.304 --> 00:13:01.304
- You went to Harvard and
then to Yale Law School.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.230
And I was struck, in reading
your autobiographical essay,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.020
about, something changed in you

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.897
that made you more comfortable
with being a student.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.563
What was that?

00:13:22.063 --> 00:13:22.896
- Yeah, I've tried myself
to figure that out.

00:13:22.896 --> 00:13:25.280
I, certainly, at Harvard did well enough,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.970
but was not exceptional, a
good part of the Harvard years

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.680
were years of kinda
post-adolescent depression

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.430
and lack of certainty and groping around

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.540
for what life might offer.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.060
I then worked for two years after college,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.300
and by the time I went back to law school,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.210
I think I was more mature
and there was something

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.010
about law school that was
just, to me, dazzling.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.860
I just loved those professors.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.020
I didn't want to leave after three years.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.206
It was just a wonderful experience.

00:13:55.206 --> 00:13:56.848
- And you were a journalist in between?

00:13:56.848 --> 00:13:57.767
- I was a journalist in
between, that's right.

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:59.971
- And you suggested that that contributed

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:01.723
also to your giving?
- It may well have.

00:14:01.723 --> 00:14:04.540
It certainly put me in closer touch

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.840
with public affairs and made me,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.510
we're talking now at a local level,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.890
city council, police
court, things of that sort.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.240
But all of that made me think it would be

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.010
a good thing to be a lawyer.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.850
- Now what at Yale, you encountered

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.471
and studied under one of the
two mentors in your life,

00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:27.264
Alexander Bickel,
- Yes.

00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:29.000
- Who was a professor of law.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Tell us his impact on
you and the educational

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.970
journey that you've taken.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.676
- Well, Alex Bickel had
an enormous impact on me.

00:14:39.676 --> 00:14:42.500
He is a man who was born in Bucharest,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.080
came to this country at age 12,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.940
became a brilliant student himself,

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.110
clerked for Justice Frankfurter.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.020
He was just, in the classroom, electric.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.090
Alex Bickel had a mind
of enormous originality.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.710
He encouraged students to
engage him and debate him.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.658
He was enormously generous.

00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:04.107
He helped me when I wanted
to enter law teaching.

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:06.500
Alex Bickel was just, kind of

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.280
the most important teacher I ever had.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.060
- And he taught you procedure, right,

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.270
was that, or many things?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.447
- Well, constitutional law.
- Oh, constitutional law.

00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:15.933
- He was a constitutional law person,

00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:18.280
but he had views on
constitutional law which were

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.390
quite out of the received
conventional wisdom at the time,

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:26.313
and today, I think on sadly,
are hardly regarded at all.

00:15:26.313 --> 00:15:29.590
I regard them highly, but history has

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.510
in a sense, passed by his views.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.520
Maybe they'll come back someday.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.353
- And what were those views?

00:15:34.353 --> 00:15:36.700
- Well, he is very much a
person of judicial restraint.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.750
- I see.
- Very much a person

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.710
of keeping the Supreme
Court out of federal courts,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.900
generally, out of decisions
that oughta be made

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.150
by legislative and elected officials.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.700
- Mm-hmm, so he would
have been much exasperated

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.310
by the recent election in Florida?

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.656
- Well, I think so, yes, I think so.

00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:55.417
- He taught you, you say,
the morality of consent

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:59.430
and the procedures by which
public decisions are made?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.600
- Yes, I mean, part of
what Bickel understood was

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.800
that society had to develop organically.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.515
One of his great heroes was Edmund Burke.

00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:12.380
And he admired Burke's sense of society

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.950
as a kind of a coral reef of beliefs

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.320
and views that have been accumulated

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.070
over many, many centuries.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.460
And he really wanted society,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.780
he wanted the Supreme Court to play a role

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.020
that generated widespread
consent, rather than just,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.780
by edict, announce this
is what the law will be,

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.343
because he thought that didn't
have a chance of catching on,

00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:33.680
that one really needed to generate

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.720
in society a general consent, and indeed,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.220
that's what he thought,
I'm not sure whether

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.950
he thought Brown against the Board,

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.510
which declared segregation
unconstitutional,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.040
was a wise decision in a scholarly sense,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.940
but he was very pleased
with the Court saying,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.760
We will do this, not immediately,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.570
but with all deliberate speed,

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.280
to be done slowly, carefully, building up

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.220
a kind of a basis in society
for acceptance of it.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.200
- And the man who argued that case,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.576
Brown versus Board of Education

00:17:06.576 --> 00:17:11.160
was Thurgood Marshall,
who you law clerked under.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.010
- That's right.
- Actually later,

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.889
when he was appointed
to the Appellate Court

00:17:14.889 --> 00:17:16.746
and then the Supreme Court.

00:17:16.746 --> 00:17:18.153
- Indeed, Alex Bickel told me once,

00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:20.285
he was a law clerk for Justice Frankfurter

00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:21.420
when that case was argued, and he said

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.250
that Justice Marshall's argument

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.143
was the finest Supreme Court
argument he had ever heard.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.210
- Tell us a little
about Thurgood Marshall.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.286
- Well, there's a remarkable man, I think,

00:17:32.286 --> 00:17:35.320
one of the great Americans,
and I think I say in the book,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.820
I think that he has done
more for race relations

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.130
in this country than, perhaps,

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.280
any individual except for Abraham Lincoln.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.830
That may be a bit of an overstatement,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.010
but he should be near the top.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.840
He's a remarkable man.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.560
He was so different from
my law school professors,

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.170
who were, of course, very
scholarly and intellectual.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.610
He, when I went to work for him right out

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.430
of law school was a practical man.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.160
He wanted to know how trials worked,

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.260
and when errors were made,
allegedly, in lower courts,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.270
I mean, he was looking at trial tactics,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.180
he was looking at why they occurred.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.490
He was much more a pragmatic man

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.020
than most law professors were,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.680
and that added a very nice
dimension to my own growth.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.320
- And he really carried the load

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.045
of all of the civil rights cases

00:18:22.045 --> 00:18:25.390
that went through the courts, leading up

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.230
to Brown versus Board of
Education, which he also argued.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.520
- He did indeed, and indeed,
not only carried the load,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.590
as you indicate, carried it

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.170
both intellectually and physically.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.500
The story of his life is a story of riding

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.810
in jalopies all across the
South, without air conditioning,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.920
unable to stay in hotels,
unable to use facilities

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.870
in gas stations, I mean, a
really tough, hard existence.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.380
And more than that, he carried the load

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.140
in the theory of how to go
to Brown against the Board.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.050
Many people in the civil rights movement

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.740
disagreed with him, they
thought he would lose that case.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.870
And if he lost it,
things would be set back

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.440
for another 50 years, that it was wiser

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.050
to go prove that separate
facilities weren't equal,

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.540
one by one, rather than try to get them

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.780
all declared unconstitutional.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.270
- So he, in a way, had what you call,

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.748
quoting Emerson, a heroic mind.

00:19:21.748 --> 00:19:24.848
- He clearly did, I mean, he was a person,

00:19:24.848 --> 00:19:28.380
he had a sense of destiny,
and you could just,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.690
occasionally, you meet
those in your friends.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.360
You occasionally see it in students.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.190
I mean, he knew from some very young age

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.900
that he was destined
to do important things,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.000
I mean, he felt it, he
believed it, he wanted it.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.710
And he did have a heroic mind.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.280
And, I mean, it's interesting to me

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.980
that once Brown against
the Board was decided,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.220
he had really achieved his destiny.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.230
And that's when he began
to think of other things,

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.073
and of course, finally became a judge.

00:19:55.073 --> 00:19:58.130
- In the Brown versus Board of Education,

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.690
we should note he used
Gunnar Myrdal's book

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:07.690
on The American Dilemma,
and that text had,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.100
a key draftsman of that was Ralph Bunche.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.596
- That's right.
- Who was another

00:20:12.596 --> 00:20:17.596
distinguished Black American,
so both in their own ways

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.740
worked to bring down the
barriers of segregation.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.560
- Well, that's right, Ralph Bunche

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.460
had a very difficult career
because he was black.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.840
He was, I believe, the first black person

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.910
appointed a professor at Harvard,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.314
but only served a year
or two and then went back

00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:37.200
to activities outside the academy.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.700
But that's exactly right,
Kenneth Clark was another one.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.660
And of course, Kenneth Clark's experiments

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.920
with asking black children to choose

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.900
between white dolls and black dolls

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.960
was also cited by the court,
along with Gunnar Myrdal,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.300
as support for the decision.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.730
- In talking about, in one of your essays

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.640
comparing Martin Luther King,

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.800
Eudora Welty, Hugo Black, you're trying

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.800
to find the features that
exist in all of their lives,

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.384
and you conclude by saying,
They teach us the importance

00:21:09.384 --> 00:21:13.310
of achieving a grip on our identity

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.930
and a sense of our own calling.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.930
So let's take that as a
platform to move into your focus

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.440
on educating students, giving
them a liberal arts education.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.440
What do you think that these heroes

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.480
and that kind of education can teach us

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.000
about our own lives and
how we should lead them?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.760
- Well, what I think a liberal education,

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.193
at its best can do, is make
us say, You live but once.

00:21:44.193 --> 00:21:48.840
You have, everyone has unusual abilities,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.560
unique abilities, and
part of the satisfactions

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.310
of life come from
deploying those abilities

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.552
in the name of a great cause.

00:21:57.552 --> 00:21:59.870
Martin Luther King is a good example.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.280
I think when he was 26
years old in Montgomery,

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.100
he had no idea that he would find him,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.790
that history would present him

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.470
with the opportunities it did,

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.880
but the point is he
seized the opportunities.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.190
He saw that it was his destiny

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.380
because of his talents,
because he was a stranger

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.620
to the South at that
moment, not to the South,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.300
to Montgomery, that he could do something.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.870
I think the same is
true with Justice Black,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.800
who was a conventional plaintiff's lawyer

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.140
and got into the Senate,
and suddenly became wedded

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.050
to a series of social
ideas about public policy

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.930
and of course on the Supreme Court.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.260
When Justice Black got
to the Supreme Court,

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.047
all of his law clerks
report that the first day,

00:22:40.047 --> 00:22:41.960
when they reported for work,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.657
he handed them a copy of Tacitus and said,

00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:46.617
"Take the first week and read this,

00:22:46.617 --> 00:22:49.407
"because all of the evils
that Tacitus describes

00:22:49.407 --> 00:22:53.297
"in the Roman Empire, of
what power does to corrupt,

00:22:53.297 --> 00:22:56.887
"of how government seeks to
impose improperly on people,

00:22:56.887 --> 00:22:59.027
"those are all in Tacitus and they're all

00:22:59.027 --> 00:23:00.670
"what we're talking about today."

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.150
He informed himself with a larger view

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.899
of human nature and human conduct.

00:23:05.899 --> 00:23:08.690
- And what about Eudora Welty,
who also is in that tract?

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.570
- What I like about Eudora Welty

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.900
is that there's a woman who still lives

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.040
in the house in which she grew up,

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.559
who rarely leaves Jackson, Mississippi.

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:21.060
You may know the essays
that were published

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.740
as One Writer's Beginning
that she delivered at Harvard.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.690
In the last sentence, I
believe, of that volume

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.180
says something on the order,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.410
A sheltered life can also be a daring one.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.630
And she lived a sheltered, quiet life,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.140
never married, but she
made the most of it.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.760
She came to look at people
and to look deeply into people

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.530
and learn how to describe people,

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.552
and of course, became an
exquisite story writer.

00:23:45.552 --> 00:23:50.552
- You, in talking about
a liberal arts education,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.860
say the value of a liberal
education is on how it is made

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.900
to shape, refine and deepen
our sense of self and others.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.470
You also talk about building
our private sense of self,

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.750
but relating that to the
building of a public self.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.840
Talk a little about
that, what is the dynamic

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.740
between those two and
what is the requirement

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.054
in building each of those things?

00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:21.030
- Well, you know, the public self

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.950
that we all show to the
world is obviously important.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.250
An engagement in public life,
engagement in one's profession

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.550
and all those things
are obviously important.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.900
But what I hope a liberal education does

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.556
is to make you ask
questions about yourself.

00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:37.250
What is it that makes me happy?

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.760
What makes me a good person?

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.760
What would make me a better person?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.620
Why is it so difficult to come to grips

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.640
with unhappiness and sadness?

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.531
Why is life so unfair to some people?

00:24:49.531 --> 00:24:52.930
Those are the questions
that a liberal education,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.810
that great literature, great essays,

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:57.731
do help you ask yourself,
and I think they make you

00:24:57.731 --> 00:25:01.169
a wiser person because of that.

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:04.350
- What about the public side,

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.730
I mean, building that commitment?

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.220
Is it through the study of individuals

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.720
like Thurgood Marshall or what?

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.360
- I think that's one way.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.600
I think there are
probably others, as well.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.050
I mean, I've been struck
living in small towns

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.573
for much of my adulthood, Iowa City, Iowa,

00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:26.260
Hanover, New Hampshire, at the extent

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.612
to which communities
depend upon participation.

00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:31.610
If people don't run for the school board

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:35.060
or for selectman, if people
don't participate in PTAs,

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.420
if people don't write letters

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.290
to their legislators, things suffer.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.970
It's important that
people have a public side

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.630
to their life and that
they do try to participate

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.983
in events that shape
us in a communal sense.

00:25:49.983 --> 00:25:53.360
- When you were president
of the University of Iowa,

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.325
you also taught a course, what,

00:25:55.325 --> 00:26:00.325
on conscience and public--
- I did.

00:26:02.985 --> 00:26:03.860
It was a course that a colleague

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.356
and I taught together that was called

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.600
Individuals and Institutions.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.220
We tried to read books and essays

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.050
about what happens when individuals

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.071
come in conflict with institutions.

00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:18.508
We read some of the Greek tragedies.

00:26:18.508 --> 00:26:21.230
We read Burke, we read de Tocqueville.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.970
We read some Erickson, but life is really

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.010
about what happens when one's, often,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.522
when one's conscience
is up against demands

00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:35.618
from the public sector that
you behave differently.

00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:40.618
- So what, in the end, will
enable, empower students

00:26:42.352 --> 00:26:47.352
to develop these virtues in the four years

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.720
that they're an undergraduate?

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.620
Is it the kind of courses that they have?

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.258
The way that they're taught?

00:26:58.258 --> 00:27:01.860
Or is it also the people they meet

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.320
in their own community of students?

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.168
- I think all of the above.

00:27:06.168 --> 00:27:08.600
Certainly, who your fellow students are

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.350
is as important as anything,

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.110
and who your teachers are is important,

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.051
but I think reading is too.

00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:18.113
My wife and I, a few weeks
ago, saw Hedda Gabler.

00:27:18.113 --> 00:27:21.110
We've seen about half a dozen Ibsen plays

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.770
in the last five years, you know,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.020
those are all kind of simplistic fights,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.020
or The Enemy of the
People, between a doctor

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.231
who knows the water is unsafe

00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:32.770
and a community that doesn't
want to have, announce it.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.937
You have to decide, what do you do

00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:35.770
as a person of conscience?

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.760
And it's not easy, and
if you become too rigid,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.824
you just become kind of
uselessly moralistic,

00:27:40.824 --> 00:27:44.030
but if you become too
lax, you may lose a sense

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:46.200
of who you are as a person.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.270
I think literature helps students

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.270
think about those questions,
doesn't give them the answer,

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.930
but it helps them think.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.890
- And partly what you're
trying to accomplish

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.420
in this laboratory of the
undergraduate education

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.210
is making students understand

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.942
that knowing that you
don't know is important.

00:28:06.942 --> 00:28:09.590
- Oh boy, absolutely, yes.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.650
I think any of us who have taught

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.930
certainly know that there comes a moment

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.610
when a student asks
something and you don't know,

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.250
and I was told by a senior colleague

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.697
my first year of teaching,
"You had better say

00:28:23.697 --> 00:28:25.887
"I don't know, but I'll find out,

00:28:25.887 --> 00:28:30.089
"because if you try to fake it,
they're going to catch you."

00:28:30.089 --> 00:28:30.922
They're going to see that you're trying

00:28:30.922 --> 00:28:32.330
to do it, but that's right.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.063
We know so little, we know so little.

00:28:37.653 --> 00:28:42.653
- Now this focus on the
liberal arts, as a leader,

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.470
you actually say somewhere
that you were mentored

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.710
by Martin Meyerson, Eliot
Stellar, and Vartan Gregorian,

00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:57.140
who were all at Penn with you.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.867
And you go on to say, "I came to realize

00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:02.167
"that the true importance of holding

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:04.367
"a senior administrative position

00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:08.877
"was the power to enunciate
the academy's central values

00:29:08.877 --> 00:29:11.997
"and the responsibility to set forth

00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:13.960
"the university's agenda."

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.300
And that is really what you've tried to do

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.167
in these various--
- That's what I've tried

00:29:18.167 --> 00:29:21.041
to do, because my own
sense is that a president

00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:24.250
is really the only
person in the institution

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.630
who has an opportunity to set the agenda

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.050
for debate within the
faculty and the student body.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.420
He may not always prevail,
but he has the opportunity,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.690
or she, to put items on the agenda

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.330
and ask that they be debated.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.050
And, of course, being a president

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.570
is a rare privilege in terms
of access to the op-ed pages,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.470
and to television shows,
and to things of that sort.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.210
So that I've thought it
was always very important

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.607
for presidents to use that opportunity

00:29:50.607 --> 00:29:54.260
to state those views that
they think are important.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.570
- Now, in doing that,
there are two issues.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.440
One is communication, which
you actually talk about

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.130
in one of your essays, and
I'm curious about that.

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:10.130
That is, the frustration
of having a vision,

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.560
being a craftsman enough to articulate

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.940
with your own words what that vision is,

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.630
but, on the one hand,
but on the other hand,

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.180
being a leader of a bureaucracy,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.730
where an official statement
has to be filtered

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.310
through that bureaucracy.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.840
Tell us about those, that tension

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.707
and how you reconcile that.

00:30:33.707 --> 00:30:35.210
- Well, you know, every
president understands

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.870
that when he speaks publicly,
his words are circulated

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.740
to alumni, faculty, students,
the local community,

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.180
and that some of those
words are going to alienate.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.060
And a president has a
responsibility to be cautious,

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.910
because you don't want to alienate people

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.410
on whom your institution greatly depends.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.220
And so I think all of us feel frustrated

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.433
on some issues because of imbalance.

00:30:59.907 --> 00:31:01.230
We conclude that it will
alienate more people

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.050
than you would like to alienate.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.800
I think they will accept
you when you speak

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.630
on educational issues, although
I think affirmative action

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.229
is an example, that when
presidents do speak on that,

00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:16.646
they sometimes do alienate
large sections of their alumni.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:18.490
But I think one has to use the privilege

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.973
of that pulpit carefully, prudently,

00:31:21.973 --> 00:31:25.960
because I think you do run
the risk of alienating people.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.243
And I think all of us have had experience

00:31:28.243 --> 00:31:30.107
with donors who call up and say,

00:31:30.107 --> 00:31:33.230
"You know, that speech
did it for me, goodbye."

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.169
That happens.
- So in a way,

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:41.169
as a president, there
is an interesting play

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:46.650
between the sense from
your own personal life

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.600
of the vision that you
would like to realize

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.450
but then the political
realities of a university.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.450
- That's right, there is indeed.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:57.760
You mentioned Martin Meyerson,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.596
who was president of the
University of Pennsylvania

00:32:00.596 --> 00:32:03.170
as I was a young man moving
up the academic ladder.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.320
One of the things that I
admired about President Meyerson

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.980
is that in his early years
as president of Penn,

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.880
he essentially said, You
here glow in the fact

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.200
that you're the best
university in Philadelphia,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.160
and you glow in the fact
that you're a member

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.960
of the Ivy League, but until the day comes

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.700
when your PhDs are as
valued and sought after

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.870
by the Harvard and Yale faculties
as their PhDs are by ours,

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.400
we've got ground to cover.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.320
I mean, he essentially came and said,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.500
This place is a little too self-satisfied,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.170
a little too smug, we need to be better.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.730
And that had an electric effect.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.040
People were a little upset,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.210
but it had the proper
impact, the intended impact.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:48.613
- When you came to Dartmouth, one of the,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.810
part of the challenge for you, I think,

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.070
because Dartmouth, I believe,
had some difficulties before,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:59.330
was to realize this liberal vision.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.927
And you actually said in
your inaugural address,

00:33:01.927 --> 00:33:05.287
"We must strengthen our attraction

00:33:05.287 --> 00:33:08.727
"for those singular students
whose greatest pleasure

00:33:08.727 --> 00:33:12.227
"may come not from the
camaraderie of classmates,

00:33:12.227 --> 00:33:15.207
"but from the lonely
acts of writing poetry

00:33:15.207 --> 00:33:19.537
"or mastering the cello or
solving mathematical riddles

00:33:19.537 --> 00:33:21.970
"or translating Catullus."

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.113
That was a heroic statement
at that time, wasn't that?

00:33:25.113 --> 00:33:28.310
- Well, I'll tell you, it,
the cello became my symbol

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.730
among the students, and
Catullus became an author

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.394
whose name they knew.
- I see.

00:33:33.394 --> 00:33:37.210
- But I was concerned when
I looked at Dartmouth,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.023
of course, seriously
before I accepted the job.

00:33:41.023 --> 00:33:43.020
And what I was concerned
with was, I thought, a sense,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.310
that there was too much emphasis
on well-rounded students.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.460
The whole place had to be well-rounded.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.280
And I wanted us to have some students

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.157
who were more, as I said,
"You can be so well rounded

00:33:55.157 --> 00:33:57.612
"that you have no point at all."

00:33:57.612 --> 00:33:59.340
Some students who had a
point, who had a focus,

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.730
who had achieved a lot and
meant to achieve a lot.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.970
And so a part of my
mission there was to see

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.760
if we couldn't strengthen the student body

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.020
in those ways, and I hope we did.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.550
- Give me a specific example of a program,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.050
either at Iowa or at Dartmouth,

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.497
where you think this liberal arts vision

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.640
that you brought to the table mattered

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.530
in actually implementing a program.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.600
- Well, for example,
we started at Dartmouth

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.500
a Presidential Scholars program,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.800
where a student who had a
certain grade point average

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.420
could work 10 hours a week

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.600
for a faculty member as a colleague.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.500
You could help do research,
you could edit manuscripts,

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.060
you could work in the laboratory.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.780
You couldn't do gopher work.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.770
You were not, you couldn't do xeroxing

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.090
that wasn't fair to the
students, or getting coffee,

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.320
but we tried to set up collaboration,

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.920
and the consequence of
that was that every year,

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.780
two or three papers would be published

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.590
with a faculty member's name,
maybe some graduate students,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.600
and finally the undergraduate student.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.020
But we very much wanted undergraduates

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.652
to be able to get a feel for what it was

00:35:10.652 --> 00:35:13.580
to work with a faculty
member and to kinda be

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.440
at the frontiers of research,

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.100
and I think that mattered.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.400
There was a lot of student
criticism at the first,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.490
it was elitist and it was
special opportunities.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.610
We've now reached the
point where it's now listed

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.120
along with the academic honors
in the commencement program,

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.770
and Presidential Scholars are listed

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.510
as a category of achievers.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.950
So I've been very pleased at that.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.830
- Now, you were at both Iowa,
a great public university,

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.010
and you were at Dartmouth,
a great private.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.541
What is the difference?

00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:48.510
Are there differences in the challenges

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.282
that you faced leading?

00:35:50.282 --> 00:35:51.120
- Well, there are superficial differences,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.440
which I think are not at the center

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.090
of what are the differences.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.120
The superficial ones is that
Iowa was 30,000 students,

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.620
Dartmouth's a little better than 5,000.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.984
Iowa was a public and one
dealt with a legislature,

00:36:03.984 --> 00:36:06.330
Dartmouth is private, governed
by a Board of Trustees.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.460
For me, the biggest difference

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.560
was that the value added
to a student's life

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.780
at Iowa was greater than at Dartmouth,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.640
because the distance was greater.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.140
Students came to that university
from small towns in Iowa,

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.760
never had left the state,
never been to Chicago,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.180
never seen a play, never
been to a symphony,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.950
maybe never seen a bookstore
in their hometowns.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.600
And they came and they started

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.530
to read Plato and Aristotle,
and all of those things.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.100
And they were set afire.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.900
And they grew and grew and grew.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.630
Dartmouth students were
from more affluent homes.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.660
They'd had more higher quality
educational opportunities.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.640
They came in at a much higher
point of sophistication.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.640
And, of course, they grew too.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.630
But I was really struck by the role

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.730
of the University of Iowa,
just opening up the lives

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.300
of kids who'd not had
that experience before.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.864
- Was it, in this
public-private distinction,

00:37:02.864 --> 00:37:06.730
compare dealing with
legislators for state budgets

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.730
with dealing with trustees and donors.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:16.950
Is there a difference in
those two sets of tasks?

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.780
- There surely was not a
difference in dealing with donors.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.350
There are people who
love their universities

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.330
and are philanthropic and want to give

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.260
and want to be helpful.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.170
Dealing with legislators is different

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.770
because I just sensed the distance

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.812
between me and them was very great.

00:37:35.812 --> 00:37:37.200
I was not of their type.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.500
You know, these are legislators

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.812
who are elected by the people of Iowa,

00:37:40.812 --> 00:37:44.330
and I was a very different
Eastern bred type of person.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:48.300
It was quite different
with the Board of Trustees

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.550
at Dartmouth, who share
similar backgrounds

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.800
and you much more readily
belonged to that kind of group.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.330
So it was a different experience at Iowa.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:02.224
- So what then, what, if you
were writing a job description

00:38:02.224 --> 00:38:06.365
for the title University President's,

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:10.440
what are the, educational
requirements aside,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.213
what does it take to undertake the task

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.838
of leading great, either public or private

00:38:20.838 --> 00:38:23.411
institutions of higher education?

00:38:23.411 --> 00:38:25.300
- Well, I think it takes an appetite

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.210
to want to govern the institution.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.270
And by that I mean, to
channel your own energies

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.770
and ultimately, professional fulfillment

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.430
through the institution.

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.690
You no longer channel your energies

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.900
through becoming a fixture
on the lecture circuit

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.662
or a writer of lots of books
or an attender of conferences.

00:38:44.662 --> 00:38:48.280
You ought to be a person
who wants your glory

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.690
to come through the
strengthening of the institution,

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.680
so at the end of a period
of five or 10 or 15 years,

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.518
people will say, This is a better place

00:38:56.518 --> 00:38:58.020
because he or she was president.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.710
I do think you have to be a
person interested in ideas.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.150
For myself, I think that by and large,

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.070
you need to be a person who's a scholar.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.950
I don't think you can lead the faculty

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.520
if you haven't yourself been a scholar

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:14.900
and had the experience of
teaching and creating knowledge.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.160
There are notable exceptions to that.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.833
But I think as a general
rule, that's very important.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:24.900
I think, too, you
somehow have to exemplify

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.920
something of a selflessness,
of a devotion to the place,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.410
'cause you're asking other people,

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.870
all those people you work with,

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.324
all the vice presidents and deans,

00:39:33.324 --> 00:39:34.942
to be devoted to the place.

00:39:34.942 --> 00:39:37.330
And if you show less than full devotion,

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.540
or if you show cynicism in that,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.920
it's much harder to motivate those people

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.528
to share your commitment to
making this a stronger place.

00:39:46.528 --> 00:39:49.440
- One of the problems
that all universities

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.930
confronted during these periods

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.793
were the question of
excellence and equality.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.610
Not necessarily saying
they're in conflict, but,

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.800
in other words to
ensuring greater equality,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.000
ensuring greater diversity,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.370
raised questions about the procedures

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.870
by which people would be admitted.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.570
Tell us a little about your thoughts

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:24.570
on that set of problems
and how well universities

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:29.370
in general have weathered that process.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.770
- Well, I think the process
of opening up universities

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:38.090
so there is greater access
and for a greater range

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.140
of students has been
a very successful one.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.510
You look at most universities and I think

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:45.860
that affirmative action
has clearly worked.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.838
It has given us more
interesting student bodies.

00:40:48.838 --> 00:40:53.530
It's given us minority
graduates who will now take

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.120
a place in the professions.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.330
I mean, when I look at what this country

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.960
is becoming and think of the possibility

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.830
that without affirmative action,

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.940
we would not be graduating people

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.010
of minority background who
would become the leaders

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.480
of this new country, in the professions,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.370
and in education, and in
medicine, and in business.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.430
I fear to think what the country

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:15.970
would have been like otherwise.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:19.470
I mean, I think affirmative
action has been indispensable.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.540
And I think all of us
find that one of the ways

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.140
that incoming students,
high school seniors,

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.120
judge the places they're looking at

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.530
is the degree of diversity that it has.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.410
Students don't want to go to schools

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.240
that don't have sufficient diversity.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.510
They recognize that they're inherently

00:41:36.468 --> 00:41:38.178
more interesting places.

00:41:38.178 --> 00:41:39.920
- And you actually say in your discussion

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.230
of what a liberal arts education should be

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:47.230
that the contribution that
is actually being made

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.240
by being exposed to different communities,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.700
being exposed to different people

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.750
from different ethnic
and cultural backgrounds.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.183
- Yes, indeed, I mean, it's interesting

00:42:00.183 --> 00:42:01.800
that for, certainly, a generation

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.070
from World War Two onward,
universities understood

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.440
that geographic diversity was important,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.190
and they went out of their
way to try to enroll students

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:14.433
from wider and wider sections
of the United States,

00:42:14.433 --> 00:42:16.490
so that the notion that you learned

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:19.720
in better circumstances with students

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.017
who've had diverse upbringings

00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:24.390
is not one that started with
the civil rights movement.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.597
It's one that goes back
much earlier than that.

00:42:26.597 --> 00:42:31.597
- Let's talk a little about
where universities are going,

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.477
in general, and one thing that strikes me,

00:42:36.477 --> 00:42:39.320
I think it's fair to ask you,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.320
is your commitment and
your powerful statement

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:48.430
of the importance of a
liberal arts education

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:53.430
a losing battle in the
face of the specialization

00:42:54.385 --> 00:42:59.385
of the academic disciplines,
the emphasis in our society,

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.550
generally, about the importance

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.230
and priority that should be given

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.903
to the market and other factors?

00:43:06.903 --> 00:43:09.130
- I don't know whether
it's a losing battle.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:12.990
It's easy to look around
and conclude that it may be,

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.680
that pre-vocational education and college,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.740
and professional education
at the college level,

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.770
is growing and growing, and
many, many parents want that.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.260
But if people don't speak
up for the importance

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.320
of liberal education, we'll never know

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.817
if it might not be a losing battle.

00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:34.380
We've certainly seen in the
national political scene

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.840
that ideas that seemed
like a losing battle

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.890
during the New Deal or the Great Society,

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.310
whatever, suddenly their
time seems to come,

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.880
and so my great hope is that enough of us

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.010
will keep alive the focus
on liberal education,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.200
that the day may well come

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.410
when it's much more widely accepted.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.440
- And what would a successful result be,

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.440
a kind of core curriculum
that exposed students

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:06.270
to more than what we
used to call Western Civ,

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:11.270
but rather the multiple
civilizations that, you know,

00:44:12.031 --> 00:44:14.334
important to our understanding
of world cultures?

00:44:14.334 --> 00:44:16.900
- I think, ultimately, a successful result

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.130
would be one that moved
professional education

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.930
to the graduate level, so
that undergraduate education

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.360
could be a liberal education,
and one could then take

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.310
a business, you know, one would then go

00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:30.877
to a graduate school of business

00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:31.874
or a graduate school of nursing,

00:44:31.874 --> 00:44:34.470
or a graduate school of
accounting or journalism.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.840
But that the undergraduate
years would be given over

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.780
to a liberal education.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.750
- Is there a way that parents and students

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:44.760
who agree with what you're saying,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.760
is there a report card
that they should give

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.945
to the university that they're looking at?

00:44:53.945 --> 00:44:57.120
Is there a check-off list?

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.660
Is there a way of getting a handle

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.580
on what a school would look like

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.403
that embodies the vision
that you're talking about?

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:09.830
- I think it would look
like many, many universities

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.970
and colleges that exist today,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:13.830
who would provide full opportunities

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.670
to major in English or
chemistry or psychology

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.750
or biology or Portuguese
literature, or whatever.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:24.430
But I think parents are so concerned

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.340
that their children have the tools

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.510
for success in this
society that in a sense,

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.300
they constrict the kinds of things

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.020
students are willing to look at.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.910
I had a young woman in
my office at Dartmouth

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:39.110
one year whose parents wanted
her to major in economics,

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.480
because they thought that had
great professional utility.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.510
And she had, indeed, fallen in love

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.520
with Portuguese literature,
she just loved it.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.720
And they could not understand why,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.986
what was the attraction of
that and why you would ever

00:45:53.986 --> 00:45:55.954
want to do that instead of economics.

00:45:55.954 --> 00:46:00.297
It's in many ways the parents
that we have to talk to.

00:46:00.297 --> 00:46:01.940
- And this, by the way, hearkens back

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.740
to these themes in your background,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.880
that is, the themes of ambition

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.880
and a kind of a well developed
liberal vision of the world.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:18.329
So in a way, I guess,
one lesson I'm drawing

00:46:18.329 --> 00:46:19.970
from this conversation
is that part of the goal

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.750
of education is to empower students

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.090
to carefully and thoughtfully make those

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.620
kind of choices for themselves.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.860
- Well, I think that's right.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.040
I mean, people really
sometimes don't remember

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.410
that the college years,
you are still very young.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.760
You are still, in a
sense, a post-adolescent.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.914
You're trying to figure out who you are.

00:46:38.914 --> 00:46:42.770
You are confused about
what career path to take.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.100
You don't really fully know how

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.160
to estimate your own abilities.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.064
You're influenced by peers.

00:46:48.064 --> 00:46:52.320
It's a very confusing
time of life for students.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.380
And I think it's important to expose them

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.180
to all these kinds of opportunities

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.320
that a liberal education does,

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.800
as they form more fully
and more conclusively

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.460
who it is they want to be.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.963
- Now, in our environment today,

00:47:05.963 --> 00:47:10.963
the implications of the technology that,

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.320
it's available, and you
actually beautifully stated

00:47:15.154 --> 00:47:17.750
the problem yesterday in
your lecture, that is,

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:22.750
the capacity of technology
not to leave us alone.

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:28.030
The way that we can be
interrupted in those moments

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.350
of silence, reflection,
reading, and so on.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:37.250
So this leads me to ask for your comments

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.250
on how we will navigate the future,

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.380
carrying in ourselves this vision,

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:52.840
which is both powerful
and beautifully stated,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:57.840
about a liberal arts
way of dealing with life

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:05.877
and the world versus the
power, the attraction,

00:48:06.752 --> 00:48:10.160
the seduction of all of
these new technologies.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.210
- Well, the new technologies are,

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.260
of course, incredibly seductive
and attractive, as you say.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.350
And I think right now we're obviously

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:20.467
in the first generation of
living with these technologies.

00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:23.210
That means that people are just forever

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.270
made frantic by them.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.210
People carry beepers and cell phones.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:30.001
The minute they get home or to the office,

00:48:30.001 --> 00:48:32.010
they get on the email to
see what's listed there.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:33.700
Then they get on the answering machine

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.486
to see what's listed there.

00:48:35.486 --> 00:48:38.698
On the other hand, they
bring you CDs and DVDs

00:48:38.698 --> 00:48:41.110
and all kinds of wonderful things.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.750
I hope we're gonna figure out,

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.230
finally, that we don't want a lifestyle

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.220
driven by these things.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.210
I think, for example, with television,

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:53.070
adolescents aside, that
more and more adults

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.520
have figured out over two generations

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.220
that you watch television selectively.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.050
You watch it for the
things that you truly want,

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.630
but it's not a narcotic for you,

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.510
and I hope we're gonna reach that age

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.580
with a lot of this new technology,

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.880
that we don't allow it to follow us

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.500
on vacation and follow us
into our home at night,

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.833
and forever pursue us, but
give us some time to ourselves.

00:49:17.731 --> 00:49:20.857
- You speak of liberal arts
and a liberal arts education

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:25.857
as, really, a tool for life, in a way.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.250
That might not be the best metaphor,

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:32.060
but a way to prepare yourself,
all through your life,

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.580
to deal with the ups and downs of life.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:39.160
Now, I know that when you
were president of Dartmouth

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.850
you were stricken with cancer,

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.830
and you were public about that.

00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.470
And you've written and said often

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:48.510
that your liberal arts training

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.738
helped you deal with the difficulties

00:49:52.738 --> 00:49:56.710
of confronting that situation.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.030
Tell us a little about that, how,

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:00.920
in this particular instance,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.290
it really mattered what
you preached, so to speak.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:07.890
- Well, in 1994 I was
stricken with cancer,

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:09.520
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.130
It of course, I was told
there was a good chance

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:18.650
of dealing with it
successfully with chemotherapy,

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.350
but it was probably a 50-50 chance.

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.740
Fortunately, it worked.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.810
But that begins to make you think

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.104
that life is short, that
you're not invincible.

00:50:27.104 --> 00:50:29.357
And then you begin to
ask, What matters to me?

00:50:29.357 --> 00:50:32.090
Am I using my time properly?

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.000
Why am I letting other people
control so much of my time?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.980
It makes you think
about your children who,

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.170
after all, are your most
important legacy on earth,

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.548
and it kind of makes you ask,

00:50:43.548 --> 00:50:45.430
Have I completed my task
with them of passing on

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:48.120
the values I want them to hope and have

00:50:49.074 --> 00:50:51.010
and to being an example and for them?

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:54.180
Have I become the kind
of father I wanna be?

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.130
Those things really make you
ask questions of that kind.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.040
And I think the asking of the questions

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.460
begins to help you to try to answer them.

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.850
I, like everyone who is
stricken with cancer,

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:07.650
began by saying, Why me?

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:09.827
I mean, I'm a perfectly
nice person, why me?

00:51:09.827 --> 00:51:12.010
And of course, you begin to realize

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.950
everybody says that, and a friend of mine

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:17.240
who happens to be a minister,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.157
a Congregational minister,
said to me, "Why not you?

00:51:21.157 --> 00:51:24.190
"Somebody has to be stricken
with this, so why not you?"

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:26.290
And I began to think about that.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.670
But that's the whole
question of the arbitrariness

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.220
of the universe, it's the question of Job.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.440
Why does God treat people,
some people in certain ways?

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.560
And I've had cancer twice since then

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.811
and I'm dealing with it still, now.

00:51:39.811 --> 00:51:43.080
It makes me think about
it very, very seriously,

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:48.080
of particularly, how best to
be myself, if time is limited.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.500
Whether it is, I don't know.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.233
But, you know, a third
time makes you think

00:51:52.233 --> 00:51:54.098
that it may, could be.

00:51:54.098 --> 00:51:57.620
And it makes you see you don't want

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.660
to spend your time on trivial things.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.890
You don't want to spend your time

00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.768
on things that are mere duty,

00:52:02.768 --> 00:52:06.158
if you've chosen them and
you can retreat from them.

00:52:06.158 --> 00:52:07.960
You want to spend it on those things

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.595
that really matter to you.

00:52:09.595 --> 00:52:13.162
- And did you turn to your books a lot?

00:52:13.162 --> 00:52:18.162
That is, reading, was reading you found,

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:21.810
something even more useful?

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:24.045
- I found help, for one of the first books

00:52:24.045 --> 00:52:25.480
I read is one of these books
that I mentioned earlier

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.980
that I read every two or three years,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.970
'cause you can read it
in a long, long day.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.270
And that's The Plague by
Camus, which, of course,

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:35.276
is about why does this
plague, this pestilence,

00:52:35.276 --> 00:52:38.760
strike this city of Oran in Algeria?

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.030
And of course, nobody
can answer that question,

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:43.500
but they puzzle with it.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.781
And that's, of course, what
you puzzle with, with cancer.

00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:49.082
And you really ask yourself,

00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:52.500
during that, I may have six months left.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.068
I may have a year left.

00:52:54.068 --> 00:52:56.660
What should I do with that time?

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.330
Why has this happened to me?

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:03.330
And people say to you glib things

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.037
that are well-meaning, like,

00:53:06.037 --> 00:53:08.442
"You've really had rich life.

00:53:08.442 --> 00:53:09.577
"You know, your work is done, in a way.

00:53:09.577 --> 00:53:11.670
"I mean, you're so
fortunate, you didn't have,"

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.437
they say, "you didn't have a life

00:53:13.437 --> 00:53:16.207
"where you failed at your career,

00:53:16.207 --> 00:53:19.207
"or raised terrible kids,
or had a bad marriage.

00:53:19.207 --> 00:53:20.954
"You know, your life in some sense,

00:53:20.954 --> 00:53:22.140
"is a nice, complete package."

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:26.034
But nobody sees it about
themselves that way.

00:53:26.034 --> 00:53:28.470
- One final question, sort of looking back

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:32.260
at this journey that you've been on,

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:36.983
students watching it, is
there one particular lesson

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.870
that you think that they might draw

00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:45.290
from this intellectual
journey that you've taken?

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.120
- Well, you know, the lesson I really,

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.150
a lesson I really draw
is one that my father

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:52.270
always taught me, which is about

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:54.300
the importance of late bloomers.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.110
My father had students in junior year

00:53:56.110 --> 00:53:58.710
in high school who were C students,

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:01.180
and 30 years later they were the mayor

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.770
of Manchester, New Hampshire,

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.270
and they were college professors,

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.280
and they were physicians and lawyers.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.390
We all mature at different rates.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.960
And I think one of the things
a liberal education does

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.640
is to make you ready for the moment.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.440
Make the ground ready for the moment

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.955
when the seed is prepared to drop.

00:54:17.955 --> 00:54:22.510
I think students too often think,

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.120
if they're not a success in college,

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.640
they're a failure forever,
or if they're not a success

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.500
in a professional school, and I think

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.310
we all grow at different rates.

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:33.760
And there, the late bloomers are legion,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.180
starting with Winston Churchill

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.690
and you can go through lists and lists

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:41.690
and lists, Harry Truman, one grows.

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.260
I hope students kind of understand

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.810
they're preparing themselves,

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:48.500
even if they're not quite
sure now where they're going.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.971
- President Freedman, on
that very positive note,

00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:52.720
thank you very much--
- A pleasure.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.140
For being with us today, and telling us

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.710
this extraordinary journey
that you've been on,

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:01.930
both intellectually and as a leader

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:03.850
of great public institutions.

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:04.867
- Thank you very much.

00:55:04.867 --> 00:55:06.580
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:09.201
for this Conversation with History.

00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:12.201
