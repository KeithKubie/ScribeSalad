Narrator: JESSI, GRANT, AND TORY
HAVE ALL BUT BUSTED THE MYTH

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:10.100
THAT SMUGGLERS COULD DRIVE
ON A MOONLESS NIGHT

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.400
WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.601
ALL RIGHT,
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE NAKED EYE

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.434
JUST ISN'T UP TO THE DEMANDS
OF THIS SMUGGLING MISSION,

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:19.167
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME
TO DEPLOY SOME TECHNOLOGY.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:24.234
CHECK THIS OUT --
NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES.

00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.367
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.100
THESE BABIES ARE
STATE-OF-THE-ART,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
THIRD GENERATION
FROM B.E. MEYERS.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.834
THEY TAKE AVAILABLE LIGHT
AND AMPLIFY IT

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:32.734
INTO AN IMAGE WE CAN SEE.

00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:35.501
THIS IS THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.000
YEAH, SO I'M GONNA DO A RUN IN
THE DARK USING NOTHING BUT THESE

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.434
AND SEE HOW I DO.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.501
OKAY, BUT THIS TIME, NO
LOLLYGAGGING AROUND THE TRACK

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.634
AT A SNAIL'S PACE.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:45.067
LET'S MAKE IT REALISTIC.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:47.634
I'LL BE CHASING AFTER YOU
LIKE I'M THE COP.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.901
Narrator:
THESE NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.367
ARE LEGAL IN THE U.S.
BUT NOT IN CANADA.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.033
STILL, I DON'T SUPPOSE

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:57.267
THAT WOULD DETER
A DEPRAVED SYRUP SMUGGLER.

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:58.400
YOU READY?
I'M READY.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.567
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.000
OKAY, LIGHTS OUT!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.467
Narrator: SO, CAN TECHNOLOGY
WORK WHERE THE HUMAN EYE FAILED?

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:14.434
TORY'S FIRST FEW LAPS
ARE FAST AND BOUNCY.

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:15.701
[ TIRES SCREECH ]

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:19.067
Tory:
SEEING IS NOT A PROBLEM.

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.667
BEING ABLE TO JUDGE
HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM OBJECTS

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.133
OR SEEING AROUND YOU --
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.167
I MEAN,
IT IS TRULY TUNNEL VISION.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.267
YOU HAVE NO DEPTH OF FIELD.
YOU HAVE NO PERIPHERAL VISION.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:33.400
I MEAN, I MUST HAVE BANGED INTO
THE WALLS HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.367
Narrator: NOW OFFICER JESSI
GIVES CHASE.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.334
AND YOU GET THE FEELING
IT WON'T BE LONG

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.567
BEFORE JUSTICE CATCHES UP
WITH OUR SCOUNDREL.

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.133
Tory: AND THEN YOU HAVE THE COP
CHASING YOU,

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.400
AND, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A WHOLE NEW GAME

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.234
WHERE IT'S LIKE NOW YOU HAVE THE
STRESS OF SOMEBODY CATCHING YOU,

00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:53.501
AND YOU'RE HAVING
TO REACT QUICKLY.

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:55.834
[ JESSI LAUGHS ]

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:59.968
Narrator: BUT WHAT'S
THE ULTIMATE VERDICT?

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.634
I MEAN, YOU CAN DRIVE
WITH THE NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES,

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.634
BUT AS SOON
AS YOU STARTED CHASING ME,

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:07.400
I HAD TO SPEED UP, AND MY
REACTION TIME HAD TO SPEED UP.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.167
AND HAVING TUNNEL VISION,
BASICALLY,

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.868
I TOTALLY MISJUDGED
THAT LAST TURN

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:12.200
AND CRASHED INTO THE WALL,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.467
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SMACKED
INTO ME AND STOPPED ME.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.868
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:18.267
Narrator: SO, DRIVING
WITH NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:20.634
MIGHT HELP A LITTLE,
BUT LESS THAN WE'D HOPED.

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:25.100
THE MYTH IS FIRST TESTED,
TOTALLY BUSTED.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.100
AND IS IT DANGEROUS?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.601
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
