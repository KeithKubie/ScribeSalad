00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.480
Sex is a big gamble.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.410
I mean, the mental risks alone that we take
with our relationships are taxing enough:

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.420
When is he going to text me back? Am I good
enough? What if she doesn’t like the real me?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.550
But the emotional price we pay for intimacy
can almost seem paltry compared to the physical

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.590
investments that our bodies make in order
to reproduce.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.170
And the sexes each make this wager differently.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.070
The female gamete is, biologically speaking,
a big bet.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.070
It’s like putting all your chips on black.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.039
An ovum and follicle take over a year to develop,
and, as human cells go, it’s huge -- about

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.129
a tenth of a millimeter, just large enough
to be seen with the naked eye.

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.760
Plus, it requires a whole network of supporting
tissues in the uterus while it waits for fertilization,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.159
which -- if that doesn’t happen -- then
have to be shed and re-built a month later.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.059
And then there's the commitment. Once an egg
has been ovulated, everything in the female

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.499
reproductive system is dedicated to dealing
with that one cell for almost a month.

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.780
And if it gets fertilized, you’re looking
at 10 months.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.649
But when it comes to playing the reproductive
roulette wheel, the male reproductive system

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.299
takes the opposite strategy.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.100
If female gametes amount to a high-stakes
bet, the males’ are basically the penny slots.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.040
Human sperm are only about one-hundred-thousandth
the mass of an egg. And they’re almost as

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.849
easy to produce as skin cells -- actually, the
process by which they mature is pretty similar.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.579
That’s because sperm are small and stripped
down -- not invested in much beyond a nucleus,

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.750
and a tail, and some extra mitochondria to
fuel their journey.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.979
All they have to do is drop off their DNA,
and fall apart.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.070
The risk of failure is still there. In fact,
with male gametes, the odds are overwhelmingly

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149
against any single sperm actually accomplishing
its mission.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.030
But while the female reproductive system meets
this risk head-on, with a single, big play,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.890
the male’s tries to beat the odds with the
sheer force of numbers.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.720
Here’s a question for you: why are the most
important parts of the male’s reproductive

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080
system literally left hanging?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.450
The testes -- the gonads of the anatomical
male -- are tasked with making male gametes,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.249
sperm, and the androgen hormone testosterone.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.560
But unlike the ovaries, which are protected
inside the body, testicles dangle outside

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.929
the abdominal cavity, in the scrotum.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.380
Because -- even though sperm may not be terribly big or
complex -- they’re touchy when it comes to temperature.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.740
The rate at which they divide, copy DNA, and
even feel the effects of some hormones, are

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.550
all diminished at the core body temperature
of 37 degrees.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.680
So the testes have to be outside the body
cavity to reach the lower temperature necessary

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.420
for proper spermatogenesis, or sperm production.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.600
It’s a rare instance of sensitivity among what
are otherwise pretty hardy and expendable cells.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.200
But that’s not to say that the testes aren’t
complex.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.490
Each one is divided into about 250 sections,
called lobules, which are loaded with tightly-coiled

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.950
seminiferous tubules.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.600
These tubules are the sperm factories, made
of a stratified epithelium surrounding a central

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.130
fluid-filled lumen.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.320
And this sperm-making work is supported by
cells throughout and around the tubules.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.650
Among the most important are the sertoli cells
inside the tubes, which nourish developing

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.030
sperm cells, sort of like how female follicle
cells help oocytes.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.750
There are also Leydig cells that secrete testosterone,
much like the corpus luteum that secretes estrogen.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.830
But compared to egg-making, spermatogenesis is
-- as I mentioned --

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.960
a pretty cheap and easy process, biologically.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.220
It’s actually kind of like how your skin
cells are produced -- with stem cells at the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.160
basal layer that produce immature cells, which in
turn get forced toward the surface as they mature.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
But in this case, the sperm develop on the outer edge
of the tubule, and progress inward toward the lumen.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.370
And it all begins with a trigger that -- if
you’ve seen our lesson on female reproduction

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.350
-- should look pretty familiar: a hormonal
cascade.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.010
When puberty comes a-knocking,
the hypothalamus starts releasing

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.000
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.870
And this tells the anterior pituitary to secrete
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.040
hormone into the blood, just like in females.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.950
But in females, LH leads to the release of
estrogen in the follicles, whereas in males,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.390
it spurs the Leydig cells to release testosterone.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.780
Meanwhile, the FSH triggers the sertoli cells
to release androgen-binding protein, or ABP.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.280
This binds to the testosterone, creating large,
local concentrations of the stuff, which is

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.780
ultimately what triggers the production of
sperm.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.780
The targets of the testosterone are the outermost
cells in the tubules, called spermatogonia.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.250
They’re the stem cells that set the sperm-making
process in motion, by dividing.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.750
And actually, they’ve been doing that all
along -- even before puberty. Throughout childhood,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.959
a spermatogonia cell uses mitosis to continuously
divide into two identical daughter cells.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.890
But when puberty starts, the testosterone
causes them to divide differently -- instead

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:31.540
of splitting into two identical spermatagonia
cells, they begin producing two distinct spermatogonia.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.410
One type of daughter cell -- known as a type
A cell -- stays up near the basal lamina and

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.930
just keeps dividing, so you never run out
of spermatogonia.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.850
But the other kind -- the type B’s -- get
pushed down the tubule toward the lumen, and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.390
turn into primary spermatocytes.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.710
These primary spermatocytes then go into meiosis
I, and form two smaller haploid cells called

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.960
secondary spermatocytes.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.020
They then rush through meiosis II, and their
resulting daughter cells total four round spermatids.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.300
These spermatids now have all of the 23 chromosomes
they need for fertilization. But they aren’t exactly mobile.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.340
If they’re ever gonna find themselves an egg,
they’ll need a way to get around -- they need a tail.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.720
The process by which a spermatid elongates,
grows a tail, or flagellum, and officially

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.720
becomes a mobile sperm is called spermiogenesis.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.220
And the whole process takes about five weeks.
But it’s not like it holds anything up,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.790
because there are plenty more where those
spermatids came from.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.070
In the end, each primary spermatocyte gives
rise to four actual sperm. And considering

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.030
how many spermatogonia are continuously dividing
into spermatocytes, it’s easy to see how

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.690
a mature male can crank out 1500 sperm a second.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.750
That’s a far cry from all the investment
that goes into making a single ovum.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.310
Now, obviously, if sperm are going to get
anything accomplished, they have to leave

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.300
the seminiferous tubules that made them.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.660
So, even once they have tails, they still
need a little help getting going.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.980
That’s why each tubule is surrounded by
several layers of myoid cells, which, like

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.220
smooth muscle, rhythmically contract, using
peristalsis to squeeze sperm -- and some fluid

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.790
secreted by the sertoli cells -- through all
the twists and turns, toward their next destination,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.080
the rete testis in the posterior testis.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.250
From there, the sperm -- although still immobile
-- leave the testes, by way of the epididymis,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.820
a long, tangled set of tubes behind the testes where
they’ll spend the next few weeks gaining their mobility.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.600
The bulk of the epididymis consists of the
enormous duct of the epididymis, which, believe

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.700
it or not, could be uncoiled to stretch about
six meters -- though I don’t suggest doing that.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.100
This duct is full of tiny microvilli called
stereocilia, which provide a huge surface

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.840
area to help reabsorb some extra fluid, and
help pass along nutrients to feed the idling sperm.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.760
It takes sperm nearly 20 days to work their
way through this labyrinth, during which time

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.210
they continue to mature.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.480
Once through the duct they enter the inferior
epididymis, where they gain mitochondria so

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.050
they’ll have energy to swim hard at a moment’s
notice.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.130
At this point they have the hardware to swim,
but still lack the ability to actually move

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.639
on their own, a skill kept under wraps until
they leave the epididymis and get activated

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.790
by a series of glandular secretions.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.449
When that time comes, during ejaculation,
the sperm flow from the epididymis through

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.750
the vas deferens, a tube that travels up behind
the bladder and joins with the duct from the

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.380
seminal gland to create the ejaculatory duct.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.350
The left and right ejaculatory ducts pass
into the prostate gland where they empty into

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.699
the urethra, which runs from the bladder,
through the penis, and into the outside world.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:21.020
This system of tubes feeding into tubes allows
all of the necessary glands to make their

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.880
contributions to a moving wave of seminal
fluid that helps sperm mature and perform

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.920
their ultimate function -- fertilization.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.600
The resulting mix of sperm, testicular fluid, and
gland secretions -- which we call semen -- provide

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.960
sperm with transportation, nutritional energy,
chemical protection, and finally activates their motility.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.150
So let’s take a look at these glands.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.330
The seminal vesicles are a pair of small,
hollow glands behind the bladder that secrete

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.760
a yellowish, slightly alkaline fluid that
contains coagulating enzymes, fructose, and

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.430
other things to help nourish and transport
sperm.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.010
Interestingly, the vesicles also secrete special
prostaglandins that help increase sperm success

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:02.270
outside of the body, by decreasing the viscosity
of a female’s cervical mucous, and actually

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.020
triggering a reverse peristalsis of the uterus that
helps draw sperm up the female reproductive tract.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.060
Now, the prostate gland encircles the urethra
just inferior to the bladder. During ejaculation

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.810
it contracts to squeeze its own special secretion
into the urethra. This stuff contains mainly

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.720
citric acid and an enzyme cocktail that help
keeps semen liquified -- and thus easier to

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.990
move and swim through.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.680
And finally we have the pea-sized bulbo-urethral
glands below the prostate, that secrete a

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.599
clear mucus that drains into the urethra to
clear out any acidic urine prior to ejeculation.

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:37.519
Speaking of, by now you may be wondering if
we’re ever going to get to what’s probably

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.569
the first thing you think of when it comes
to the male anatomy.

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:45.149
The penis hangs from the perineum, between
the pubic bone and coccyx. It consists of

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:50.480
a shaft that ends in an enlarged tip called the glans
penis, surrounded by a fleshy cuff of foreskin.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.780
Internally, the penis contains three layers
of erectile tissues, each wrapped in a layer

00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:00.389
of dense fibrous connective tissue. This spongy
network is made of connective tissue and smooth

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:05.649
muscle that’s full of tiny vascular spaces
that fill with blood during sexual arousal,

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:07.819
and make the penis expand and become rigid.

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:11.139
The resulting erection is what helps the penis
penetrate the vagina.

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:14.290
And, the fact that we’re only now getting
around to talking about it here at the end

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.769
should tell you that -- as with the female
external genitalia -- the penis actually isn’t

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:21.889
all that important in terms of overall reproductive
function.

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:26.629
Evolutionarily speaking it’s just a delivery
system, designed to get male gametes as close

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:30.649
to female gametes as possible, and reap some
payoff for their investments.

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:35.640
Now! What that payoff looks like in term of
fertilization is where we’re headed next week.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.160
But for now, you learned all you’d ever
care to about testicular anatomy, the steps

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.910
of sperm production, and how it’s influenced
by gonadotropin and testosterone. We also

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.079
looked at how sperm mature, and how they leave
the body on a tide of glandular secretions

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.189
during ejaculation.
