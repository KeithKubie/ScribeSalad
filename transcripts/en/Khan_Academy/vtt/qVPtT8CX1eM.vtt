00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.360
We're on problem 129.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.330
If n is a positive integer, is
the value of b minus a at

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.120
least-- OK, so let's see.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.320
So n is positive.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.610
n positive integer.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.080
And they're saying, is the value
of b minus a at least

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.020
twice the value?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.520
So that's greater than or equal
to twice the value of 3

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.670
to the n minus 2 to the n.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.020
That's what we need to test.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:45.000
Statement 1 tells us, a is equal
to 2 to the n plus 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.940
And b-- this is still statement
1-- is equal to 3 to

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.390
the n plus 1.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.910
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.310
So let's substitute this
into this equation.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:07.370
So you get 3 to the n plus 1
minus 2 to the n plus 1 is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.770
greater than or equal to-- and
let's multiply this out.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.990
2 times 3 to the n minus
2 times 2 to the n.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.860
So what's 2 times 2 to the n?

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.680
Well, that's just 2
to the n plus 1.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240
2 times 2 to the n is 2
to the n plus 1, and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.140
there's a minus sign.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.530
That's where I got it from.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.170
So interesting.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.210
Just like that, we have a minus
2 to the n plus 1 on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.640
both sides.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.260
So we can just add 2 to the n
plus 1 from both sides to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.690
cancel them out.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.080
So we get rid of that,
get rid of that.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.900
And then our statement boils
down to, is 3 to the n plus 1

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.440
greater than or equal to
2 times 3 to the n?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.500
We could rewrite 3 to the n plus
1 as 3 times 3 to the n.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.390
And we're testing whether
that's greater than 2

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.750
times 3 to the n.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.240
And they tell us that n
is a positive number.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.450
But that actually
doesn't matter.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.310
Because we have 3 to the
n on both sides.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.520
Even if you rose this to a
negative exponent, you would

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.310
still have a positive number.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.290
So you could divide both sides
by 3 to the n and the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.820
statement boils down to 3 is
greater than 2, which is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.880
absolutely correct.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.890
So statement 1 is enough
information to say whether

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.926
this statement is true or not.

00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:27.140
And it actually proves
that it's true.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.300
Let's look at statement
number two.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.610
Statement number two tells
us that n is equal to 3.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.090
So let's see.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.230
If we look at the original
statement, if n is equal to 3,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.140
then we have to say-- This is
what the statement reduces to.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.200
It reduces to, b minus a is
greater than or equal to 2

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.300
times 3 to the third power.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.390
So that's 27.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.720
Minus 2 to the third power.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.760
Well, 2 to the third is 8.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.550
So it reduces to, b minus a is
greater than or equal to-- 27

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.590
minus 8 is 19.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.260
Times 2 is 38.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.690
Well, I don't know.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.640
They don't tell us
anything else

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920
about b, or a, or anything.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.110
So this is a useless
statement.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.690
And actually, going through
this was a little bit of a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.270
waste of time.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.180
You could have just said, hey,
they told me what n is.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.310
I can come up with a number
here, but that still doesn't

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.640
give me any information
over what b or a is.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.020
So statement 1, alone,
is sufficient

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.920
to answer this question.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.425
And 2 is not.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.640
Let me go to sky blue.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.710
Problem 130.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.590
The inflation index for the
year 1989, relative to the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.540
year 1970, was 3.56.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.740
Indicating that, on average, for
each dollar spent in 1970

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.490
for goods, 3.56 had to
be spent for the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.710
same goods in 1989.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.540
Let me write that down.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:03.070
1970, $1.00.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.420
In 1989, that same thing
would cost $3.59.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.550
Oh, $3.56.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.560
I'm getting my 6's
and 9's confused.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.900
$3.56 had to be spent.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.209
If the price of a model K mixer
increased precisely

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.240
according to the inflation
index, what was the price of

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.970
the mixer in 1970?

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.730
So we want to know the
mixer K in 1970.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.400
So statement number one.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.990
The price of the model K
mixer was $102.4 more

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.860
in 1989 than 1970.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.840
So let's call this, K.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.630
We're trying to figure
out K 70.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.620
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.420
Mixer K in 1970.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.620
So they say the price of the
model K mixer was $102.40 more

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.450
in 1989 than 1970.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:03.920
So this, essentially, tells us
that mixer K in 1989, minus

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:15.370
mixer K in 1970, is
equal to $102.40.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.840
But we also have other
information.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.730
We know that mixer K, it went
exactly with inflation, the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.080
increase in inflation price.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:36.580
So mixer K in 1989, is equal to
3.56 times mixer K in 1970.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.590
Well, how do we know that?

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.970
Because they told us that mixer
K, the price of it,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.820
increased directly with
this inflation.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.700
Pretty much anything that went
with inflation was worth 3.56

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.610
times more in 1989.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.680
So mixer K in '89 is
3.56 times more

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.750
than it was in 1970.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.595
So now, we have this linear
equation, which was given in

00:05:58.595 --> 00:05:59.970
the problem statement.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.110
And we have this linear
equation.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.600
So we have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.010
So we actually have enough
information just with

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.810
statement 1 to solve
the problem.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.350
And I'm actually not even going
to go into it because it

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.740
would be a waste of time.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.230
Hopefully, we're getting into
the rhythm of this.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.000
Two linear equations, two
unknowns, enough information.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.520
If they're quadratic or
something, then you'd have to

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.290
dig a little bit deeper.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.270
Or if they're somehow parallel
equations, but I wouldn't

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.590
worry about that too
much on the GMAT.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.760
Statement number two.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.840
The price of the model K mixer
was $142.40 in 1989.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.760
So they're telling us that
K in 1989 was 142.40

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.880
Well, this is definitely enough
information, because we

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.870
already have this equation.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.370
The '89 price, which is 142.40,
is equal to 3.56 times

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.200
the 1970 price.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.120
So you just divide this by 3.56
and you have your answer.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.660
So each statement,
independently, is enough to

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.910
solve this problem.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.260
Problem 131.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.306
Is 5 to the k less
than a thousand?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.620
Statement number one tells us
that 5 to the k plus 1 is

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.430
greater than 3,000.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.910
I already have a sense this
isn't going to help us,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.980
because it's essentially setting
a lower bound on 5.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.230
So let me just explain it.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.340
So 5 to the k plus 1.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.430
That's the same thing as
5 to the k times 5.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.150
So that's equal to 5
times 5 to the k.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.670
You could view this as
5 to the first power.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.070
Then, you would add the
exponents to get here.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.000
And that, they say, is
greater than 3,000.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.630
You divide both sides by 5 and
you get 5 to the k-- that's a

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.960
k-- is greater than 600.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.080
That doesn't help us.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.070
5 to the k could be 6,000.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.560
Well, 5 to the k could
be 700, in which case

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.850
this would be true.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.460
5 to the k could be 7,000.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.600
In which case, this
wouldn't be true.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.930
So statement 1, by itself,
isn't enough information.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:20.230
Statement number two tells us, 5
to the k minus 1 is equal to

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:26.820
5 to the k minus 500.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.940
This is interesting.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.620
Let's see what we can do here.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.990
Let's get all the
k's on one side.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.830
So this is the same thing as 5
to the k minus 1 minus 5 to

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:45.430
the k is equal to minus 500.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.100
Well, this is the same
thing as 1/5, or 5 to

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.030
the negative 1.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.030
Let me write that.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.290
5 to the negative 1
times 5 to the k.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.220
Then, minus 5 to the k is
equal to minus 500.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.180
Let's factor 5 to the
k out of this.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:08.240
So you get 5 to the
k times-- 5 to the

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.720
negative 1, that's 1/5.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.220
Minus 1-- we factored a 5
to the k out there-- is

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.300
equal to minus 500.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.540
And let's see what we can do.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.860
5 to the k.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.980
1/5 minus 1.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.020
That's minus 4/5, right?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.910
Times minus 4/5 is equal
to minus 500.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.610
We can get rid of the minus
sign on both sides.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.480
Multiply both sides
by negative 1.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.670
And then, we can multiply
both sides by 5/4.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:42.630
So we get 5 to the k is equal
to 500 times what?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.880
5/4.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.170
And that is what?

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.180
That's 125.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.040
2,500 divided by 4.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.480
2,500 divided by 4.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.060
I want to say it's 475.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.040
Is that-- 5/4.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.740
No.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.170
So each fourth is 125 and
you have another.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.010
So it's equal to 625.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.310
Even if I just got my math
wrong, that doesn't matter.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.200
Because they just want to know
whether 5 to the k is less

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.270
than a thousand.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.820
And it definitely is.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:24.220
Even if my math-- 500 times
5/4-- 1/4 of 500 is 125.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:30.130
125 times 5.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.090
So we'll have one
more of those.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.880
625.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.460
So statement 2, alone,
is sufficient

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.390
to answer the question.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.310
Statement 1 was kind
of useless.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.460
I've run out of time.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.330
See you in the next video.
