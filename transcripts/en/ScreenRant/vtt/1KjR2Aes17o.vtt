00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.980
When a story unfolds in the real world that
seems like a movie come to life, Hollywood

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.360
studios don't waste time in adapting it.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.090
But not every movie based on a true story
is clearly advertised as one, which means

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.251
some stories that seem too strange, too hard
to believe, or just too well-hidden to be

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.000
based on fact slip by audiences.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.110
Let us know if we missed any in the comments
below!

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.350
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movies You Won't
Believe Are Based On Real Stories.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.410
Nacho Libre (Paramount Pictures)

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.750
That's right, the movie that cast Jack Black
as a Mexican priest entering the world of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.570
Lucha Libre to support local orphans actually
happened.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.650
The movie is based on the life of Sergio Gutiérrez
Benítez, a priest in Texcoco Mexico who learned

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.350
just how much money it took to care for over
200 orphans.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.239
Inspired by movies he had seen that showed
completely fictional priests who wrestled

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.130
to raise money, Benitez did it for real, taking
the name of Fray Tormenta - Friar Storm.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.580
He kept his dayjob a secret for years, but
when a rival revealed Friar Storm was a priest

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.060
in disguise, the money and donations began
to roll in - a twist that had the priest wishing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.689
he'd let it slip from the start.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.650
Rocky (United Artists)

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.110
Everyone knows the story of the small-time
boxer who finds the heart to take on the heavyweight

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.790
champ, but Rocky isn't as original a story
as you might think.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.210
Early on, Sylvester admitted that he started
writing the movie's script after seeing a

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.500
15-round fight between heavyweight champ Muhammad
Ali and Chuck Wepner, a boxer who'd been written

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
off, forced to work as a bouncer while he
trained.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.530
Since Rocky's opponent Apollo Creed was also
based on Ali, Wepner would eventually sue

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.330
Stallone in 2006 for stealing his life's story.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.770
The lawsuit was settled out of court, but
the theft didn't stop there.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.760
For research, the production team had also
sought out Muhammad Ali's greatest opponent,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.420
Joe Frazier, who makes a cameo in the film.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.600
Rocky punching sides of meat and running the
steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.420
Both taken from Frazier's own life without
giving any credit - a fact that the former

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.590
heavyweight champ is still sore about.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.119
Indiana Jones (Paramount)

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.189
We explained in an earlier video how Indiana
Jones was based on the 1954 movie Secret of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.970
the Incas, but both characters owe their origin
to a real life explorer.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.130
Hiram Bingham ("High-rum Bing-um") was just
36 years old when he realized teaching history

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.910
and politics at Harvard, then Yale wasn't
enough to keep him busy, and organized a search

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.420
for the lost capitol of the Incas based mainly
on curiosity.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.650
Relying on centuries-old books and local guides,
his search would lead him to the ruins of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.880
Macchu Picchu, a mountaintop city that had
been lost to South American history.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.099
The site was a major breakthrough, and his
book became a bestseller when it released

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.290
just 6 years before Charlton Heston played
a rougher version of the adventurer, with

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.090
Indy following decades later.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.480
A Nightmare on Elm Street (New Line Cinema)

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.844
No, there's no documented proof of a child
murderer returning from the dead to kill teenagers

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:43.844
in their sleep.

00:02:43.844 --> 00:02:46.569
But the inspiration for Freddy Krueger is
realer than fans would think.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.830
Director Wes Craven has explained that the
story began when he read multiple accounts

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.700
of Cambodian immigrants dying under strange
circumstances.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.070
In the case of one family having settled in
Los Angeles, things were fine until their

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.170
young son began refusing to sleep, convinced
that if he did, an unseen terror was going

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.960
to kill him.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.349
After staying awake for days and hiding coffeemakers
in his room, he succumbed to sleep.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.129
Hours later, they heard him screaming in terror,
and found him dead in his own bed.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.550
Craven let his imagination run wild, and A
Nightmare on Elm Street was born.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.170
300 (Warner Bros.)

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.480
Zack Snyder's vision of ancient Spartan warriors
may be based on Frank Miller's comic, but

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.140
viewers who loved 300's intense action and
badass battles may not know just how accurate

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.580
the movie actually is.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.590
Sure, there weren't any mutants or magical
beasts at the battle of Thermopylae, but the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.940
Spartans really were famous throughout the
ancient world for their skills at delivering

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.090
one-liners.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.400
The soldiers being happy for the shade offered
by storms of arrows fits with actual historical

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.840
accounts, along with their response to being
commanded to lay down their arms.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.480
King Leonidas may not have actually screamed,
"This is Sparta", but the other lines are

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.911
still used as mottos in the Greek army to
this day.

00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:57.911
Plus, he really did throw Persian emissaries
down as well.

00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:58.911
Fury (Columbia Pictures)

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.049
The story of star Brad Pitt's tank crew making
a glorious stand in World War II Germany isn't

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.730
based on a single crew, since the final product
is too poetic to be true.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.629
But director David Ayer pulled from multiple
true stories to keep Fury accurate.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.440
Take the real world war hero Audie Murphy,
who mounted the machine gun atop a burned

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.770
out tank to singlehandedly hold off a German
assault, just like the movie's heroes.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.519
Brad Pitt's character is even named after
American tank commander Lafayette "War Daddy"

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.159
Pool, who racked up a total of 258 armoured
vehicle and mobile gun kills in just 3 months.

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.280
If that wasn't enough, Ayer based the movie's
climax around the story told by American soldiers

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.539
of a single recruit found alive in a burned
out tank smack in the middle of a country

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.789
crossroad, surrounded by dozens of enemy dead.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.750
Heat (Warner Bros.)

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.319
Most movie buffs will tell you that Michael
Mann's Heat is based on the real-world Bank

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:51.050
of America shootout in 1997, when gunmen overwhelmed
LAPD officers with assault rifles and body

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.050
armor.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.729
But it isn't just the action scenes that were
inspired by the real world.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.379
The director's friend Chuck Adamson, a former
Chicago police officer gets some of the credit

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.999
for the movie's main rivalry.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.180
Apparently, Adamson really did face off with
a career thief name McCauley - De Niro's character

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.610
- and the pair really did sit down for a heated
cup of coffee while one was chasing the other.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.979
In the end, McCauley fled a robbery knowing
he was trapped, was chased down, then shot

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.120
and killed by Adamson, just as the movie shows.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.430
The Hunt For Red October (Paramount)

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.259
Tom Clancy's CIA hero has gone through some
crazy adventures, but one Jack Ryan movie

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.599
was based on more than imagination.

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.990
In The Hunt For Red October, the commander
of a Soviet nuclear submarine flees for America,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.059
looking to defect while his authorities set
out to sink his sub instead.

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.059
Total fiction, right?

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:37.059
Wrong.

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.999
Clancy based his story on Captain Valery Sablin,
who along with loyal crew, stole a destroyer

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.409
called The Sentry.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.389
Soviet forces would soon sink the ship, claiming
Sablin was looking to flee to the West.

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.740
It was only after Clancy published his book
that the true story came out: Sablin was looking

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.140
to attack Soviet leadership, and spark an
even more communistic revolution.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.270
So the true story of Red October... wasn't
really true at all?

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.210
Star Wars (Disney/Lucasfilm)

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.529
George Lucas wasn't trying to hide the role
Nazi Germany played on his space epic, naming

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.249
his "stormtroopers" after Germany's own special
attack forces.

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.249
Star Wars wasn't ABOUT Nazi Germany, but the
influences are clear.

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:12.039
The uniforms of the Empire are drawn from
history, as is the alliance - led by American

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.649
heroes - who overthrew the old order.

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:18.770
The space battles were based on real footage
of aerial dogfights, the famous "Kessel Run"

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.369
is based on a German military term, while
the planet Hoth is named for a German general

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.969
who served on the frozen Russian front.

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.089
The first movie's finale is even modeled after
German propaganda films, but the prequels

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:33.089
went even further, showing how the Emperor
began as a Chancellor, just as Adolf Hitler

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.089
did.

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.149
Director J.J. Abrams has even admitted that
when the writers wondered what would have

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:39.139
happened if the Nazis regrouped after losing
the war, the First Order, the villains of

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.050
the next Star Wars trilogy were born.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.389
The Shining (Warner Bros.)

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.179
Stanley Kubrick's classic horror movie, just
like the Stephen King novel it's based on,

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:51.370
is beyond famous.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.949
But horror fans would be surprised to know
it wasn't completely fiction.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.919
In a time when the author would sometimes
feel genuine anger towards his own children,

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.689
King and his wife spent a night at the Stanley
Hotel in Colorado.

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:08.020
As the only guests near the end of the season,
the couple walked down long, empty hallways,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.240
stayed in the haunted Room 217, and even shared
a quiet drink with the hotel's only bartender.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.899
The moments all made it into the book, but
it wasn't until King woke from a nightmare,

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:20.870
seeing his son running in terror through the
hotel that The Shining was born, with the

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.090
basic plot decided before King headed back
to bed.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.619
Those are the films based on actual events
and people that we couldn't believe, but what

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:26.619
are your favorites?

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:30.949
