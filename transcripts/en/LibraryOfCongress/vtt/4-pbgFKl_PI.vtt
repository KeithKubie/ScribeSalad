00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.920
Alona is an award winning
Israeli author and illustrator.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.070
She is best known for her
classic work, Once Upon a Potty,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.970 position:56%
which has been translated into many,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.980
many languages including
Spanish, Japanese amongst others.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.590
Her late husband, Zygmunt Frankel,
was a well known artist and writer,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.960
and her son, Ari, has illustrated
and written children's books

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.650
and is an accomplished musician.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.820
Alona is gifting to the
Library 82 pieces of material.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850
On the [inaudible], we
have a presentation later

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.470
on to the librarian's office

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.270
and there's just a
sampling of her books here.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.660
Today she will be speaking about
the newly translated book, Girl.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.830
Alona, like her books, is bright,
positive and a delight to be with.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.930
She speaks of rainbow, love, stars,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.710
grandparents on the farm
and white elephants.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.470
I'm amazed how someone that
has experienced such sadness

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.970
in life creates and gives
happiness to so many of us.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.720
When I think of Alona and
her work, a paraphrase line

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.730
from the Yiddish Culture
[inaudible] Project,

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.300
which we had here last
week, comes to mind.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.840
Power of art, resiliency of the
human spirit and the will to live.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.430
Thank you, Alona, for giving
us all of these gifts.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.730
Before Alona speaks, we have a few
words of welcome from the Chief

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.320
of Diplomacy at the Embassy
of Israel, Yaron Gamburg.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.120
Yaron.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.980
&gt;&gt; Yaron Gamburg: Thank you, Gail.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.410
I'm not exactly Chief of Diplomacy.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.610
I wish I were, but my position
is Administer of Public Diplomacy

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.910
at the Embassy of Israel.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.910
I took on this position a few
months ago and it's a pleasure,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.440
it's a pleasure and honor to be
with you, all of you this morning,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.370
this afternoon, the Alona Frankel
colleagues from the Library

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.360
of Congress, dear Gail, once again.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.160
Today Alona will be speaking
with us about her book,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.260
newly translated book
into English, Girl.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.920
Her own experiences as a young
girl during the Holocaust.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.950
Last week on November
9th, we remembered one

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.780
of the more tragic days

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.110
of the modern history the
Kristallnacht on November 9.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.070
This event was actually a precursor
of the Holocaust when dozens

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.960
of Jews were killed, synagogues
and Jewish-owned stores

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.270
and institutions were burned.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.210
There was a special
congressional event

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.230
at the Washington Hebrew
Congregation together

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.660
with also the Chinese embassy.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.620
I must tell you that as a grandson
of a Holocaust survivor myself

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.430
and also as the grandson
of the officer

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.150
in the Red Army before
the Nazis this period

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.010
of history has a special personal
meaning for me and this book

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.260
of Alona provides us with
a very important insight

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.440
into the children's mind and
soul in the period of our history

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.610
when hatred and bigotry
became dominant models

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.040
of too many governments

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.070
and political leaders
in Europe and elsewhere.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.300
It's a must read for all of
us for all of those who have

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.070
as adults responsibility for
our lives, for our own reality,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.750
for our children by what
we say and what we do.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.400
This book of Alona is written
for adults but let us not forget

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.910
that most of the books
Alona wrote in the past more

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.500
than 40 years were for children.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.530
So did you know about the
family of tiny white elephants?

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.390
[Speaking Hebrew] in Hebrew.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.330
In Hebrew it sounds better.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.480
Yes or no.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.150
Let me give you a trailer.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.290
In the jungle there lives a family

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.170
of little white elephants
[speaking Hebrew] in Hebrew.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.510
Papa [inaudible], Mama
[inaudible] and baby [inaudible]

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.310
and one day this happy
family is joined

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.740
by a tiny baby girl
elephant, [inaudible].

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.030
And I will not give a
spoiler for those of you

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.360
who still haven't read this book,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.510
but I will tell you it is
my favorite book of Alona.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.490
[ Inaudible ]

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.320
Yes, I will get your
signature later.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.950
[Laughter] So this book, when I
read this book to my oldest son

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.460
after his baby brother was born and
while he was happy in general but,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.130
you know, he was not too much
eager to share his stories

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.980
with his brother, you know, and
Alona's book was the best guide

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.950
for me, my wife in educating
our children to love each other.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.500
For me today there's a special
opportunity to meet in person

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.120
with Alona and thank her in
person for this wonderful world

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.550
that she created for
us for our kids.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.390
This world where we
can educate each other,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.660
where we can understand
each other and this world

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.930
where we can learn how we can
and should love each other.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:29.250 position:56%
Later afternoon as Gail said Alona's
work and legacy will be honored

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.620
by the Library of Congress.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.810
It's a wonderful gift to her as
a writer but it's also a gift

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.040
to [inaudible] literature
in general,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.900
to the modern Hebrew
language literature.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.740
This language that was
revived only 100 years ago

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.370 position:56%
when nobody believed the [inaudible]
succeed except for a small bunch

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.920
of people like [inaudible]
and a few others.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.220 position:56%
So Alona's books like books of other
modern Israeli writers are a vivid

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.560
illustration of this revival.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.250
Modern Hebrew combines the
depths of the ancient language

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.550
and at the same time allows us

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.470
to communicate the most
sophisticated concepts

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.170
of contemporary civilization.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.060
So this triumph of modern
Hebrew is one of the sources

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.070
of this incredible achievements of
Israeli culture in general be it

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.030
in literature, theatre or cinema.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.070
Speaking about cinema just
check these movies on Netflix

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.050
to get an idea of the scope.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.270
So, thank you very much
for this attention.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.740
I wish us all a great book
talk by Alona Frankel.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.040
Thank you.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.840
[Speaking Hebrew]

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.180
[ Applause ]

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:58.910
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Hi, I'm
Alona, and I'm really very proud

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.690
to be invited here and talk to you.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:08.140
I shall try as briefly as
possible, which isn't easy,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.520 position:56%
to tell you about this book of
mine, which I wrote after many years

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:23.920
that I wrote and illustrate the
books for children and as modest

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.400 position:56%
as I am I must confess that my books
were very, very nice appreciated

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.750
and well-known and they got many
prizes, and I could never imagine

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:44.370
that I would write about my history
of my childhood that happened

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:50.020
in the worst times in our history,

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:55.220
the Jewish history,
and I was part of it.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:03.170 position:56%
So I am what is called a Holocaust
survivor and it's kind of a conflict

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:11.590
because usually such subjects
they got stereotypes how Holocaust

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.570
survivor has to look like.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:21.480
So usually it has to be very
ugly and then he has to be

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:31.100
with some ash [phonetic] on his
head and all kinds of movements.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:38.980
So it's such a thing that
I always try to look nice.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.870
So, I'm like misleading people,
oh, you're a Holocaust survivor,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.810
it's impossible but it is all true.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:56.810
I was born in an unfortunate
era just 2 years, in 1937,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.380
just 2 years before the
Germans occupied Poland.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.770
I was born in Poland in
a wonderful city Krakow.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:11.390 position:56%
If you have been in Poland or plan
to be, you have to visit this place.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.250
It's really wonderful.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:25.750
And in 1939 the Germans as you must
know invaded Poland and my father,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:34.170
my mother and me we escaped
to the east to a city

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.070
by the name of Lvov [phonetic].

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.720
The city now is [inaudible]
and escaped from Germans.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:47.650
Of course no one then knew
what is going to happen

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.100
and there were many Jews that
prefer the German occupation

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.300
than the Russia occupation
because the German was, of course,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.740
well-known as very
cultured civilization

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:09.760
and the Russians were always
like lower kind of culture.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:17.240
So many stayed and they,
of course, were murdered,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:25.760
but we also couldn't
escape the German invasion.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.580
It was a period that
[inaudible] make kind

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.960
of a pact that they divide Poland.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.520
It's a very difficult
place that Poland exists.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.230
I mean the borders.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:48.570
In the west, the Germans, east,
the Russians so in their history,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.690
which is really horrible history,

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:57.700
3 times this nation even didn't
exist being divided between Poland,

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:02.510
between Russia and Germany
and Austria in the south.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:11.210
So after they win the war
between Russia and German started,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:22.860
the Germans came to Lvov and to
begun a history that everyone knows

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.310
that they established the ghetto
and all the Jews were forced

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:39.470 position:56%
to leave during the most poor part
of the city and all those atrocities

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:45.030
that happened, the actions and
even actions against children.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:52.280 position:56%
They are worse that when I hear them
that immediately get kind of alert

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.700
like [inaudible] selections
that started

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:01.240
to have this whole
new meaning for me.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.220
So I usually avoid
them and what started

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.070
in the ghetto were those
actions even against children.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:15.340
Only recently I heard just
horrible thing that the Germans

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.660
in the ghetto they
established some playground

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.640
to make children gather
there and then they took them

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.710
and all of them were murdered.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:36.800 position:56%
So, I am one of very few children
that survived from this Lvov ghetto.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:43.110
When it turned out that the
ghetto is going to be liquidated,

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.340
which is also a word that
always make me, you know, jump,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:54.570
so my parents tried very much
to find some place to escape

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.930
and to find some place to hide.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.730
And they did find some place.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:08.450 position:56%
A family that owned, this man owned
the, was very grateful for my father

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:16.800
and they agreed to hide them,
but without a child, imagine.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.630
So I was the child.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:23.500
So it was another problem
what to do with the child.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.810
So it was a woman that agreed
to take me to her parents

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.640
in a very small village
named [inaudible]

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:42.500
and they made some false documents
and my mother was even told me,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:50.270
look, Elonka, my name is Alona, my
real name is Alona, look, Elonka,

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.180
your name is not Alona, your
name is name Irina [phonetic]

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.940
and not Goodwin [phonetic],
which is my family name,

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.280
Seraman [phonetic], Irina Seraman.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:09.380
And she told me all these Christian
prayers say our Lord in heaven

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.360
and everything and how to, you
know, all those men, Saints,

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.650
and it was very lucky
because my accent was Polish.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:26.820
We were [inaudible] and didn't
speak, I don't understand Yiddish

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.260
so it was Polish so
this what happened

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.540
that all the family they
told me I am a Christian girl

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.860
and this woman she came
to take me to the village.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:52.720
So, now I want to show you
how, which one is, which one?

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.740
This is my son, Ari.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:08.370
Okay, okay.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:16.230
So, my mother was born in a
little town named Oswiecim,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:23.200
which became during the war
Auschwitz and here you see them

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:29.460
like nice Jew and there's
my grandmother.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.260
He name was Rebecca.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.910
And she was known for her beauty.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:38.550 position:56%
There were stories that during the
first World War Cossacks [inaudible]

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.470
just to look at her, which is nice.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.690
And after the war no one
knew how, where to find them

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.100
and they were not anymore.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.140
And this is me.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.640 position:56%
As I told you, I was born in Krakow.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:57.480
My mother she told me that I was so
ugly that when she walked with me

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.120
to the park when the
[inaudible] didn't come,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.510
she used to put me
near one bench and sit

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.580
in the second one just
not make connection.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.970
[Laughter] I don't
think I am so ugly here.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.790
So, this is also me.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:23.480
Nice. So after my parents hide in
this place with this Polish family

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.140 position:56%
and I was in the village, the ghetto
was liquidate and they also were

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.660
that as this meaning that I cannot
repeat and I was in the village

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.240
and until now I just can't
imagine how it happened

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:47.240
that a small girl is taken from her
parents, her name changed and she

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.930
so quickly learned those players,
which are very nice and took

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:56.820
to a remote village with 2
extremely old people they were

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.390
like 45 something like this.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:05.830
So imagine I was born in 1937
so half a year I will be 80.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.940
I must tell you it's
completely new thing

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:16.380
in my life I cannot understand
it how, when it become

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.840
that it was just whole
life what did I do?

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.690
It's like this amount of life
and now it's so little left.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:40.920
I am really sorry because it's
such a waste of time to die.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:51.410
[Laughter] Life is so interesting.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.410
But, well, that's it.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:35.920
So in the ghetto here I will show
you some things and some documents

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.820
that my mother kept under
the mattress and, of course,

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:48.160
after she died I have them.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.300
And some of them are, this is one
of the documents from the ghetto

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:04.570
if you see my father already
looks horrible and this is some

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:10.280
in our ghetto even to say
our ghetto it's horrible.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:17.210
So, it wasn't the Yellow Star of
David, it was kind of a ribbon

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:23.440 position:56%
on your shoulder that you are Jewish
and those are some permissions

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.720
that you can, that you work.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.770
So one of them it [inaudible].

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.650
My father was very good
at making false documents,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:42.830
but I do not really know which one
and here is this woman that agreed

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.120
to hide me with her parents.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:53.810 position:56%
Her name was Hannah Seraman
[phonetic] and she had terrible name

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.390
because she was kind of
making deals all the time.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:04.720 position:56%
You know when war, when such a
situation is a horrible war it takes

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.090
place so there are
many elements of people

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:14.330
that suddenly they become
cooperating with the conqueror

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.890
and making all kind of
deals between the Gestapo

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.850
and the Jews and the Poles.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.880
So she had this name that
she was like really terrible

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.570
because she promised some families
to hide them and it was known

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:37.750 position:56%
that she took them and then she took
all their money and abandoned them

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.920
of course to certain death.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:45.070
But still she didn't do it with me.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:57.190
So, if you see I am, my parents
paid for, paid her to take me

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.970
and if you see this photograph
this dress my mother did it

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:09.810
and this ribbon after we
have been in this photograph.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:16.200
So it was taken from me and this,
they asked her to photograph me

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.580
because they really didn't
believe that I am still alive

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:29.880
and in this hiding to convince
my parents that I am still alive

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:36.590
so they ask her to give me some
piece of paper for me to draw

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:42.860
because they didn't and then

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.540
after she bring the drawing
they gave her the money

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:52.360 position:56%
and here you see really did the kind
of drawings I was doing here it's

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.260
like me and piece of a car and
the dog and this is a train.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:03.950
I don't know if someone were to
come now and show me those drawings

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:09.220
and ask me what do you predict
from this child to be maybe,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.200
illustrator or something?

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.770
No. No, they are not
such talented drawings.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:24.230
[Laughter] So, but still it is
really, it is really interesting

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.830
and then those drawings
somehow saved my life

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:36.030
and now these being
illustrator I make my living.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:44.600
So it's like a chain of the same
talent helped me then and now.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.220
And here is also a
drawing if you can see it.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:54.270
This is supposed to be [inaudible]
and farmers with those, you know,

00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:00.640
I don't know how you call it
in English those, you know,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.760
that you cut the grass
and the wheat.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:13.800 position:56%
So those are the drawings my parents
got and then gave her some money.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.470
After the money it was no more.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.150
They didn't have any
money to pay her anymore.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:26.140
So, she abandoned me.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:33.850
She took me back to this hiding
where my parents were hiding

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:40.260
in Lvov and, of course, as I told
you this family didn't want a child

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.560
to be there.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.320
Imagine no children,
no pets, no children.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:52.320
And still she took me to the hiding
of my parents, which was a very,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.090
very small room that
once was a cabinet

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:06.510
of a [inaudible] a Jewish doctor,
and here is his mother and his wife

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.100
and the children were murdered
in the beginning of the war

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.220
and now this family lived there.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:19.910
And it was a small room and I
was not allowed to talk loudly

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:26.190
and to walk in case any
neighbors will notice

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:34.120
that Jews are hiding there because
it's very important to realize

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:41.210
that only Poland it was a
death penalty for hiding Jews.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:48.440
So, and only Poland I
am kind of taking care

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.110
of their reputation somehow
because I love Poland

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.130
so much and I love the language.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:01.680
So, in Poland, they didn't
cooperate with the Germans

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:10.170
like every other occupied country,
Belgium and France and Hungary

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.630 position:56%
and Romania and every other country.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.890
The Poles always were
opposed and many millions

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:26.340
of Poles also were murdered during
this war and it doesn't mean

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.870
that there were also many
[inaudible] that gave away the Jews

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:39.940
and sometimes for money and
sometimes because they didn't

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.740
like us so much, which
is really strange.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:49.140
I think it's kind of a
disease like necrophilia

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.690
or something it's so disgusting.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:56.120
I really cannot understand.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.940
Well, but this is another subject.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:05.590
So in this hiding where
I was not allowed to talk

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:15.580
and I think also food was very
not, it's difficult to talk about

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:24.140
but it [inaudible] situation that
me I was hiding from those people

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:30.470
that hide my parents and all of us
were hiding from the [inaudible]

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:37.410
and when the steps of this lady
was approaching like this so I had

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:43.670 position:56%
to run to the corner of this little
place and hide under the rocks there

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:49.150
that we slept there and
being quiet like mice.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.610
By the way I had my pets.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:57.780
There were 2 little mouse,
mice, one of them was name Misha

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.140
and the other one Tisha
and I tamed them.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:09.000 position:56%
They came and I made them for little
crumbs of bread that were left food

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.720
and when the front was near and
they were bombarding the city,

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:25.270
so of course, everyone in
the city went to a shelter

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:30.100
and the mice always also
run away but we couldn't

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.790
because when the neighbors
would see us Jews so we stayed

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.180
in this little place
during the bombardment.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:46.250
And in this little place, every
piece of paper which was very,

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:53.520
very rare so I draw and
it's really unbelievable.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.760
I really don't understand it
how a girl being there can make

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.020
such drawings like
little fairies and dwarf

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:16.820 position:56%
and this [inaudible] birds closed in
a little room, no food, no walking,

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:23.780
no speaking but it's,
this is how it was.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:30.390
And then I did the drawings
and this one if you see

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.850
so everyone here is smoking because
they were, of course, no food,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:41.130
no cigarettes and they don't
know where was more important

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:49.460
for my parents and as you
see, everyone here is smoking.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:56.440
They were smoking and the boys
smoking and the chimney smoking,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.210
which is a very good sign because
if there's smoke out of the stove,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.620
a chimney, it means maybe
something is cooking there.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.000
So, they pick mushrooms
and so idyllic

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.040
and I a little girl hide in there.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.540
And here it's also some of the
things that survived the war.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.790
This is a cookbook that my
mother dictate to my father

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:32.890 position:56%
because he has very nice handwriting
and it's also [inaudible]

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.020
because she made this cookbook.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:42.410
Imagine those times that no meal is
repeating itself during the whole

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:48.190
year like the first and second
and the dessert and every place

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:53.290
that was left so I was
making those drawings.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:58.990
And here this is another story.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:04.100
All those documents and
there are much more are now

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:09.640
in the Washington Museum,
Holocaust Museum.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.700
Of course when Israel have
this museum [inaudible]

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:20.520
that I must confess I don't
like this institution, sorry.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:27.260
Why I don't like it because
somehow it's a very political.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.600
Every guest that is coming to
Israel first of all take them

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.390
to the [inaudible] and it's like,
you know, those beggars in front

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:42.650
of a Cathedral they see it and
they [inaudible] bleeding heart.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:52.900
So I feel like the government is
taking advantage on back of people

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:57.340
like me that survived this
war and they were very,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.220
very offended when I decided
to give those documents

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.670 position:56%
because they started to [inaudible].

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:13.950
So I gave it to the
museum here in Washington.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:19.770
In [inaudible] in this
hiding, were some books,

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.180
which is really very strange

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.080
because this book is the
first edition of [inaudible].

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.810
I must have some took
care of [inaudible]

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.410
and this first edition my
father bought, of course,

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:47.640
everyone in [inaudible] knew
German so, and because he read it

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:53.470
and because he knew
that it's written

00:33:53.470 --> 00:34:01.240
in such a [inaudible] German
language, the intellectual,

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.850
so he never believed that
this man will succeed

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:14.340
to do something politically, which
was of course a huge mistake.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.790
So imagine they run
away from the Germans

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.950
and they took the book with them.

00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:27.310
It's really so, so
unbelievable and other books was,

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:36.410
that was in this hiding was a
wonderful huge book of the history

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:43.840
of the Jesuits, which was
very important [inaudible]

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.930
of declaration.

00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:55.120
It was also a Bible, first edition
like 100 years old, in English

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:06.090
and beautiful letters of Hebrew and
my father used to tell me stories

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.780
from the Bible and I
remember the stories I

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:16.630
like the most were first the
stories about Noah and the ark,

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.970
you know Noah and the ark

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.430
that he saved the animals
before the [inaudible].

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:29.840
And what I liked about it first of
all they had enough food and, well,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.420
now I think about it it's
strange because lions

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.560
and sheep I don't know maybe
they feed on each other

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.410
but this is not a nice
story so forget it.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.510
And then it was the smell of wood

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:53.020
that this little place would
camouflage as a carpenter workshop

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.760
for I like the story of the
[inaudible] and, of course,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.480 position:56%
they survive it which was really and
the other story that I like most was

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:11.250
about the story of the man, man
[inaudible] that God gave people

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:16.930
of Israel from the
sky and it was shape

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:24.070
of some cardinal [phonetic]
something and you eat it

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:29.530
and then you can imagine every
kind of food that you like,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.680
like strawberries and cream
or ice cream and so on.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.200
So, of course, in this situation I
like the stories very, very much.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:45.040
The other book also was because
it was a cabinet of a gynecologist

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:55.550
so it was an encyclopedia in 5
volumes of the sexual science.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.810
So imagine I being a children
illustrator, of course,

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:04.380
those were the first [inaudible]
I have seen in my life.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.770
[Laughter] It's kind of ironic
and five volumes there were

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:15.440
and it's also here in
the Washington Museum.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.520
And then it was a cookbook.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:24.530
A cookbook that they also took
when they run away to the east

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:32.680 position:56%
and this cookbook my father gave my
mother on her birthday as a present.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.980
I must tell you she never
forgive my father because instead

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:46.070
of some French perfume or some
negligee, pink or maybe sexy black,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:52.180
I don't know if then it
was sex at all and black

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:56.170
and so she never forgive him.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:05.690
So if you imagine those books were
about the most important things

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:10.100
of life because, well,
cookbook, foods, yes?

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:19.280
A religion, you have the Jesuits
and the Bible and, of course,

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:26.760
politics was the main
[inaudible], yes.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:42.580
And also what was there
a lot of book, of course,

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.360
so the most important
thing in life and then

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.440
after the war my mother
kept those books.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:59.350
And here I want to show you
this, some of the photographs.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:05.540
Some of the photographs
of members of my family

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:15.240
that didn't survive the war and
no one knew what happened to them,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.330
but they were not anymore.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.910
I decided because of those
photographs I decided

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:30.990
to write this book, Girl,
because still then I was writing

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:37.830
and illustrating and as
[inaudible] as I am I must confess

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.830
that I was very successful.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.970
I get a lot of prizes and usually
those prizes were some kind

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:50.610
of a paper written calligraphy very
nice, Alona Frankel get the first,

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:55.950 position:56%
and this was the prize and my mother
used to keep it under her mattress

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.990
and then I kept it under
the mattress and then

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:06.840
when my mother died I took
care of her many years

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:12.860
and she died she was 90 1/2.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:17.430
It's only when I think
about it if I am 80

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:23.850
so another 10 1/2 years
it's very near.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.630
I really can't accept it.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:35.040
Really it's not, well, she
finds some moments and she died.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:42.030
And I had to arrange her apartment
after she died and whoever had

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:48.500
to do it in his life I must tell
you this is one of the worst things

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.920
that can happen to a person.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.380
You come to the place
of your childhood

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:59.490
and you find there yourself
and I found all kinds

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:05.770
of presents I gave my mother
and she even didn't open them.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:11.490
She said, oh, Elonka, you waste
your money and when you come

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:15.600
to [inaudible] the merchandise
you feel like clapping his hands

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.780
and saying, oh, this
is such an easy prey

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:25.540
and you pay 10 times
more, which is right.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:34.780
I cannot argue or I go away, but
I didn't argue about the price.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:45.810 position:56%
And then among other things I
found, I found a shoe box, you know.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:55.270
Usually it's very suitable to have,
to take a photograph and I looked

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:05.450
through those photographs and they
were not survive the war with us.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:09.020
They were my aunt here,
not here, there in Israel

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:17.250
and my aunt she was the
only person that survived

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:21.810
because she came to
Israel in the 30s.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:27.490 position:56%
And she had those photographs of the
members of the family and they look

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:33.130
at those pictures and they feel so
guilty because I really didn't want

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:39.720
to hear about those histories
that my mother used to tell

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.120
because I always felt
so guilty about it.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.190
It happens that when someone
survives some horrible,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:43:00.700
horrible situation and so he feel
guilty that fate is ruling his life

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:08.190
but why me, why I am one of so few
children that survive the ghetto

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:15.620
in Lvov and why this woman didn't
just abandon me somewhere no one

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.710
will ever know.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:24.890
So, I didn't like to talk,
to hear it and I didn't,

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:33.590
but still I realized that I'm the
last person in the world that can,

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:40.110
that knows some of the names
of those people and then I felt

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:46.850
like maybe I have to
somehow to tell the story

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:55.290
because it was never a secret that
I was during the war in Poland.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:44:00.400
Israel to be a new
immigrant from Poland it's not

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.610
such a big honor especially
to be a Polish mother

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:10.270
or a Polish woman it's
not, it is not a big honor.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.430 position:56%
Really I don't know why because I am

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.600
such a nice person
so I don't know why.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:24.180
And then I decided when I started,
when I grew up and then I was

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:31.350
in the Army [phonetic], of
course, I was very important.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:36.130 position:56%
I was in the Air Force intelligence.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.290
I must tell you I was a surgeon.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:43.030
I must confess that I
still know some secrets

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:47.520
that I will never,
ever, ever tell you.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:56.370
And after I was married very young
and then I had Ari and, you know,

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:02.820
immediately the thing will change
your life for the rest of it is

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.820
when you become a parent.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.960
So, and I started to
work, of course,

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:15.830
and just didn't have time
to deal with this past.

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:17.170
I didn't want to.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.940
I run away from it.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.360
And the other thing was that
they didn't want my children

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.270
to be second generation
of Holocaust survivor.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:33.610
I wanted them just to adore me

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:41.280
because I am a really an excellent
mother and the best mother

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.090
in the world and not because
they pity me that I had

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.870
such a horrible childhood.

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:55.220
My other son, Ari, is a composer,
musician, my other son, Michael,

00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:05.140
is in Israel so he's a psychologist
and once I asked him, Michael,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:10.540
isn't it true that I
was the perfect mother?

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.240
[Laughter] If he's a
psychologist it also say something

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.210
about his mother, yeah?

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:21.680
[Laughter] So, he was
thinking such a serious,

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:27.920
wonderful person and
he said, no, no, no.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.890
I was so offended.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.190
What do you mean?

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.540
I am an angel?

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.890
And then he said but I wouldn't
change you in the world.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:49.040
So we are now okay and that, well,
you can be [inaudible] your mother.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:59.890
So, then my children were
already grow up and not

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:05.020
at all home now I want to tell
you how it came that I started

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:10.450
to have this courage
to write this book

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:16.870
and I was already very established
as a writer for children very known

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:27.770
at home and abroad and so
on and then my mother died

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:34.070 position:56%
and then my husband, the father of
my children, was ill and I took care

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:40.850
of him at home and I just
transferred him on my arms

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:47.260
to the other world, and I
was left alone with the cat

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:53.330
and the gold fish, the name of
the cat is Soromoro [phonetic]

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:57.270
and the name of the
gold fish is Alexander.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.990
And well, it's not one gold fish

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:04.740
because usually they have
[inaudible] once in a while.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:10.070
So, in our little garden I have
like kind of little mausoleum

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.230
for all those Alexanders,
Alexander the 1st and the 2nd

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:20.780
and now it's the 6th already,
but they are very nice pets.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.140
First of all they are quiet, yeah?

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.550
Which is not bad.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:30.590
And then they are very clean
also, which is not also so bad.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:40.040
But then I was left alone at
home and I started to think

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:48.470
that maybe I will [inaudible]
I had this obligation to write

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:56.210
about this history of me
during the war and our family.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:49:01.350
And I was sitting and
I don't enjoy writing,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:07.780
only [inaudible] enjoy
writing, but I had just

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.080
like promised myself
that I would try.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.130 position:56%
First I wrote, if you are interested
you will find it in the book,

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:23.220
first I wrote like a letter
to myself being a little girl

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:30.030 position:56%
and promising this little girl
because I just feel this little girl

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:35.030
in myself, you know, it's
this childhood everyone

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.760
that feels this childhood
inside his soul.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:45.230
So my friend, [inaudible],
she's a poet in Israel,

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:51.800 position:56%
she said that the childhood is like
an island in the middle of your life

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:56.390
and there are people that
have like a little boat

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:00.860
that they can visit their childhood

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.860
and those people do
not become bankers

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.430
or politicians, excuse
me, and martians.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:17.260
They become teachers and doctors
and artists because they feel

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.240
that it is not easy to be a child.

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.890
Really it's very difficult
to be a child.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:29.150
First of all you are short and
you do not have a credit card

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.460
and everyone is telling
you what to do.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:37.630
So I have this ability to
visit myself as a child.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:44.860
So first of all this letter to
myself promising this little girl,

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.930
promising I will never,
ever abandon you ever

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:53.360
because we will die together.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:51:01.540
So it's this, you know, huge
question what is better to die

00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:08.590
in the arms of a loving mother or
that your loving mother is trying

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:14.680
to somehow save you
like my mother did?

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:18.300
It's a big question I don't know.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:25.110 position:56%
So, well, I can tell you many things
but we do not have enough time.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:31.310
So I just tell you that I
wrote this book and it became,

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:38.420
it get the bigger prize
for literature in Israel.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:41.240
I was so surprised.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:46.060
It's the [inaudible]
prize and it was very nice

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:51.220
because all the prizes I get
[inaudible] this piece of paper

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:56.980
and here all of a sudden
it was also some money,

00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:01.140
not that the government didn't
took the taxes, of course,

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.460
which is really very nasty,
but then you could buy a car

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.560
and it wasn't so bad.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:15.910
So, and this book I was
really surprised that people,

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.810
it got the prize not because
about what it's written

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.860
but the way it, the
literature prize.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:29.190
And after the first book
I had this really courage

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:33.460
to write the second one
which is called [inaudible],

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:39.120
which means a teenager and this
one is about me coming to Israel

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:45.370
as a new immigrant from Poland
and it was horrible, very,

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.410
very difficult I must tell you.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:52.150
I hope that it will also
be translated to English.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:56.260
And the third one is called Ishiar
[phonetic], which means a woman,

00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:02.150 position:56%
and some stories of being a
witness to things in life as a woman

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:11.120
and now I am playing with hope that
maybe I will have enough courage

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.360
and patience to write
the fourth one,

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:20.740
and I want, I have a name already.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:26.570
So I would call it matrona
[phonetic] which is, you know,

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:34.140
the Roman old lady's, old lady's
matron you must know this word.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.010
So I, maybe.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.040
I don't know.

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.940 position:56%
So, now, well there are some things,
of course, that I can tell you

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:49.500
but if you're interested in reading
the book or just look at my site

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.840
on the Internet there are
many interviews with me

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.530
that you can hear some more things.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:54:08.010
And now we, and now maybe some of
you have some questions about, ah,

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:17.300
yeah, this man is my partner and
is all the time criticizing me.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.160
[Laughter] But, okay, so here
when we were, after the war

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:32.660
and we were saved by the Red Army,
I know that in America you used

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:40.160
to think that the Americans
won the war, but it is not true

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.520
because after Stalingrad
if you know about it,

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.530
it was after the Russians
were going to win the war

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.780
and then the Americans joined.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:55.810
And I remember my father all the
time they were why it's not a

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:57.110
second front?

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:58.880
Why not second front?

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:05.430
So when we were after
the war it became,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.780
my mother was very
ill with tuberculosis.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.500
She almost died.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:19.960
And my father broke an arm because
we couldn't work and I was brought

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.880
to some orphanage because
the war was going on.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.960
It was on the east when
we were, when we were

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.000
and Poland to Berlin and to Berlin.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:41.280
So I was in this orphanage
which was also hell,

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.280
but no one helped me
and it was enough food.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:54.960 position:56%
So, somehow my mother succeed not to
die because it was a mortal illness

00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:04.250
if you know about, well, know
antibiotics and it's terrible

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:13.670
and then we went back to this birth
town Krakow, the beautiful Krakow,

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:19.770
which is this ridiculous hat
my mother is wearing of me

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:24.180
with this [inaudible] which became
horrible for me because people

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:29.090
from America after the war
they felt very guilty about all

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:36.690
of us survivors so few of
all the tens of thousands

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:39.080
of people that were murdered.

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:45.550
And they sent some packages
from America and you are America

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:49.150
so all kind of stupid
clothes and so one.

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:56.360
In one of the packages, it was this
stupid hat that when I wear it,

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:02.520
it always go up with this
stupid pom pom and to hold it

00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.950
on my head I used to do like this.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:12.440
And this [inaudible] stayed with
me with the head, without the head.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.080
Some kind of a [inaudible]
but it stopped now.

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:21.850
And, well, but we had
to leave Poland

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.760 position:56%
because of some threats anti-Semitic

00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:28.640
and the only place we
could go was Israel.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:35.090 position:56%
My father didn't like the politics
of Israel and [inaudible] and so on.

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:36.390
He was a Communist.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:43.590
He was like many good people he
believed that this is an idea

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:48.210
that would save the
world and also the Jews.

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:55.730
So, but we went to Israel
and here is some [inaudible]

00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:04.760
on this horrible, terrible ship
Galea [phonetic] that we came

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:13.320
to Israel and it was
31 of December 1949.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:22.270
And then next morning in
Tel Aviv it was snowing.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.980
Never before and never after.

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.340
People went crazy.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:33.260 position:56%
And I was thinking, oh, wow, why did
they make such a fuss a little snow?

00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:42.190
And another part became like
being somehow, you know,

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:48.150
Hebrew and it was very hard
for new immigrants in Israel.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:52.390
Now to be a new immigrant in
Israel is horrible, difficult,

00:58:52.390 --> 00:59:02.460
so this is the second book I write
about it and so we have [inaudible]

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:07.500
but you have some questions?

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:12.010
Maybe they have some questions?

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:14.550
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: We have
time for 2 short questions.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.510
Yes, hi?

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:24.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.980
The question is did you have
a hand in the translation

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.890
when Girl was being translated?

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.190
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: To
English you mean?

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:36.710
Because it's also in Polish.

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:42.410
No. No. Because I didn't
have [speaking Hebrew]?

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:43.710
&gt;&gt; Patience.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:45.310
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Yeah, but it was,

00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:52.530
it turned out to be a
wonderful translation

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:57.080
and to Polish I have also
wonderful translator.

00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:03.800 position:56%
I asked Amos Oz about who
translate his book about Love and --

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.140
&gt;&gt; -- Love and Darkness.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.440
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Yes.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:15.300
So he recommended some young man
that was a priest and he fell

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:20.140
in love with Hebrew and he stopped
to be a priest and he started

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:26.940
to be one of the most wonderful
translators from Hebrew to Polish.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:33.780
So he also translated my
book Girl wonderfully,

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.130
but I didn't check
it because, well, I,

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.950
like I always have
something to do next.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:48.660
So and I am a little
lazy also I think.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.510
I trust them.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:01:03.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.840
Yeah, she was wonderful.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.160
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.300
Yeah. Yes, please?

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:13.600
&gt;&gt; Who me?

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.400
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Yeah.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:22.900
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.500
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: The
question was how old were you

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.770
when you drew these pictures
from the hiding place?

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:29.070
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Yeah.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:38.730
So, it was like in '43
and I was born in '37.

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:43.640
So, yeah. Yes?

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:55.870
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.070
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: The question
was can you say a few words

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:02.580
of what inspired you to be a
children's illustrator and author.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.850
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Well, this
is the only thing I can do

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:09.450
and get paid for.

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:12.910
[Laughter] I am kind of
dyslexic or something.

01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:17.090
I write with mistakes, I do
not know the [speaking Hebrew]?

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.470
&gt;&gt; Multiplication.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:26.860
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Multiplication
and I really don't care.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:32.540
[Laughter] And this was the only
thing and then the major, my love

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:38.780
and I think what saved really
my life were books and art.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:45.520
Those are the things that
really there was to live for.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.190
And the books saved my life.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:53.440
I remember some years
not what happened around

01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.200
but that I read Dickens or
Gargoyle [phonetic] or, you know,

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.920
so those 2 things the love for
books and the love for arts,

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.400
and I have a little talent also

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:13.810
and most important
thing I have been lucky.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:17.380
It's very important
it's hard to realize

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.590
that sometimes life is
like, that you are lucky.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:30.050
That this woman didn't abandon me,
that somehow people liked what I,

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:34.230
my work, which is also
I know so many people

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:40.290
in this world enormously talented
but they didn't have the something

01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:48.750
that is really mysterious and
it's very hard to accept the fact

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:53.800
that luck is also,
you know, important.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.710
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: One more question.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: This lady, please?

01:03:57.010 --> 01:04:01.810
&gt;&gt; I was wondering I've been
reading about Oskar Schindler.

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:08.720
I was wondering if you or
your family knew [inaudible]?

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:12.020
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: The
question was does anybody,

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.710
does Alona know anything
that worked with Schindler

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.200
or anybody that he saved?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.010
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Not at all, not
at all, but you can really realize

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:28.680
that I am this little
girl in the red coat,

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.390
but I survived and she didn't.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:36.120
And, well, it's unbelievable.

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.910
I must tell you I like
to talk about it.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:50.220
I didn't think that it really, I
somehow found, find the way to go

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.100
around it and not to ruin my life.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:01.000 position:56%
Maybe because I was always so amazed
by the wonders of nature and maybe

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.710 position:56%
because in this place in the village
I remember I was the [inaudible]

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:10.920
geese, very stupid, embarrassing
I must tell you, and I took care

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.070
of the horse and I looked at all
the flowers and the [inaudible]

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:19.790
and everything and my best
friends were the pigs, you know,

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.080
because I was such a little girl.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.540
So I used to crawl into
their [speaking Hebrew].

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.580
&gt;&gt; Pigsty.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.720
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Pigsty, yeah,
and I made for myself some dolls

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:40.980
of apple and corn, from the corn
hair, and they ate those dolls,

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.980
but still they are very
intelligent, lovely animals.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:49.680
Not so [inaudible] but very,
very nice and they are not dirty.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.890
They must have moisture
on their skin

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:56.850
so if you give them [inaudible],
they will bathe in [inaudible],

01:05:56.850 --> 01:06:00.190
of course, but they
didn't have they have mud

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:04.730
and I like them very much really.

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:07.510
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Thank
you, Alona, very much.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:11.280
[ Applause ]

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.760
You are really to be admired.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.690
And we love you.

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:16.190
Thank you for coming.

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:17.490
&gt;&gt; Alona Frankel: Thank you all.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:22.690
And you must understand that for
me it's all strange to be here.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:29.600
The other day I also had some
talk in Harvard University,

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.700
and I do not have any [inaudible]
any certificate of anything

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.160
because I really didn't
study anything.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.220
It doesn't mean that I do not
know anything, but so I was there

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:48.740
in this front yard of Harvard,
and I was thinking, wow,

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:55.210
2 big gentlemen will come and take
me on a jet and say Mrs. Frankel,

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.830
you do not have any
certificate or anything.

01:06:58.830 --> 01:07:03.180
You can't stand on this
Holy ground of Harvard.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:08.990
[Laughter] Please go out like
in the last scene in the trial

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:12.240
of [inaudible] you remember.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.470 position:56%
And I was there, I was talking to
people, they looked quite interested

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:22.580
and here I am it's like the temple
of the knowledge of the world

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:29.550
and you sit and you listen
to me and it's all nice.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:36.360
This little girl, you know, all
this way so life is surprising,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:43.720
and I would like it to continue and
let us all be healthy and happy,

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.790
okay, for the rest of [inaudible].

01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.500
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Thank you.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.910
