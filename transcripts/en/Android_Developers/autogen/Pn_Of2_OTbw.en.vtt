00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.470
 Edward Andrew: Le Monde is one of the most important French newspapers 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.864
 And has always been keen to be the best publishing institution 

00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:15.610
 Online news in France. 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.970
 Has always represented the challenge we face 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.120
 Be able to put the best of the press 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.450
 On the reader machine and tap 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.890
 Of this technology to reach as many as possible 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.090
 Of people. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.790
 After we learned that a lot of our readers 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.380
 Consider reading Le Monde as complete 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.180
 It takes a lot of time 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.700
 We started thinking about issuing a daily newspaper 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.160
 Be a digital newspaper with distinction 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.459
 La Matinale was a newspaper. 

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:38.875
 Asin Amro: We wanted to go through La Matinale 

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.050
 Test some new things 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.476
 And change the way we work [inaudible]. 

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:46.016
 Le Monde is an evening newspaper 

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.400
 But we wanted through La Matinale 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.310
 To publish morning news 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.071
 Exclusive on mobile devices. 

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:53.350
 We developed the idea of ​​La Matinale 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 After we analyzed user feedback on the main Le Monde application. 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 We discovered two problems: 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.410
 First in price 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.990
 The second to allocate a lot of time to read. 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.310
 Through La Matinale, we managed to solve these problems 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.330
 By cutting the price of the service and publishing only 20 articles a day. 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.060
 Android is a platform for La Matinale application. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.550
 Since the launch of La Matinale, Android has been launched 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.460
 The main source of newspaper downloads. 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.550
 We also noticed an increase in subscribers' remittances 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.100
 6% on Android compared to other operating systems. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.270
 We believe the billing system is on Google Play 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.080
 Contributed a lot to increasing subscriber transfer rates 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.250
 To apply La Matinale as we believe the reason for it 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.573
 Is to provide a better user experience 

00:01:37.573 --> 00:01:40.386
 Compare with the main Le Monde application. 

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:42.440
 Thanks to the Google Play billing system 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.240
 The user does not need to fill a lot of models. 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.650
 Just click a button 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.000
 To subscribe to La Matinale. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.098
 Subscriber transfers on La Matinale 

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:55.050
 14 times higher than the main Le Monde application. 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.850
 Hence we realize that the application of La Matinale 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.544
 Offers a great experience for the reader. 

00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:01.960
 Edward Andrew: The application was La Matinale 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.659
 The first product we apply 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.492
 Google Play billing system. 

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:05.930
 It was very simple. 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.250
 Application developers took only one week 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.110
 And when we discovered the success of the experiment 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.725
 We decided to circulate it to our main application. 

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:14.350
 Asin Amro: We really wanted to get back 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.770
 Direct readers of the main Le Monde application 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.480
 We thought the best way to promote La Matinale 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.090
 Are across the main Le Monde application. 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.488
 We placed an ad on the home screen between 7:00 and 9:00 

00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:30.540
 To promote the day edition of La Matinale 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.176
 With the newspaper logo and the title of which edition 

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.401
 Includes the headlines of today's edition. 

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.806
 In terms of interaction, he was able to apply La Matinale 

00:02:37.806 --> 00:02:42.135
 Achieve great success with multiple Android user visits. 

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:46.180
 Operating per user is 3.5 times greater 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.638
 Compared to other operating systems. 

00:02:47.638 --> 00:02:50.241
 That is another standard that proves 

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:52.920
 How successful La Matinale is in terms of interaction. 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.461
 Edward Andrew: We think we are now 

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:57.546
 Need awareness on the application of La Matinale 

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:01.670
 To get to know more people about its importance 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.370
 How to submit a few minutes every morning 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.470
 An overview of the news. 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.920
