00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.630
Woven from manila sisal or flax fibers traditional ropes are a binding element in our world

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.369
the process starts with racks of natural fiber yarns

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.669
The yarns are funneled through separators which configure them to twist evenly together

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.809
The fibers then travel through tubes that squeeze them into bundles

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.869
Workers tie the ends of the bundles onto a wheeled vehicle called the forming machine

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.149
They roll the machine back until there's no slack in the bundles

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.619
The machine is then sent to the opposite end of the factory over 1,000 feet away

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.920
as

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.430
The machine travels backwards its gears turn hooks twisting the yarns into a tight configuration

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:04.199
The formation of the twists ensure an even distribution of tension. This is what makes roads so strong

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.640
This long indoor space is called a rope walk there aren't many of them left in the world

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.989
When the machine reaches the back wall, it stops and workers cut both ends of the strands

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.399
They tie them to post to maintain tension and prevent unraveling

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.500
On one side they tie three of the strands to a machine that will transform them into a rope

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.868
Halfway down they bring in a cart that holds a piece of grooved wood known as a top

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.508
They tuck the twisted strands into the grooves of the top

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.089
They then roll the cart down to face the rope making machine a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.949
Worker ties rope around the strands on the top

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
This holds them in place as the rope making machine twists the three strands into one

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.259
The Rope machine with twisting hooks remains in the same place

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.150
When the cart arrives at the opposite side of the building the rope is formed a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.059
Worker removes the ties around the top they now have a piece of rope

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.780
That's over 700 feet long and almost 5 inches in diameter
