&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.240
&gt;&gt; Joel Achenback: I have-- this
is actually a real treat for me

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.920 position:56%
to be able to introduce Janna Levin
who's written just a beautiful book,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.550
fascinating book called
"Black Hole Blues

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.900
and Other Songs from Outer Space".

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.170
Janna Levin is a Professor
of Physics

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.820 position:56%
and Astronomy Barnard College of
Columbia University, she has her PhD

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.800
in Physics from MIT, she has
written a couple other books

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.590
"How the Universe Got Its Spots",
and she wrote a book called,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.710
"A Madman Dreams of
Turing Machines".

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.960
This book, I know probably
many of you in this room heard

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.020
about the whole LIGO
experiment earlier this year the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.440
gravitational waves.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.440
How here knows about that?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.950
Good. OK, so we've got some
nerds here, some geeks.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.280
So, a hundred years
ago Einstein predicted

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.530
that the universe would resonate
with these gravitational waves

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.090
as space itself kind of rippled

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.320
from the collision of
super dense objects.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.470 position:56%
And for a hundred years people try
to figure out how do we detect this?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.040
It's an amazing story.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.400
Now, if Einstein were here today
he probably would say, you know,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.250
I was right, you know,
he didn't need

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.020
to check it, I mean, I got this.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.320
You know what I mean?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.060
I got it, really, I'm sure, right?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.600
But experimentalist wanted
to check it out and--

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.880
so back in earlier this year
there was this big announcement

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.050
down at the National Press Club

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.670
where they had detected
these gravitational waves

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.860
with this experiment called LIGO

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.630
which is actually two enormous
experimental detectors,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.840
one in Louisiana and one in
Washington State that were set

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.650
up with incredible precision to
measure the very tiniest change

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.670
in space itself as a gravitational
wave pass through the earth.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.590
And they've been working on
this for 40 years and as--

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.430
I'm a reporter for the Post, I'm a
science reporter so I went there,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.140
we wrote about it,
it was a big deal.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.740
And there were some
legendary physicists there,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.360
Ray Wise was there,
Kip Thorne was there

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.330
and we threw it at our stories.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.340
Well now, Janna Levin comes along

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.140
and gives us the real
story, the back story.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.850
And it's beautifully written.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.910
It's told me all kinds of stuff I
wish I had known earlier this year

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.970 position:56%
when I covered it for the newspaper.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.270
I'm, you know, I told
Janna I'm very resentful

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.120
when a scientist writes so well.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.410
I mean, why am I-- why do I
exist if-- you know, I mean, we--

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.890
if you're a journalist write
about science you count

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.330
on scientist being utterly
incomprehensible, right?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.970
You know, and then you
translate it, you know,

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.020
it's like what she means
to say is, you know?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.140
But this book is so well
written and-- so please welcome,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.510
give a warm welcome
to Dr. Janna Levin.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.320
[ Applause ]

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.610
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: I wasn't going

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.000
to stand behind the podium
because I'm so little.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.430
Hold on I'm going to try
to do this, with the mike.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.600
Well that was basically
my entire talk,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.370
so what do you guys
want to talk about now?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.410
Thank you so much for coming out.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.700
I'm really honored
everyone came out.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.020
I'm here at Book Festivals
as a fan as much as an author

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.140 position:56%
so it's just an absolute bonus to
see everyone out here for this talk.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.800
I know some of you raised
your hands when asked

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.620
if you had heard of
the LIGO experiment.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.080
So on February 11th of this
year an obscure experiment

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.120
that almost nobody had ever heard
of announced what has been touted

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.170
as the scientific discovery
of the century.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.860
It was an early morning
press conference

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.300
and people were listening all
over the world and as soon

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.820
as the press conference started the
New York Times, I was sitting next

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.750
to Dennis Overbye from the New
York Times pressed, you know,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.930
submit on his article and all
of these articles went straight

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.890
to the front page of all the
papers it was for 24 hours it was

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.480
like the whole world stood
together and stopped and listening.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.180
I was on Al Jazeera TV that night
and I'm looking down the barrel

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.650
of this sort of-- I'm in a tiny
box talking to somebody in Qatar,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.230
I don't know where and, you
know, and there's this moment

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.070
where they're looking at
me and I'm looking at them.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.000
And they're saying, they're about
to ask me what does this mean

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.370
for humanity and then they're
like, I'm sorry to interrupt you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.270
but we have to turn
to the war in Syria.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.910
So, that was like, a second where
everyone paused for something other

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.210
than or kind of earthly concerns.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.010
And yet after about
10 minutes I felt

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.480
like people weren't sure what
exactly it was all about, right?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.660
How many people after they heard
the announcement felt an hour later

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.790
that they didn't really understand
what the hell it was all about?

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.330
Oh come on there's
more of you than that.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.360
I don't believe that for a second.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.930
It's a very difficult result.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.530
It's something we've never done
before in the history of humanity.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.520
When LIGO, this experiment,
which again no one had ever heard

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.380
of came online and
made the discovery.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.290
What you don't know or maybe some
of you know but I'm assuming many

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.120
down is that was a 50 year arguist
[phonetic] claiming of a kind

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.430
of scientific Mount Everest

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.320
that people gave their
careers over to this campaign.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.630
It cost nearly a billion dollars.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.430
It consisted of two absolutely
colossal machines, one in Louisiana

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.510
and one in Washington State,
each one spanning 4 kilometers.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.660
And they had failed in their
initial generation, I mean,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.360
failed is maybe too strong.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.160
The initial generation machine was
built in 2000 and heard nothing.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.830
What LIGO did was not take
a picture of this guide.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.570
These are not telescopes,
these are recording devices.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.630
It recorded literally the
shape of space-time ringing

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.950
from two black holes, 1.3
billion years ago colliding.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.910
And what I'd like to do more or
less for the rest of my half hour

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.090
or so is pick a part what
discovery meant and what happened

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.940
and why it's so significant.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.090
So let's see if our
technology is working.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.690
I'm going to play for
you the recording.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.400
And this is, you know, we're jut
going to listen to it for a second

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.300
and then we're going to spend
the rest of the time trying

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.750
to understand how this is possible.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.220
So LIGO Hanford, the
instrument-- Oh, that's loud.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.680
And that's LIGO Livingston
in Louisiana.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.100 position:56%
And, so what the hell is that about?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.760
I mean, what does that even mean?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.060
What does that even mean?

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.050
How many of you are like sci-fi
fans who know that there's no

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.080
such thing as sound in empty space?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.760 position:56%
You know if you watch a sci-fi
movie and you see somebody screaming

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.370
in the vacuum you're going
to be totally annoyed, right?

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.750
There's no sound in empty space.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.010
How can this possibly be sound?

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.310
And I'm going to argue to you

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.180 position:56%
that this was literally something we
could hear but it's incredibly quiet

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.650
by the time it gets to the earth.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.170
So let's do a little picking a part

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.030
of what this discovery
was actually about.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.710
This is a view of our
Milky Way galaxy taken

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.710
from the European Southern
Observatory in Chile.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:55.010
It's this dry barren bit of
brittle earth and that's perfect

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.640
for astronomical viewing.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.630
The skies are dry it
means there's not a lot

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.680
of interference you
can just look out.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.910
This is taken just
with a digital camera.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.550
If you can imagine holding
your eyes open long enough,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.850
you could see this.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.010
The Milky Way is this
spectacular rift on the sky.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.370
And if you think about where
we really are in the galaxy,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.250
we live in the galactic suburbs.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.110
New Yorkers are always
terribly offended by that fact.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.740
They really resent that, but we do.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.360 position:56%
We live safely outside the center of
the galaxy in the galactic suburbs

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.910
and this is the view from
our sky, the Milky Way.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.700
The reason it looks like it does
is because we live inside it.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.240
OK, we can't look at
it from the outside.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.980
There is our star it's a pretty
average star, it's a yellow star.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.070
And as we all know
we're the third rock

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.320
from the sun there's a
hundred billion stars

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.720
in the Milky Way galaxy
and there's probably tens

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.690
at least billions of
planets like ours.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.240 position:56%
But, you know, we've never gone
anywhere and we've been to the moon.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.260
So this thing about
putting a flag in the moon,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.330
that's real that's not
a conspiracy theory.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.330
We have been to the moon.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.440
But our biggest aspiration
right now is just to go to Mars,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.230
it's our galactic, you know,
it's our solar neighborhood.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.430
We've barely gone to anywhere.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.590
And so if you think
of being so confined

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:23.670
to this tiny region outside our
rocky planet the galaxy itself,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.270
the center of the galaxy
is 26,000 light years away.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.250
The whole galaxy is a hundred
thousand or so light years across

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.860
and we've only gone
to the moon, you know,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.770
which is seconds away
in terms of light speed.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.290
And so here we are confined to
this little solar neighborhood

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.940
and almost everything we know

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.180
about the universe is
brought to us by light.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.080
We wait patiently,
we build telescopes

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.730
and we take pictures of the sky.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.390
This is not a cartoon.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:03.340
This is an actual map of all the
galaxies we've ever discovered

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.070
in the universe, the
observable universe.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.840
There are as many galaxies
in the sky

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.860
as there are stars
in our own milky way.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.990
So there are hundreds of billion
of galaxies, everything you see

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.030
in this map is an entire galaxy.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.160
And we collect this sort of map of
the universe by taking pictures.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.540
You know, ever since Galileo
pointed a telescope at the sky,

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.690
we've made this kind
of silent movie, right,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.830
of these collected snapshots
that date back 14 billion years

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.350
and stretched over 90
billion light years across.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.870
It's really an incredibly
extraordinary image,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.870
yet all of that stuff, all of it
in the entire observable universe,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.590
everything we have ever seen
including everything we see

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.970
on this earth, everything
on this room,

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.630
everything out in the farthest
reaches of space make up less

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.720
than 5% of what exist
in the universe.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:08.010
More than 95% of the
universe is in dark stuff,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.420
stuff that can't be seen,
dark matter or dark energy

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.520
and it will never come
to us through light.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:20.790
And that's really quite a
stunning realization to understand

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.300
that as vast and spectacular
the universe looks to us

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.440
in pictures it's a very modest
fraction of what's out there.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.690
My favorite terrain of the entire
cosmos is the dark, darkness,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.360
you know, the vast
emptiness of space-time,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.610
the darkest parts of the universe.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.790
This is a portrait of a black hole.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.250
I'm proud to say I did that myself.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.070
A black hole, you know,
black holes are out there.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.830
We see them indirectly because
they destroy their neighboring

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.510
environment but there's many, many
black holes that we don't see.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.070
There's probably a billion
black holes in our own galaxy

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.780
and we only see a handful.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.580
The center of our galaxy has a
black hole 4 million times the mass

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.390
of the sun and we only know
it's there because of the orbits

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.740
of the stars and the inner system.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.120
It's completely dark.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.940 position:56%
This is what a black hole would look
like if we could see it up close,

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.370
there's some evil civilization
figured out how

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.260
to collapse a sun to a black hole.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.030
It would collapse down
to 6 kilometers across.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.040
Isn't that spectacular, the entire
mass of the sun in 6 kilometers.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.020
I know all my references
are New York based

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.320
but you're going to
have to forgive me.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.910
That would fit in Manhattan.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.780
You could fit that
black hole in Manhattan

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.720
but then it would destroy the earth
so that wouldn't be a good idea

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.270
but this is also an illustration
that black holes have this kind

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.460
of horrible reputation as
engines of terrible destruction

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:56.520 position:56%
but actually you'd be perfectly safe
in orbit around a black hole sun.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.260
Isn't that like a song?

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.730
Is that Soundgarden?

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.760
You'd be perfectly safe in your
orbit around a black hole sun.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.290
There's nothing wrong with your
orbit it's exactly the same.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.650
In fact, as the suns pull
on gravitational pull.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.900
The only problem is it would be
apocalyptically cold and dark

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.550
and that would be really
unfortunate but.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.460
In this computer model which
was made by Andrew Hamilton

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.210
from Colorado, the little earth
model was kind of self-illuminated.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.770
But that black hole
is only 6 kilometers

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.520
across so that's a tiny
little pseudo earth satellite.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.820
Oh, sorry.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.770
Did I do something bad?

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:38.370
I did something bad.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.460
I'm back. Thanks.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.380
But the important thing
to notice about this is

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.220
that what the black hole really
does even though it's dark

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.730
and we can't see it is it creates
curvatures in space-time itself

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.560 position:56%
and that means that even light bends
when it travels around a black hole.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.100
So notice that while this earth
passes behind this black hole sun

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.500
you can still see it.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.950
You can still see it because the
light gets lands back at you.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.090
We've never seen anything
like this in reality.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.120
We can't see black holes like this.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.680
There is an experiment to try
to measure the dark shadow

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.590
of a black hole in the
center of our galaxy.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.480
It's 4 million times the mass
the sun but it fits in a handful

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.140
of sun widths which is
crazy, crazy density of mass

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.180
but it's 26,000 light years
away and there's an experiment

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.810
that uses essentially all of
the telescopes on the earth

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.620
to try to resolve the shadow.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.160
It's equivalent to trying to
resolve a quarter on the moon.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.580
And I really believe this will be
successful in the next year or so.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.730
I think you're going to be
seeing the first actual pictures

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.160
of a black hole that we've
every seen in the history

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.380
of humanity in the next year or so.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.630
If there was a black hole
between us and the Milky Way,

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.850
what we just saw this great rift
of the Milky Way and we were to try

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.270
to fall into it you're
an astronaut orbiting

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.400
around it this is what
you might see.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.580 position:56%
The spectacular thing about black
holes is that there's nothing there.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.680
And people think black holes are
these dense crushes of matter

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.080
but there's actually
nothing there at all.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.460
If you fall across the shadow
of a black hole it's empty.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.810
It's empty space-time.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.510
Maybe you guys can ask me questions
about that later if you want.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.020
But also, the other myth
about the black hole is

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.320
that they're completely dark.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.340
Black holes are dark from the
outside but not on the inside.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.350
If you were to fall into a
black hole you'd have a full,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.740
I don't know, microsecond
of bright light falling

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740
in behind you from
the entire galaxy.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.530
It would be like you saw the
evolution and the history

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.400
of the entire galaxy
falling in behind you

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.250
and you could get this
bright flash of light.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.720
These are again computer
models and not cartoons.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.120
So as you fall towards the center
of the black hole, all that light

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.540
from the galaxy that falls
behind you becomes concentrated

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.750
into this bright flash of light.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.950
I used to jokingly call it a
near-death experience, you know,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.760
when you see the light at the
end of the tunnel only it's

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.850
like a total death experience
because you get crushed to death

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.400
in the center of the black hole.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.780
We don't really know what
happens in the center.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.680
That's still a mystery because
all the material that fall

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.500
into a black hole get blown
out into another universe,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.430
is there another big bag
inside the black hole.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:34.170 position:56%
Is the black hole much bigger on the
inside than it is on the outside?

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.250
Is it as big as a universe
on the inside?

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.510
These are thing we don't
actually know the answer to

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.510
but are all conceivable
possibilities.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.250
You know, Dr. Who TARDIS, you walk
inside and it's huge on the inside,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.550
that's like the black hole.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.620
It's 6 kilometers across
on the outside

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.140
but it's an entire
universe on the inside.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.930
It's not an experiment I
recommend anyone tries.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:00.730
OK, so here we are coming up to
this great event that happened.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.410
When Einstein theorized
about all of these things,

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.010
the curvature of space-time

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.000
and his most famous accomplishment
the general theory of relativity,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.840
it's like 1915 he finally writes

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.820
down the correct mathematical
expression

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.940
for his theory of general
relativity.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.720
And the first thing he
turns to is the question

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.980
of what he calls gravitational
waves.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.340
He says if an object can curve
space and time around it then

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.390
when the object moves surely
those curves have to move with it.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.690
And he imagined they
would create waves,

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.150
waves literally in
the shave of space.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:46.400
If you were floating nearby a black
hole and it moved, you would have

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.990
to sort of bob on the wave
communicating to you just

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:56.810
like fish swirling in a pound
that this object had moved.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:58.990
And he labored over this for years.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.320
This was 1915, 1916.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.870
In 1930s when he was asked, are
these gravitational waves real?

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.010
Einstein said, I don't know,
you know, I really don't know.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.650
He would write a paper
saying they do not exist.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.760
It would be accepted
for publication.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.940
Between acceptance and
publication he would sneak

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.710 position:56%
in a completely different paper that
said that they do exist, you know.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.780
And then people say,
Einstein you've got

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.410
to be very careful your famous name
is going to be on these papers.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.190
And he would say, my
name is on a lot

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.740
of wrong papers just
don't worry about it.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.590
It's not his concern.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.300
But this debate went
on into the '70s.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:42.610
But I'm going to show you very
sophisticated current model

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.110
of what happens as two
black holes collide,

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.610
this is again a computer model.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.480
And what it's really showing you is
those natural curves and space-time

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.860
around the objects and as
they orbit it makes a wave

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.230
and then they collide and
form a new black hole.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.590
That's the current thinking and
that flattens out space-time

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.230
and eventually that
black hole goes quiet.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.940
Now, what does this
have to do with sound?

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.240
Oops, sorry.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.540
That was abrupt.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.750
What does this have
to do with sound?

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:17.430
The argument is if you were
floating nearby those black holes,

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.920
you would literally hear them
even in the absence of air,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.020
even in vacuum because the
space-time changing would squeeze

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.690
and stretch you as it passed.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.080
And because your eardrum is
built to resonate and response

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.140
to being squeezed and stretched,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.340
you would literally
technically hear the waves even

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.730
in the absence of air.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.940
It happens that the two black holes
that collided that were detected

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.880
in September ring in the
human auditory range.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.640
It's just a ridiculous
coincidence that it's literally

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.250
in the human auditory range.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:20:01.140
This is a model from my group,
where we show in yellow the orbit

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.050
of one black hole, in
red the orbit of another,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.650
this is just a theoretical
prediction, and simultaneously play

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.010
for you what you would hear

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.050
if you were floating
dangerously close to those.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:17.020
It might be a little loud
because it's going to get louder.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.210
Notice you can hear
details of the orbits.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.260
It's like mallets on
a drum banging a drum.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.590
You can reconstruct the size
and the motion of the mallets

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.140
by listening to the sound.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.980
Black hole orbits can
be very complicated.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:39.720
Notice how it gets quiet, and
loud, then it get quiet again.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.680
These are things that allow us to
reconstruct the size and motion

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.980
of the mallets by listening.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.680
That little chirp at the end is
really goofy, everyone laughs

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.200
at that because everyone
thinks black holes are going

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.110
to sound way more butch
that they actually do.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.410
They sort of have this like sort

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.690
of little feminine
chirp at the end there.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.830
But that chirp is an
extremely characteristic

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.520
of black hole collisions,
extremely characteristic.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.830
What's happening is the black
holes begin to orbit so quickly

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.510
in the final fraction of a second
they're orbiting near the speed

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.140 position:56%
of light that the frequency at which
they're banging space and time,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.970
the drum, goes up and it
creates this sort of scooping

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.640 position:56%
up chirp right before it goes quiet.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.550
And it goes quiet because
they create a new black hole

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.520
and go silent.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.920
So in walks Ray Wise, who was
mentioned in the introduction,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.890
sort of let's take us to the 1970s.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.040
It's the 1970s people are
still arguing about whether

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.760
or not black holes are real.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.520
They're still arguing about whether

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.180
or not gravitational
waves exist at all.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:53.110 position:56%
Ray Wise is a young professor at
MIT and he is asked to teach a class

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.020
on gravitational waves-- I'm sorry,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.780
on Einstein's theory
of general relativity.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.070
And he's just started a new gravity
program he's this young professor,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.910
he's really, you know, wants
to make a good impression

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.340
and he knows nothing about
general relativity so he says yes.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.340
So he teaches this class in
general relativity and he says,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.430
he was bumbling, he was completely
bumbling he couldn't follow the

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.980
mathematics, he didn't
understand the theory,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.050
it was incredibly difficult
and all he could make sense

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.170
of was this thing about
the gravitational waves

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.630
that he could just imagine, how
could I make that seem real?

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.500
If a gravitational wave like
a wave in the ocean pass

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.080
and something bobbed on the
wave you can measure it.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.250
And he's an experimentalist
and so he's dreaming of ways

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.300
to measure this, the gravitational
wave, and that's the thing

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.970
that keeps the students
in the class.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.400
He says they're not walking out,
you know, they're not walking

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.320
out because he's thinking about
real ways to understand it.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.580
And he comes up with this idea
he called it a highku [phonetic].

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.790
It's for this little instrument and
here's the idea of the instrument,

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.090
you shine a laser, which
was new at the time,

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.230
down this L-shaped
instrument it gets split

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.850
at that beam splitter
there and shines

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.930
to the two mirrors,
let's watch it again.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.440
Those little black circles at the
end are two mirrors that are hung

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.150
so delicately that if a
gravitational wave passes they'll

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.320
sort of bob on the wave.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.400
And if they move because
of the gravitational wave,

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.090
the laser will keep
track of their movement

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:30.180
and it will record the
passing gravitational wave.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.780
Now, you don't have to worry about
the details of the experiment,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.900
you can think of this is like
the body of an electric guitar.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.570
You know, if you pluck an
electric guitar string,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.840
technically it doesn't
really make a sound.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.770
You need the body of the electric
guitar to record the shape

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.340
of the string, you plug
that into an amplifier

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.900
and you play it like a sound.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.970
In many ways, LIGO is
like a musical instrument.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.090
It plays the wave back as sound.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:01.870
So Ray starts to build this in
what's known as the plywood palace,

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.780
MIT's campus in the '70s.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.550
It's a ramshackle structure that
was thrown up on the periphery

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.530
of the campus during
the war effort--

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:14.790
the World War II effort in an
attempt to get scientist invested

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.800 position:56%
in technology important for the war.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.100
It was supposed to be torn

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.220
down within five years,
it existed for 50 years.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.310
And so the sheer crappiness of the
structure encouraged creativity.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.020
Nine Nobel Prizes came
out of the plywood palace

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.600
and this may be the 10th.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.920
Ray builds this tiny little
prototype it's a meter

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.000
and a half long, tiny
little prototype.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.890
His colleagues are
telling him nobody cares

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.700
about what you're doing,
it's not important.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.540
This will never succeed.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.840
Black holes aren't real,
gravitational waves don't exist.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.370
And they said even if they did if
the sun blew up and created a wave

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.960
in space-time, you could not
hear it with your machine.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.530
We do better looking out
the window, and it was true.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.500
You do better looking
out the window.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.350
And Ray realized that he had
to build the real instrument.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.980
It was 3000 times bigger than what
he was doing in the plywood palace,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.300
with no financial support,
no community support,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.920
and he thought he was doomed.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.480
He told me once I started life
with one ambition I wanted

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.990
to make music easier to hear.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.350
He was an immigrant from
Germany in, you know,

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.500
of 1947 he was a kid
building hyphys [phonetic].

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.120
And he would log speakers
that he found

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.730
in an old Paramount movie
theater that had been burnt out,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.250
he would log them home to Manhattan

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.720
and he would build
these little circuits

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.710 position:56%
and he would have all the immigrants
in the neighborhood come over

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.130
and listen to the philharmonic.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.090
And this was his life's ambition.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.760
And in some bazaar twist he
has his ambition as an adult

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.040
to become the one who
records, you know,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.330
the symphony of the skies
in some sense, right?

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.180
And he sees this dream
of his passing

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.270
because he doesn't have funding
and he doesn't have support

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.570 position:56%
and other people start to hear about
his idea, in Germany, in Japan,

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.770
in Scotland they start to build
these machines better than his,

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.050
bigger than his, more
likely to succeed.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:17.120
And Ray says to me, you
know, I thought that was it

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.440
and then the next big
event is I met Kip.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.700
And Kip Thorne is a famous
and iconic astrophysicist

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.560
and they team together, I'm going
to fast forward in the interest

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.430
of not keeping here all night but.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.370
Fast forward to the year 200
they've accumulated a team

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.650
of almost a thousand people.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.530
And they've secured hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.830
from the National Science
Foundation,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.600
they fought bitter grievous
battles, people have literally

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.950
like climbing Mount
Everest there are

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.570
like bodies along the
way, it's gruesome.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.640
But they get there, in the year
2000 they build these instruments.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.720
This is the real LIGO machine
the one that's 3000 times bigger

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.020
than Ray's.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.490
They are these L-shaped machines.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:03.120
Along those tubes is a vacuum.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.200
They are the two largest holes
in the earth's atmosphere

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.670
if you add up the LIGO machines.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.620
There's less stuff in
those tubes than there are

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.930
in regions of interstellar space.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:19.280 position:56%
This is a little cartoon we're going
inside the tube and the laser shines

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.020
down the tube and hits a
mirror 4 kilometers away,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.430
and bounces off the mirror,
keeps track of its location.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.940
So if the mirror is
bobbing on the wave,

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.210
it will know that it
has bobbed on the wave.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.920
In these, what we call
beer chambers,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.460
are these elaborate components.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.220
Now in the year 2000, all the
science runs they hear nothing.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.250
The first generations of
machines were completely quiet.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.450 position:56%
And you can imagine the community
response to this initial generation.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.480
But they weren't that
surprised on the LIGO team,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.280 position:56%
they always argued it would probably
be a second generation of machines.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.890
The idea is that each machine
has to make a recording

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.950
or you would never believe it and
how it works something happens,

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.560
some cataclysmic event far away
and it washes over the earth

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.510
and rings the two machines.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.350
This is what the machine
sounds like.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.220
It sounds like noise.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.210
They literally listen to the
instrument in the control room

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.210
through like conventional speakers.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.840
This is, you know,
a process everyday.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.640
My friend Rona [assumed
spelling] he's one

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.220
of the important experimentalist

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.910
on the team says he gets really
pissed off if the speakers aren't

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.810 position:56%
on when he goes to the control room.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.210
Then in August-- oh, this happened.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.360
The Washington machine
is on the same site

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.740
as the plutonium separation
facilities that were used

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.730 position:56%
in World War II for the first bombs,

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.410
the ones that were
actually used in Japan.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.070
And that's because they
have to be on a remote site,

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.660
it's a government facility
there's no association

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.680
with the plutonium separation
facilities but it is kind

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.980
of ominous, you can see them
in the plums on the horizon.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:02.670
And because they are nuclear
sites they have a lot of security

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.600
and I guess one of the
security guards is driving

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.140
around in the middle of the night
in this desert with a very--

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.120
like not completely
thoroughly flushed out knowledge

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.580
of the local geography and he
drives into one of the arms.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.180
And I know this is not
a nice thing to say

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.600
but luckily he broke his own
arm and not the LIGO arm.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:28.640 position:56%
Had he broken the LIGO arm, not only
would the experiment have been over,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.330
people told me, that's, it
we would have gone home.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.100
Drawing the vacuum is so hard
that vacuum was drawn in 1998

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.230
and has not been brought
up to atmosphere since.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.540
If that vacuum had been blown, as
one of my friends on the team says,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.130
Mike Landry, he says, we
all would had gone home.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.430
That's it.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.730
It's over.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.980 position:56%
But not only that he would have
suffered much more damage presumably

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.160 position:56%
than just breaking his arm it's like
opening a door in the space station,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.030
right, only the vacuums on
the inside not the outside.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.310 position:56%
But it would have been very, very
dangerous for him to blow a big hole

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.680
in that vacuum very suddenly.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.980
At one point they discussed
not even building

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.050
that cement encasement,
luckily they did.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.990 position:56%
So, at the other site, in Louisiana,
they were shut up my some hunters

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:19.650
who people think that was not an
accident that they were unhappy

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:21.940
about the scientific experiment
on their hunting grounds.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.420
So one of the head of the Louisiana
site says we're so American

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.520
to the Europeans, you know, we've
had a car incident, we've been shot

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.170
up by guns, all we need is a
hamburger incident, you know?

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:38.400
So, in August 2015,
this is, you know,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.660
15 years after the initial
machine was built, this is 50 years

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.430
after Ray started this experiment.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.310
Ray works on that experiment
all the time.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.540
I cannot tell you how
many times somebody said

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.690
to me we better ask Ray.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.540
Ray walks those tunnels, he finds
wasps and vermin and chlorine

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.860
from the urine it was rotting
the tubes and he's the one

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.310 position:56%
who discovers all the stuff, I mean,

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.960
he's really in the experiment
all the time in his 80s.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.660
Ray says to be in August of 2015,

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.880
if we don't discover black
holes this thing is a failure.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.870
It's a billion dollars into it,
and really, most of his life.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.970
And the reason he said that is
that all the old timers they're

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.730
after pure space-time, pure
space-time coalescence.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.090
That's what they want to discover,
nothing else will compare.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.010
Meanwhile, all of the other
experimentalists including a lot

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.890
of the young people are
telling me, nothing until 2018,

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.470
don't expect anything until 2018.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.470
Meanwhile the funding,
they're right on the edge

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.500
of the funding being not retracted

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.770
but it becoming a more
difficult argument to make

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.210 position:56%
that this experiment should continue
to get funded at this level.

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:56.690
A lot of the astronomy community
is unhappy and against it,

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.800
doesn't think they'll ever succeed.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.080
So, three weeks later
after this conversation,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:09.810
it's September 13th a weekend
and Ray is working on the site

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.090
and he's looking for radio
interference and they decide

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.830
that they're not ready to start the
science runs yet and they're going

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.450
to keep testing the machine.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.350
But he says, luckily my wife said
it's time for you to come home.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.220
So he gets on a plane
and he goes to Maine.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.500 position:56%
It's late Sunday night, early
Monday morning and a lot of the team

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.310
at Louisiana and in Washington
are still doing these tests,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.610
they're banging on the machine
they're driving trucks up

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.120
and down the access roads
breaking really hard to try

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.790
to knock the machine what
they call out of luck,

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.010
which means that in observing mode.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.580
And eventually 4 in
the morning Louisiana,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.550
2 in the morning Washington they
decide this is ridiculous we're

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.850
tired, we're going home.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.640
They put down their
tools they go home.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.010
Within an hour, they leave
the machine in observing mode,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.550
within an hour on Monday
September 14th

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.150
after a 1.3 billion year journey
a gravitational wave comes

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:08.420
from the southern sky, it
rings the machine in Louisiana,

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.920
it's captured beautifully, 7
milliseconds later skimming

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.740
across the continent it rings
the machine in Washington State,

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.230
it's captured beautifully.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.430
By the time Ray wakes up at 8:30
Monday morning looks at the log

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.000 position:56%
and says, what the hell is going on?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.840
It's already billions
of kilometers away.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.490
And this is what they detected.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.740
This is a computer simulation,
no telescope could record this.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.040
They detected the collision

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.400
of two black holes one was
36 times the mass of the sun,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.310
one was 29 times the
mass of the sun.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:45.530
They heard the final
few orbits one-fifth

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.660
of a second this is
drastically slowed down so

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.560
that human beings can perceive it.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.650
Each black hole is a
couple of hundred kilometers

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.720
across they were traveling
near the speed

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.980
of light in their final orbits.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.040
They caught that let's see it
again because it's so beautiful.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.570
They caught the last
200 milliseconds,

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:09.540
a fifth of a second before those
two black holes collided and merged

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.460
to make one black hole bout
60 times the mass of the sun.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.200
That one black hole rang off all
the imperfections and went quiet.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.100
And you can actually hear
this in the recording,

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.670
you can hear the black hole kind

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.030
of shedding away the
imperfections and going quiet.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.750
It was not only the first
bear detection of black holes,

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.890 position:56%
you could never see this in light it
was the loudest single event we've

00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:37.270
ever detected since the big bang.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:42.630 position:56%
More power came out of that
collision than all the stars shining

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.170
in the observable universe
combined and

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.500
yet none of it came out as light.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.660
All of it went into the ringing
of space-time ringing the drum.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.890
And by the time it got to
the earth it was so quiet

00:34:55.890 --> 00:35:00.730
that it moved the mirrors by
less than 1/10,000 the width

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.470
of a proton over 4 kilometers.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:10.750
It was just an absolutely miniscule
faintest, thinnest wisp of a sound

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.900
that was finally recorded.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.670
So, why don't we hear it
again and what you're going

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.780 position:56%
to hear is actually that final chirp

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.190
that we've already
predicted in our simulations.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.220
What's so stunning is
that the simulations

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.010
that people have been doing across
the world internationally are

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.470
so close to exactly what you hear.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.500
So that is actually
what they recorded.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:42.370
And by reconstructing from the
sound they deduced the size

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.720
and motion of the actual mallets.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.160
And then just to close, since
this is a Book Festival,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.810
I was going to actually just
read two very short paragraphs

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.830
from the end of the
book if you don't mind

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.640
and then I'd be happy
to take questions.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.440
I think I can do this
with the podium, hold on.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.370
I don't think it's a spoiler for me
to read from the end of the book.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:07.220
You know what happens, they
discovered gravitational waves.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.920 position:56%
There will be press releases,
scientific papers will be published,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.060
news articles will abound.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.030
There will be documents,
reports, and careful records kept.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.830
We'll continue to send a portrait
of our best selves into space,

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.560
a declaration that we were here
that we strove for understanding

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.930
that we often failed and
occasionally succeeded.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.710
We heard black holes collide.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.090
We'll point to where the sound
might have come from to the best

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.290
of our abilities, a swatch of
space from an earlier epic.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.550
Somewhere in the southern
sky hauling away from us

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.540
with the expansion of the universe,

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:47.450
the big black hole will roll along
its own galaxy, dark and quiet

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.570
until something wonders pass

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.000
and interstellar dust
cloud or an errant star.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.510
After a few billion years
the host galaxy might collide

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.560
with a neighbor tossing
the black hole

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.450
around maybe toward a
super massive black hole

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.710
and a growing galactic center.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.320
Our star will die.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.730
The Milky Way will
blend with Andromeda.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.380
The record of this discovery
along with the wreckage

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.320
of our solar system will
fall into black holes

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.750
as well everything
else in the cosmos.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.510
The expanding space
eventually silent

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.430
and all the black holes
will evaporate

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.050
into oblivion near the end of time.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.850
Thank you.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:31.760
[ Applause ]

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.450 position:56%
And I think I'm taking questions but
I don't know what the clock says.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.890
Oh, what's it?

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:40.190
Five minutes, sorry.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.490
Please.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.790
&gt;&gt; Do we know the speed of--

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.100
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: Times
is relative by the way.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.420
Yeah.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.690
&gt;&gt; Do we know the speed
of gravitational wave?

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.400
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: It's a
really important question.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.730
In Einstein's original theory,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.690
the speed is the same
as the speed of light.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:58.440
We can tell that it took about
the speed of light to get

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.170
from the Louisiana machine
to the Washington machine

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.620
but we can't measure it that
accurately that we can say for sure

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.780
that it is indeed traveling
at the speed of light,

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.540
but the evidence suggest
that that's what's happening.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.380
Yes. I think we're going
to trade back and forth.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.250
&gt;&gt; You said that there was

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.830
like absolutely nothing
inside of the black hole.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:26.020
Does that mean that absolute devoid
of atoms and everything in space?

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: Yeah, so technically
the only way that we know how

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.390
to form a black hole at the
moment is through the death state

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.230
of a star, so a very heavy
star much bigger than our sun.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.820
At the end of its life
when it runs out of fuel

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.250 position:56%
and its interior collapses under its
own weight it no longer has the sort

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.720
of brightness and the
pressure to stay aloft

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.790
and it collapses under
its own weight.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.820
And remarkably, Einstein did
not think that this would happen

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.190
but after studying
nuclear physics involved

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.720
in the bomb projects they realize

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.640
that there was known forces
it could resist collapse,

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.080
and the star will collapse
under its own weight.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.890
Eventually, let's say it's 10 times
the mass of the sun, that object is

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.090
as it collapses becomes
like 60 kilometers across.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.330
At that moment it creates
the shadow.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:16.090
The region where the curvature of
space-time is so strong, sorry,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.790
that not even light can escape.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.720
But it doesn't stop falling.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.970
The stuff keeps falling and it
falls all the way to the center.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.730
So the stuff is not
there at that shadow.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.850
What we call the event horizon

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.050
of the black hole is empty
by the time it's formed.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.290
Where that material of the
star goes once it crushes

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.610
to the center, we don't know.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:40.990
Again, it might blow out into a new
big bang inside the black whole,

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:45.260
a whole universe inside there or
it might get stored in some kind

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.950
of thing we don't understand
some kind of remnant.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:51.010
We don't really know what
happens, but it's not there

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.100
at the event horizon anymore
that's for sure that we understand.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.400
Yes.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.970
&gt;&gt; Kind of a science
fiction question

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.300 position:56%
like because I was always fascinated
like there was this theory

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.830 position:56%
that like our conventional engines
they would never take us anywhere it

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.040
will take like hundreds of
years to go to the nearest star.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.590
And there was this
lovely theory that like

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.960
with the black holes we can
actually maybe find some shortcuts

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.570
but like would anybody actually
survive going into like--

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.020
because I remember reading
those like endless fall

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.420
like people get stretched
into in like-- yeah.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.720
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: Yeah,
it's not a good story.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.490
Not a good story in the
internal black hole.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.920
It doesn't end well for
anybody on the inside there.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.220
&gt;&gt; So there's no really potential?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.520
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: Well,
here's what we know.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:39.660 position:56%
We know that there are current space
craft, current technology had just,

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.900 position:56%
just broken out of the sun's
influence voyager which was launched

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.250
in the '70s has just barely
escaped the influence of the sun

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.550
and that was from the '70.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.720
It will be tens of thousands

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.230
of years before it makes
it to another star system.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.130 position:56%
Our nearest star at our current rate

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:01.490
of technology would take 35,000
years to send a space craft there.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.520
There are these things
called nanocrafts

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.300
which are literally the size
of like a postage stamp.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.880
And if we could accelerate those
too then they might get there

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.180
in decades.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.040
But traveling at the speed of light
those star systems are only 4 years

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.660
away, OK, but we don't know how

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.660
to get anything near
the speed of light.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.830
So the question is could we use
something like black holes is,

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.530
you know, that's not terribly
likely but it doesn't--

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.960
I mean, it doesn't mean, I mean,

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.090
warp drive is something we
can kind of try to make.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:34.900
Like there are mathematical models.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.460
A better thing to do would
be to warp space-time

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.690
so that you pull the star
closer, you walk across

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.530
and then you push it out again.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.830
That would actually work the best.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.710
I mean, literally you could get
there in a faction of a second

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.390
but we just-- you know,
we just don't know how

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:51.950
to harness energy sufficiently.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.950
If we did we weren't be arguing
about oil and coal anymore,

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.390
you know, and fracking if we knew
how to harness energy like that.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.480
I think do I have time
for one more question?

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.360
One more. Sorry for people in
the line but I can stay out here.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.010
&gt;&gt; Sure. I was just
curious, in your mind,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.370
what do you think the coolest
thing about this discovery is

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.070
like is it the fact
that Einstein's theory

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.780
of general relativity has
been further validated

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.130
or that this is evidence
of black holes or even

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.210
that this maybe a precursor to
even additional discoveries?

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.510
&gt;&gt; Janna Levin: I think it's not

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.070
that we've proven Einstein
right again.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.050
I don't think any one is surprised

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.440
that gravitational waves are
real, or that they exist.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.930
I think what's been
much more exciting is

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:39.490
that it's the first time we've
ever detected black holes truly

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:43.100
in a sense without looking
just at stuff around them.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.190
Usually we look at what they're
doing, the stuff around them

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.750
and we say, oh there
much be a black hole

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.900
at the center there
creating all this havoc.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.200
This is entirely different.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.710
We are directly hearing the
collision of these black holes.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:57.100 position:56%
We've never seen two black holes
together because you can't see them.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.050
And I think it points
to the possibility

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.790
that this is a completely
new dimension in terms

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.670
of understanding the universe
that this silent movie

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:10.020
that we've compiled is now going to
be accompanied by this sound track

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.750
and this sound track can get
ever more complex and rich

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.160
as we get more sophisticated
at listening.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.290
And that's just, you know, it's
like pointing the telescope

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.100
at the sky for the first time.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.640
I mean, that's what we hope, right?

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.410 position:56%
We hope that we're going to discover
things we haven't even thought

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.080
of before because 95%
of the universe is dark

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.030
and the only way we're going
to detect it is by listening.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.380
So thank you very much.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.510
I'd be happy to sign
books or stay afterwards.
