00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.179
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I'm Liv Wu.

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.590
I'm an executive chef.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.240
I know a lot of you.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.510
I'm just delighted and honored to be introducing
Joel.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.180
He's a hero of mine and a hero of a lot of
us on the food team.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.020
I'm not going to say a lot except to say -- to
tell you that this morning I was playing around

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.360
on his website â€“ the website for Polyface
Farms.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.230
It's really a cool site to visit foodie or
no or greenie or no.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.820
It's full of fun and full of really serious
stuff.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.940
And stuff that makes you think hard.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.850
But of course I went to the -- I clicked on
the buy turkey link because it's, you know,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.949
seasonal and we just created -- if you guys
didn't know -- an ability for us to group

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.620
by heritage and organically raised turkeys
that will be available to all of us through

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.330
Google Green Grocer.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.830
But I clicked on "turkey," and there was all
of this wonderful language that so Joel.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.190
It's wonderful white skin, buttery, moist.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.640
You know, it was a great sale.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.360
And then, the last piece was a disclaimer
that says 'we will not ship.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360
We don't ship.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
Please go to your local farmer and buy your
turkey there.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.530
And not only that, we suggest you go to visit
the farm before you buy the turkey' and I

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.170
just went 'huh'.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.190
That is exactly what we do on the food team
here.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.060
This is what makes us able to bring you great
food and makes our consciouses clear about

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.420
what we're doing.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.500
You may try to drive an electric car or hybrid
car, but in fact, what you eat and how that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.729
food is produced is contributing hugely. as
much as if not more than, the car you drive

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.499
to our environmental footprint.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.810
So I love the turkey link.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.090
And just with that I will give the floor to
Joel.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.489
[applause].

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.569
&gt;&gt;Joel: Thank you.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.579
Are these yours?

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.930
[chuckles] I need them but they're not mine.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.930
All right.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.689
Well, it is a real distinct honor to be here
at Google and I do feel like a fish out of

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.890
water because I have what is called 'anti
technology karma'.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.340
[laughter] Anybody who shows me how to do
something on a computer when I do the same

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.859
functions, it doesn't work.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.700
Took me ten minutes to get out of the parking
lot at the Hilton this morning up at Burlingame

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.489
because the room key card would not work in
the -- you know, I watched the other cards

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.099
in front of me all go through, put it in and
run out, put it in and run out, mine it doesn't

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.590
work and so the gate doesn't come up.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.650
So it takes me ten minutes to get out of the
parking lot.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.790
That's just the way my life is, you know.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.510
But I sure can make dancing earthworms.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.700
[laughter]

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.930
&gt;&gt;Joel: And in the continuum of things probably
most of us, historically and in the future,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.760
will be far more dependent on dancing earthworms
than working key card slots out of a Hilton

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.769
parking lot.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.400
So -- and as my life has gone, on I have found
myself more and more kind of -- I call it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.489
archaic-- in our culture because we live on
a farm that is -- that has four generations

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.939
living on it.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.650
My mother is a very healthy happy octogenarian
will be 88 this winter.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.049
She still rides five miles a day on her stationary
bike.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.049
Drives.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.049
Ballroom dances.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.040
Teaches English country dancing to people
and sings in the Happy Notes which is an old

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.109
-- it's a group of retirees-- who entertains
and she'll pop in at our house and she drives

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.299
to sing in this chorus at the nursing home.

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.519
She says, "we're going to sing to the old
folks" and half of them are younger than she

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.519
is.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.969
But and then of course we have, you know,
Teresa and I are there and our children are

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.060
there and their children are there.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.400
So we have four generations on the farm all
living in a commune.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
It's quite dramatic.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
It's quite amazing.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.740
And we grow our own food.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.270
I feel like we just live in this nest of abundance.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.710
We live in a time when a lot of people are
concerned that we're teetering on the precipice

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.949
of precariousness in a lot of things.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:51.270
You know, economically, ecologically, socially,
culturally.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:01.930
And so, to live surrounded by a tribe that
is devoted to a common denominator and surrounded

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.669
by abundance.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.729
We like to graze.

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.360
I like to walk through the seasons.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.030
We have mulberries and pawpaws and pear trees
and apple trees and grapes and strawberries

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.280
and I just like to graze.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.270
I just have these visions of campuses whether
they're Google campuses or any kind of institutional

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.520
campuses where all the ornamental landscaping
is converted to edible landscaping and you

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.740
use your GPS technology to just let everybody
know every morning when you get up with a

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.509
app the strawberries in quadrant 45 are ready
to be picked today.

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.280
[laughter] The asparagus in quadrant 87 pick
some spears on your way to your office this

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.710
morning.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.990
Why couldn't we do that?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:54.199
And the idea is to return us as a nest -- as
a nest to an ecological womb.

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.610
Wouldn't that do a lot to take the edge off
of the fear and the concern that many of us

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.610
have for some of the big picture items around
our world.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.000
You know, we could hook up the exercise room
to water pumps that would pump water back

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.030
up on to the roofs of all of our buildings
that are growing strawberries and cucumbers.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.189
That way we don't have to have any air-conditioning
and it cools down our buildings so much we

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.409
use our human power to pump the water back
up on the roof.

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.760
And this stuff can be done.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.520
It's not out of the question.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.909
So, as I live the more live the more I look
at our culture and I look at the fact that

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:40.780
we are if first culture in human civilization
that routinely eats unpronounceable food.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.039
You know, we're the first culture in human
civilization that eats food that you can't

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.439
make in your kitchen.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.439
You ever try to make high fructose corn syrup
in your kitchen?

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:58.290
We're the first culture in the world, in history,
that has ever put 1500 miles on average under

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.740
every morsel of food.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.990
That's a long ways.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.909
You know, in 1930, one calorie of food on
the table took an average quarter calorie

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:09.909
to get there.

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.460
Today every calorie of food on the table takes
15 calories of energy to get there.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.760
I mean, these are hockey sticks graphs.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.740
And we all know that hockey stick graphs never
last.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:33.371
And so, what happened was -- I'm leading up
to why this book came out -- was that as I

00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:42.349
tried to describe looking for sound bites
of how do I describe what I think has sustained

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:49.139
and rejuvenated and regenerated and formed
the glue for human existence for centuries

00:07:49.139 --> 00:08:00.310
if not millennia, what I found was that this
blip that we call "modern America" is extremely

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.850
abnormal.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:08.030
And I run into young people every day like
you know -- it's so fun to talk to a group

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.030
here at Google.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:15.530
You know, if I talk to a group of farmers,
you know the average farmer is now 60 years

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.530
old.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.639
And they can remember, you know, a day before
supermarkets.

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:27.009
Today most of us can't even remember a day
before computers.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.389
My first book -- I wrote on a typewriter.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:33.500
You know, when I was in college, there was
no computer.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.880
I wish you'd just think about this for a minute.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.630
I can remember when TV dinners were introduced.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:47.459
Can you imagine, you know, no microwave.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:52.040
I can remember a day when there was no takeout.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.960
I could remember when a salad bar buffet started
in restaurants.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.020
Started during Vietnam era -- Vietnam war
era.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.670
It was one of the biggest shocks of Vietnam
war veterans.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.190
They went, they came back there were salad
bar restaurants.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.090
[laughter] Where did this come from?

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.490
It was like boom!

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.150
It hit the culture.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.360
But these are new things in our culture.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:25.600
And as I would explain these things and how,
you know, when I was a kid if you wanted to

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.900
stay warm in the wintertime you don't have
to worry about this in California but where

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:36.410
we are if you want to stay warm in the wintertime
you had to get some heat in your house and

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.290
so, we would cut wood.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.670
We had wood stoves and we would cut wood.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:48.730
And my wife has inherited her grandmother's
majestic wood cook stove that when she and

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:57.300
granddaddy went to housekeeping in 1929, that
was state of the art technology -- this majestic

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:03.699
wood cook stove that you put little kindling
on the side that's where your dish water got

00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:04.699
hot.

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.570
It just kept hot water there all the time.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.610
You see all the old westerns and the baby
is getting ready to come and the doctor says

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.040
boil water.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.230
The water was always there.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.949
It was always ready.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.860
That was new technology at that time.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.680
And so, I just started mentioning this as
I would describe these numerous things that

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.560
we've come to today with supermarkets with
unpronounceable food, with computers, with

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:42.440
the technology, you know, iPhones and iPads
and Google. that this represents an abnormal

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.550
blip in human history.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:51.100
And so, what is this glue that is normal in
civilization?

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.570
And so, I want to just spend a couple of minutes
and we'll go right to questions and answer

00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:00.120
and discussion about some of these things
that I think have been -- are interesting.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.300
They're in the book 'Folks, This Ain't Normal'.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.930
It describes what I consider to be abnormalities
in our system.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.270
You see -- historic -- so I want to talk about
animals for a minute.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.950
Because animals are much-maligned in our culture.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:23.010
I got one chapter in the book the title something
like 'my aunt is my dog is my cat is my child'.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:28.170
And what we've done in our culture, as we
have Bambi-eyed and Disney-fied our culture,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:35.940
and we ascribe anthropomorphistic humanism
to animals and so, we have animal rights movement

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.139
that has eliminated, for example, wearing
fur.

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:45.360
When I was a kid, teenagers would actually
get their spending money by trapping foxes

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.800
and mink and beavers and stuff.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800
I'm not that old.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800
I'm not that old!

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.820
I'm really 80.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.779
That's what good food does to you.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:12:01.532
[laughter] People would -- you know, I remember
very well old-timers saying back in the 20s

00:12:01.532 --> 00:12:02.532
and 30s.

00:12:02.532 --> 00:12:08.860
You know, when I was a boy these are people
that are old enough to be my dad in a community,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:14.940
this is how teens got money to go to the movies
or get their first automobile or whatever.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.970
And fox skins brought 50 dollars apiece.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:23.600
Today they're less than a dollar so nobody
traps and a lot of places in our country now

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.390
are having problems with kids with rabies.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:32.320
One in ten foxes has the mange because of
this explosion because we've extracted humans

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.410
out of nature.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.019
And so, what was the role of animals historically?

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:42.149
Let's talk about chickens.

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:45.250
Historically chickens -- because everybody
likes chickens.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:52.080
I mean, chickens are like the most -- the
coolest of the farm animals.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.779
[laughter] So what was the role of chickens?

00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:03.490
Well, historically they didn't have garbage
trucks and landfills.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:09.870
And enough excess food to just throw it away.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:17.769
So chickens were a garbage disposal, salvage
operation in the homestead and the farm stead.

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:19.149
That's what chickens were.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:26.550
And that's one reason why peasants -- chickens
were a luxury because there was no grain.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.190
Now, let me talk about grain for a minute.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.519
Because our culture -- when you think "farm,"
you tend to think "grain."

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:35.009
That's what we think in our culture.

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:43.480
In fact, we subsidize the U.S. duh Don't look
at me like you don't get this.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.620
The USDA subsidizes six types of grain annual
production.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:55.709
But in a day before cheap energy and machinery,
if you wanted to plow a field to grow barley

00:13:55.709 --> 00:14:05.070
or wheat, you had to walk all day behind ox
or a yak or a mule or a horse with a sharp

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.959
stick and it was arduous work.

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:13.529
And you know at the end of the day you looked
back and maybe the area of a size of this

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:17.149
room you actually got torn up a little bit.

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:21.160
And then you could go back and you could hand
broadcast seeds.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.190
Okay?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.690
And those seeds would grow.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.720
And then you had to hand weed those seeds
to keep the weeds out of them then whatever

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.940
grew, you could go in with a scythe and scythe
it down and then put in a shock so it could

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940
dry.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:42.529
It actually ferments just a little bit because
of the uneven moisture drying of the stalk.

00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:49.470
And that's one reason why people now have
so much wheat gluten intolerance is because

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:55.010
we're harvesting it so fast and drying it
so fast there's no tiny amount of fermentation

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:01.670
that occurs in the grain, to change the enzymes
to digestible enzymes in the grain crop.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.089
Okay?

00:15:03.089 --> 00:15:04.509
So.

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:12.100
You put it in a shock and then you took it
in to a hard floor maybe a wooden planks or

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.480
beaten lime or rock or clay that you pounded
real hard.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.850
Anyway a hard surface and then you beat it
all right with a flail and then you would

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.130
winnow it, all right, throw it up and the
breeze would blow through it and drive the

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.940
chaff and husks away and then you'd get some
barley.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:34.110
Now carefully sweep that up and put it now
in a -- in something that you could store

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.850
it away from rats and mice in a day before
sheet metal, before mesh metal, in a clay

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.140
pot somewhere and hopefully that would last
you until the next year's harvest.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:51.339
Folks, there was not enough grain left over
to feed animals.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:56.540
That's why in the Bible, in Hosea, the prophet
talks about a harlot being sold for 9 and

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.250
a half ephahs of barley.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.290
It's not because harlots were cheap.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.290
[laughter] It's because barley was expensive.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:13.729
[laughter] I'm trying to help us understand
here that this idea of cheap grain fundamentally

00:16:13.729 --> 00:16:20.920
-- fundamentally changed the role and the
place of farm animals that had been normal

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.770
throughout history.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:28.930
And so, now suddenly we had all this grain
with our ability to tillage, machinery, cheap

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.930
energy.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.410
And so, now we can go plow up with a great
machine.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:38.460
Suddenly the traditional role of a chicken
which was right next to the kitchen to eat

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:46.200
the kitchen scraps and the, you know, the
peelings and all the stuff that came out spoiled

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.620
food being in a day before refrigeration.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.010
Food spoiled what do you do?

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.139
You feed it to chickens.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:56.279
And then chickens then in return then cycle
it -- the ultimate recycling agent-- and give

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:58.949
us eggs in return.

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:01.930
That was the traditional role of chickens.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:07.970
Today, we think we're great when we take our
banana peels and our waste from the kitchens,

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:13.790
put it on a truck run with diesel power --especially
biodiesel-- and truck it off site somewhere

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:20.439
to a composting operation and then people
can buy the compost for their house plants

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:22.329
or little ornamental flowers.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:27.689
What really would be green would be to attach
a chicken house next to each cafe so that

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:34.299
the scraps [applause] went right into the
chicken house, the eggs come right back in

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:38.220
and now we don't have to truck the garbage
anywhere or bring the eggs from anywhere.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.070
That's what I'm talking about is normal, okay?

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:47.480
So, I've just concentrated on chickens but
you could take every single animal.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.179
I'll do one more just to show where I'm coming
from.

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:52.570
Let's take cows.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.570
All right?

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:57.660
What is the role of herbivores in nature?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.780
Historically herbivores -- the bison on the
American plain.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:07.720
Today the wildebeest on the Serengeti, the
cape buffalo in Botswana.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:14.270
We Americans -- we modern day developed country
people-- are absolutely brain damaged when

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.060
we talk about grass.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.540
When I say "grass," everybody thinks about
this close cropped lawn out here or a golf

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.780
course, right?

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:30.220
When I say "grass," what I think about grass,
is little house on the prairie when ma and

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.809
pa wouldn't let the girls go out past the
stoop of the soddie lest they get lost.

00:18:35.809 --> 00:18:36.809
Lost?

00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:37.929
What do you mean?

00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:44.590
We think lost, the city beautification committee
would cite me for violating the ordinance

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.570
for having an unkempt lawn.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:52.470
No, I'm talking about glass, like if you go
today to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:58.270
they've preserved a 2-acre native prairie
patch they used it with fire.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.340
This grass is 12 feet tall.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.130
It's more than half an inch thick at the stem.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:05.450
It's thick as hair on a dog's back.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.120
I still get chills every time I talk about
it.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:18.960
It's an absolute biological biomass soil building
carbon sequestering cathedral.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.210
[laughter] And you walk out in there in this
12-foot tall grass.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.740
I mean, taller than the lights in this room,
okay?

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.820
And it's over your head and it just blocks
out the world.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.659
And then to imagine this rustling waving mass
of biomass for hundreds of miles out through

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:38.659
the prairies.

00:19:38.659 --> 00:19:40.870
I mean, it is unbelievable.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:50.260
And so, civilization -- civilizations coalesced
early on around grasses, perennials and herbivores

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:57.180
because that was the only really nutrient
dense product that could be produced without

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.590
tillage.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:07.740
Because when all tillage was done with a crude
stick or a wooden spade, it was too precious

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.210
to do in any scale.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:17.150
And so, that's why lamb, goat, camel, cow,
yak -- all right?

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:25.440
Became the centerpiece of civilizational diets
and fish all right?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.980
Because that could be fished.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.440
You didn't have to till to get seafood.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.090
And you didn't have to till to get the herbivore.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:40.110
And so, that's why that became the centerpiece
of dietary protocol in every civilization.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:50.600
Today, with cheap grain, we have been able
to abdicate this and plow up everything and

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:58.030
confine the animals in houses where they neither
salvage nor do anything except for eat erosive,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:09.809
petrol chemical dependent, ecologically debilitating,
annuals that are subsidized by U.S. domestic

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:18.250
policy to make cheap food in concentrated
animal feeding operations that have no comparison

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:26.480
either ecologically or relationally or symbiotically
or nutritionally to their forbearers who filled

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:34.779
a definite function in their ecology of the
ecological womb.

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:40.480
So what we've been able to do is extricate
ourselves from this historic normalcy which

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.010
was the herbivore is the biomass restart button.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:46.980
The grass grows in an S curve.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.530
You with me?

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.880
S curve.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.309
The bottom part I call diaper grass.

00:21:52.309 --> 00:21:55.500
This is teenage grass and this is nursing
home grass.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:06.670
[laughter] Well, if my job is to take solar
energy and metabolize it into decomposable

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:13.400
biomass, carbon sequestering biomass, where
of those three stages do I want grass more

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.279
often than not?

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:17.490
Teenage.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:26.210
Not nursing home into senescence and not diaper
into trying to toddle, but teenage all right?

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:32.150
And so, if the grass is allowed to just grow
and get old and die, it shuts down the photo

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.770
synthetic thing.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:40.290
If it stays very diaper-ish, it can never
really kick into high gear.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:46.350
And so, the herbivore was nature's way before
mowing machines and before cheap energy was

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:55.240
nature's way of pruning the biomass to restart
the rapid biomass accumulation.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:04.789
An herbivore is an ecological biomass accumulation
restart button.

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:09.080
That's the role of herbivores in nature, all
right?

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:17.289
And when we go to grass finished beef, grass
finished lamb, we reaffirm that normal role

00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:20.090
of the herbivore ecology in nature.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.070
We're the first culture -- and I'm almost
done -- we're the first culture that views

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:30.900
children as liabilities instead of assets.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:36.130
All cultures in history viewed children as
a blessing.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:41.360
Today we talk about the cost of raising a
child.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:50.370
You know, this is the first generation which
the average child has not had domestic chores.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:24:01.600
You know, kids used to grow up weeding the
garden, picking beans, helping can applesauce.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.850
Helping to cook.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.360
Today we call that child abuse.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.929
[laughter]

00:24:08.929 --> 00:24:16.130
&gt;&gt;Joel: And I would suggest -- and I know
I'm speaking into the heart of our electronic,

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.410
plugged in, techno-glitzy world and so I'm
doing a dance with you here and I'm not a

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.260
Luddite and I love technology.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:32.230
I love microchip, electric fencing and energizers,
UV stabilized, you know, canvasses and nursery

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:38.160
and polyethylene black plastic pipe and stainless
steel and refrigeration and there's a lot

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.080
of cool things we've got today, all right?

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.179
But I want to tell you something.

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:55.440
Human self-actualization, human self-affirmation,
I think, is actually encouraged and stimulated

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:04.400
when we viscerally participate in the physical
elements of life.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.940
And there is no comparison with looking back
at the end of the day and seeing gleaming

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.919
gleaming jars of fresh-made, canned salsa
for example, sitting on the shelf that you've

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:20.360
picked the tomatoes and you've sliced and
diced and you've smelled it and you've been

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.160
viscerally involved, touching, smelling, moving
it, and preserving it for the future.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.020
There's nothing that compares with the sight
and the ability to participate and have a

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:40.820
visceral relationship with that production
on the shelf compared to being the top performer

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:45.460
in the latest video game.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.179
One is just cyber.

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.980
And we see it in our interns.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:57.190
We've had interns come out of Dilbert-cubicle
type situations.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:03.710
And they get there and they describe with
trembling lips and deep emotion that for the

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:14.751
first time they were able to build something
that they could touch, sense, feel, and hear

00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:20.210
the voices of their team members in person.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.510
Powerful self-actualization.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:30.279
And finally, we're the first culture that
has devoted so much time and energy to a national

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:37.980
food police -- the food police -- you know
about the food police -- we call them the

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.470
food safety people.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.240
I call them the food police.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.380
Who, for the first time in human history,
have told a culture that you know it's perfectly

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:53.250
safe to eat Mountain Dew, Twinkies and Cocoa
Puffs but that raw milk, compost-grown raw

00:26:53.250 --> 00:27:01.440
potatoes and Aunt Mathilda's pickles now that's
deadly [laughter] And so, I want to end -- because

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:08.110
of this setting-- , I want to end with a thought
about food innovation.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:13.760
Because folks, what has become normal in our
culture I'm suggesting, you know, DiGiorno's

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:23.720
frozen pizza, concentrated animal feeding
operations farms with no trespassing signs,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.149
food production models that you have to walk
through sheep dip and put on hazardous materials

00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:37.409
suit to go visit, it's not food worth eating
and it's created a toxic landscape.

00:27:37.409 --> 00:27:42.490
Just try living down river from a concentrated
animal feeding operation or from a mono-speciated

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.980
spraying operation in the San Joaquin valley.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.580
We know about this.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:55.039
There are many of us who believe that much
of our pathogenicity, our type two diabetes,

00:27:55.039 --> 00:28:00.160
the fact that the U.S. leads the world in
the five chronic debilitating diseases of

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.230
cancer and diabetes and these things.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:09.730
There's a reason why, that there's a connection
here because we lead the world in creating

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.899
an abnormal food system.

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:22.289
Now, if we're going to return our food system
and our landscape policy to a more normal

00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:29.490
sustainable regenerative system I would suggest
that it's going to require the same kind of

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:37.400
innovation that Google enjoys today bringing
innovation to the world.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.909
How does innovation happen?

00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:44.090
It happens in embryonic prototypes.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:50.520
The beginning of Google is not a 15,000 person
campus in California.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.960
The beginning of Google is a couple wild ideas
with lunatics sitting on their little computers

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.710
fooling around with stuff and dreaming and
thinking.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.149
But starting small.

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:10.919
And so, what we've got right now is a desperate
need in our food system to free up the innovators

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:12.419
at the bottom.

00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:19.340
Farmers like us that are returning with high-tech,
techno-glitzy stuff like electric fencing

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.390
and 4 wheel drive diesel tractors, with front
end loaders and chipper shredders, large scale

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.750
composting and all that kind of stuff.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:36.220
But taking that heritage normal biological
cycling with a healthy dose of appropriate

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:43.080
technology, marrying the two together and
coming with an innovative anecdote -- antidote

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:51.000
not anecdote -- antidote to the problems we
face in our ecology in our food system.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.240
And we have to be able to start from the tailgate
of a pickup truck; from an innovative kitchen

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.419
in our homes.

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:03.600
We have to be able to start there to access
our neighborhoods and our communities with

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:10.170
innovative antidotes to what Wal-Mart and
Costco are offering us.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.470
And so, that's just as much as I'll say.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.260
You can ask more questions about the food
police.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.100
That's as much as I'll say right now.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:22.340
But it is absolutely an innovation thread
that runs through everything and that's why

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:31.510
innovation always occurs in the economic sectors
of least governmental penetration.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:38.480
And that's why government regulation is stifling
true innovation and antidotes to the problems

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480
of society.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.460
And so, that's all I'll say right there about
the food police.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.159
We can go onto more questions and answer.

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.789
I think I'd like to stop right there.

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:52.390
That gives you a few tidbits of some of the
things that are in this book "Folks, This

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.390
Ain't Normal".

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:59.040
I think you'll find it a very broad cultural
and I think many of you when you look at,

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.750
you know, the result of having a Manhattan
project for ammunition but not having a Manhattan

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.450
project for compost.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.640
You'll get this wonderful epiphany that you
understand some of the wonderful things you've

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:16.340
heard about elitism and we can't feed the
world will be set in their cultural context

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.630
as we carry the past into the future.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:25.850
Because my belief is that the chances are
the next hundred years we will need to return

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:37.110
to a more localized, truly solar driven, carbon
cycling, biomimicked, kind of existence than

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:43.649
we have learned to enjoy in the last 50 years
as we have abdicated historical normalcy in

00:31:43.649 --> 00:31:45.620
our civilization.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.860
Questions?

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.650
Comments, anything at all on how all this
works.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.650
[Applause]

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.070
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thanks for speaking today.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.230
So, I think I buy into just about everything
you're saying.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.980
But at the same time I think in order for
us to actually have the kind of change you

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.270
want to have, we need more than just rich
Bay Area people pulling for it.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.040
I think the system is kind of stacked against,
you know, sustainable farmers and the real

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:20.732
cost of, you know, factory pork isn't what's
reflected in the price but the fact of the

00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:27.790
matter is if I was spending most of my income
on food, it's hard for me to then also get

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:34.040
what, you know, we think is better, more humanely
raised, and sustainably raised stuff.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:40.210
So have you any thoughts on how you get the
people who are not kind of us more bought

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:44.690
into the system and make it possible economically
for them to do.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:48.880
People like Alice Waters can say everybody
can afford this stuff but in reality I don't

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.510
think that's really true in every case.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.559
So how do we get people who aren't us to pull
for it, too.

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.789
&gt;&gt;Joel: Your question is well stated.

00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:58.710
I think there are two issues here.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:03.690
One is how do we get more people to buy in
just philosophically after all a lot of people

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:04.990
are still eating at McDonalds.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.889
And a lot of people still think they've eaten
a great dinner out of a box.

00:33:08.889 --> 00:33:16.299
I ran into a an art teacher in Washington,
D.C. she said I'm going to retire this year.

00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:20.190
Being a very astute male, I said you don't
look nearly old enough to retire.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.080
And she said well, I'm not.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.080
I'm frustrated.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.080
And I said why.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.960
She said because our first art project this
year and the first art project is to bring

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.340
in a cooking pot.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.470
This is tenth grade.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.010
Bring in a cooking pot and draw it because
they come in different shapes and sizes and

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.309
they're fairly basic and easy to draw.

00:33:37.309 --> 00:33:43.029
And so, yesterday I did the assignment and
all the kids looked at me -- 22 in the class--

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:47.300
looked at me like I had two heads and they
said, "we don't have a cooking pot in our

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.300
house."

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.440
Said "what do you do?"

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.620
"We just open a box and stick it in the microwave."

00:33:51.620 --> 00:34:01.440
So I think the question is two things -- one
is how do we get more people to just buy into

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.440
the idea that I should have a relationship
with my food you know.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:12.130
You know, we live in a culture in which people
are far more interested and passionate about

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.700
the latest body piercing and hair style in
Hollywood than they are about what's going

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.620
to become flesh of their flesh and bone of
their bone at 5 o'clock.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.980
And this is abnormal.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.530
Now, the answer to that is simply we have
to lead by example.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:33.950
And that's where this headquarters is leading
in the institutional edge by example.

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.920
What you've done here with your meal plan
and with all these -- with sourcing and all

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.270
that is leading.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.060
I call it leadership and that's what needs
to happen is leadership by example.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.240
But the second part of your question is about
the high price.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.070
And essentially it is the charge of this is
really an elitist movement.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.630
This is really about elitism.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:59.800
Now, when anybody ever comes up to me and
talks about the price -- that they can't afford

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.180
this food -- I know this is very unpolitically
correct.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.540
You won't find very many politically correct
things in this book.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:14.120
My first response is: right now we'll get
in your car and it better be a cheap car not

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:19.160
an expensive care and we're going to go to
your house or apartment wherever you live

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.861
and this is what we're not going to see in
your house because you can't afford this.

00:35:23.861 --> 00:35:26.780
This is what we're not going to see.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.790
We're not going to see any sodas.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.830
We're not going to see any alcohol.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.880
We're not going to see any a tobacco.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.600
We're not going to see any coffee or tea.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.410
You really can live without those things.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.850
We're not going to see TVs or iPods.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:41.550
We're not going to see lottery tickets or
Disney vacation cruises.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:47.730
We're not going to see hundred dollar designer
jeans with holes already in the knees.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.030
[laughter] We're not going to see -- are you
with me.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.310
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:53.310
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.540
Here's the thing.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:06.580
The fact is very, very, very few people have
no choice about how to spend their money.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.700
And I would say -- and I know again it sounds
very uncharitable--, but I would say instead

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.590
of us sitting here today picking the lint
out of our belly buttons stewing over how

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:24.160
to deal with maybe the 2 percent who really
have a problem, let's instead look around

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.670
and say, "well, all of us that can, what's
my problem?

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.150
What's my excuse?"

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:38.680
And the fact is if the 98 percent of the people
who could do something would do it, it would

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.740
so fundamentally change the fringes that the
argument would change in a way that we can't

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.740
even imagine.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:54.770
You know, it's like people with a 4-acre suburban
lawn coming together at their garden club

00:36:54.770 --> 00:37:05.320
meeting and stewing about, you know, the 4-child
single mom in Harlem that can't grow a garden.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.020
Why don't all you people grow a garden?

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.340
We got 35 million acres of lawn in this country.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.540
36 million acres growing food and housing
and recreational horses.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.990
That's 71 million acres.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:21.030
That's enough to feed the whole country without
a single farm.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.830
So the point is every one who can should.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.710
And if everyone who could would, it would
so fundamentally change the parameters of

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.820
the argument that we can't even imagine the
innovation that would punch out the other

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.130
side.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:42.240
And, if it became more normal again, a lot
of things would happen -- economies of scale

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.060
just regular things that happen when something
becomes more normal.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.570
Next question?

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.570
Yes.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.590
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Hi.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.220
I'm from the big island of Hawaii.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.610
I have a farm and a community there.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.600
We've had -- we integrate chickens.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.630
We make biochar.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.150
We generate all our inputs.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.150
It's all very lovely.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.180
&gt;&gt;Joel: Wow, you are weird.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.180
Okay.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.180
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.180
Yeah.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.650
&gt;&gt;Male #2: A lot of us here are technologists.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:12.900
And sometimes when technologists get into
the carbon, we geek out on agriculture.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.030
&gt;&gt;Joel: Absolutely.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.720
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Anyhow.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:23.650
Ultimately though, like many people in agriculturally
sustainable parts of the world, it's not economically

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.650
sustainable.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.910
We weren't able to for instance build a house
for our growing family.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:33.750
So like many many families one of us has to
leave and go to the city -- or Google in my

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:41.290
case -- and be either wash cars of rich people
or be a software engineer -- my case -- and

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.530
send the money home to the farm.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.220
This is like -- it's a -- it's common.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.650
It feels -- it's tragic in a way.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:57.220
I mean, I would love to be there with my chickens
and grass and everything.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:05.310
But is this -- could you say some words about
the people who have to leave the farms to

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.940
make it work?

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.280
Because the system is stacked against actually
doing it the right way.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280
&gt;&gt;Joel: Yes, yes.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.450
Well, if you would like me to, I would say,
" bless you my son.."

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.940
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.340
Amen.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:25.620
&gt;&gt;Joel: But in actuality, we haven't gotten
where we are overnight and we won't get out

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.330
of it overnight.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:34.270
And as you know, all innovation requires disturbance.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.800
We know that.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:42.251
All succession, all, you know, freshing up
whether it's for ideas, technology, policy

00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:46.110
-- it all requires disturbance.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:51.710
And so, what you're going through in your
life right now is the disturbance of an innovative

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.540
idea that you have brought to your home, your
family.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.010
Chance are you didn't grow up on a farm.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:04.040
Chances are you have this green bug in your
genes somewhere, you know?

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.860
Both Gen and Jean.

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:14.500
You have this thing that is wanting you to
move forward that way.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.020
And a lot of people do.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:23.270
A lot of people really want to do something
with their hands as a craftsman or an artisan.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:34.720
And I think our culture has failed the blue
collar craftsmanship of our age by worshiping

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:44.320
just intellectual, academic, cerebral pursuits
without appreciating the balancing groundedness

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:52.810
that calluses and not to mention immunofunction
occurs when we assault our immunofunction

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:58.280
with exercise with calluses and splinters
and dirt under our fingernails or grease or

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.280
whatever.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:05.720
And so, what you see, then, is you see people
with physical, visceral hobbies whether it's

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:11.680
building sailboats or gardening or doing something.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.560
We've got people now learning to cut meat
in big cities.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.980
It used to be like big Tupperware parties.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.740
Now it's meat-cutting parties.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.660
[laughter] Because people want to get in there
and touch it, sense it.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.490
It's the Lexus and the olive tree phenomenon.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:29.830
And so, in a place like this you see it very
acutely.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:35.700
And so, I think what you're trying to do is
absolutely phenomenal and laudable and I think

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.840
there are principles that hopefully -- I wrote
a book "You Can Farm".

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:40.840
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I read it.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:47.130
&gt;&gt;Joel: That can hopefully help stimulate
some creativity in how to jump start that

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.130
forward.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:53.330
But at the end of the day what you're trying
to do is leave a legacy that has moved us

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:56.960
innovatively in some direction.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.140
And maybe you won't accomplish it completely
even in your lifetime.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:07.460
In fact, I've heard, if a vision can be accomplished
in your lifetime, it's too small.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.110
My dad used to say, if you don't suck a seed
just suck and suck and suck until you do suck

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.110
a seed.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:16.770
So just keep after it.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:21.050
And remember that anything worth doing is
worth doing poorly first.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.020
We've all heard Grandma.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.370
We come do adulthood.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.910
You know we're children and we're willing
to experiment with things.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:35.830
And we come to adulthood and we become paralyzed
with analysis and fear because we can hear

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:40.560
Grandma over our shoulder, "if it's worth
doing, it's worth doing right."

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.310
And the fact is, nobody does it right the
first time.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.310
Nobody.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:51.430
I mean, it would be equivalent to, you know,
to going to a family shindig and here's a

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:58.150
little toddler and the first time Janie tries
to stand up, she gets up on a chair she's

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:00.740
wide eyed, "Oh look Janie's starting to stand."

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:06.590
Of course she gets this great big grin, she
loses her grip on the chair and falls down

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.510
on her diaper and all the adults gather around
and say "Janie, if you can't walk any better

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.610
than that just quit".

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.921
[laughter] We don't do that do we?

00:43:13.921 --> 00:43:16.520
We say, "oh, wow, she's doing."

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.320
And the fact is all of us toddle first.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.190
And so, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing
poorly first and just be encouraged by that

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.630
and keep going after it.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:34.790
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Your answer to -- so Kevin's
question was more or less -- there's a lot

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.250
of people out there who can't afford to eat
well and your answer was well they can afford

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.560
to eat well they just choose not to.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.870
So how do you change the mind set and convince
them that it's something worth doing as opposed

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.990
to something that's not worth doing.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:53.070
And I have a second question which is, if
you were king for a day and could change three

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:59.360
policies or behaviors or do three things to
fix the U.S. food system what three things

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.680
would those be.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.000
&gt;&gt;Joel: Oh my.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.310
You moved this question -- okay.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:07.750
So we'll go to your king for a day one.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:13.360
Yeah, because I do believe that it is a mind
set.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.880
I did a class for a college.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.600
It was a real elite girl's private college
on global food issues.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.180
The professor of global food issues wanted
me to come and be a guest lecture.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.290
I said, "let us do something different.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:31.300
Get us a classroom with a cooking range in
it.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.090
You go get some salsa and some good local
artisanal cheese.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:39.590
I'll bring some apple juice from our neighbor's
biological apple orchard.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.580
I'll bring some eggs and some skillets okay?

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.870
So we went in there and I did omelets for
these college students.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.630
You know, sixty-second omelets.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.500
And we had the salsa; we had this cheese.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.960
We had this apple juice to die for.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.230
It's cold pressed; it's got an inch of sediment
on the bottom.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:01.260
You have to be careful eating it because you
could guzzle it and ooh, I just ate six apples.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.410
And you have 24 hours to work through this
event.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:12.260
[laughter] But anyway, we did these wonderful
omelets for a buck 50 a plate in two minutes

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.490
per.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:14.490
So I asked the students.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:18.380
I said so -- because college students are
always forlorn no money, no time, blah, blah,

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380
blah.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.920
I said so how many of you watched a movie
this week.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.080
All of them.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.700
How many of you put money in a vending machine
this week?

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.370
All of them.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:29.650
Okay?

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:30.930
See?

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:33.530
We live in a culture that's all about victimhood.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:35.810
Victims, victims, victims.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.950
I mean, and we're hard wired to remember what
stops us not what makes us go.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.980
That's why we call them stoplights and not
go lights, okay?

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.110
So we dwell on the negative.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.720
We dwell on the negative.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.820
And so, the positive part of the question,
if I were king for the day what couple of

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.380
policies would I do to really move this forward?

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.340
Ooh, that is a big one.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:07.370
The first one I would do, is to eliminate
all farm subsidies.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:10.190
All subsidies.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.450
All these things that -- and you know what?

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.120
There are a lot of things that aren't overt
farm subsidies.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.730
They're kind of sweetheart deals.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:27.340
You know, things that, for example, make it
cheaper to bring a container load of apples

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:33.570
from China than pick apples from our own trees.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:40.380
Because that's, you know, if you use -- because
of all the laws regarding that.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.951
So I would certainly eliminate all the subsidies.

00:46:41.951 --> 00:46:47.910
The second thing I would do, is amend the
constitution with a food emancipation proclamation.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:52.130
[laughter] And I would grant every citizen
of the United States.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:57.020
And I am dead -- it's funny but I am dead
serious about this -- I would grant every

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:02.510
citizen of America the right to food freedom
of choice.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.180
We do not have that in our culture.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:10.400
And the Food and Drug Administration now,
in response to several suits filed by the

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.470
farm to consumer legal defense fund, which
I call the NRA of food choice in our country.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:18.540
And everybody should join it because I want
it to be as big as the NRA.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:24.040
Because you see we've been granted the freedom
to own guns, worship, assemble and speak.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.300
Well, what good is it to have those freedoms
if you don't have the freedom to choose the

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:35.770
fuel to feed your 3 trillion member internal
community of beings that fuels you to go,

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.010
shoot, pray, and preach?

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:43.370
[laughter] It happen only reason that our
founders did not give us the freedom of food

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:51.151
choice is because they couldn't have imagined
a day in which you couldn't, you know, buy

00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:56.240
raw milk from your neighbor and California
has now, you know, incarcerated these three

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:04.000
folks down in Los Angeles for having the audacity
to take their herd share goat milk from their

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.330
own animals off the farm and drink it in their
own homes with their own families.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.340
Now, folks this is tyranny.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:16.970
And we're supposedly fighting tyranny around
the world with our military while our own

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:25.280
USDA food police sends swat teams out to farmers
and confiscate food out of domestic freezers

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:31.340
to keep families from being able to eat foods
of their choice.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:37.940
So I would emancipate food from its enslavement
by Monsanto's agenda.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.300
And anyone who thinks Monsanto is your friend,
think again.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.820
You know, we have trespass law in this country.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.360
If I came to your house or your yard and dumped
a bunch of garbage on your lawn that you didn't

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.570
want, I'd probably -- the prosecuting attorney
would come against me for trespassing violations,

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:56.690
right?

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:03.850
But Monsanto can go and dump promiscuous pollen.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:05.980
Those are interesting words.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:22.540
[laughter] Promiscuous pollen that runs rampant
around the community creating sexual orgies

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:34.680
in my plants with life forms of garbage that
I don't want and our country -- our own president

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:42.970
-- our Democratic president thinks that I
should have to pay Monsanto a royalty for

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:49.180
the privilege of their promiscuous pollen.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.030
This ain't normal.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.260
So.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.420
I would absolutely say, "you know what?

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.820
You own you".

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.170
And you can word it however you want to.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:09.430
But I would say every person is now -- if
you want to take responsibility for your own

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:14.840
person hood and your own 3 trillion member
of internal community of beings, you can do

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.840
it.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.360
You can do it.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.880
[laughter] You know.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.580
Now, if you don't want to and you still want
a USDA stamp on all the food you eat to certify

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:31.040
that it's gone through the industrial food
fraternity, that's fine with me.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.650
And you will find me -- I will not be picketing
McDonalds.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:35.660
I will not be picketing the World Trade Organization.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:38.130
I will not be picketing Monsanto.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:50.590
What I want is to let we native Americans
who honor heritage indigenous foods to be

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.880
able to eat it and for you to be able to buy
it.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:03.950
And if we did that, folks, if we did that,
you would see an explosion of cottage industry

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.270
and domestic food systems like you cannot
imagine.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.550
Everywhere I go around the country.

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:12.030
This is a very unusual group for me to talk
to.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:18.270
My bread and butter group have been sustainable
ago groups farmers and greenie type food people.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:26.690
And everywhere I go there is just this almost
like a bull in the stall at the rodeo right

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.580
before they let him out or a horse right before
the horse race.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:38.260
There's just this chafing at the bit ready
to make egg noodles or quiche from my garden

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:45.540
produce or lacto-fermented sauerkraut or charcuterie
or artisanal cheese.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.610
There's this -- people are just nuts about
this.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:52:02.990
But in between them and their neighbor and
you is this huge food police that says, "Oh,

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:06.610
you can't make pickles in your house and sell
it to a neighbor, that's manufacturing.

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:11.090
You live in a residential community."

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:16.690
So I have a lady in Texas that told me she
got fined by her homeowner's association because

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:22.080
there's antifarming language in her homeowner's
association and she grew a tomato plant in

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.050
her vegetable, I mean flower garden and that's
farming.

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:35.000
So we have created -- we have taken our western,
Greco-Roman, reductionist, linear, compartmentalized,

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.040
fragmentized, systematized, disconnected,
individualized, parts-oriented, kind of thinking

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:51.750
to an unbelievable philosophical apartheid
and I think that those of us who want to come

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:57.640
back together in a more eastern holistic,
we're all related, and let me own my own body

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:04.730
-- those of us who want to do that and live
in our tepees and have our medicine man and

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.250
educate as runners instead of mathematics.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:17.350
Those of us who wanted to do that, should
be able to opt out of the greater cultural

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:22.520
that normalcy may not vanish from this side
of our world.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.520
Question.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.980
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Well, how to follow that one up?

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:33.530
So it seems that you're describing a really
wedged situation here with the laws and how

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:34.910
the money flows.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:38.931
And you know one of the characteristics of
a wedge like that is that the people who are

00:53:38.931 --> 00:53:43.970
benefiting the most are the beneficiaries
and they have power.

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.430
How do you break a cycle like that.

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:46.810
&gt;&gt;Joel: How do you break a cycle?

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.600
Well, that's why I didn't say -- see?

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:53.710
Notice I didn't say if I were king for a day,
I would shut down Monsanto.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.000
See, a lot of my friends would say that.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.590
If I were king for a day I would outlaw concentrated
animal feeding operations or I would outlaw

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:01.690
-- you know what I'm saying?

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.980
Or I would outlaw genetic modification or
whatever.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.980
You see?

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.580
I didn't say any of those things.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:11.160
I really believe and I think I'm at home in
this company here to say this.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:19.580
I really believe that the greatest innovation
and the greatest opportunity is when we allow

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:27.410
people to self-actualize their own individual
expression.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:33.100
That's why on our farm we create habitats
to preserve and enhance the pigness of the

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:37.700
pig, the chickenness of the chicken, and the
tomatoness of the tomato.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:45.770
It's in that environment of phenotypical distinctive
expression that you capture the essence of

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:51.400
the person and the essence of the gifts and
talents they bring to the table.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.550
And so, yes, it is a wedge.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:55:02.030
And that's why I think rather than try to
regulate out and cherry pick what we don't

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.240
like and regulate that out.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:14.420
If we just allow the people -- I mean, right
here the people who want to eat differently

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:21.290
and buy differently and by one meal at a time
create a different landscape for their grandchildren.

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:34.200
If we allow them to do that, it would just
completely topple Monsanto, Tyson, Ciba Geigy.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:40.720
The only reason they're able to enjoy their
position at the top is because they're protected

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:48.260
from competition at the bottom that is absolutely
-- that has absolutely jumped ship.

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:57.780
You know, very few people I think really trust
Kraft Food to take care of them anymore.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.470
We've been there, done that, okay?

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.940
And look where we are.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:06.670
We've exchanged 18 percent food costs and
9 percent health care to 9 percent food costs

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:08.090
and 18 percent health care.

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.820
We've been there done that.

00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:17.480
Just like people who are looking for breast-feeding,
Lamaze, home schooling, free food in an institutional

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480
setting.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.890
Who would have dreamed of this five years
ago?

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.600
Who would have dreamed of it, okay?

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:36.510
This is indicative of an entire desire to
not entrust the current powers that be with

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.760
my body, my food, and my being.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:47.890
And so, what we need to do is just free up
that -- free up that move, okay?

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.550
Let it go.

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:56.660
And that's what scares the current big players
to death.

00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:02.820
But that's where I'm coming from freedom from
the bottom up not from regulation top down.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.830
And that's the difference.

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:08.700
&gt;&gt; Liv Wu: I love finding this.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.300
And I want to read it and have you comment
on it.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.570
You call it "scaling up without selling your
soul."

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:21.911
[reading] "Many successful entrepreneurial
startups morph into Wall Street empires that

00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:28.350
lose their distinctiveness and in the process
the business chews up and spits out its workers

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:32.050
and founders in a mad scramble to dominate
something.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:38.450
Does middle ground exist between the calm
talking stick circle of indigenous circle

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:44.960
of eastern tribal cultures and the mad scramble
frenzy of western capitalism.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:50.170
Or perhaps more to the point, in light of
recent Wall Street and economic developments,

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:54.950
what values are more important than growth?

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:58.990
Especially since cancer is growth."

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:02.950
Please talk about this whether it's the food
chain or larger.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.840
&gt;&gt;Joel: Sure.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.270
What she just read is something that I wrote
actually.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:15.320
You didn't say that I wrote it, but I wrote
that in response to -- I'm going to be very

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:22.360
personal with you as our farm grew and as
our business grew we saw small entrepreneurial

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.830
endeavors like ours be gobbled up.

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:29.590
Look at organics today and look at the take
overs of the little innovative organic players

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:33.540
in the game and they've been bought up by
the big food companies.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:40.980
We got scared frankly because we didn't want
to get gobbled up like this and sell our soul.

00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:51.500
And so, we developed a ten-step value statement
for Polyface farms that is a totally anti-Wall

00:58:51.500 --> 00:59:00.810
Street empire-building capitalistic value
statement that I gave first to Fortune 500

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:05.150
middle managers at the Innovation Immersion
Summit in Phoenix, Arizona about five years

00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.430
ago.

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.860
And I've given it several times.

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:11.100
It probably should be a book.

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:18.830
But as we looked at what is it that defines
us as a opposed to a typical, you know, a

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:23.990
typical like global, Wall Street-type, capitalistic
corporation?

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:25.450
There were distinctive that came about.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:29.170
And I won't give all ten of them to you but
I'll give a few.

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:37.320
The first one was so we resolved ourselves
that we would never have a sales target.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.440
No sales target.

00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:42.500
We don't measure success by sales.

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:46.590
As soon as you start measuring success by
sales or you create quotas or you say we want

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:51.150
to be at this stage by such and such a date,
this many customers, this many sales.

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:59.470
As soon as you do that, you begin looking
at people as commodities to buy, sell, and

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:00.470
trade.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.140
In my scramble to the top of the heap.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:08.350
You know, notches in my hatchet if you will,
okay?

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:17.410
And so, we want sales to be an organic -- almost
a serendipitous outgrowth of quality and service.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:21.460
And so, we don't assume -- this brings me
to my second segue.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.080
The second one is: we will never advertise.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.580
All growth, if it's going to be, has to come
from satisfied word of mouth.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.080
Now, it's fascinating to me that even the
companies that spend 2 million dollars for

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:40.550
a thirty-second Superbowl ad still get 70
percent of their customers according to business

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:44.430
journals by satisfied customers -- word of
mouth.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:46.930
It still works.

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:52.600
And so -- and that is certainly a mantra here
at Google.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.930
It works.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:01:00.470
So we don't assume, if sales drop off, we
don't assume we're not spending enough on

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:01.550
advertising.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:07.610
We assume that we must not be giving the quality
or service or whatever.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:08.610
Okay?

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.610
In other words.

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:15.570
And what this does is instead of immediately
making us look outside, it makes us look inside

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:20.630
and we think that's healthy for the organism.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:27.050
Another one is that we will never patent or
copyright.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.630
Whoa -- talk about anti-Wall Street.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.770
Here's the deal.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.060
We want to be lean and mean.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:37.730
And if we never patent anything, then that
means, we have to stay lean and mean to stay

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.800
ahead against the copiers.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:45.500
And if we can't stay one stride ahead of the
copiers, then we don't deserve to be in charge.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.970
Because really, all these ideas are just gifts.

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:54.940
And I know -- boy, that's a real big one,
okay?

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:59.690
Especially since this morning I was reading
about Steve Jobs and the antipathy between

01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:03.700
Apple and Google and I'm watching all of your
Apple computers here.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.840
[laughter] And realizing a lot of Google money
bought Apple computers.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:19.560
So anyway, the idea here is that innovation
really in a lot of ways is just -- is very

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.750
much a stroke of blessing, genius and epiphany.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:34.140
And so, the innovators should be sharp enough
to stay a little bit ahead of the copy catters.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.940
So those are just three.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:43.470
But there are ten of these that we have identified
-- one is defining our -- a fourth one is

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:44.690
defining our market.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:47.730
We won't deliver more than four hours away
from the farm.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:52.740
Because four hours out and 4 hours back is
about as much as one person can drive in one

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:53.740
day.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:57.690
Which creates an ability for transparency.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.310
We don't want to ship anywhere.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.070
We want people to come to the farm.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:08.790
We have a 24/7, 365 open door unannounced
policy.

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:13.310
Instead of a no trespassing sign, we want
to put up a sign "trespassers will be impressed."

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:20.000
[laughter] And that's our commitment to transparency.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.600
We're not concerned about copy catters.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:27.060
We're not concerned about diseases, because
our animals have an immune system.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:33.640
[laughter] We want people to come and viscerally
participate in this so that, when we sit down

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:40.510
to dine to this intimate experience of dining,
there is a partner we've danced with prior

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:43.610
to meal.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.460
And that creates integrity.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.760
Maybe one more question -- what's our time
like?

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760
One more and we're over?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.760
OK, one more.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.240
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Thank you Joel for everything you
do.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.710
Really really appreciate it.

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.190
You mentioned the power of word of mouth.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:59.940
And that's definitely something we're working
on here at Google and aiming to make it better

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940
at.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.160
We've announced some things that are coming
along those lines.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.770
I think you'll find some people in this room
and this company that will be very willing

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:08.920
to help you get your message out.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.890
Given your difficulty with the swipe card
at the hotel this morning is there anything

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:16.580
we can do as a individuals or as a company
to help you get that message out.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.910
&gt;&gt;Joel: [chuckles] Thank you.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:25.780
I would say well for one is -- that's one
reason I like to write.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.830
Because to me, that is a way -- and this is
by the way available on audio and Kindle,

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.980
you know -- this book.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:38.480
But to get this kind of thinking penetrated
into our culture.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.550
But you guys -- when you said you want to
help, you have a great big voice here.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:45.010
You have a huge voice.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:50.930
And your voice to bring balance can be extremely
powerful.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:05:04.830
And so, I think that individually in your
ripple of influence, you can add things to

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:12.980
the pot whether it's how you eat, where you
recreate, what you do, what you value as a

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.510
individual and then as a corporation, as a
business.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:24.240
There are certainly things that you could
do -- like you're doing -- more of the same.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.730
And continuing to use your purchasing power
-- I mean, I'm hearing about buying whole

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:29.730
animals.

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:30.730
That's a big deal.

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.280
So the cafes have to work together.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.180
This one does T-bones this one wants meatloaf
and so you get together and you use the whole

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:38.180
animal.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.180
And you use some blemished fruit.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.990
And you use some blemished tomatoes.

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.100
Maybe Google could start a cannery here.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:50.630
Maybe you could have some canning classes
and take this one step further in domestic

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:54.740
food preparation to stimulate domestic culinary
arts.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:06:00.850
Because ultimately this big change is not
going to occur -- I mean, it can't occur just

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:06.200
with the farmers and just with the food preparers
or chefs or processors.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:12.490
It ultimately has to penetrate to the way
we live so that our homes -- rather than just

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:17.420
-- and our kitchens -- rather than just being
a pit stop between everything that's important

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:23.950
in life out there actually become an epicenter
of how we live, use our lives and our economic

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:29.520
commerce that we domesticate our values.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:34.370
And that is something that all of us can work
on.

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:39.150
And that's something I'm sure Google can continue
to work on when I hear about 3 hour commutes

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.680
and that sort of thing.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:49.740
And so, you know, telecommuting, working from
home, those kinds of things are ways to move

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:55.780
that -- to take this information economy and
move it to the next step which is the regenerative

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.780
economy.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.430
That's the next step we've got to go.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:02.750
We've been the agrarian, we've been the industrial,
we've been the information, now we've got

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.390
to move on to the regenerational economy.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:07.920
Okay, everybody.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.610
Thank you for letting me visit with you.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.610
[Applause]

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:17.800
&gt;&gt; Joel: Now, may all of your carrots grow
long and straight.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:25.820
May your radishes be large and not pithy,
may your drip irrigation never spring a leak.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:33.510
[laughter] May your kitchens be places of
aesthetic, aromatic, romantic sensuality.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:37.880
And may we all commit ourselves to making
the world better than we inherited.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880
Blessings on all of you.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880
Thank you so much.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:39.881
[Applause]
