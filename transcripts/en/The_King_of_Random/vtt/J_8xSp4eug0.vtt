00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
In the past,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
you've seen Grant teach you
how to make a rope maker,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.480
and how to make
a few types of DIY rope.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.800
Well today, we are going
to test those kinds of rope.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.300
We're going to see
how much weight they can take

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.400
before they break.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.380
[Music]

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.700
Guys, you've seen
Grant make rope before.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.600
You've even learned

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.800
how to make a rope maker
from him, and today,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.400
we're going to put
that to the test.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.900
This one is made from cord.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.940
We've also got some sisal twine,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.600
and finally, a rope made
out of soda bottles.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.500
So to test these types of ropes,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.619
we can't just say, oh,
we pulled this hard

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.443
until it snaps.

00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:39.129
So, we've got
an industrial scale.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.420
It's a crane scale.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.700
We're going to secure the rope

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.642
in between this scale
and a truck,

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.289
and then start driving away.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.612
We're going to film this screen,
and see how high it gets right

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:49.969
before the rope gives out.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.200
Maybe the ropes will snap.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Maybe the ropes will
stretch to the point

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
where they're not securing
anything anymore.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.900
We just want to see
how high the scale gets

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.900
before that happens.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
That should tell us
how strong our rope is.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.000
48.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.120
40-- 50.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.100
You hit 50.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.900
Almost 51.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.220
[Music]

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.540
43.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.600
43 pounds, not bad.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.720
Okay, you got like
10 pounds on me.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.700
We're going to take three kinds

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.100
of DIY rope that Grant
has shown you in the past,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.388
and we're going to put them
on a powerful scale,

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:24.800
and pull on them with a truck

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.020
to see how long they last
before they snap.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.620
[Music]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.500
Almost 60.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.600
Okay.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
So our powers combined
doesn't do much.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.100
Once we've made some rope
that we can hold onto,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.637
I think we'll be able
to do a lot more than that.

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:40.941
Yeah.

00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:44.080
The problem right now is
that it's less about strength,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.130
and more about what
your fingers can take.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:02:16.340
[Music]

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.800
We've made all
of our types of rope.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.869
We've got them out here,

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.331
and we've got
two big old trucks,

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:22.800
and we're gonna pull them
and see what happens to them.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.000
First off, best bet,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.700
which one do you think
is gonna be strongest?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.300
I kind of think
that the the triple braided

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.600
sisal rope is going
to be the strongest.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.100
I agree.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.540
Yeah.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.200
I think the Mason twine is
actually going to be stretchier,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.470
but the sisal twine is going
to be a lot of stronger.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.360
All right, so we have
a single piece of the sisal,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.076
a single piece of
the Mason twine,

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.307
then for both of those,

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:45.288
we've got three twists
braided together,

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:46.893
which is actually six strands,

00:02:46.893 --> 00:02:49.300
because it's three
times going there and back,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.660
and then we have three
of those twisted together,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.960
as well as the soda bottle rope
that Grant made,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.436
and we're going
to test all of them.

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:57.400
Just want to point out,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.880
we've made a quick
modification to our scale.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.580
You can't really see too well
what's going on necessarily,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.600
but this is a GoPro
that's just facing the numbers,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.607
and we don't know.

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:10.400
This might twist or something
as we're pulling on it,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.000
and this way,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.800
the GoPro is sort
of locked in place.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.052
It's always facing the screen.

00:03:14.052 --> 00:03:16.229
We should always be able to see
what's on the screen.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.706
It's filming at
a high frame rate,

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:19.138
so right before the rope breaks,

00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:21.600
we should see the maximum
pull strength that it gets to.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.150
First up is the single
strand of Mason line.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.900
We'll see what it gets to.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.770
I bet that
immediately just flips.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.300
Oh, yeah.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.880
[Music]

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.640
All right, you're
starting to lift.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.700
Hey, it lifted it up.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:41.497
All right, you can add
a little bit more tension.

00:03:41.497 --> 00:03:44.160
[Music]

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.280
Camera's spinning
around like crazy.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.600
Done.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.660
I think it did actually
break at the knot.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.606
Doesn't matter how strong
your rope it is

00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:55.710
if the knot can't take it.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.584
Most of the time

00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:59.760
you're not going to just have
two plates squishing down

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.700
on top of your rope
as you pull away.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100
So that should be our first one.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.407
Yep.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.620
Let's move on to the sisal.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.880
[Music]

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.900
It's lifting.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900
It broke.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.300
So that broke very quickly.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.960
I'm interested to see
what that got to.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.580
All right.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.200
So we tested
our individual strands.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.700
Next is our three strand rope,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
and we're going
with the sisal twine this time,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.900
because we think it's going
to break faster just

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.200
after that initial tests.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.900
So these little
u-shaped brackets,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.400
they tightened down quite a bit.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.500
This is what we're going
to be using for everything,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.300
other than the single strands,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.700
just because we don't have
to tie knots this way.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.700
We've got liftoff.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.800
Better than the last one.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.780
[Music]

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.620
Stop.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.200
[Music]

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.900
This wasn't as tight as I
was hoping it would,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.014
but it's still
snapped the twine.

00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:02.318
Yeah.

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.260
So, I think it was
a good result.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.900
We'll see once we get
to the bigger ropes,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.600
but now I'm banking
on the Mason twine.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.080
That's lit.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.340
[Music]

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.740
It is lifting.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.500
[Music]

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.940
It is stretching.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.640
[Music]

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.640
Keep going.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.620
[Music]

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.200
Huh?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.680
So it's actually putting...

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.760
&gt;&gt; Stop!
&gt;&gt; pressure?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.800
I'm not sure what failed.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.855
I think it was just the rope.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:43.208
This looks very broken.

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:43.960
Yeah.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.480
Now that I would say definitely
at a much higher strength.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.391
So using these little
you bracket shape pieces,

00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.100
one of them is now missing.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.209
Because I think

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:58.660
when the rope broke, it kind
of got launched somewhere,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.100
and we haven't yet found
where that somewhere is.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.280
[Music]

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.000
I got it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.900
No more rope attached though.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.760
[Music]

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.280
I don't think it needs
much interaction,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.596
but I'm going to back
up more because...

00:06:17.596 --> 00:06:19.070
I don't want to
snap and hit you.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.420
Now, we started
launching metal pieces.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.740
[Music]

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.280
It is lifting.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
[Music]

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.680
It is stretching.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.900
I hate this.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.560
It is broken.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.400
It broke.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.310
Sure enough.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.820
It just keep breaking near where
we're putting tension on it.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.460
But..

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.500
That is extremely common.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.600
Most cords, ropes,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.630
tethers will break
where you have a knot,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.230
just because it's being pinched.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.800
There's extra pressure
right there.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.900
I still think
we're getting good data.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.560
All right, time for what we
assume to be our strongest.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.840
[Music]

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.000
We have liftoff.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.700
Stretching.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.680
Stretching more.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.060
Broke.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.880
Nice.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.800
Holy cow.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.700
This stuff is crazy strong.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.100
So I think these two broke,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.434
and then this one stayed on,
and just kept stretching,

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:19.663
and then it broke as well.

00:07:19.663 --> 00:07:20.240
Yeah.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.000
All right.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.100
I think this is
our strongest one,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.700
but we still got
one more to test.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.077
We do.

00:07:24.077 --> 00:07:25.900
We have our soda bottle rope,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.967
and I don't know much
about the strength

00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:29.500
of the soda bottle rope.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.500
But we want to know.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.410
I believe Grant hung
from the soda bottle rope.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.513
So that's some amount of weight.

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:38.800
That's an indication,
but it's not an exact number.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.646
So now we want to get
an exact number.

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:45.540
[Music]

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.300
I do think it'll break,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.900
but I think it
will stretch a lot

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.700
before it breaks.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.000
All right, let's find out.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.540
[Music]

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.660
Lifting.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.500
Stretching.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.880
Stretching.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.757
Stretching.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.700
Wow.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.300
Stretching.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.520
Holy cow!

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.880
Broken.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:16.100
[Music]

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.920
Looks like we just had one,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.630
one of our little ropes
doing all the work here.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.425
One broke last.

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:21.400
Yeah.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.700
Same thing that happen
with the other one.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.590
Like two of them broke,

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.980
and then it stretched
a little bit more,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.800
and then it broke more.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.400
Very cool.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.660
Let's take a look
at our results.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.500
All right, reviewing footage.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.200
First up, the string.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.171
The Mason twine,
one strand of it.

00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:38.556
I think it reached five pounds.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.740
[Music]

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.720
Wow.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.980
[Music]

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.700
It can pull more weight
than I can pull just with the,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.560
the two bars together.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.080
41-40--.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.440
Oh, it hit 49.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.300
That was a 49.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.100
48 to 49.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.980
49.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.600
Yeah.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.100
Yeah.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.000
&gt;&gt; 49 and then...
&gt;&gt; In just a second.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.860
All right, do you think
this one pulled more or less?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.700
I'm thinking way less.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.100
Well, remember how
quick it snaps.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.403
Yeah.

00:09:03.403 --> 00:09:04.280
It broke.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.680
It didn't--

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.720
&gt;&gt; It didn't even get completely--
&gt;&gt; Didn't even get tight, yeah.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.420
9.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.520
It hit 9, 10.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.540
Oh yeah.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.560
It's breaks at 10.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.960
The 10 flashed up there.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.890
I don't think it's
always that weak.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.600
I think we had like a weak spot.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.423
So it's that--

00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:21.500
It's made from fibers.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.700
Just these super
thin fibers twisted together.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.341
Overall, it's decently strong,

00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:27.400
but there are
sometimes weak points.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.200
And I think,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.400
we maybe had a knot
tied on a weak point,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.217
because ten pounds
is pretty little.

00:09:32.217 --> 00:09:35.230
It did obviously break without
even pulling the line tight.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.700
So, it might have really
just been 10 pounds on it.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.840
This is the sisal rope,
the six strands of it.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.920
Did hold tight,
little bit of stretching.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.500
And then snap.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.160
30, 50, 60--

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.920
It hit--

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.120
Oh.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.980
I think I saw--

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.680
Like 130.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.880
139 maybe?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.000
39, 139.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.480
I think it might be switching
from 20 to 30 but,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.360
we have one backward 6, 9.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.670
Moving on
to the Mason twine.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.600
So six strands of the Mason
twine twisted together.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.700
All right, 189.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.800
So 129-139 up to 189
with the Mason twine.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.700
Just one was about 130.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.400
We don't know exactly,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.211
because our scale
didn't get perfect reading.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.180
But about 130.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.290
3 times that,
do you think's going to be 390?

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.520
It's stretching.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.480
Oh, but this--

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.900
It's just slide, and snap.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.156
The slide is what's
interesting on this one.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.400
&gt;&gt; Oh, I think that's--
&gt;&gt; 299.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.660
That hit 299.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.920
Yeah, I think we're
at 293 there.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.280
Yeah, that's 293.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.140
All right, so not three
times as much.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.220
Almost up to 300 pounds.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.200
Those points where
it's binding together,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.499
where it's actually
being attached, those are going

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:52.800
to be a little bit weaker.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.200
So it's not fully as strong as
three times the strength of one,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.580
but it's quite a bit stronger.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.840
It's more than double.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.700
For a homemade rope
out of twine...

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.500
300 pounds is,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.753
you can be able to move a lot
of stuff at 300 pounds.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.140
Yeah.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.400
You're getting a
good strong rope.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.398
So stretchy.

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:11.552
Oh my goodness.

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:14.155
Stretching more.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.087
Broke.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.880
Nice.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.460
I remember, two
of them broke first,

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.580
and there just
ones stretched out--

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:22.610
Just holding on.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.560
Just stretching a lot.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520
What'd you get?

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.840
But before,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.100
when the first one broke,
we had a high point

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.800
of like 390 in there, I think.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.520
I think it's that...

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.620
389.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.100
Almost 300,

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.660
and then almost 400
for the Mason twine.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.900
Not quite there.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.940
But not bad.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.700
It's pretty serious rope.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.080
And now we've got one left,
the soda bottle.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.820
Where you think
the soda bottle rope opens up?

00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:55.670
I don't even know where to begin
to guess on this one.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.620
Lifting.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.691
That's so stretchy.

00:11:58.691 --> 00:11:59.845
Oh my goodness.

00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:01.419
Just goes out of frame.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.060
Stretching.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.800
Wow.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.920
I was kidding, but it does.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.860
Broken.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.740
Oh, it stretched a ton.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.497
Wow.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.900
Down.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.800
No way.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.680
That's it.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.540
Like 440--

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.100
The soda bottle rope
is our strongest rope.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.580
That's soda bottles.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.332
It was thicker.

00:12:24.332 --> 00:12:25.882
It was still a lot thicker too.

00:12:25.882 --> 00:12:27.100
But it doesn't matter.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.900
That's, that's volume, not mass.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.940
That's crazy.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.700
I did not think the soda bottle
rope would be that strong.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.540
