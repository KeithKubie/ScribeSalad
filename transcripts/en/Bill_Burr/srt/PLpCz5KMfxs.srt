1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,930
It's like a boss. I um,

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,570
I watched on Netflix, I watched that
Ukraine documentary, uh, winter on fire.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:22,230
[inaudible]

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,570
you know, it was just one of those
things where it's just like Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,300
I knew I wasn't politically active,
but watching what these people did,

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,480
what they turned around, I'll,

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,750
I'll try to give you a simple version
of what happened, which, you know,

8
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,501
with my brain,

9
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:42,501
that's all you're going
to get is basically what
happened I guess around 2003,

10
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:45,000
2004, uh,

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,790
there was some fucking
Russian dude pro Russian dude,

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,220
eight claim that he won the fucking
election. And they were like, no,

13
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,990
you didn't. Your piece
of shit. You rigged it.

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,910
And they proved it and he got bounced.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,790
In 2004 pro Russian candidate, Viktor
Yanukovych wins the presidential vote.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,830
The election was found
to be raped. As a result,

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,610
the people take to the streets in a
peaceful protest called the orange

18
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,444
revolution.

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,770
2009, the same dude comes
back and guess what?

20
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,290
He wins the election
like that wasn't corrupt.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,820
2010 Yana Covich returns this time.

22
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,970
The election is confirmed
and he regains full control.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,400
So anyways, you, the Ukraine is a
chance to join the European Union,

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,790
right? To start being more
like a European country.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,900
And for once and for all get out from
underneath a, whatever you call, whatever.

26
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,460
Russia has a dictatorship.

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,040
Fall 2013,

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,780
a key milestone of coaches as Yanukovych
appears ready to sign an association

29
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:48,800
with the EU. Yet as the
people look to the west,

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,020
their leader turns to the east and
the future of the nation hangs in the

31
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,854
balance.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,240
So the fucking Russian dude who
allegedly got elected legitimately,

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,470
you know, listens to the people and
they say that that's what we want to do.

34
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:07,540
We don't want to take
a step towards Russia.

35
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,750
We want to become part of the European
Union. We want to have a future here.

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,380
Like, um,

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,050
what we see going on in western Europe
and all of the fucking politicians go,

38
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:21,250
you got it. All right. The people have
spoken, we're gonna do what you said.

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,280
And what do you think happened? Right
in the midnight hour they gave him,

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,440
they all right there, Fred.
They're like, yeah, you know what?

41
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:30,160
We're not signed to that. And uh,
we're going go hang out with though.

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
Vladi daddy over there poop none.

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,850
Vladimir Putin and I were going to
fucking shoot 18 holes of golf with him,

44
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,980
but we're going to sell out
your country to the ruskies.

45
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,450
[inaudible]

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,140
so start it off this
whole fucking revolution.

47
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,300
I'm not going to say what the
fuck. I mean, you got to watch it.

48
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:01,300
It's unbelievable. But um, you know,

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,240
I mean it's totally, it's not in the
news. I mean, they ended up winning.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,450
They somehow ended up winning and these,
these fucking people had no weapons.

51
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,130
They were just getting shot at
what I don't understand. I mean,

52
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,750
I do understand it, but I, I,

53
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,030
there's no place in the world where
you can protest. You can't do it.

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,960
You protest,

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,880
cops show up and they beat the fuck out
of you until you go home and they arrest

56
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,700
a few and then that's it. Everyone.
It happens in this country,

57
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,470
this country with all its on would
have free brave freedom of speech.

58
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,300
You know those fucking occupy
Wall Street people, right.

59
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,290
They come down there,

60
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,930
they beat the fuck out of them
and everybody knows the old trick,

61
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,610
the same shit that they was.

62
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:45,480
They would claim when they did it in the
Ukraine where basically when you have a

63
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,970
peaceful demonstration, it's like, well
fuck, we can't beat the fuck out them.

64
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,823
What should we do?

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,930
They hire a couple people to go down
there and pretend to be the protesters.

66
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,620
They throw a couple of fucking rocks and
then the, the, the, the cops go nuts.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,420
No. So yeah, still

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,673
[inaudible] but then watch the

69
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:12,980
[inaudible]

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,813
and then on the newest,

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,390
they're like the protesters started
attacking the police. You know,

72
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,100
the police were just doing their job,

73
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,190
but Blahblahblahblah the police's job is
to go down there and beat the fuck out

74
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:26,630
of them. Alright, isn't it? Isn't that
what it is? Got Jesus Christ bills.

75
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,210
I Dunno what, what do you
know? I don't know. That's,

76
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,670
that's Kinda what I got out of
it. I got out of it that, um,

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,830
it was an amazing documentary that
these people actually with basically no

78
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:40,820
fucking weapons and just, you know, died,

79
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,630
lost their eyes, had all these horrific
fucking injuries, got kidnapped,

80
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,351
disappeared,

81
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:49,970
all of this horrific shit
and they were able to um,

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,310
hold them off for awhile.

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,113
Okay.

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,870
What is the [inaudible] [inaudible]

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,393
[inaudible] [inaudible]

86
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,080
[inaudible] what's the [inaudible]

87
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,150
so then the fucking Russian guy
ends up having to leave, right?

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,960
He fucking leaves and Da da Da.

89
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,450
He's a jolly good fellow.
It's all fucking over.

90
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,540
[inaudible]

91
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,720
and then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, this,

92
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:40,080
this other revolution starts
with people who are pro Russia.

93
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Since the, since the
document you've been made,

94
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,520
like 6,000 Ukrainian people died. But, um,

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,460
I'll try to say is if you get
a chance to check a Ukraine

96
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,450
winter on fire,

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,353
[inaudible]

98
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,320
our top story, this half hour,

99
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:10,190
dozens of activists are under arrest
after they've a demonstration and

100
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,420
Manhattans Union square got out of hand.

101
00:06:12,421 --> 00:06:14,100
The protest is entering its second week.

102
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,020
The arrest were caught on tape and
uploaded to youtube as part of the occupy

103
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,570
Wall Street movement. Today,

104
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:26,571
activists are speaking out against the
NYP di claiming officers used excessive

105
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,520
force during yesterday's
crackdown last night,

106
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:33,630
a group march to a police precinct
demanding answers about their friends who

107
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:35,790
were taken into custody
earlier in the day.

108
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,900
More than 80 people were arrested when
the group marched from Zuccotti Park to

109
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:44,460
union square where police corralled the
demonstrators with orange netting and

110
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:46,710
arrested. Those who would not disperse.

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,450
Many of the activists say the police were
overly aggressive and arrested people

112
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,560
without cause.
