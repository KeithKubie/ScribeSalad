PETE FRISELLA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.330
My name's Pete Frisella.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.985
I'm a developer advocate on
the Google Analytics team.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:15.630
I'd like to introduce you to a
new series we have called "Off

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.440
the Charts." This series is
about getting into the deep

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.240
features of Google Analytics,
understanding how it works,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.210
things you can do with it, and
how to use the feature itself.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.780
So today, I'd like actually
talk to you about getting

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.050
started with cost data upload,
and this is all about

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.835
measuring non-Google
paid campaigns.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.580
So let's talk about what
is cost data upload.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.730
I'll kind of get into little bit
more about what that means

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.710
and what cost data upload works,
how it works and the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.280
feature itself.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.090
Then we'll go into the
architectural overview, which

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.600
explains the deep details and
also how you would actually go

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.170
about uploading data to
Google Analytics.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.110
And then finally, we'll talk
a little bit about some

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.760
opportunities that are available
from a developer

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.780
perspective and also from
a business perspective.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.570
So with that, we'll
get started.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.280
So what is cost data upload,
and what does

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.459
cost data itself mean?

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.510
So this is all related to all
the paid campaigns you may be

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.560
running out there, all the
information that's related to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.950
that paid campaign.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.460
Whether it be ad costs, clicks,
impressions, the name

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.550
of the campaign, all this itself
relates to cost data.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.820
It's what we refer to as cost
data in Google Analytics.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.900
So for example, if you are
running a campaign, say with

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.220
Google AdWords, for example,
you'll know this is pretty

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.350
familiar for you.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.800
You've got cost data, and if
you link that to Google

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.210
Analytics, which is what you
should be doing, you actually

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.500
get these reports within
Google Analytics that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.580
highlight, for your paid
campaigns, how they're

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.320
performing.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.030
And they give you a lot more
information around how to

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.960
optimize certain key words,
maybe landing page

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.190
optimization.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.720
Now, these things are important
things, but to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.320
really do this analysis, you
need that cost data associated

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.960
with the campaigns that you're
running in Google AdWords.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.110
And this linking works really
well today, and it takes care

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.270
of all that for you.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.180
And it gives you some powerful
tools to take care of analysis

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.060
around campaigns and user
interaction, and how campaigns

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.100
are performing.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.020
The thing is, though, for
a lot of people, why we

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.760
encourage you to use Google
AdWords, we love Google

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.820
AdWords, obviously.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.610
There is other paid campaign
services out there that people

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.040
obviously use, and that includes
things like other

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.760
paid search services.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.730
You might be running in a
campaign on a social network.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.640
You might be doing email
marketing campaigns.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.320
So all of these campaigns are
running out there, and you're

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.180
getting users visiting your
website or your property from

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.850
these paid campaigns,
and that's great.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.030
You're able to track what
they're doing, the conversions

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.900
possibly that are taking place,
goal completions.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.550
And you're getting a good
general sense of which paid

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.240
campaigns are driving traffic
to your site.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.820
This is great.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.140
So a report like this, that I'm
showing here right now, is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.570
kind of common that you're
looking at, for my particular

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.020
campaigns, how are they
performing and what kind of

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.710
traffic is coming to my site
because these campaigns?

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.600
Now, you see that first row
there, row number one, is a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.610
Google AdWords campaign.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.600
And you'll notice while you
have user interaction data

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.730
such as visits, and you have
impressions and clicks cost

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.880
data, you don't get the same
kind of visual in cost data

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.230
that you would have
for AdWords.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.800
You don't get the same data for
the other paid campaigns

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.370
that you may have.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.730
So for example, we have an
AdWords network campaign

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580
running, and we have
an affiliate

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.000
network campaign running.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.770
And you'll see, we know people
are coming to the site, but we

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.320
don't have the cost data within
GA to do that analysis.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360
There's kind of two things
missing around this then.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.570
For the particular paid campaign
itself, being able to

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.190
analyze that in terms of the ROI
and the metrics you might

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.790
be getting.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.980
Click-through rate, cost per
click, things like that, you

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.330
kind of miss out on that.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.640
And then also, you don't really
have the ability to

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.680
compare how these services are
performing against each other.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.120
So is the AdWords network
driving more?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.000
Better conversions, or is Google
AdWords driving better

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.730
conversions?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.580
So you're missing that kind of
complete view, that complete

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.510
analysis, around your cost data
across all your different

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.970
paid campaigns that you might
be having for all online

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.710
advertising and digital
marketing.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.830
But cost data kind of
solves that problem.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.490
When we launched this feature
about a month ago, we had some

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.730
success stories right off the
bat with a couple customers,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.290
working with partners of ours to
get something in place and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.940
a solution for them.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.350
So, for example, we talked Next
Analytics and Cardinal

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.019
Path, and they came up
with a solution that

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.459
uses cost data upload.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.580
And they worked with
Natural Wellbeing.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.180
And really, it was around fully
automating this process

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.980
for them, so being able to
take their cost data

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.280
automatically, export it, and
upload it into Google

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.340
Analytics using this
new feature.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.350
And it worked really well for
them in saving them a lot of

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.810
time and doing this
full automation.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.150
We also did the same thing with
ShufflePoint and E-Nor.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.350
They came up with a solution
using cost data upload again

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.570
to help OEMPCWorld.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.230
And this one was really about,
again, fully automation.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.440
And a lot of the analysis they
were doing was kind of a

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.260
manual process where you had
your Google AdWords data, you

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.140
had some other campaigns.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.310
You had to manually bring that
stuff together and do analysis

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.850
outside of GA.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.040
So this new feature really
allowed them to bring all that

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.550
into Google Analytics and to
do that complete analysis

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.570
within the product itself.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.210
So it saved them a lot of time,
fully automated, a great

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.460
solution for them.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.340
So I think it would be good just
to start off with a quick

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.950
demo to show you how this
actually works.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.730
And then we're going to dive
into details, and I can give

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.410
you a little bit more background
on how these actual

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.370
steps that involved
to do this.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.730
Sometimes, it's just easier to
show you how it works, so I'll

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.570
start off with a report.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.440
This is within Google
Analytics.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.650
It's a custom report, and the
example here is that I have a

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.970
paid search ad running, and
it's for an ad network.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.130
It's a CPC, and it's
for the keyword

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.280
"dogbone." And I can see--

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.110
so I've tagged my URLs,
and I'll get into that

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.220
a little bit later.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.340
So I know that someone's
clicked on the URL, and

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.680
they've visited my property,
and I can see that there's

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.920
been two visits.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.690
But just as how I described
before, we don't have

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.610
any cost data here.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.970
But the thing is, I actually
do have the cost data.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.660
The service provider that
I'm using allows me to

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.420
export the cost data.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.200
I just don't have it in
GA, so that's really

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.620
what I want to do.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.340
I want to have that same data
available in GA so I can do

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.900
analysis and can carry
out cost analysis.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.180
So just something to note
here, the source is Ad

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.080
Network, the medium is CPC, and
the keyword is "dogbone."

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.600
So as I mentioned, I actually
do have this cost data.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.070
So you can imagine that I
exported this from the paid

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.370
search provider and have
it in CSV file.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.805
And there's a header up here
that has some dimensions that

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:36.440
I'll explain later.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.320
But in row two, we can see the
same values that I just showed

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.560
you in report are
actually here.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.850
We have Ad Network as a source,
CPC is our medium, and

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.410
we have this keyword
here, "dogbone."

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.830
And there's that cost data
I was talking about.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.810
We have impressions, we have
clicks, and we have ad cost,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.730
so I have this data.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.940
It's there.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.090
It's available, and there
was a couple other

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.770
keywords that I ran also.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.510
Now, let's actually upload it
and see how this process

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.090
works, and then we'll see--

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.460
once it's available in the
report, you'll see how it's

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.080
actually joined together.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.250
So I have a little script.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.140
It's a Python script, just to
kind of test things and see

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.970
how it's working, how
the feature works.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.090
I'll start off with--

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.450
there's this new entity called
custom data source.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.490
I can also explain what this
means in a little bit, but

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:28.290
basically, you upload the cost
data to a custom data source,

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.960
and you specify which date
you'd like to upload

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.810
the cost data for.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.770
So, in this example, this cost
data actually is from

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.850
yesterday, so I exported all of
the cost data and metrics

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.340
from yesterday into a
CSV file, and it's

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.820
available to upload.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.770
So I'm going to select the
custom data source that I want

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.363
to upload to.

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:49.200
And I'll show you how
this process works.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.770
So I have quite a few
accounts here.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.730
I want to upload to the
My Store account.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.950
I will select the web property,
and then here's what

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.410
I'm talking about in terms
of custom data sources.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.830
I have three set up, and I'm
just going to choose the first

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.470
one, the Ad Network custom
data source.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.720
So now I've selected it.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.240
If I go back up, you'll see
now that it's actually

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.860
selected, here, Ad Network, and
then also the account and

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.490
the web property.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.800
And then the upload data again
is 2012, November 28.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.510
So I will do an upload of
cost data, which is

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.660
number three here.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.365
I know the file that I showed
you, what the name of it is.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.240
Oops.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.220
Spelled that wrong.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.350
OK, so it's actually uploading
right now to Google Analytics

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.850
to that customer data source,
and if all goes successful,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.660
we'll get a response back
from the server

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.145
saying it was a success.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.830
So it takes a little bit of
time to process the data.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.620
It's not going to show
up instantly.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.740
I will go back to the
presentation.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.270
It could take anywhere from a
few minutes to up to 12 hours,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.360
so you should see data
within 12 hours.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.650
Depending on the kind of load
and your profile and web

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.860
property, it could take
a little longer.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.610
I'm going to actually go back
to the presentation.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.400
We've successfully uploaded
cost data.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.580
I'll come back a little bit
later, and we'll see if it's

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.650
available in the report and
if it's been joined

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.560
to our actual campaign.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.770
In the meantime, let's talk
about architectural overview,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.230
how this feature works, and
how you would actually go

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:31.220
about uploading cost data.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.500
So there's quite a few steps
involved, but they're all

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.040
pretty simple.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.760
The first four are really around
how to prepare for a

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.310
successful upload.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.310
And the fifth is really around
reporting and how you would do

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.550
analysis, the tools that are
available for that within GA.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.190
We'll start with tagging
campaign URLS.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.370
So obviously, the primary
benefit to this feature is

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.260
that you're able to join that
user interaction data that's

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.570
already in GA that you have, and
you're able to join that

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.990
with the cost data that might
sit somewhere externally.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.660
So bringing those two together
is really a huge benefit here.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.870
But in order to do that, it's
important that you use

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.680
campaign tracking parameters,
so you should

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.810
be doing this anyways.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.100
But the important part of this
is that the campaign tracking

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.520
parameters, the values you use
as part of the campaign,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.100
should or have to match the
values that you're uploading

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.720
through cost data
upload feature.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.000
So I'll explain a little bit
more in detail what this

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.730
means, but basically, they have
to match, and if they

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.960
match, then they'll actually
get joined

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.030
together in that case.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.305
So in this example here,
I have an ad running.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.540
It's not a Google ad.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.440
It's another paid
search provider.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.410
The link there actually has UTM
parameters as part of it,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.800
these campaign tracking
parameters, and I've specified

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.970
an ad network, CPC as a medium,
the campaign is summer

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.240
sale, and again the term is
"dogbone." So you've seen

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.405
these values throughout, and
we'll kind of explain how this

00:10:58.405 --> 00:10:59.655
all works now.

00:11:02.196 --> 00:11:04.570
OK, so you've tagged
your URLs.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:05.900
All your destination URLs
for all your paid

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.390
campaigns are tagged.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.750
And again, this is not
for Google AdWords.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.520
Google AdWords has a different
mechanism for

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.840
uploading cost data.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.420
You just link your profile to
your Analytics account, and

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.320
it'll take care of itself.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.360
This is for non-Google paid
campaigns, just something to

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.760
keep in mind.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.530
But once you've tagged those
URLs, the next thing you want

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.070
to do is actually get the data
out of the external source and

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.260
prepare it as a CSV file to
upload, so let's take a look

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.780
at what that means.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.230
The first thing is what can
you actually upload.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.230
So there's quite a few different
dimensions and three

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.290
metrics that you can
provide values for

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.610
through cost data upload.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.670
There's actually nothing new
here in terms of dimensions

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.180
and metrics.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.770
So these use existing AdWords
dimensions and metrics that

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.420
you've seen and are probably
familiar with, so

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.190
it's nothing new there.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.400
So if you have any reports set
up, like custom reports around

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.740
performance of paid campaigns,
those don't have to be changed

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.750
once you start uploading
cost data.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.770
Any zero values that you had
before will just automatically

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.920
be populated with this data
that you've uploaded.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.040
For the dimensions, there are
two that are required, which

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.160
are source and medium.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.650
And then for metrics, there's
three of them,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.490
and only one is required.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.830
One of the three is required.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.760
For any ones that are omitted,
we'll just assume it's a value

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.025
of zero basically for those.

00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.445
So this is the important
part here.

00:12:21.445 --> 00:12:23.260
We talked about the tagging
of the URLs, and

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.030
this is why it's important.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.220
This is how the data
actually gets

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.260
joined and mapped together.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.210
So you have all your user
interaction data sitting in GA

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.500
already today, and you're doing
that through normal

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.280
measurement that you've already
done all the time, so

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.500
that's taken care of.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.040
Now, you're uploading
cost data.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.930
And what's going to happen
is the campaign tracking

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.660
parameters, the values you use
there and the ones you upload,

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.980
if there's a match there,
then the data

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.100
will get joined together.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.300
This is why it's important that
these things are synced

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.450
across the two.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:57.270
Also, there is a specific case
in terms of the case that is

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.330
required for these things.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.540
The keyword is case
insensitive.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.860
So it doesn't matter if the
keyword is capitalized or not,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.430
they'll get joined regardless.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.130
But the other four dimensions
are case sensitive, so you've

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.680
got to be careful there and
make sure these values are

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.050
consistent in that regard.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.680
Also, it's up to you really
to determine the naming

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.480
conventions that are used
in the external system.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.490
It's quite possible that the
naming convention used by this

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.650
external source might be a
little bit different and not

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.640
as matched up with the namings
that we use for our

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.520
dimensions within GA.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.085
So it's kind of up to you to
look at what's available from

00:13:33.085 --> 00:13:36.000
the external provider and map
and see how that maps these

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.540
dimensions and the values you
need to provide for these

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.900
dimensions.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.030
It's kind of up to
you to do that.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.950
And usually, it's a one-step
kind of process once you've

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.030
got it setup.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.960
Then you don't have to really
worry about it anymore, but

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.990
identifying those mappings at
first is really important.

00:13:51.756 --> 00:13:54.390
OK, so we know what
we can upload.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.880
Let's take a look at actually
what you would upload.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.870
So I showed you a
CSV file before.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.900
Here's another example.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.390
So this is for aggregates,
right?

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.570
You're uploading aggregate
data on a daily basis.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.170
That's usually the
typical use case.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.430
So best practice then is really
to wait until the end

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.660
of the day and then
upload cost data.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.300
Or upload cost data for the
previous day because you want

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.400
to upload it in an aggregate,
and you upload it for a

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.150
specific date.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.250
You say I'm going to upload it
for yesterday or the day

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.240
before and so on.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.140
Again, you'll notice here that
the values I have for the

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.070
source and medium match the
values that I use in my URLs

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.880
for my campaigns as part of
the campaign tracking

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.480
parameters, and those should
always be consistent.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.510
And then you have your actual
metrics here, the cost data

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.710
itself, the compressions,
ads, and clicks.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.570
In this case, I provided values
for all three because I

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.000
had them available.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.490
And then, of course, you saw the
list of all the dimensions

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.000
that are available.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.250
Those can be included also.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.570
There is quite a few different
constraints and requirements

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.270
around what needs to be provided
and the values you

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.460
can provide.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.230
These are all available on our
developer site, which I

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.450
provide some links later
for you guys.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:04.130
OK, so we've tagged our campaign
URLs with campaign

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.410
tracking parameters.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.090
We've got our CSV file that we
exported out from the external

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.590
source, and we've prepared
it properly.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.560
And now we have to create
a data source.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480
Remember, we have to upload
to a custom data source.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.790
We have to create that, and
that's actually done through

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.432
the web interface.

00:15:22.432 --> 00:15:29.754
OK, so I'll show you how it
actually is done right now,

00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:32.120
and then I'll explain how
exactly that this works.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.370
So it's at the web
property level.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.470
And we're currently doing white
listing, so some of you

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.620
may have this, some of you may
not, but it will be all rolled

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.900
out to everybody in the next
week or so I think.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.800
So if you go to the web property
level in the admin

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.280
panel, you'll see a tab called
Custom Definitions.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.400
So I already have three
custom data sources

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.840
available in here.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.125
I'm going to create a new
one, so I'll show

00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:58.730
you how it's done.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.430
So a new custom data source, You
can imagine just, say, I

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.987
want to have one for, let's say,
email marketing, so I'll

00:16:05.987 --> 00:16:12.880
put email marketing campaigns,
specify the type.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.720
We're uplinking cost data.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.210
That's the type.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.460
And then we link your profile.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.300
Linking profiles will enable
this cost data to be available

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.170
for those profiles.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.670
You can imagine you might
have 100 profiles here.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.760
You can select which
ones you want.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.130
There's a little search box to
make it a little bit easier.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.150
And then you just select which
profiles you would like the

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.370
cost data to show up in.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.960
Click Create, and you'll see now
I have a new custom data

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.410
source for email marketing
campaigns.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.590
And the important thing here
is there's an ID, and you

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.430
actually need that ID to do
uploads, and I'll show you how

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.904
that's done.

00:16:48.904 --> 00:16:51.630
I'm going to go back to
the presentation.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.750
So let's look at what's a custom
data source, and how

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.750
does it relate to Google
Analytics model?

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.890
I think you're probably mostly
familiar with this.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.010
This is the way GA
is set up today.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:00.950
We have Web Properties.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.230
That's where all the user
interaction data is collected.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.829
That's the level it's
collected at.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.420
And then we have profiles, and
profiles basically act as

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.109
views of that data.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.550
So you can have one maybe
for marketing.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.000
You might have one for sales, or
certain filters apply that

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.490
you want to have different views
of your web property

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.190
user interaction data.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.920
What's been introduced with
cost data upload is custom

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.150
data sources.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.010
So this resource kind of
acts as representing

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.220
external data sources.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.790
You could have a single or
multiple external data sources

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.120
per custom data source.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.790
It's up to you.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.675
You can have multiple
custom data

00:17:34.675 --> 00:17:36.530
sources on your web property.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.620
I would say, as a best practice,
I would create a

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.290
custom data source per
external data source.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.315
It's just a little bit easier
to manage, and it allows you

00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:46.890
to kind of separate data from
across the different sources

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.370
that you might have.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.010
It's really important that
you link a profile.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.680
So this, as I showed you
before, when you link

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.230
profiles, it enables that
data to be available

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.510
within those reports.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.020
If you don't have that linking,
then the cost data

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.210
will not show up in reports.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.290
So in this case, we have an
example here where we've

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.110
created a custom data source,
and it's linked to two

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.340
profiles, profile one
and profile three.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.260
So those two will show data, and
profile two will not show

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.190
any cost data from that
custom data source.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.600
In addition to that, we
have what we call

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.890
daily upload resources.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.900
These kind of represent the
actual data you've uploaded to

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.600
GA on a per-date basis.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.080
So you have one for each
day, a resource,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.800
and these are important.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.120
They store information around
which custom data source they

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.000
belong to and also metadata
around recent changes that

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.370
have taken place with this
particular resource.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.230
So if someone uploaded to it,
deleted it, you get that kind

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.200
of changelog history.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.650
It's part of that resource.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.990
You manage and create custom
data sources within the UI,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.060
and you actually upload cost
data using an API.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.170
You can actually also look at
the history of a daily upload

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.105
resource within the UI.

00:18:53.105 --> 00:18:56.340
I'll show you that, by
going to the history.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.950
There's a little history
link here.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.890
You can kind of get it.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.970
For that custom data source,
you can see all the changes

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.210
that have taking place.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.470
And you can actually get-- per
day, you can see all the

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.630
changes that have taken place.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:13.630
OK, also from a creation
standpoint, in deletion, you

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.050
need to be an admin.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.880
So admins, anything with
modification to a resource,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.760
whether it's create or
delete, is admin.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.480
And viewers, just regular users,
can view data, but they

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.630
can't do anything
around creating

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.362
or deleting or uploading.

00:19:26.362 --> 00:19:27.612
So that's important.

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:32.520
OK, so we showed you how
to create a data

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.110
source, so let's recap.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.810
We've got our URLs tagged with
campaign tracking parameters.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.350
We've got our CSV file that's
prepared and which was

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.400
exported out from the
external source.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.260
We've created a custom
data source

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.760
using the web interface.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.750
Now, we actually want to upload
the cost data, and we

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.500
use this API to carry
this out.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.130
So here's an example
in Python.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.530
It's pretty simple, actually.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.640
You create a media file
upload object, and you

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.140
specify the CSV file.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.130
And then you actually just call
the upload method for the

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.540
daily uploads resources.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.460
And you specify a few parameters
that are required,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.640
and you execute that.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.050
And it'll automatically upload
the file for you and respond

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.720
with a 200 if successful.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.370
If there was an error,
typically--

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.060
I think when people first start
out with this, they get

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.910
errors around the file
formatting for the CSV.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.180
The errors are really
descriptive, so they really

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.640
help you out in terms
of figuring out what

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.890
the problems are.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.970
There's also a few other
operations you can carry out.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:33.390
You can list which
daily uploads.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.220
This gives you your history
and changes.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.620
You can look up for
a year of history.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.040
You can look at what's
taken place.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.120
And we also have a
delete method.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.090
So if you want to get rid of
data completely, you can

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.630
actually delete it out of
the daily resource.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.020
And this is important because
the way the cost data is

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.650
stored within GA, it's actually
stored separately

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.460
outside of your user
interaction data.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.740
So this is great because you
can kind of upload--

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.000
If you?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.390
Want to delete something, it
doesn't actually touch any of

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.970
your user interaction data.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.870
So feel free to upload and
delete without any worrying

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.570
about corrupting or having
any effect on your user

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.910
interaction data that's
already there.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.780
All right, so once you've kind
of done that, and you've

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.720
actually successfully uploaded
cost data, and it's been

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.420
processed, you'll have the data

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.250
available in your reports.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.160
So going back to the start of
our presentation, now, the

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.900
magic's happened.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.680
Before, we had zero values
for the cost data.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.990
And you can see now when you've
done it properly, this

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.040
actual cost data will
get joined.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.350
In reports that you would
normally see zeroes now show

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.775
you the campaign visits are now
joined and associated with

00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:36.460
that uploaded cost data, which
gives you all these nice other

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.130
additional metrics, calculated
metrics, around margin, ROI,

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:39.650
and things like that.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.220
So now you can do your complete
ROI analysis across

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.500
all of your different
paid campaigns.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.940
Reporting is available
a few different ways.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.090
We have the API, of course.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.780
You can continue to use the
core report in API to pull

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.050
metrics out.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.480
Like I said before, the
dimensions and measures

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.980
haven't changed, so any reports
you might have been

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.760
running before will work just
as they did before.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.170
There's no changes to be made.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.460
And then from the web interface,
there's kind of two

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.250
main options, which are you can
build a custom report or

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.780
there's a new cost analysis
report under Traffic Sources.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.270
The cost analysis report, this
is what it looks like.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.780
It's actually just for
cost data upload.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.870
It was created for that.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.010
And then for custom reports,
let's just see if our data

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.740
that I had uploaded has
been processed.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.910
So let's refresh this and,
yes, you can see.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.080
That was the cost data we
uploaded at the start of the

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.730
presentation.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.920
It has been joined to my
campaign visits for that

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.180
particular keyword,
and we can now see

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.440
impressions, clicks, and cost.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.790
And of course, you could do--

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.480
there's some calculated metrics,
like cost per click,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.790
and you can add those to
your custom report.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.040
So great, it worked.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.950
So some of the opportunities
are, for developers, you have

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.820
an opportunity to build
a connector.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.560
There's kind of two steps
to this, I would say.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.840
There's the initial setup, which
is kind of just creating

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.730
custom data source, but then
there's two cases that you

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.870
really got to consider.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.610
One is historical upload.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.705
You'll notice when I
did the upload, I

00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:03.880
uploaded to actually yesterday.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.730
It was data for the 28th, and
you can actually upload data

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.220
all the way back to 2005.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.070
So if you've been tagging your
campaign URLs over the last

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.810
seven years, you can actually
go back and export the data

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.960
and upload that.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.460
It's a little bit different use
case, because typically

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.110
when you export, you're going
to export a large chunk of

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.200
data from your system, and then
you have to individually

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.840
upload that for each day.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.600
So that initial historic
upload is a little bit

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.020
different use case, but the
API really allows you to

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.190
automate all that.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.900
And then going forward, there's
an opportunity to

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.770
build a connector that pulls
the data down from the

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.510
external source automatically
and uploads it to GA.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.480
If you don't really have the
development resources or you'd

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.020
just like to get started, we
do have four partners that

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.090
have built integrations
using this feature.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.055
Next Analytics, GA Data
Uploader, Analytics Canvas,

00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:53.670
and ShufflePoint all have
great integrations.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.770
And depending on your
requirements, I think any one

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.320
of them will be able to solve a
lot of different use cases.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.000
So I'd definitely encourage you
to check these out in our

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.700
App Gallery.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.690
So to finish up here, we have
just a few resources for you.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.810
We'll include these links at
the bottom of the video for

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.520
you, but all of this is
available on our developer

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.177
site, which is developers.googl

00:24:13.177 --> 00:24:16.400
e.com/analytics.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.500
And we also have the App
Gallery, which is

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.980
google.com/analytics/apps.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.820
All right, thank you
very much, and

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.460
you can start uploading.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.850
I think if we have
some questions,

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.600
we'll take some questions.

00:24:34.584 --> 00:24:35.560
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
so taking a

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.270
quick look at the Moderator.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.550
We have a few questions.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.700
One of them is from John, who
says he's played around a

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.650
little bit with uploading cost
data, and his campaigns don't

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.140
seem to be matching up.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.565
Are the UTM parameters
case sensitive?

00:24:49.565 --> 00:24:51.650
PETE FRISELLA: Yeah, I think
I touched on this earlier.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.900
So the keyword is normalized to
lowercase no matter what.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.470
So that one, you don't even
have to worry about case.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.350
But for the other ones, you do
have to worry about case

00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:59.470
sensitivity.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.530
Those will affect what
gets matched up.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.270
But again, because the data's
stored separately, go ahead,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.230
upload things, and you'll see
if you have a problem, you

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.060
simply just delete the data.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.270
It doesn't affect any of your
user interaction data, so

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.480
there's no problem there.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.170
MALE SPEAKER: And Andrew asks,
"Are we going to be able to

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.880
apply advanced segments to
uploaded cost data?"

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.010
PETE FRISELLA: So because you're
uploading aggregate

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.210
totals for a day, it's not
on a session basis.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.090
So you can't actually
do the advanced

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.990
segments like you would.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.630
It actually acts exactly the
same way that AdWords does

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.650
today, which is advanced
segments would not apply for

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.720
this particular case.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.850
All right, so thanks very much
for taking the time and

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.870
joining me today about learning

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.250
about cost data upload.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.500
I'll see you guys next time.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.180
