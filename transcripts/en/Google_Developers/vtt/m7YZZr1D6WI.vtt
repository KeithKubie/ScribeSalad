NapoleonCat is a social
media marketing dashboard.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.670
I co-founded the
company four years ago.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.170
And a year ago, I took
over the CEO position.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.800
Switching to CEO means that
you are the person that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.950
has to implement the ideas,
and put them into practice,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.890
and make them work.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.460
And you are the one
that is responsible

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.060
for the actual effects.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.850
And you are also responsible
for the whole team

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.790
on a daily basis.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.290
So that puts much more pressure
and responsibility on a person.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.860
The beauty of such a
solution is that you actually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.580
don't have to be present
in different countries,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.760
physically, to
sell your products,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.370
and to have customers,
and to serve them

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.100
all over the world,
because you can do it all

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.580
online from the office in
Warsaw, Brazil, wherever.
