00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.720
PROFESSOR: Last time we talked
about op-amps and the fact

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.120
that they allowed us to
abstract away certain

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.070
components of a circuit and
sample particular voltages

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.820
from a circuit and then modify
those voltages as we would

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.720
like in an LTI fashion.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.030
Today I'd like to talk to you
about some other interesting

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.470
things that fall out of the fact
that we're only dealing

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.760
with LTI systems.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
In particular, Thevenin/Norton
equivalence and superposition.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.700
Thevenin/Norton equivalence is
the idea that if you have a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.100
very complex circuit, but it's
still a LTI circuit, you can

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.540
express it using
a linear curve.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.060
And superposition is the idea
that because you're also

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.900
dealing with LTI components,
if you're trying to solve a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.260
circuit, you can take the
individual contributions of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.820
independent sources to that
circuit and sum them in order

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.845
to find out either the total
current flowing through a

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:04.170
particular component or the
total voltage drop across a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.220
particular component.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.665
At this point, I'll walk
you through both.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.970
Thevenin/Norton equivalence is
an important concept in that

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.880
you may have a very complicated
circuit.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700
And you don't really want
to talk about the entire

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.490
complicated circuit.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.220
You just want to sample the
voltage drop or current in a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.470
very particular location.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.090
Because we're dealing with LTI
systems we can actually

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.115
express that particular sample
as its relationship between I

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.880
and V and possibly whatever
resistive component is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.170
associated with the voltage
drop across that sample.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.530
We can solve for this curve by
looking at the location that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.800
were sampling and finding
the open circuit voltage

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.690
associated with that position.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.170
Or if we were to leave the two
terminals from where we are

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.250
sampling open, what is the
voltage drop across that

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.419
section of our circuit?

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.540
That's the point right here,
where the current flowing

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.090
through the system is 0.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.550
And there's a given voltage
associated with it.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.180
Likewise if we want to find the
other intercept, we can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.430
close those two terminals by
running a wire across them and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.900
then look at the current that
flows across that wire.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.260
That's the close circuit
current.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.620
The slope is going to tell us
about our resistance, if any.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.960
If we're only dealing with a
voltage source or a current

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.990
source, then we're only
going to be dealing

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.780
with a straight line.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.300
Once we've solved for these
values, we tend to express

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.410
them either as a Thevenin
equivalent circuit or a Norton

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.680
equivalent circuit.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.240
And you can convert
between the two.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.490
Let's walk through an example.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.870
Here I've got a simple
circuit.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.750
And I would like to find the
Thevenin equivalent of that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.750
circuit, given that I'm sampling
from above this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.200
resistor and below
this resistor.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.900
The first thing that I'm
going to do is find the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.730
open circuit voltage.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.330
Or if I were sampling from this
point to this point, what

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.658
is the voltage drop across this
section of the circuit?

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:43.990
Well, I've got 36 Volts.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.530
There's 12 Ohms of
resistance in the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.885
section that I'm sampling.

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:52.060
And there's 6 Ohms of resistance
outside the section

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.380
that I'm sampling.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.200
So 2/3 of my total voltage
drop across this voltage

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.570
divider is going to be accounted
for inside my

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.910
Thevenin equivalent circuit.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.200
So my Thevenin equivalent
voltage is 24 Volts.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.410
Now I want to go after the
short circuit current.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.589
If I were to draw a wire from
this terminal to this

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:22.480
terminal, I'm curious what
this value would be.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.230
As a consequence of connecting
these two terminals, these

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.700
resistors are going to be
completely bypassed.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.880
We don't actually have to drop
any voltage or put any current

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.420
through these resistors because
there's actually an

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.500
infinitely easier way for
the current to go.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.310
In this case, we're just going
to follow Ohm's law.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.850
36 divided by 6 is 6 Amperes.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.380
But because of the
directionality on this short

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.160
circuit current, current in this
system is going to flow

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.580
in this direction.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.960
So are short circuit current is

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.970
actually negative 6 Amperes.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.160
That just leaves Rth.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.460
Once again we're going
to rely on Ohm's law.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.160
If we divide our voltage
by our current--

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.670
you can't have a negative
resistance.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.860
We're actually going to divide
by the negative of this.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.320
We'll get out 4 Ohms.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.750
Let's do it again, this time
with a slightly different

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.810
sample point and
find the Norton

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.060
equivalent of our circuit.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.345
So if I'm only sampling across
the 9 Ohm resistor--

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.970
I personally still solve for
the Thevenin equivalent

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.900
voltage first because I
think it's easiest.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.780
I'll just make note
of it over here.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.670
The voltage drop across this
resistor is determined by the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.060
fact that this is a simple
voltage divider.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.440
The other resistors
in this circuit--

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.910
7, 2, 9 Ohms.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.200
So the voltage drop across
this resistor is going to

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.100
represent half of the total
voltage in our circuit.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.290
That's 18 Volts.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.190
The short circuit current
associated with connecting

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:50.570
these two terminals is 36 Volts
divided by the sum of

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.160
these two resistors.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.300
Once again we're going to end
up bypassing this resistor

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.610
entirely because, think about
it this way, if there was a

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.850
resistor across here with 0
resistance, all the current

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.480
would sink through it, or it
would represent the location

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.900
for which infinite current
would flow.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.210
36 divided by 9 is 4.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.520
And because we're following in
the opposite direction we're

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.110
going to say this is
negative 4 Amperes.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.560
In this orientation, the Norton
equivalent amperage is

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.220
actually the negative
of this value.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.875
You sometimes see the arrow
pointing downwards.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.050
This preserves our property
of short circuit current.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.960
If this was short circuited,
Isc would still

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.090
be negative 4 Amperes.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.340
And our Vth--

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.155
if our Vth was the voltage drop
across these two points--

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.550
ha, I haven't solved
for Rth yet.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.470
There are a few ways
to do this.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.870
But I'm going to
use Vth and In.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.890
18 over 4, we can reduce
it to 9 over 2.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.320
And if I were to solve back
out for the voltage drop

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.305
across this resistor just as a
consequence of I Norton, I

00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:10.520
would get 18 Volts, which is
also the Thevenin equivalent

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.000
voltage for this circuit.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.450
That covers Thevenin/Norton
equivalence.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.050
And we're going to talk about
superposition really quickly.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.350
Superposition is yet another
circuit-solving strategy.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.440
It falls out as a consequence
of only working with LTI

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.070
components.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.100
And it means that in order to
solve for a given component

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.880
current or component voltage,
you can actually find it by

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.790
taking the linear combination
of every contribution as a

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.290
consequence of independent
sources.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.800
What do I mean when
I say that?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.050
Well, if you have a circuit
like this--

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.410
and you might recognize
it from the

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.930
NVCC lecture earlier--

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.170
you can actually express it as
a linear combination of just

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.150
the voltage source and just
the current source.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.120
Note what when I remove the
current source, I end up with

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.650
no connection because if you
have 0 current flowing through

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.480
a system, it's the
same as if the

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.270
connection has been removed.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.760
Note that when I remove the
voltage source, I no longer

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.000
have a voltage drop across
that connection, but I

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.250
maintain the connection.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.330
If in this example I was
just looking for I1.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.180
I1 would be the linear
combination of the

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.570
contribution of I1 in this
particular circuit plus I1 in

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.410
this particular circuit.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.920
So this is the expression
that I'm looking for.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.620
In the first circuit, I'm just
going to use V over IR --

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.870
or V equals IR --

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.060
and I'm going to have 3 Amperes
in this direction.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:26.600
In this circuit I'm actually
going to have to

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.850
use a current divider.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.150
Identify that I have five parts
total to distribute

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.060
among these two branches.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.000
Identify that this side is going
to get the inverse of

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.370
this side's contribution to the
total parts, or this side

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.180
is going to get the proportion
of parts equivalent to this

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.430
side's contribution.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.630
And vice versa.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.800
That this side is the side
that I'm interested in.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.150
And so 2/5 of the total current
flowing through this

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.650
current divider is going to
end up in this branch.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.050
2/5 of 10 is 4.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.810
It's in the opposite direction
of this current flow.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:17.550
So I'm actually going to
contribute negative 4 Amperes

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.800
from this subcircuit.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.440
This should match the results
from the NVCC lecture.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.690
That's my super fast coverage
of superposition and also

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.550
Thevenin/Norton equivalence.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.370
Next time we're going to start
a whole new module.
