00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.660
Simplify 3a to the fifth
over 9a squared times a

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.192
to the fourth over
a to the third.

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:08.900
So before we even
worry about the a's, we

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.270
can actually simplify
the 3 and the 9.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.030
They're both divisible by 3.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.650
So let's divide the numerator
and the denominator here by 3.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.880
So if we divide the numerator
by 3, the 3 becomes a 1.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
If we divide the denominator
by 3, the 9 becomes a 3.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.270
So this reduces
to, or simplifies

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.670
to 1a to the fifth
times a to the fourth

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.580
over-- or maybe I should
say, a to the fifth over 3a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.130
squared times a to the
fourth over a to the third.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.370
Now this, if we just
multiply the two expressions,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.677
this would be equal to 1a to
the fifth times a to the fourth

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.135
in the numerator, and we don't
have to worry about the one,

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.340
it doesn't change the value.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.200
So it's a to the fifth times a
to the fourth in the numerator.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.230
And then we have 3a-- let
me write the 3 like this--

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.270
and then we have 3
times a squared times

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.330
a to the third in
the denominator.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.349
And now there's
multiple ways that we

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.650
can simplify this from here.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190
One sometimes is called
the quotient rule.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.590
And that's just the idea that
if you have a to the x over a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.470
to the y, that this is going to
be equal to a to the x minus y.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.510
And just to understand
why that works,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.980
let's think about a to
the fifth over a squared.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.600
So a to the fifth
is literally a times

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.176
a times a times a times a.

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:39.870
That right there
is a to the fifth.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.270
And we have that over a squared.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.790
And I'm just thinking about
the a squared right over here,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.556
which is literally
just a times a.

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:51.600
That is a squared.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.110
Now, clearly, both the
numerator and denominator

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.420
are both divisible by a times a.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.710
We can divide them
both by a times a.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.690
So we can get rid of-- if
we divide the numerator

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.870
by a twice, by a times a, so
let's get rid of a times a.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.400
And if we divide the denominator
by a times a, we just get a 1.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.950
So what are we just left with?

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.990
We are left with just a
times a times a over 1,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.670
which is just a times a times a.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.980
But what is this?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.220
This is a to the third power,
or a to the 5 minus 2 power.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.700
We had 5, we were able to
cancel out 2, that gave us 3.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.430
So we could do the
same thing over here.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.620
We can apply the quotient rule.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.450
And I'll do two ways
of actually doing this.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.241
So let's apply the
quotient rule with the a

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:42.640
to the fifth and the a squared.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.830
So let me do it this way.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.160
So let's apply with
these two guys,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.480
and then let's apply
it with these two guys.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.100
And of course, we have
the 1/3 out front.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.180
So this can be
reduced to 1/3 times--

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.960
if we apply the
quotient rule with a

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.080
to the fifth over
a squared, we just

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.580
did it over here-- that
becomes a to the third power.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.650
And if we apply it over here
with the a to the fourth over a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.150
to the third, that'll
give us a-- let

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.930
me do it that same blue color.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.660
That'll give us a-- that's
not the same blue color.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.410
There we go.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.710
This will give us a to
the 4 minus 3 power,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.120
or a to the first power.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360
And of course, we can
simplify this as a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.470
to the third times
a-- well, actually,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.250
let me just do it over here.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.070
Before I even rewrite it, we
know that a to the third times

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.260
a to the first is going to
be a to the 3 plus 1 power.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.040
We have the same base,
we can add the exponents.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.440
We're multiplying a times
itself three times and then

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.300
one more time.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300
So that'll be a to
the fourth power.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.900
So this right over here
becomes a to the fourth power.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.940
a to the 3 plus 1 power.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.710
And then we have to
multiply that by 1/3.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.910
So our answer could be
1/3 a to the fourth,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.820
or we could equally write
it a to the fourth over 3.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.730
Now, the other way
to do this problem

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.500
would have been to
apply the product,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.510
or to add the exponents
in the numerator,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.491
and then add the exponents
in the denominator.

00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:15.740
So let's do it that way first.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.690
If we add the exponents
in the numerator first,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.314
we don't apply the
quotient rule first.

00:04:19.314 --> 00:04:20.190
We apply it second.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.060
We get in the numerator, a to
the fifth times a to the fourth

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.760
would be a to the ninth power.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.940
5 plus 4.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.680
And then in the denominator
we have a squared times a

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.326
to the third.

00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:35.450
Add the exponents, because
we're taking the product

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.640
with the same base.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.374
So it'll be a to
the fifth power.

00:04:38.374 --> 00:04:40.290
And of course, we still
have this 3 down here.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.860
We have a 1/3, or we could
just write a 3 over here.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.060
Now, we could apply the
quotient property of exponents.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.110
We could say, look, we have a to
the ninth over a to the fifth.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.980
a to the ninth
over a to the fifth

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.530
is equal to a to
the 9 minus 5 power,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.960
or it's equal to a
to the fourth power.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.830
And of course, we still
have the divided by 3.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.230
Either way we got
the same answer.
