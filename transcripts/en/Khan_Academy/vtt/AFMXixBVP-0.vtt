00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.890
Let's say we've got the function
f of x is equal to e to the x.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.245
And just to get a sense
of what that looks like,

00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:13.140
let me do a rough drawing of
f of x is equal to e to the x.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.275
It would look
something like this.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.690
So that is e to the x.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.380
And what I want to do is
I want to approximate f

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.010
of x is equal to e to the
x using a Taylor series

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.930
approximation, or a
Taylor series expansion.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.440
And I want to do it not
around x is equal to 0.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.050
I want to do it around
x is equal to 3,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.562
just to pick another
arbitrary value.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.520
So we're going to do it
around x is equal to 3.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.570
This is x is equal to 3.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.860
This right there.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.610
That is f of 3.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.780
f of 3 is e to the third power.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.080
So this is e to the third
power right over there.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.520
So when we take the
Taylor series expansion,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.120
if we have a 0 degree
polynomial approximating it,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.630
the best we could probably do
is have a constant function

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.379
going straight through
e to the third.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.920
If we do a first
order approximation,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.750
so we have a first
degree term, then

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.610
it will be the tangent line.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.360
And as we add more and
more degrees to it,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.090
we should hopefully be
able to kind of contour

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.912
or converge with the curve
better and better and better.

00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:23.870
And in the future, we'll
talk a little bit more

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.950
about how we can
test for convergences

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.630
and how well are we converging
and all that type of thing.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.762
But with that said, let's
just apply the formula

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.220
that hopefully we
got the intuition

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.810
for in the last video.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.170
So the Taylor series
expansion for f

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.560
of x is equal to e to the
x will be the polynomial.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.590
So what's f of c?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.410
Well, if x is equal
to 3, we're saying

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.230
that c is 3 in this situation.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.360
So if c is 3, f of 3 is
e to the third power.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.620
So it's e to the third power
plus-- what's f prime of c?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.984
Well f prime of x is also
going to be e to the x.

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.400
You take the derivative of e
to the x, you get e to the x.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.470
That's one of the super cool
things about e to the x.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.460
So this is also f prime of x.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.142
Frankly, this is the same thing
as f the nth derivative of x.

00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:13.850
You could just keep
taking the derivative

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.840
of this and you'll
get e to the x.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.390
So f prime of x is e to the x.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.250
You evaluate that at 3, you
get e to the third power

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.700
again times x minus 3, c is
3, plus the second derivative

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.140
our function is
still e to the x,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.910
evaluate that at 3, you get
e to the third power over 2

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.830
factorial times x minus
3 to the second power.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.100
And then we could keep going.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.090
The third derivative
is still e to the x.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.330
Evaluate that at 3. c
is 3 in this situation.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.290
So you get e to the third
power over 3 factorial times

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.560
x minus 3 to the third power.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.170
And we can keep going
with this, but I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.840
think you get the general idea.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.590
But what's even more interesting
than just kind of going

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.180
through the mechanics of
finding the expansion,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.800
is seeing how as we add
more and more terms,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.740
it starts to approximate e
to the x better and better

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.240
and better.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.560
And our approximation gets
good further and further away

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.900
from x is equal to 3.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.520
And to do that, I
used WolframAlpha,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.700
available at wolframalpha.com.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.270
And I think I typed in
Taylor series expansion e

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.700
to the x and x equals 3.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.640
And it just knew what
I wanted and gave me

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.290
all of this business
right over here.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.735
And it actually
calculated the expansion.

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:33.370
And you can see it's
the exact same thing

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.100
that we have over here, e to the
third plus e to the third times

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.030
x minus 3.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.660
We have e to the third plus e
to the third times x minus 3

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.780
plus 1/2.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.669
They actually expanded
out the factorial.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.835
So instead of 3 factorial,
they wrote a 6 over here.

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:47.660
And they did a bunch
of terms up here.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.910
But what's even more interesting
is that they actually

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.600
graph each of these polynomials
with more and more terms.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.050
So in orange, we
have e to the x.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.390
We have f of x is
equal to e to the x.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.070
And then they tell us,
"order n approximation

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.330
shown with n dots."

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.140
So the order one
approximation, so that

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.160
should be the situation where we
have a first degree polynomial,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.740
so that's literally-- a
first degree polynomial

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.860
would be these two
terms right over here.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.430
Because this is a 0-th degree,
this is a first degree.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.260
We just have x to the
first power involved here.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.030
If we just were to plot this--
if this was our polynomial,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.900
that is plotted with 1 dot.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.580
And that is this one right
over here, with one dot,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.440
and they plot it
right over here.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.770
And we can see that
it's just a tangent line

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.520
at x is equal to 3.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.420
That is x is equal to
3 right over there.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.240
And so this is the tangent line.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.140
If we add a term, now we're
getting to a second degree

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.070
polynomial, because we're
adding an x squared.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.330
If you expand this out,
you'll have an x squared term,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.830
and then you'll
have another x term,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.840
but the degree of the polynomial
will now be a second degree.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.330
So let's look for two dots.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.890
So that's this one
right over here.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.750
So let's see, two dots.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.890
Two dots coming in.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.190
See, you'll notice
one, two dots.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.140
So you have two dots,
and it comes in.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.620
And this is a parabola.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.550
It's a second degree
polynomial, and then it

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.950
comes back like this.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.410
But notice it does a better job,
especially around x equals 3,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.170
of approximating e to the x.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.860
It stays with the curve
a little bit longer.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.030
You add another term-- let me
do this in a new color, a color

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.640
that I have not used.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.680
You add another term.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.644
Now you have a third
degree polynomial.

00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:37.060
If you have all
of these combined,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.030
if this is your polynomial, and
you were to graph that-- and so

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.320
let's look for the three
dots right over here.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.790
So one, two, three.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.520
So it's this curve.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.240
Third degree polynomial is
this curve right over here.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.970
And notice, it
starts contouring e

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.750
to the x a little bit sooner
than the second degree version.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.925
And it stays with it
a little bit longer.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.090
And so you have
it just like that.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.960
You add another term to it,
you add the fourth degree term

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.780
to it.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.642
So now we have all of
this plus all of this.

00:06:09.642 --> 00:06:11.100
If this is your
polynomial, now you

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.810
have this curve right over here.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.600
Notice every time
you add a term,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.000
it's getting better and
better at approximating

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.260
e to the x further and further
away from x is equal to 3.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.206
And then if you add another
term, you get this one up here.

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:26.580
But hopefully that
satisfies you,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.440
that we are getting closer and
closer, the more terms we add.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.180
So you can imagine it's a
pretty darn good approximation

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.750
as we approach adding an
infinite number of terms.
