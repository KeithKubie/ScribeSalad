Madfinger Games is
game developers,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.140
and we are creating
amazing games which

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.780
are running on
multiple platforms.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
That means on iOS,
Android, and Facebook.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.250
My role as a
marketing director is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.170
to show off the world that
we are creating the games.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.480
This means bringing new users,
new players to our game,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.130
and also to care about our
huge community of players which

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.140
are already playing our
game, and to give them

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.650
interesting content to
bring them back to the game

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.920
again and again.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.400
Community is something like the
biggest or strongest marketing

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.630
tool for us because they
can share their activities

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.890
on our game, and they can
bring also new users for us.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.960
They can share the
score with friends.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.670
And the community and number of
players are increasing by them.
