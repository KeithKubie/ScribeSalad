00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.280
In genetics, understanding how allele pairs segregate in

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.240
all their possible combinations for all the chromosomes, and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.250
then recombine in the offspring at fertilization to produce

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.980
all the different genotypes and phenotypes we can get,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.780
is one of the most complicated parts of genetics.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.090
We're only scratching the surface here really understanding what's

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.620
going on in miosis. So there's a handy way

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.760
of thinking about how these allele pairs separate using

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.740
a tool called a punnet square. Now some of you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.960
may have heard of this before. We're going to take a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.830
quick look at how we can use punnet squares to

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.100
help us understand this segregating alleles problem a little better.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.450
Let's imagine for a second that we have two parents.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.870
a mom and a dad. These are two individuals here

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.430
and we're going to focus only on chromosome two, which has

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.310
the lactase gene controlling lactose intolerance. Dad is homozygous recessive

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.560
for lactase non-persistence. This means that dad is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.270
going to be lactose intolerant, because he's not going to make

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.570
enough lactase as an adult To be able to

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.740
metabolize lactose. Mom on the other hand is homozygous-dominant

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.510
for lactase persistence. This means mom is going

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.940
to be lactose tolerant, she's going to keep expressing lactase

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.970
into adulthood. Now the question is, if they have

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.500
a child What are the possible genotypes and phenotypes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.390
of their children? This is when our punnet squares

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.960
are going to come in handy. Let's take the possible segregated

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
allele combinations we can have for the dad. If

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.740
his pair of homozygous recessive alleles segregate, we can get

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.760
one gamete with a recessive allele, and another gamete

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.590
with a recessive allele. Now we can do the same

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.930
thing for the mom here. She can either pass

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.470
on a dominant allele or another dominant allele. So if

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.100
we want to figure out what their offspring could be, genotypically,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.730
or what genotype they will be, all we have to do

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.640
is fill in this punnet square. Look at this box, combine

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.660
the column and the row. We can have a plus and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.240
a minus here. You can have a plus and a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.000
minus here. You can have a plus and a minus here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.790
You can have a plus and a minus here. It turns

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.039
out that all the possible combinations appear to be the same.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.590
So, based on these results, what percentage of the children will be lactose

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.870
intolerant, like the dad? Go ahead and put your answer and percentage form here.
