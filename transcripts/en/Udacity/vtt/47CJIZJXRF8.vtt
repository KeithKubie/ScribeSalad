00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.870
For this quiz, I've got some CSS on
the screen with two break points and

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.520
the two resulting layouts.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.560
I want you to tell me
which div is which.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.130
For the red, green, and dark blue boxes,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.030
type in the IDs of the elements
over here that match.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.240
Your options are box A,
box B, and box C.
