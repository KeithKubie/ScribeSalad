00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, and this is Crash
Course Study Skills.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.920
Henry Fonda was a famous actor with a career
that spanned 54 years and included starring roles
in classic movies like 12 Angry Men and Once
Upon a Time in the West.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.320
He was one of the most well-known and successful
actors of his time, bringing home an Oscar, two Golden
Globes, and even a Grammy before retiring.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.720
So it might surprise you to learn that Fonda
had a lifelong struggle with performance anxiety.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.080
In fact, even when he was 75 years old, with over half
a century of acting experience under his belt, he would
often throw up before beginning stage performances.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.510
But, despite his anxiety and sudden lack of lunch,
Fonda would still step out from behind the curtain and
give the audience the great performance they expected.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.740
That’s because he understood one of the unavoidable
facts of life – a fact that the author Steven Pressfield
put so well in his book The War of Art:

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.239
“Fear doesn’t go away.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.420
The warrior and the artist live by the same
code of necessity, which dictates that the
battle must be fought anew every day.”

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.740
If you’re a student, you might not be performing
on a stage or facing down an enemy army,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.260
but your tests and exams are battles all their own,
and they often come with the same feelings of anxiety.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.000
These feelings are normal, and you’ll never
truly banish them.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.360
If you’re doing work that’s important to you,
you’ll always feel some amount of anxiety.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.160
And that can actually be a good thing, because anxiety
is an indicator that what you’re doing IS important.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Otherwise, you’d be apathetic about it.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.660
However, too much test anxiety can hurt you.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.720
Research has shown that high-pressure situations
can actually deplete your working memory.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.000
Additionally, stress caused by anxiety
produces a hormone called cortisol,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300
and too much cortisol can hinder the ability
of the hippocampus to recall memories.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.580
This means that it is crucial to learn how
to manage your test anxiety.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.740
You have to learn how to perform well in the
face of it, and make sure it doesn’t consume

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.200
your thoughts so you can actually solve that
geometry proof that’s staring you in the face.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560
Fortunately, there are several techniques
and mental exercises you can use to do that.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.400
Roll the intro!

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.240
[Theme Music]

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.000
Test anxiety is caused by many different factors,
but today we’re going to focus on the most common
ones, which I call the Three Big Fears:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.460
Number one: A fear of repeating past failures

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280
Number two: The fear of the unknown

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.090
Number three: The fear of the stakes

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.740
Now, in a minute, we’re going to dig into each of these fears and work to figure out how you can combat them,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.320
but before we do that, there is one general
purpose strategy I want to share with you.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.720
The next time you feel anxious going into a test, take
out a piece of paper and spend a couple minutes writing
out exactly what’s causing you to feel that way.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.500
This has been scientifically proven to reduce
test anxiety.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.040
A study done at the University of Chicago found
that students who were given 10 minutes to write
about their fears and anxieties before a test

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.880
improved their scores by an average of nearly
one grade point compared to the control group.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.960
This technique works for pretty much the same
reason that using a to-do list works:

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.440
It allows you to take all those worries out of your
head and store them somewhere safe.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.360
You’ve probably been in a situation before
where you’re stressed, and a friend tells you,
“Hey, just don’t worry about it, man!”

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.720
Of course, you can’t – right?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.650
You can’t just let go of the things that
are worrying you – after all, your brain
thinks they’re important.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.500
However, by writing them down, you’re unloading
those worries into an external system that you trust.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620
Subconsciously, you know that they’re not
going anywhere.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.560
And by doing this, you free up mental resources
that you can then devote to doing well on the test.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.620
So that brings us to our first big fear: the
fear of repeating past failures.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.210
Logically, everyone knows that failure is
inevitable every once in awhile.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.380
“To err is human,” wrote Alexander Pope,
and the realm of calculus finals is no exception.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.920
But we’re not always logical.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.580
In fact, human beings have an inherent
negativity bias –

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.680
a tendency to remember and give more emotional
weight to negative events rather than positive ones.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.700
This is a feature of the brain that’s pretty
useful when it comes to survival –

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.040
after all, remembering which mushrooms
made you sick or not to try to shake hands with
a tiger is pretty important for survival.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.740
But the negativity bias doesn’t limit itself
to poisonous mushrooms or tigers;

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.450
any negative event can create feelings of
apprehension and fear when it comes up again.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.140
So even though almost everyone does poorly
on tests and exams at least once in awhile,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.340
when it happens to you, you might naturally
fear that it’ll happen again the next time around.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.720
So how you do you actually beat this negativity
bias?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.540
Well, first, realize that you’re not defined by
your past successes or failures –

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.940
despite what that insidious part of your
brain might try to tell you.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.740
While the path you’re on right now is certainly
in part a product of your past choices, it’s not
a path with a predetermined destination.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.200
At any time, you can choose to do things
differently than you did in the past.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.620
If you’re ready to do that, you need to start by
analyzing your past mistakes and gathering as
much information about them as you can.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.820
After all, you can only improve if you know
what you were doing wrong before.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.360
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.460
Elite chess players understand this concept
really well.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.280
While they spend a lot of their practice time
playing games and studying the openings and
endgames of players at higher ranks,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.420
they also dedicate a ton of time to analyzing their
own past games – especially the ones they lost.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.900
By doing so, they can start to correct bad
habits and uncover patterns in their playing, which
can then be tweaked or improved in the future.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.680
So take a cue from these chess players – as well
as from elite performers in pretty much any other
discipline, be it opera singers or figure skaters –

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.160
and review your past exams
to see how you can improve.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.420
Start by getting your hands on a copy of
your past exam;

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.280
if your teacher doesn’t usually hand these out
or let you take them home, talk to them after class
and ask if you can at least look it over.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.840
And while you’re talking with them, also
ask for feedback –

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.440
especially if your exam contained short-answer or
essay questions where there’s no concrete answer.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.180
Once you’ve got a past exam in your hands,
review the mistakes you made.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.110
Don’t just acknowledge your mistakes; for each
incorrect question, make sure you understand
why your answer was the wrong one.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.360
If it was a complex problem – like a math
equation – identify the exact point where
you made a mistake.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.980
Additionally, make sure you know what the
right answer was, and why it was right.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.140
Before you move on, cross-reference the question
with your notes, as well.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.400
If you’re going to be tested on that question
again – like in a final exam – highlight that section
of your notes so you know it’s important.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.740
You can also create quiz questions for later
review.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.360
Overall, shoot for mastery over the material
so you don’t make the same mistake again.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.500
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.780
The details of those incorrect questions aren’t
the only things that deserve reflection.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.620
You also need to figure out why you made the
mistakes in the first place.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.580
Ask yourself: Was I unprepared?

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.290
And if so, why was I unprepared?

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.230
Did I simply not put enough time into reviewing?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.710
Did I ignore the study guide?

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.550
Or did I use an ineffective study method?

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.160
If you feel that you were prepared, then maybe
something went wrong during the actual exam.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.340
Maybe you rushed through and made a lot of
careless errors.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.420
Or maybe you let time get away from you and
didn’t actually finish the whole exam.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.540
Or maybe that creepy AI from Ghost in the Shell
hacked your brain in the middle of the exam and forced
you to spend the whole time licking your paper.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.560
These things happen.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.020
Whatever the reason was, don’t let it get
you down too much.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.020
Remember that failure is a great teacher – and
it’s a better one than success.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.140
Since we remember our failures so well, every
one of them is a lesson and an opportunity.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.200
But you need to make sure that you use that
opportunity by making a plan for how you’ll
avoid the mistake in the future.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.680
Just saying “I’ll do better next time”
isn’t enough – you need to know exactly
how you’re gonna do better.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.980
And that’s not all you need to know.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.300
In fact, the more you can learn about your
exam in all its facets, the more comfortable
you’re gonna be.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.660
This is the way to overcome the second of
our big fears: The Fear of the Unknown.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.780
People naturally fear what they don’t understand,
and in general, this is a good thing!

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.680
It’s another one of those pieces of brain
programming that’s useful for survival,
and most other animals share it with us.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.360
When I visited New York City for the first
time several years ago,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.320
I noticed that the squirrels there seemed
much less afraid of people than the squirrels
back home in Iowa

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.260
– but that was because these big-city squirrels
had a lot of experience dealing with people,
and it was mostly positive.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.500
So try to gain as much experience with the
upcoming exam as you can.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.710
Now, we talked a lot about how to do this
in the last video on preparing for tests,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.040
but the general principle is to try to replicate
the test conditions when you’re studying.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.960
Do your best to get access to practice tests
and study guides, and create quizzes out of
your notes to fill in the gaps.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.420
Additionally, spend some time studying in
a classroom that looks and feels similar to
the one you’ll be tested in,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.720
and quiz yourself under the same time
constraints that you’ll face during the exam.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.820
You want to make the test feel like a familiar
old friend when you actually face it.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.080
As Scott Berkun, a professional public
speaker, put it:

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.000
“By the time I present to an actual audience,
it’s not really the first time at all.”

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.620
That’s the feeling you’re going for.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.940
And that brings us to the last of our big
three fears, which is the Fear of the Stakes.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.700
One of the biggest sources of test anxiety
is the feeling that this test means everything

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.020
– it’s gonna define your overall grade, where
you’ll be able to go to college, and whether or not
you’ll get to work for Elon Musk some day.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.600
But in reality, you’re rarely going to come
across a test or situation that you can’t recover
from in the case that things go wrong.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.080
Trust me – I actually failed a test in college
once.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.940
And Nick over there actually failed an entire
class – twice.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.480
And, even worse, I was once fired from a job.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.860
In both cases it was totally my fault, but
I learned my lessons, I made sure I never made
the same mistakes again, and I moved on.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.560
And even if things don’t go perfectly for
you, you’ll be able to do the same thing.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.900
If that’s not comforting enough, try reframing
the test in your mind.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.220
Think of it as yet another learning opportunity
rather than as a judgement.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.080
After all, a test challenges you to recall what
you’ve learned, and as we’ve already discussed,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.140
active recall strengthens your
mastery over the material.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.500
And – at least for me – viewing a test
this way makes it seem a lot less scary.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.720
Lastly, keep in your mind that anxiety isn’t something
you always need to try to deal with on your own.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.080
If you have anxiety that’s majorly affecting your
life, don’t hesitate to ask a professional for help.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840
Hopefully you found this week’s video to
be helpful.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.360
Next week, we’ll be switching gears and
talking about how to write great research
papers and essays.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:17.380
See you then!
