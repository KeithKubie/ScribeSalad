00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.440
Talking about traits like Huntington's disease that's

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.150
caused by replication errors is just depressing.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt; It is depressing, but not all replication

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.100
errors have to be so harmful. Actually, some

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.700
replication errors can be kind of good long-term,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.830
and they actually duplicate whole segments of DNA. &gt;

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.570
So, are you talking about duplicating a whole

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.072
gene? Sure. sometimes a whole segment of DNA

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.490
gets duplicated where gene is involved and the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.784
net effect is that an individual has an extra

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:26.745
copy of the gene.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:28.290
&gt;&gt; But why is that a good thing?

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt; Well, you can think about it as a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.800
new source of material for evolution to act on.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.670
&gt;&gt; So the extra copy, one can just

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.420
have a mutation and have a whole new function?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290
&gt;&gt; Sure. That's exactly what happened with

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.060
our beta globin genes. Through a process known

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.430
as duplication and divergence, an ancestral globin gene

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.830
was duplicated several times, and each of the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.260
copies mutated slightly to have a different

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.190
ability and expression pattern. Now, each of these

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.310
globin genes is important in oxygen binding, and

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.830
only expressed at different stages of human development.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.890
&gt;&gt; So, in this case, the replication error

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.900
caused something that was overall a positive thing.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, over time, that's exactly what happened.
