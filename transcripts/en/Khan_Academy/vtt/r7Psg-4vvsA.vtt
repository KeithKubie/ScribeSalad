00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.652
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.652 --> 00:00:04.031
So I've talked the idea of verb tense,

00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:08.176
which is the ability to
situate words in time,

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:10.638
but today I'd like to
talk about verb aspect,

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:14.382
which is kind of like tense, but more so.

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:16.019
Let me explain what that means,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.784
so with basic verb
tense, we can distinguish

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.720
between the present, the
future, and the past,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.297
right, so now, later, then, right,

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.670
past, present, and future,

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.829
so I could say, simply, "I walk",

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:37.420
"I will walk",

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.743
and "I walked",

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:43.429
so this is the past, this is the present,

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.144
and this is the future,
so that's verb tense,

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:49.187
but what's really cool about verb aspect

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:52.113
is it's this tool that really allows us

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:55.351
to expand all the possible ways

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.151
of expressing something in time,

00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:00.552
so you could just say "I walk", true,

00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:04.641
but you could also say "I am
walking" or "I'm walking",

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.617
or you could say "I have walked"

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:13.091
or

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:17.804
"I have been walking".

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:21.490
All of these things are different aspects.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.671
They're different versions
of the verb to walk,

00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.894
in the present tense,

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:29.299
and we'll explain all of the those.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.495
They'll each get their own video,

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:32.061
but I just wanted to impress upon you

00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.176
the idea that within every tense,

00:01:34.176 --> 00:01:36.497
past, present, and future,
that there are also

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.934
four mini tenses, or baby tenses,

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:40.513
and this is what we call aspect,

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:42.336
and we'll get to the names of those later.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:43.381
Don't worry about that now.

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:46.180
I just wanted to just plant the seed.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.781
You can learn anything.

00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.845
David out.
