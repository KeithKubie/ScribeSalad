up against the unknown and the
 

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.660
up against the unknown and the
frightening then you're also likely if

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:25.670
frightening then you're also likely if
 

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.340
frightening then you're also likely if
you develop into that sort of person

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:27.350
you develop into that sort of person
 

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.900
you develop into that sort of person
then you're also likely to develop into

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:28.910
then you're also likely to develop into
 

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.610
then you're also likely to develop into
the sort of person that other people

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:30.620
the sort of person that other people
 

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.930

the shadow was the anima which is like a
 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.380
the shadow was the anima which is like a
female figure and so his idea was

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:41.390
female figure and so his idea was
 

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.900
female figure and so his idea was
something like you know if you look

ability to learn now human beings are

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:43.060
ability to learn now human beings are
 

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.910
ability to learn now human beings are
very strange creatures right because

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:44.920
very strange creatures right because
 

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.270
very strange creatures right because
we're very malleable compared to most

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:48.280
we're very malleable compared to most
 

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.250
we're very malleable compared to most
animals you know like grizzly bears now

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.260
animals you know like grizzly bears now
 

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.590
animals you know like grizzly bears now
and grizzly bears a thousand years ago

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600

it's like whatever they're the same
 

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.680
it's like whatever they're the same
thing they do the same thing

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:57.690
thing they do the same thing
 

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.570

there's no transformation about human

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:00.580
there's no transformation about human
 

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.730
there's no transformation about human
beings we have this massive brain and

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:02.740
beings we have this massive brain and
 

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.460
beings we have this massive brain and
you know it's a pain because it means

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:05.470
you know it's a pain because it means
 

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.110
you know it's a pain because it means
you have to take care of human children

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120
you have to take care of human children
 

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.430
you have to take care of human children
until they're 40 and and that's a big

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440
until they're 40 and and that's a big
 

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.920
until they're 40 and and that's a big
burden and so you know we pay a big

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:13.930
burden and so you know we pay a big
 

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.510
burden and so you know we pay a big
price for it it also makes childbirth

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:15.520
price for it it also makes childbirth
 

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.050
price for it it also makes childbirth
very difficult and and it's costly you

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:19.060
very difficult and and it's costly you
 

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.460
very difficult and and it's costly you
have to eat a lot because you have a big

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:20.470
have to eat a lot because you have a big
 

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.840
have to eat a lot because you have a big
brain because it uses up a lot of energy

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:21.850
brain because it uses up a lot of energy
 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.590

can learn now the learning is a strange

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720
can learn now the learning is a strange
 

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.680
can learn now the learning is a strange
thing because you can think of it as

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:34.690
thing because you can think of it as
 

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.160
thing because you can think of it as
just acquiring more information but you

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.170
just acquiring more information but you
 

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.840
just acquiring more information but you
could also think of it and this is more

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:39.850
could also think of it and this is more
 

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.650
could also think of it and this is more
accurate as finding out something that

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:43.660
accurate as finding out something that
 

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.570

that that's okay with all of the viewers
now why would that be

it's like yeah yeah that's okay we can

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:15.940
it's like yeah yeah that's okay we can
 

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.810
it's like yeah yeah that's okay we can
we'll watch that clue well swallow like

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:18.820
we'll watch that clue well swallow like
 

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.460
we'll watch that clue well swallow like
we'll be completely engaged in it and

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:20.470
we'll be completely engaged in it and
 

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.749
we'll be completely engaged in it and
the reason for that is because it's a

the reason for that is because it's a
 

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:26.609
the reason for that is because it's a
myth it's about how people it's a meta
