00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.340
GREG KNOKE: Hi, my name's
Greg Knoke.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.280
I'm the Google Drive developer
relations technical writer and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.890
with me today is--

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.320
STEVE BAZYL: Steve Bazyl, I've
been here before of course.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.640
GREG KNOKE: And today we're
going to talk to about about a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.480
new feature we launched
for the real-time API.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.480
We've recently added an undo and
redo feature to the API.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.850
That makes it really easy to
implement this feature for

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.210
your own applications.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.600
And I think the best way to
demonstrate this is to jump

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.540
right into a live demonstration
on my screen.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.540
So, if you'll bear with me.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.600
STEVE BAZYL: Go ahead.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.190
GREG KNOKE: So right now on my
screen, what you can see is we

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.700
have the realtime quickstart
that you've

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.750
possibly seen before.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.740
It's part of our
documentation.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.740
And I have two accounts live
on the quickstart.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.780
So you'll notice we have our
standard text area and at the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.070
bottom we've added these new
Undo and Redo buttons.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.940
So if you look here I'll type in
a little bit of text here,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.710
and you can see that now the
Undo button has become

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.170
highlighted for only
one these screens.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.770
That's because these are
two separate accounts.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.050
So on the other account
you can see

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.060
that Undo is not active.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.760
That's because the Undo button
only undoes local changes.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.300
So you can see if I go
back to my other

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.310
account, undo a few changes.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.540
It's synchronized between both,
but only one account can

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.420
actually undo.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.580
Now if I go to the other
account, type a little bit,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.790
you'll see that if I undo
changes here, I'm still

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.040
undoing only the changes
made by that account.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.020
So this handles all the
complexity of what can happen

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.320
with undo and redo features in
a collaborative environment,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.220
but the code itself is very,
very simple to implement.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.070
And if you want to see how we
implemented this for this

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.010
specific example, go ahead and
take a look at the Google Apps

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.610
Developer Blog.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.980
And you can also take a look at
the realtime quickstart in

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.850
the Drive documentation.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.810
And to show off a little bit
more about this feature and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.540
how it works with more
complicated operations, I'll

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.760
hop over to Steve and he'll
take a look at a realtime

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.980
tasks application
he put together.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.620
STEVE BAZYL: So this is one of
the demos that we put together

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.800
with Realtime API
few weeks back.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.260
It's based on [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.170
And the difference between this
and the QuickStart is the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.520
data model's a little bit more
complicated in this one.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.320
It's a list of tasks and
tasks have statuses.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.760
And we can also do things
like bulk operations.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.590
Things like selecting
all of the tasks and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.730
marking them completed.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.360
When we do things like that that
we want to be one logical

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.810
operation from an undo
and redo perspective.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.740
And to do that, there is part
of the API in the realtime.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.380
API is this notion of compound
operations and within a block

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.630
of code you can just say begin
compound operation, make a

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.470
whole bunch of changes,
and then when you're

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.400
done, say end operation.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.150
And from an undo and redo
perspective, those things are

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.610
then treated as a single
operation on the stack.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.210
So you can see this, actually
if you can for the demo just

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.910
do a select all on
everything and

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.580
then try a clear completed.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.630
If we undo that,
what you see is

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.290
everything just gets restored.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.360
If we didn't do the compound
operation, what would happen

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.360
in this case is everything
would get cleared in one

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.960
operation, but if we tried to
undo them, they would all be

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.340
undone individually.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.340
Which is really not what would
be expected from a user

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.990
perspective.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.520
So it's really easy to do.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.865
I actually just did the code
for this yesterday.

00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:06.150
It took me about, probably
about five minutes to add

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.000
undo-redo support.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.520
Probably the hardest part
was figuring out

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.280
where to put the buttons.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.660
But the code for this is really
trivial and you can see

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.660
this on GitHub, Google Drive
/ realtime Tasks and

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.170
just check it out.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.340
It's really, really simple.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.050
There are some weird
cases with this.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.010
One of the things I want to show
in the QuickStart is some

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.270
weird cases that can happen
around conflicting changes.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.420
So Greg, I think you had
discovered this the other day.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.300
An interesting case where you
could have an undo, which is

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.060
effectively turns
into a no-op.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.640
GREG KNOKE: Right.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:53.020
So for example in this case,
if I undo or if I type the

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.000
word test one account and delete
in the other account

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.340
and then undo those and then
retype, I can't remember

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.140
exactly, and then try to undo
it, you'll see it takes a

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.380
while before undo actually
starts to do anything.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.470
That's because when trying to
undo words that the one

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.230
account is typed and then they'd
been deleted, the undo

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.130
turns into a no-op.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.050
So you can't undo
typing a letter

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.270
that since been deleted.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.920
STEVE BAZYL: Right, and this is
actually the same as even

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.620
if you take out the
concept of undo.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.810
If you were to type into a
range, in a list, or a string

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.130
that another collaborator
deleted that range.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.300
When those changes get resolved
and transformed, that

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.390
is a no-op operation because
you're deleting into an area

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.450
of text that doesn't
exist anymore.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.270
When those inserts or deletes
or transformed, you're

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.110
effectively into the
same situation.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.280
So even though it's a little
bit odd from a user

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.100
perspective, when you start to
think about how the underlying

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.900
technology works and
transformations, it actually

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.640
does make some sense.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.350
There's probably somethings you
can do to probably make

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.200
this a little bit easier for
users and developers.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.890
We had an idea of maybe like
fast forwarding a little bit.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.800
Trying to find things that
are actually undo able.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.190
But it is as it is now, it's
predictable, it's consistent

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.250
with the way that regular
inserts work today.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.910
GREG KNOKE: Thanks again for
tuning in for this Google

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.860
Developers Live and if you want
to see how we implemented

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.409
any of the code in the
QuickStart start or the

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.690
realtime tasks application, go
ahead and check out our code

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.500
repo on GitHub and also look at
the Google Apps developer

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.350
log and the Drive
documentation.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.890
STEVE BAZYL: And of course you
can always ask us questions on

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.990
Stack Overflow or on the
Google Drive Developers

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.350
Community and we're always happy
to talk more about the

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.300
realtime API and of course hear
that you're building.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.070
GREG KNOKE: All right,
well thank you again.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.430
STEVE BAZYL: All right, see
you guys next week.
