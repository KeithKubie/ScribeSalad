00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.340
- The prince wants to trade
Andrew Hall for a high value

00:00:02.368 --> 00:00:03.636
Jihadist prisoner.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.539
You told us this piece
of [muted] was dead.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.408
I told you he
was taken care of.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:12.145
Big changes up north in the
Panski Gorge close to Chechnya.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.748
We keep a light footprint, low
visibility, civilian clothes.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.217
Prince, a Navy SEAL--

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.753
The last thing you'll see
before you die is my face.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:23.122
--what's it matter
who shoots me?

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.357
The prince is smart.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.159
He won't kill you,
not right away.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.395
Convince him to keep you
alive, to run you back into us.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.164
And be your spy?

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.432
It's your only option.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.133
You want me dead.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.301
No.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.702
I want the prince.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.839
(ON PHONE) Halojena, that
was my favorite school.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.307
Exchange, Tom.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.275
We're here.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.843
Where are you?

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:47.647
The exchange has been moved
75 kilometers north, northeast

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.649
of the village of Chero.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.317
Chero's on the Chechen border.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.586
He's laying a trap.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:54.720
It's starting.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.322
(ON WALKIE) Delta
1, [inaudible]

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.724
we arrived on a possible
transport two clicks away.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:00:59.725
Grid to follow.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.694
Next com window in four hours.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.630
Haber One, out.
- That's our transpo.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.737
(ON WALKIE) Foxtrot
Delta One, the Georgians

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.672
are pulling drone coverage.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.674
Proceed as planned.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.144
No Georgia QRF, no drones.
Fair.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.745
We are walking into a trap.

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:22.448
You know this, I know this,
damn, [inaudible] knows it.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:23.449
What the hell are we doing?

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.584
We're doing our jobs.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.719
You're not seals.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:31.290
You're lobsters, getting
boiled one degree at a time

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:35.495
until it's too late to
crawl out the prince's pot.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.196
Ask her.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.598
This is personal.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.899
Look, he's right.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.635
It is personal, OK,
just like it is for you.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:45.638
The real man responsible for
Taggart's death is the prince.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.507
And if we want payback,
we've got to get him.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.512
And I need your
help, all of you.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:53.246
You want to try?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:00.787
Wow.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.695
So we're having a daddy,
daughter moment, huh?

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:15.501
- I guess we are.
- (ECHOING) Dad?

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.769
Dad?
Dad?

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:24.410
I'm fine.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.812
I'm fine.

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.414
You know what your problem is?

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:31.217
You might want to get in line.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.252
Summit Fever.
Summit Fever is--

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.821
Yeah, I know what
Summit Fever is.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.690
When you get close to the
top down and then the weather

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:41.794
rolls in, the real weather,
hardest thing to do

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.697
is walk away.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.500
We should walk away.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:51.971
Trust me, Ricky, I
won't lead you astray.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.776
Nazim, he's bait, right?

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.279
So I guess the question
is, for whose trap,

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:02.848
yours or the prince's.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:06.452
I need you you
can handle Ortiz.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:08.454
Look, we've
buddies a long time,

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:11.257
so he's going to do his job.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.960
You can't command
buddies, Graves.

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.863
You want to lead, you can't
be friends with any of them.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:22.202
Hey, Bear, we got
a situation up here.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:35.014
Christ.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:38.284
Stop right there.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.853
Go ahead, get your pay back.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.755
It won't matter.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:48.995
You, your family, all
of you are dead already.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:49.662
Mom?

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:53.966
Jesus.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.901
Mom?

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.503
Mom.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:59.839
If I die, a trigger
gets pulled on all of you,

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.041
the same as Taggart.

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:03.776
Why do you have a gun, Mom?

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:04.977
Take me back.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.012
I'll make a call.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.613
Take your families off the list.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.383
Hold, Nazri, you
pulled your one trigger,

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.618
Taggart, your personal payback.

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.053
There is no [inaudible]
- Bull[muted].

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:16.722
You never caught a shooter.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.357
My people don't need orders.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.061
They're still in place
stalking your families.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:24.797
Call it off, and I'll
take you down there myself.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.766
Take me down there first.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:31.504
[inaudible] He's bluffing.
Let's move out.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:33.673
The hand-off is in three hours.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.409
Your family is safe, Ortiz.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:37.943
This is it.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.079
The village is 5
kilometers up that valley.

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:45.418
Hey, Bear, village must be
Kishnet which is in Chechnya.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.920
The prince wants us
to walk into Russia.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.622
We don't to do it, boys.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.891
Look, this is what we do.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.927
We take risks and
we follow orders.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.329
We got to go now.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.701
Rip, we don't go.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.569
He would put a bullet
in Nazri's his head

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:05.305
and take us home
back to our families.

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.976
I'm not Rip.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:11.878
I'm not Rip.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.587
Might as well see
what happens next.
