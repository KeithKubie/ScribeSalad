- OH, [bleep]!

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.476
WELL, TOOK CARE
OF THAT EYE SITUATION!

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.446
KIND OF GOT A LITTLE BLIND SPOT
FROM HERE TO HERE,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.815
BUT HEY, SMALL PRICE TO PAY

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.484
- WHOA!
GOD DAMN, YOU DO LOOK GOOD!

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.353
YOU'RE JUST ABOUT PERFECT,
WOODY.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.989
- "JUST ABOUT"?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "JUST ABOUT"?

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.291
- WELL, IF I HAD GODLIKE LIPS
AND EYES,

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.159
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM COMPETING
FOR REAL ESTATE

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.928
WITH MY OVERSIZED NOSE AND EARS.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.497
I'D TAKE THOSE IN JUST A SMIDGE.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.933

OH, OH! [grunts]

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.003
HEY, MALLOY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
PLAY WITH MY FROZEN HOOKERS,

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:38.038
AT LEAST PUT 'EM BACK!

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.242
[monitor beeping]
- IT'S TOUCH AND GO.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:44.111
FOR 12 MINUTES,
HE WAS CLINICALLY DEAD.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.581
[monitor flatlines]
AND HE'S DEAD, AGAIN.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.719
[monitor beeping]
AND NOW, HE'S BACK.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.155
- DO YOU THINK HE CAN MAKE IT TO
A FOREST OPENING AT 9:00 A.M.?

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.290
- YES, OF COURSE, THAT IS,

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:59.226
IF THE FOREST OPENING
IS IN HELL.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.528
[phone rings]

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.931
WOODY, I'VE GOT
SOME REALLY BAD NEWS.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:07.367
- SECOND WIND!
- UH, I'M GAY.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.303
- COME ON, STEVEN,

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:14.675

[retches]

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.710
[grunts]
HOLD ON.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.479
[coughs] SOME OF THESE PILLS
ARE STILL INTACT.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.915
<i>ALLONS-Y, MON FRERE.</i>

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.084
[screams]
- ALL RIGHT, WOODY.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.487
LET'S GET A LOOK
AT YOUR BRAND NEW FACE.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.456
AND, VOILA!

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.259

YOU WERE RIGHT!

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:36.430
I AM A GODDAMN ADONIS!
