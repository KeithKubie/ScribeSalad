00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.190
Unlike recessive alleles, having two copies of every

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.560
gene does not protect you from a dominant allele.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.700
As we learned in lesson five, having one

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.940
copy of a dominant allele is enough to cause

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.540
a phenotype. Now in the case of dwarfism,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.010
the most common cause is a dominant allele that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.300
causes Achondroplasia, which is inhibition in bone growth. Achondroplasia

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.610
is one of the most common causes of dwarfism.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.090
So this is what normal bone growth looks like.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.020
If we take a long bone from your body, the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.530
end of it it has a particular kind of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.620
cell, here I'm outlining it in red, that actually grows

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.410
and divides and then it comes into the long

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.480
bone part of the bone and it provides the material

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.960
that grows the bone longer over time. Now, those

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.920
red cells are red, indicating that they had a particular,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.200
important protein called Fgfr3. It stands for fibroblast

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.278
growth factor receptor 3. And we'll learn a bit

00:00:58.278 --> 00:01:03.009
more about it in a moment. But we'll just call it Fgfr3 for now, and as these

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.495
Fgfr3 positive cells grow and divide, then they

00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:09.400
become the cells that are part of the, the

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.090
physical substance of the long bone itself. So, the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.270
way the bone grows itself, essentially, is these Fgfr3

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.210
positive cells grow and divide into more cells,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.480
and that's how the bone gets longer. Now,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.480
how do bones end up a certain length,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.580
and they're not shorter or longer? Well, it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.030
turns out that this protein Fgfr3 is really important in regulating this

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.760
process, in fact, signalling through Fgfr3 in a cell keeps

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.650
the bone from growing too long. An active Fgfr3 protein prevents

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.770
bones from growing even longer, but some mutations

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.990
in the Fgfr3 gene, results in a protein

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.480
that's over active. And it actually stunts the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.945
growth of bones even more, so that they

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:57.830
can't grow as long even as they normally would. So, let's learn a bit more about

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.850
this Fgfr3 protein. The Fgfr3 gene can be

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.806
found on chromosome four in the human genome.

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:11.280
Chromosome four has 186 million base pairs in it, and the Fgfr3 protein can be

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.710
found near the end. The Fgfr3 gene itself consists of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.570
17 exons spanning 15,000 base pairs,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.050
after transcription and splicing, the resulting mNRA

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.890
has 2,421 nucleotides of coding region.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.980
And after translation, we'll have a protein

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.050
with 806 amino acids. Remember, we just divided

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.920
2,421 by three and then subtracted one from

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.650
the overall answer, because the last codon is

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.030
a stop codon, which doesn't code for an

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.170
amino acid, it's just empty. Now, let's actually

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.850
look at one allele of this gene that's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.720
associated with Achondroplasia. One allele of the Fgfr3

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.290
gene contains a G to A, a guanine to

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.270
add new mutation at position 1138 of the coding region.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.220
Now using the genetic code which we learned about in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.640
lesson three, and you can find posted in the instructor's

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.410
notes on this page. I want you to determine the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.730
change expected in the amino acid sequence here. And then

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.290
select the type of mutation best used to describe this

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.440
A allele from the list below. Now if you have

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.920
trouble answering this you want to go back and review mutations

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.770
from lesson six.
