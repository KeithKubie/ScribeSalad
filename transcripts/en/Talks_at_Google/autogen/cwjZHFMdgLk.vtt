DAN CAREY: So today,
welcome to this Talk

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.380
at Google with Jess Lee.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.400
I'm Dan Carey, and
joining me is Jess.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.172
JESS LEE: Hi.

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:16.570
DAN CAREY: She is a
partner at Sequoia Capital.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.870
Previously she was at
Google as a product manager,

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.070
and then Polyvore--

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.790
Polyvore.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.340
She joined as a product manager.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.930
You were then VP of product,
honorary co-founder,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.730
and ultimately CEO.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.600
Led the company through the
acquisition with Yahoo in 2015.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.780
You were Fortune's 40 Under
40 list, Glamour's top 35

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.880
Under 35 Women in Tech, and a
whole bunch of other things.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.530
So welcome.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.674
Thanks for coming.

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:41.215
JESS LEE: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:42.093
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.093 --> 00:00:44.087
Oh, thank you.

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:46.170
DAN CAREY: So what's it
like to be back at Google?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.010
JESS LEE: Oh, it's totally--

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.580
DAN CAREY: Is it wild?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.496
JESS LEE: It's trippy.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:49.600
It's very surreal.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.200
I used to sit in this
building in 2005, I think,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.390
when it first opened.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.280
Yeah, it's kind of
cool to be back.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.590
I learned a lot of
things on this campus.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.130
I was an APM, and I worked
on Froogle, which was

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.480
product search back in the day.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
And then, after a short stint
there, I moved to Google Maps.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.760
But this was when Google
Maps was a desktop product

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.460
and we did not have smartphones,
so it was a pretty long time

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.252
ago.

00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:16.419
DAN CAREY: So you joined
Polyvore right from Google,

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.918
right?

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:17.670
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.540
DAN CAREY: And it was kind
of a weird journey, right?

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.940
Like, it wasn't
normal circumstances

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.648
for leaving Google
and joining a company.

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:23.310
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.020
Yeah, I would say it was a
little bit of an unusual path.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.300
So I remember, I was sitting
at Google in my office

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.770
with another Google Maps
PM, and he was like, hey,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.460
you should check out
this site called Polyvore

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.750
that my friend is working on.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.320
And I was like, OK.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.361
I checked it out, and I
was like, oh my god, this

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:40.000
is amazing.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.930
What Polyvore does is it lets
you mix and match and create

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.400
outfits out of real products.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.900
And you can create those
outfits and share them

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.650
with your friends.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.420
It's kind of like
a fashion magazine

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.850
created by a community of
women all over the world,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.930
but everything is shopable.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.090
So I fell in love.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.700
I started using it two
or three hours a night,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.290
and just couldn't get
it out of my brain.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.920
And then, because I
was a PM, I wrote--

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.840
I had a lot of complaints
about the product.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.240
So I wrote them all
down, and I sent an email

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.217
to one of the founders,
and I was like, hey,

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.300
I love his product, I think
it's going to be huge,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.435
but can you fix this,
this, this, this, this,

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.610
and here are some suggestions
for how to fix them.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.600
And then he wrote
back and said, hey,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.420
these are all great suggestions.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.150
Why don't you just come
work here yourself and fix

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.777
all this stuff yourself?

00:02:22.777 --> 00:02:24.360
And so that's what
ended up happening,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.740
and that's how I
ended up at Polyvore.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.360
DAN CAREY: So you
filed a bug report

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.568
and got them assigned to you?

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:31.410
JESS LEE: Yeah, kind of.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.370
DAN CAREY: Polyvore is
fantastic and awful.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.150
My wife used to work
at Polyvore and joined

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.200
Polyvore for the same
reason, because she

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.940
needed to pay for all the stuff
she was buying on Polyvore.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.100
So it's a very good site.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.600
So what was it about Polyvore
that caught your interest when

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.230
you were using it?

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.771
What clicked?

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.960
What made you so
passionate about it?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.377
JESS LEE: So before getting
into computer science and Google

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:54.960
and all that, my
original goal in life

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.345
was to be a comic book artist,
because I really loved to draw.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.080
That ended up not working out,
because my parents wouldn't

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.590
let me go to art school
because they're Asian

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.570
and they thought it wasn't
a legitimate career.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.740
But what drew me into
Polyvore was the ability

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.240
to self express.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.580
I mean, it was a creative
tool, ultimately,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.640
and it was kind of at the
intersection of art and fashion

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.450
and technology.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.794
So I thought, wow, how
often does something

00:03:21.794 --> 00:03:23.460
like that happen where
it pulls together

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.340
a lot of your passions?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.630
It's something that's at
the very earliest stage,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.244
so if I went there, even
though there's not a lot there,

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.660
I would get the opportunity
to learn a ton, which actually

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.910
reminded me of the APM program.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.701
I got into the APM
program thinking, OK,

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:38.700
I don't know how to do--

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.940
I don't even know what a PM
is, but at least if I come here

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.100
to Google, I'll grow and I'll
learn, and maybe it'll work,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.740
maybe it won't, but
at least I would

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.235
challenge myself and grow.

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:53.110
And that's exactly how
I felt about Polyvore.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.920
I was like, there's
nothing here,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.560
maybe I can volunteer and step
up and do some of those things,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.760
and I'll grow a lot.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.620
And that's what
ended up happening.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.040
I actually kept volunteering
to do various different things

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.740
at the company.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.310
You know, I was like, well,
let me write the blogs,

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.926
since I'm a marketing person,
or let me answer the phone when

00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:12.300
the advertisers call, because
we don't have a sales team.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.680
And then what ended up happening
is I would try that job,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.000
learn just enough to be
a little bit dangerous,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.709
like just enough,
and then figure out

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.854
I wasn't very good at it, and
then hire someone to do it.

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:25.020
But having done it myself,
I was a little bit better

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.060
at finding the right
person to hire.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.330
And then that person
would inevitably

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.139
end up reporting to me,
because I was the only sort

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.430
of business person at the time.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.720
And then we just kept
growing, and eventually

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.670
all the departments
were reporting in to me,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.020
except for engineering.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.150
And my title was
still VP of product.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.870
And at that point, we
decided to make the switch

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.490
where I became CEO.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.070
So very unusual path to
sort of running a company,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.879
but that was mine.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.420
DAN CAREY: That's
really interesting.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.490
And in that time,
was there anything

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.290
that you came across that
you were like no way,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.660
I can ever do this, huge
mistake, way too dangerous

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.750
at this?

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.610
JESS LEE: Yeah, that
was like every day.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.590
I mean, startups
are incredibly hard.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.930
Every day is a new obstacle.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.690
And I definitely felt like--

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.570
especially since I
was growing quickly

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.150
and the company was
growing, every time

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.770
I felt like, OK,
I've got it now,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.657
I've figured out
how to do my job,

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:23.490
I think I might have
figured it out finally,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.520
that feeling would inevitably
only last for a brief moment,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.229
because then the
company would get bigger

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.228
and then everything would
change all over again,

00:05:30.228 --> 00:05:32.010
new people, you know,
the process that

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.740
was perfect for
communicating with 20 people

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.210
broke at 50 people.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.730
And then as we got that
right, it broke again at 75

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.940
and then at 125.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.837
And then, you know,
when you're growing,

00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:43.920
things just keep changing.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.295
You just kind of
have to get used

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:49.500
to the feeling of
constantly not knowing

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.229
what you're doing
or not knowing how

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.770
to do something,
which is essentially

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.034
the same thing as learning.

00:05:54.034 --> 00:05:55.200
So you should kind of seek--

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.552
I've always felt like you
should seek out that feeling.

00:05:57.552 --> 00:05:59.760
You should try to find that
really nauseous, horrible

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.385
feeling of I don't
know what I'm doing,

00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:04.330
because that's how you know
you're getting career growth.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.400
DAN CAREY: And then
was there anything

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.787
while you were kind
of the CEO of Polyvore

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:09.870
that kept you up at night?

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.040
I mean, what was
your biggest worry

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.370
while you were doing that?

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.161
JESS LEE: Oh, yeah.

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:17.410
So specifically-- I mean,
there were so many things.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.856
Product market fit.

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:22.480
Was our product
serving the users well?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.990
We were very, very
community driven.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.640
And then figuring
out is the market

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.681
that we're in big enough?

00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:28.550
Do we have to
evolve the product?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.380
Lots of hiring.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.080
Lots of the-- especially
later, all of the issues

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.980
became very much
related to people.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.655
So did I have the
right VP of sales?

00:06:38.655 --> 00:06:40.280
Did I have the right
VP of engineering?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.310
Were these people clicking?

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.768
I mean, there were
so many moments.

00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:44.240
And, strangely,
they all felt very

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.760
existential, because
I think when you're

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.090
running the company, your
identity becomes intertwined

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.330
with the company's identity,
and every bump in the road

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.850
feels very, very
personal, which is part

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.920
of what makes startups so hard.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.340
DAN CAREY: So I was kind of
stalking you on your Sequoia

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.460
page before this, and you
talk about grit a little bit.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.300
You talk about being able to
create delight and overcome

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.180
obstacles, just kind
of sticking with it.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.420
I'm sure everything wasn't
always on the up and up,

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.170
and it's a startup,
so there tons of times

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.253
where you feel like dying.

00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:16.880
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.620
DAN CAREY: So any
advice for people

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.300
in terms of developing grit?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.830
Is it something that's innate
and you just kind of have

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.180
to express it, or
is it something

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.930
that you practice over time?

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.846
JESS LEE: Yeah, I
definitely think-- you know,

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.430
some people start out--

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.180
there's this concept
of distance traveled.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.280
Like when you're looking at,
say, an interview candidate,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.863
and you look at their
resume, and then

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:35.450
if you look at the distance
traveled, like where did they

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.880
come from and how
far have they gone,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.380
that's actually a good metric.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.150
That's how I really
think about grit.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:45.350
If you started at an easier
place in life, more privileged,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.980
maybe your distance
traveled might actually

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.490
be less than someone who
had none of the privilege.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.280
So I think sometimes
your upbringing

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.290
and where you came from,
that original distance

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.444
traveled to get to where
you are, actually increases

00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:01.610
your grit sort of naturally.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.193
It could be your
family circumstances.

00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:04.970
It could be your
socioeconomic classes.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.844
But on top of that, I
think grit is something

00:08:06.844 --> 00:08:08.162
you actually develop over time.

00:08:08.162 --> 00:08:09.620
And the way you do
that is you push

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.350
yourself to travel further.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.190
You get used to just forcing
yourself to do things

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.260
that are hard, that feel bad.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.670
That nauseous
feeling of learning

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.035
that I was talking about.

00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:22.910
And that's actually what
increases your grit.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.230
Because grit is really--

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.350
it's really pain tolerance.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.760
So if you can put yourself
into those painful situations

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.343
and those challenges,
rather than kind

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.086
of taking the easy
route or coasting,

00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:34.669
that's, I think, how
you develop grit.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.400
And I think grit is one of
the most important ingredients

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.549
in startup founders,
because it's just so hard.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.590
You don't control so many
of your circumstances,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.450
or you don't control what
happens with the market.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.200
You can't control the
fundraising climate.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.844
You can't control what all
the people on your team

00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:51.260
decide to do, or if there's a
competitor that comes along,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.030
so you really have to have grit.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.200
You need to practice at getting
stronger and stronger to put up

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.740
with all the ups and downs.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.240
DAN CAREY: So is that something
you look for now that you're

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.990
on the other side of
that funding table,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.114
now that you're at Sequoia?

00:09:04.114 --> 00:09:05.420
JESS LEE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.540
You know, I think a combination
of grit and passion.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.940
To get through the pain of
just the basics of starting

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.020
a company, you either have to
really care about the problem

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.520
and be mission oriented, or you
have to have that natural grit.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.270
But there has to be
something driving you,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.890
because, on average,
it takes, I think,

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.340
eight or nine years to build
a company from ground zero

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.310
to a successful outcome, like
an [INAUDIBLE] or a large M&amp;A.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.440
And so, you know, imagining
that amount of time,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.564
it has to be something
you probably care about.

00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:38.730
You need the grit to power
through all the problems.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.310
DAN CAREY: Yeah.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.260
One of the other things that
you mention on your Sequoia

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.676
profile and a few
other interviews

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:44.140
that I've seen with
you is you talk

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.585
about focusing on one thing and
doing it really, really well.

00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:48.210
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.430
That was one of the core
value at Polyvore, yeah.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.120
DAN CAREY: Do one thing.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.510
JESS LEE: Mm-hmm.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.800
DAN CAREY: So how has that
one thing kind of changed?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.410
I'm sure being a wannabe
comic book artist,

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.659
being an APM at Google,
being at Polyvore

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:59.700
in all those different
roles, it's changed a lot.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.325
How do you kind of
pick that one thing?

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:02.130
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.770
I think when I was a
PM, one of my strengths

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.340
was actually
empathy, it was being

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.710
able to think what does the
user want in this situation?

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.439
As they're printing out their
driving directions before--

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:17.980
on Google Maps back when we used
to print driving directions,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.642
because remember,
this is desktop days,

00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:20.600
what are they thinking?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.350
What do they want?

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.660
And that empathy helped guide
a lot of product decisions.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.640
But then as you become--

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.050
then I became--

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.830
I transitioned,
and at Polyvore I

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.800
started answering the
phones for sales calls.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.500
Then the empathy
was applied to what

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.660
does the advertiser want,
and trying to research

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.940
and understand enough about
the advertising industry

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.640
to imagine, OK, it's not
just this is an advertiser.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.940
The person that I am talking
to is an account manager

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.670
at a large agency who is
trying to advance their career

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.130
and wants to do good
for this client.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.714
The client probably
thinks this way.

00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:57.130
And being able to
take all of that

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.260
and figure out what the
right ad product was.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.020
Then, as the company got large
and I started managing people,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.480
it was what does
my team care about?

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.940
Where is this person
in their career?

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.370
How do they feel about the
current state of the company,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.110
their team, their career goals?

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.810
And now that I'm
investor side, again

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.176
that applies to trying to
understand the founder.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.550
And then trying to understand
the market that they're in,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.000
the users that they're serving,
what do they care about.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.750
So I would say that first I
thought, oh, my one skill is

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.649
actually product design
and product manager,

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:29.190
and then I looked
a little bit deeper

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.312
and I realized it was probably
something to do with empathy.

00:11:32.312 --> 00:11:33.770
DAN CAREY: Do you
think that's just

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.870
the key for consumer
businesses is empathy

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.920
kind of across the board?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.525
Is that the thing to nail?

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:40.160
JESS LEE: Not
necessarily, because I

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.220
think with the help of
amazing user researchers

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.780
who can tell you these are your
three personas of, you know,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.080
the three types of users that
you're solving for, you can

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.240
actually-- if you're an
analytical, smart person,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.810
if you have that
data given to you,

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.330
rather than having
to imagine it,

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.460
you can still be a
fantastic product designer.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.800
I think the key
with great consumer

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.660
design, product design, is
creating a kernel of delight.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.330
It's not enough to have a
product that solves a problem

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.830
and sort of does what
people ask you for.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.350
You have to go way
above and beyond.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.810
And there has to be this moment
of, whoa, I didn't expect that,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.190
or that was amazing or
unexpected, to the point where

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.125
you would bother
to tell a friend.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.680
A good example is
actually Snapchat.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.110
When you take your--

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:37.830
when you do the filters and you
do one that's the face swap.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.430
That's really clever
because I didn't expect that

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.080
inside some sort of chat app.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.340
And then, it's inherently viral.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.360
I will sit there and
show it to my friend,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.620
and we'll do it together.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.080
And that's a moment of
word of mouth delight.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.310
So I think the secret to
great consumer products

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.060
is you have to grow.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.850
And if you're
growing organically,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.274
it's because people
are talking about you.

00:13:02.274 --> 00:13:04.440
And the way to get people
to talk about your product

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.680
is to do something above and
beyond that's really, really

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.294
delightful.

00:13:08.294 --> 00:13:09.585
So that's how I think about it.

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:11.280
DAN CAREY: So what do you
think the most important thing

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.050
was that you worked at
while you were at Polyvore?

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.966
And I'm wondering if you
knew how important it

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:15.735
was at the time.

00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:18.570
JESS LEE: Yeah, I
don't think I did,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.660
but it turned out to be culture.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.480
In the beginning,
when you're starting,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.450
the product you build
as a CEO, as a founder,

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.170
is the product, the service
that is delivered to your users.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.740
But then as the company
grows, your attention

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.710
actually-- you get further and
further away from the product,

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.590
because you're not the one
writing the code anymore,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.840
or you're not the one making
the day-to-day decisions,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.670
you're managing through a team.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.970
And the product actually
starts to become the company

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.350
and the organization.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.800
And the same way that you
instrument your product

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.940
and measure is this
feature working or not,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.610
your AB test, or you carefully--

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.937
you know, you put Google
Analytics on everything.

00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:02.520
You actually have
to do the same thing

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.320
with your company and your
team to make sure it's healthy.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.220
Like are you measuring your
employee engagement scores?

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.080
Are people happy and thriving?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.000
Is code being checked?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.990
And you actually have to
pay a lot of attention

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.120
to how people work together.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.280
And, most importantly,
the culture

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.030
is basically the
operating system.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:22.080
So it's about
building the operating

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.360
system for the company,
which is the culture,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.294
and then all those metrics
and things that you monitor.

00:14:27.294 --> 00:14:28.710
And the larger and
larger you get,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.334
the more and more
important it becomes,

00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:32.880
because you need people to
be aligned on how to behave.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.870
And that's something
I've always thought

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.120
was really great about Google.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.270
I always felt like there was a
clear culture when I was here,

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.960
and it was measured and
defined and really cared

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.641
about and thrived, and everyone
knew what being Googley meant.

00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:47.640
And I think that's part
of why Google has always

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.524
been successful.

00:14:49.524 --> 00:14:51.440
DAN CAREY: So did you
just fork Google culture

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.210
and bring it over to Polyvore?

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.440
JESS LEE: No, actually.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.700
I had made some--

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.970
a lot of it's the same,
like empowering engineers

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.400
to make decisions,
empowering product people

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.610
and try to be a little bit more
bottoms up, or at least that's

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.010
how it felt when I was here.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.580
I copied a lot of that.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.010
But the one thing
I did not copy,

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.490
and I think you can't
at a startup, is you

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.000
have to be very cognizant
that you're on a clock

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.270
and you're running out
of money all the time.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.570
Google has one of the best
business models in the world,

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.940
and basically
AdWords and AdSense

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.560
are printing money
in the basement

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.450
to power all kinds
of amazing projects.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.590
Now that's evolved to Android
or maybe other business lines,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:39.350
but that luxury of, oh,
we need to just purely

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.200
focus on building
the right product

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.382
and not have to worry too
much about revenue, which

00:15:44.382 --> 00:15:46.340
is the case-- it's probably
changed since then,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.530
but that was certainly
the case when I was here.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.620
I could not copy that
over into a startup

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.330
where you have 24
months of runway.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.180
And it's not even just the
runway of money you're funding.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.940
It's also the runway of
people's time and patience.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.420
If you're underpaying your
team, because they're not

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.970
at Google or Facebook,
then you have to make sure

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.250
they see a path to success.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.640
So I think being much more
conscious about spend as well

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.830
as urgency and people's time
was a big part of our culture

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.240
that I would say was
different than Google.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.590
DAN CAREY: So a couple things
I keep hearing is learning,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.434
people, caring.

00:16:26.434 --> 00:16:28.100
Are these the things
that motivated you?

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.150
Has your motivation been
the same across an APM,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.106
being a CEO, being at
Yahoo, being at Sequoia?

00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.647
JESS LEE: Personal motivation.

00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:37.980
I think I care about two things.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.632
One is impact.

00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:40.340
Like what kind of
impact are you leaving?

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.090
What sort of dent are
you making universe?

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.260
And the second is just
personal growth and learning.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.020
I found that if, again, if
you optimize for learning,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.164
then you think about success
and failure in a different way,

00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:53.330
because sometimes you learn
the most in the toughest

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.761
situations where you
are most likely to fail.

00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:58.010
So if you reframe that
conversation into am I learning

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.930
or not learning, and
learning is success,

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.200
then you stop thinking
about whether you're

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.440
getting the A or
the C or whether you

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.060
sold for a billion dollars
or a hundred million.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.627
You just stop thinking purely
about the outcome, which

00:17:13.627 --> 00:17:15.710
makes you afraid sometimes,
because you don't want

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.390
to risk what you already have.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.994
And then the other is impact.

00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:22.160
One of the things that I
really loved about Polyvore

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.800
was it had this very
democratizing effect

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.430
on fashion.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.164
It was about letting
a community of women

00:17:27.164 --> 00:17:28.580
all around the
world say, no, this

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.040
is what I think is
stylish, and I don't want

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.160
to listen to the fashion
magazines telling me

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.910
this is what you're
supposed to look like.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.660
And, for the women who used
it, it was very empowering,

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.217
and that allowed
them to-- you know,

00:17:40.217 --> 00:17:42.050
when you feel like you
look a little better,

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.049
then you might feel a
little bit more confident.

00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:46.280
And we had so many
girls from school age

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.744
to girls applying to college,
to older women, just talking

00:17:48.744 --> 00:17:50.285
about how it helped
their confidence.

00:17:50.285 --> 00:17:52.770
So, for me, that was always
was part of the mission.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.770
And then part of the
mission, for me, at Sequoia

00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:00.060
is-- you know, the venture
is probably 7% women.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.510
And that, I think,
has downstream impacts

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.670
on the percent of women
who start companies

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.820
and the percent of
innovation that happens

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.310
in fields targeted at women.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.800
And then that affects execs
and all the way down the chain.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.847
So I thought maybe if I
could move into venture

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:19.430
and change the ratio
just a little bit

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.090
and help back amazing
founders, both men and women,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.180
but I might be a little bit
more inclined to understand

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.040
some of the female
founders who are working

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.520
on products targeted at women,
which I was at one point too.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.800
So that's on the impact side.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.794
DAN CAREY: So how are
you approaching your role

00:18:35.794 --> 00:18:36.960
as a partner at Sequoia now?

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.882
I know it's still relatively
new, but anything where you're

00:18:39.882 --> 00:18:41.340
like, this is what
I'm going to do,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.680
I'm going to be
focused on this, I'm

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.110
going to provide
this value to people?

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.840
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.920
So I think the investors
that do the best are probably

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.500
the ones that are actually
helpful to their founders.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.740
So I've tried to focus on
where can I be really helpful.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.260
And some of those
areas are in consumer,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.970
because that was what I did.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.060
My whole career has
been mostly in consumer.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.845
I'm also starting to look at
some spaces like AR and VR

00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:06.440
and robotics.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.440
I spend a lot of time meeting
female founders as well.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.300
I've been looking at
direct-to-consumer brands,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.650
which is fairly new for
venture and for Sequoia.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.790
Yeah, those are some of the
areas that I tend to focus on.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.950
DAN CAREY: And any
kind of niche fields

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.695
that you're kind of geeking
out about, excited about?

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:28.830
JESS LEE: I'm pretty
excited about robotics.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.020
I think now that computer vision
is of age, computers can see,

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.644
you're seeing a lot more
tech moving out of the phone.

00:19:36.644 --> 00:19:39.060
Instead of it being in a little
screen or on your desktop,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.310
it's moving out into
the physical world.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.120
And maybe the first--

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.670
basically it's sort of
the intersection of it's

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.300
all the tech that we know
from the internet moving

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.190
from pure bits into
the world of atoms.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.920
So maybe the earliest
version of this

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.550
might be something like
DoorDash or Instacart

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.080
or Google Shopping Express
where it's not just software

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.340
and are my bugs OK?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.135
It's like software
and then, oh my god,

00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:12.260
all the problems of the
real world, like the driver

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.330
was drunk or missed the
delivery, or the food's cold.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.800
These are not
things that software

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.680
can catch, which is why I
think a lot of these companies

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.530
are run by hardcore operational
people who just know how

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.360
to grind it out and
have a lot of grit,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.300
because it's not beautiful,
elegant software anymore.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.508
And I think you're going to
see more and more of that

00:20:31.508 --> 00:20:33.350
as we move into
fields like robotics

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.732
and more automation
in the real world.

00:20:35.732 --> 00:20:37.190
DAN CAREY: You
realize that now you

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.840
have to combine
fashion and robotics,

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.646
and I guess Google Maps now.

00:20:40.646 --> 00:20:42.730
JESS LEE: Yeah, I have
not seen that pitch yet,

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.980
but that would be pretty cool.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.200
DAN CAREY: I'm sure
it will come up.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.300
So before I ask you about
the most important thing

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.759
that you're working
on at Polyvore,

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:51.716
but what's the most
important thing that you're

00:20:51.716 --> 00:20:53.412
working on today, if
you're aware of it?

00:20:53.412 --> 00:20:55.070
JESS LEE: The most
important thing.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.890
I think, at the end of
the day, Sequoia's mission

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.840
is to help daring founders build
really legendary companies.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.660
So the most important thing
is to find those people

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.310
and help them.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:12.820
I have done two investments.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.090
I spent a lot of time
with those founders.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:15.960
One is a seed.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.840
One is a Series B. Because
I'm on the early-stage team.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.410
We do everything from seed to
basically Series B. Every day

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.985
is just trying to figure
out how to help them.

00:21:28.985 --> 00:21:30.860
And then the other piece
is I've been working

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.151
on various initiatives to
try to figure out how to help

00:21:33.151 --> 00:21:34.490
female founders more so.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.680
There'll be more on that
probably in a few weeks.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.600
DAN CAREY: OK.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.160
Yeah, I know you've been
doing a lot of talks lately.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.440
A conference a couple of
weeks ago for women in tech.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.430
JESS LEE: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.050
I love going to those events.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:49.675
It's so amazing to see all the
activity and the excitement.

00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:51.800
DAN CAREY: So when you were
running a startup, when

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.000
you were talking about
product market fit,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.480
how did you know
when you nailed it?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.125
I mean, delight won't give
you product market fit,

00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:57.170
it will give you virality.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.670
How do you know
that you're actually

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.870
providing that value early on?

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.172
JESS LEE: So I actually do think
that when you found delight

00:22:06.172 --> 00:22:07.880
and you found product
market fit that you

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.500
do start to see organic growth.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.539
You do start to see
that word of mouth.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.080
You're right, there
are moments where

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.590
you're seeing that word of
mouth for other reasons,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.812
like maybe you had a really
viral piece of content

00:22:21.812 --> 00:22:22.520
on your platform.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.587
So you have to be able to figure
out how to distinguish that.

00:22:25.587 --> 00:22:27.920
But, generally, I think organic
growth means that you've

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.500
found product market fit.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.269
The question, though,
is how large of a market

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.310
is it that you're working
on, and how-- you know,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.180
you can have product market
fit for some very tiny sliver

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.147
of a market or for
a particular user,

00:22:41.147 --> 00:22:42.730
and you have to be
able to distinguish

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.475
is this enough for a
sustainable company or not.

00:22:45.475 --> 00:22:47.600
I mean, I think that's the
biggest lesson that I've

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.450
learned on the venture side.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.770
I can assess the match between
maybe a user and a product,

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.170
but thinking through the
market structure, like is this

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.820
a good market to be in?

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.190
Are there tons and
tons of competitors?

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.980
Are the platform companies
most likely going

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.810
to dominate the space
in the long run,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.770
and, therefore, your tech
will be commoditized?

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.330
Thinking through those kinds
of issues in market size

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:11.960
and market structure
has sort of been

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.100
one of the biggest lessons.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.891
DAN CAREY: Any tips
for learning that stuff

00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:17.500
other than joining a
VC firm and thinking

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.900
about it 40 or 80 hours a week?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.940
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.860
I think-- this is
maybe something

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.510
I didn't do enough of as a
PM, is competitive analysis.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.820
Look through what other people--

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.440
you should obviously
figure out what's

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.360
great about your product,
but you also have to think--

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.880
when I say delight, when
you're going above and beyond

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.140
what people expect.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.500
What people expect is set by
what's available in the market.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.665
So just because you solved
their problem doesn't mean

00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:47.790
you're going to win if
there's another product that

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.250
also solves their problem but
has much better distribution

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.270
than you do.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.060
So you really have to think
about that line of what

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.110
people expect being set
partly by competitors.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.650
A good example of this is when
all the smartphones came out.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.550
Before that, BlackBerry
was the best phone.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.690
It had a keyboard.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.130
You could your email.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.156
And then when the iPhone
came out, that was just--

00:24:11.156 --> 00:24:13.530
I don't need a keyboard, like
I can browse the entire web

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.029
with this.

00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:16.140
It just reset
everyone's expectations.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.951
And it took-- a lot of companies
died during that because they

00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:20.700
didn't catch up and
they were just focused

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.700
on what they were doing.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.105
You have to think about who
else is innovating out there,

00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:25.347
and what are they doing.

00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:27.930
So I would say spending a lot
of time on competitive analysis.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.960
And then also thinking through
here's where we are now,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.679
where will we be in five years?

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.470
Where will my competitors
be in five years?

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:35.637
And then skate towards that.

00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:37.428
You know, skate to
where the puck is going,

00:24:37.428 --> 00:24:38.680
not to where it is right now.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.240
So just getting really good
at thinking about that is,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.725
I think, the most
important thing.

00:24:44.725 --> 00:24:47.410
DAN CAREY: And I'm guessing
that advice holds true for CEOs,

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:48.460
for basically everybody?

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.060
JESS LEE: Yes.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.570
DAN CAREY: OK.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.986
JESS LEE: I think that matters
a lot for founders and CEOs

00:24:51.986 --> 00:24:53.722
as well.

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:55.180
DAN CAREY: Does
stage matter there?

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.210
Should early-stage
startup founders

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.710
be worrying about
their competitors,

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.140
or should they just be
focused on delight and value,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.345
like you said?

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:04.470
JESS LEE: I think you still
have to think about it.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.800
It's not something you spend
every day obsessing about.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.590
I don't think you can be
constantly looking behind you,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.750
looking in the rear
mirror, but you

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.370
have to know what
the baseline is,

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.578
and you have to have a sense.

00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:18.120
And that's part of how
you set your strategy.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.000
And then you just focus
on getting to that point.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.590
But you have to make sure do
those checks periodically.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.937
It could be once a
year, if you're smaller.

00:25:27.937 --> 00:25:29.770
It could be every
quarter, if you're larger.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.730
But it is really
important to have that,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.300
to check the expectations of
the market on a regular basis

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.475
but focus most of your
time on actual execution.

00:25:38.475 --> 00:25:39.891
DAN CAREY: I'm
really curious what

00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:42.750
you think about the early
stages of community.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.860
Obviously, Polyvore had
a really good community.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.347
It had a good company culture.

00:25:47.347 --> 00:25:49.930
Do you see differences between
how you seed culture internally

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.520
at a company and how you
seed it in a product?

00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.070
JESS LEE: I think it's
best if they're somewhat

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.360
aligned, because, if they
are, then I think it comes

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.386
across more authentically.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.689
For the community, what we did
is the same way that we cared

00:26:12.689 --> 00:26:15.230
about our individual employees,
we cared about our community.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.850
When we would have
a community event,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.070
we would apply-- do
a few things well,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.870
rather than having
a massive conference

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.069
where we couldn't really
spend time with people,

00:26:23.069 --> 00:26:24.860
and we also didn't have
the money for that,

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.990
we chose to have
smaller meetups.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:32.960
So we got 20 people to come to
New York Fashion Week with us,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.086
and we threw a beautiful
breakfast for them.

00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:36.710
We took a couple of
them to some shows.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.810
We tried to give them the
tickets, instead of us going.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.310
Our community manager went
through all their Polyvore

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:45.470
profiles and picked
out items that--

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.460
products that they had used
regularly and then bought them.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.500
We got our advertisers
to just give us

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.560
swag, free stuff and coupons
and shoes or whatever.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.960
We packed them into these bags.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.590
And I remember we
had these breakfasts,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.140
and some of these women
would open it and just

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.020
start crying because
they were so happy.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.821
It was just the immense
delight was amazing,

00:27:04.821 --> 00:27:07.070
and it was just such a bonding
moment for those teams.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.500
And then they went on to
talk to the other community

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.210
members about it.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.180
So it was great for us.

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.220
It's hard to measure
whether that was really

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.860
an ROI-positive investment,
which is sometimes how people

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.790
think about
community, but I think

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.830
that's just not the right
way to think about it.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.790
Think about Zappos.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.970
Zappos has an
amazing reputation,

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.200
and that's because of good
customer service, but also

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.940
those stories of the woman
who wrote in or was on a call

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.470
with a Zappos person for
an hour talking about how

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.592
she had a whole
series of life events

00:27:38.592 --> 00:27:40.300
and therefore needed
to return the shoes,

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.841
and they'd let her
return it and then

00:27:41.841 --> 00:27:44.510
they counseled her for an hour
and then gave her something--

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.870
I don't know.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.370
I don't even remember
the lore anymore.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.245
But that's the point.

00:27:47.245 --> 00:27:50.320
All I remember is there was
a story, and it was amazing,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.070
and that's part of
what cemented, I think,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.957
the brand for Zappos.

00:27:53.957 --> 00:27:55.790
DAN CAREY: Do you think
people are focusing,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.340
founders, as much as they
should, on culture today?

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.460
Do you see a lot of these
really big, scalable networks

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.640
that don't really have
an identity to them?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.450
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:14.310
I think sometimes it's easy to
just be obsessed with winning

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.080
and not think about culture.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.540
And that's fine if
you're always winning.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.929
People love to work at
companies that are winning.

00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:21.970
That's a huge part of it.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.553
You can't just have
an amazing culture

00:28:23.553 --> 00:28:25.480
and then drive your
company into the ground.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.460
You have to have both.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.710
But I think some companies
have prioritized winning

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.130
over treating people well.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.820
And that works as long as you're
on that upward trajectory,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.539
but as soon as the
going gets tough,

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:41.580
I think people start to
look around and question,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.440
and they're like,
why am I here again?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.030
I'm being treated horribly.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.440
And then they start to bail.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.860
So part of culture and creating
that right operating system is

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.430
it smooths out the
bumps in the road,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.030
because when the
going gets tough,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.430
which it almost always
does at a startup,

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.790
there's always going to be
something that goes wrong,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:07.150
you get to keep your team
together for just a little

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:07.760
bit longer.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.801
They have a little bit
more loyalty, a little bit

00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:11.849
more patience, and that
extends that runway

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:12.890
that I was talking about.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.320
Because it's not just
a runway of money

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.700
and not being able
to pay people,

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.002
it's a runway of
people's patience.

00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:20.710
As an employee, you
have a million things

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.435
to choose as a job.

00:29:23.435 --> 00:29:25.310
If you're great, you
can come work at Google,

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:28.310
you can work at Facebook, and
then you get paid more too,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.760
but they choose to
work at your startup,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.580
and you have to
figure out how do you

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.230
get that little bit
of extra loyalty

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.450
when the going gets tough.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.890
So I think culture
is very important.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.140
I think, in general,
Silicon Valley does really

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.810
focus on culture.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:43.940
And every kind of culture.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.540
You know, there are
eccentric cultures.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.940
It can be extreme, that's fine.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.650
Yeah.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.170
But I think treating
employees right

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.775
is really, really important.

00:29:54.775 --> 00:29:56.600
DAN CAREY: So if
you weren't in tech,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.260
let's say you're not
at Sequoia, let's say

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.990
you're banned from the
tech industry forever,

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.150
are you going to go become
a comic book artist?

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.446
What would you do?

00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:06.820
JESS LEE: That's
a good question.

00:30:09.732 --> 00:30:11.940
I don't think I would make
it as a comic book artist.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.356
I don't think I'm
talented enough.

00:30:13.356 --> 00:30:15.460
But I might give
it a try anyway.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.415
Yeah, or a
professional cosplayer.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:18.400
DAN CAREY: Oh really?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.224
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:30:21.224 --> 00:30:22.890
DAN CAREY: Can we touch on that?

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.510
Because that's divergent.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.690
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:31.705
Well, I love anime, and I
cosplay now, rarely, but, yeah.

00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:32.950
DAN CAREY: That's pretty fun.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.330
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.080
DAN CAREY: So you were at
Yahoo for a bit of time.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.300
You were at Polyvore
for a very long time.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.860
You were at Google
for a bit of time.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.730
Those are three companies in
relatively similar spaces,

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.580
or at least parts of them.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.680
What was it like working
across them over time?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.013
Did you have to adapt yourself
to provide the most value

00:30:53.013 --> 00:30:54.640
and provide the most
impact, or was it

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.240
more of this is what
you bring to the table,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.323
here's how you can influence
the group around you?

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.540
JESS LEE: Oh, it change a lot.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.910
At Google I was an APM,
fresh out of Stanford,

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.940
computer science.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.600
I had never led a team before.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.030
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.996
I never had a real job.

00:31:08.996 --> 00:31:10.870
And you come into that
situation with a bunch

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.180
of experienced
engineers, and you're

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.270
like, how do I get these
people to listen to me at all?

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.070
I have no credibility.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.890
So there, I
remember, I was like,

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.300
how do I get them to respect me?

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.740
I know, I'll fix a bug.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.770
So I just checked
in code and tried

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.850
to prove that I was useful and
that I was going to work hard,

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.220
and slowly built that
relationship with that team.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.310
But it was all about
rolling up your sleeves

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.570
and getting stuff done.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.090
Then when I had
the credibility, I

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.280
was able to lay out more
of the product roadmap.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.350
But everything was
very, very in the weeds

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:52.910
and working with the team,
making decisions myself.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:58.150
At Polyvore, it was,
early days, very similar.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.710
I mean, they hired
me and I didn't

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.470
have to work so hard
to earn the respect,

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.400
but it was a lot of in the
weeds and making decisions,

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.700
writing code, all that stuff.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:14.520
Then when you switch into
becoming a manager or VP

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.940
or moving up in the
org, you are no longer

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.120
focused on the solution.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.290
You are focused on the problem.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.450
And the art--

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.370
I think the reason
why no one likes mic--

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.297
no one really likes
micromanagers.

00:32:29.297 --> 00:32:31.630
What's annoying is that the
micromanager is a person who

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.990
is trying to tell you,
here's the solution,

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.660
let me tell you, like, do
it this way, do it my way.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.930
And what you really want is
an explanation of, like, no,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.749
this is the problem
we're trying to solve.

00:32:41.749 --> 00:32:43.290
The reason I don't
like your solution

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:46.330
is because you didn't think
about this part of the problem.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.500
So if you just articulate
the problem clearly

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.370
and the guardrails of
what's acceptable and not,

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.065
then people start to come
up with the solutions that

00:32:56.065 --> 00:32:58.440
are a little bit closer to
what maybe you think is ideal.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.810
And even they don't, you have
to still accept it sometimes,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:01.700
because they could
be totally right.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.450
I've been proven wrong
many, many times,

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.460
as I'm sure we all
have, if we're managers.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.480
But that just keeps changing
as you grow in the org.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.124
So you start with
a solution creator,

00:33:11.124 --> 00:33:12.540
then you become a
problem creator.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.397
And then at some point,
no one tells you anything.

00:33:15.397 --> 00:33:17.480
There's no problem given
to you and you don't have

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.780
to articulate, you're just--

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:24.270
here, you are a VP at Yahoo,
create value for our company.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.540
And then no one tells you--

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.450
you know, so we
invented products.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.720
So that's a very
different way of thinking.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.760
But I would say that that was
the difference between all

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.490
the different roles and stages.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.650
DAN CAREY: So did you
approach that by trying

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.130
to find problems for people, or
did you just try to find teams

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.720
and then say, bring me problems
you think are important?

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.470
JESS LEE: Yeah, so I set
up a very-- you know,

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.240
I was a VP of the
lifestyle group.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.460
And we knew that
to create value,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.410
we wanted to build a bigger
mobile user base for Yahoo,

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:59.559
because it was still quite a
home-page, desktop-centric.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.600
I actually had a lot of--

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.040
Yahoo Weather is amazing, but
still, more mobile growth.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.020
And we wanted lifestyle,
which, to me, meant a younger

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.725
audience and a lot of women.

00:34:12.725 --> 00:34:14.100
So then what we
did is we started

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.100
outlining what are the
verticals that we could go into?

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.440
Health and wellness.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.489
Fashion.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.139
Beauty.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.250
Social.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.870
And so we picked verticals.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.330
And then what we
did is we started

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.590
to build out user personas.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:31.029
What are the different types
of people in this space?

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:32.320
And then what are the problems?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.489
And what I did was I didn't
tell them, here are the people,

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:40.770
I know exactly what
women 13 to 25 want.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.230
I said, here are the
parameters of those users.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.740
Come up with a process to
understand these people.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:47.489
And then the team got
really good at that.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.560
They got great at
creating user personas.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.960
They became amazing at
coming up with a brainstorm.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.025
Erica was involved in
this, actually, your wife.

00:34:56.025 --> 00:34:57.630
She's awesome.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.350
And they would--

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.160
DAN CAREY: I know.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.400
JESS LEE: -- run a process
with the team to brainstorm

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.192
different products.

00:35:03.192 --> 00:35:04.941
And then we came up
with a process for how

00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:06.100
to test that very quickly.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.516
And then what we
ended up doing is

00:35:07.516 --> 00:35:10.180
creating a process to get
apps shipped in eight weeks.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.430
So we would brainstorm, and
then eight weeks later, we

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.860
would push something to Android.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.994
And it would be an MVP,
but we'd get enough data.

00:35:15.994 --> 00:35:17.910
And then we'd do two or
three more iterations.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.410
And there, we
actually shipped, I

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:24.529
think, four or five apps inside
of Yahoo under some umbrella

00:35:24.529 --> 00:35:26.070
company so it didn't
say Yahoo on it,

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.778
because we didn't want
to risk the brand.

00:35:27.778 --> 00:35:31.770
But it was a great, fun thing
for the team to work on.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.070
For various reasons-- well,
we didn't ship all of them.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:36.730
You know, some of
them actually sucked.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.921
And some of them had
interesting traction,

00:35:38.921 --> 00:35:40.920
but we ended up deciding
they weren't strategic.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.960
And the one that
eventually launched

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.380
was Cabana by Tumblr, which is
a live-streaming, group-watching

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.412
app.

00:35:47.412 --> 00:35:49.620
You know, I think there's
a lot more work to be done,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.000
but I think--

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.640
that's sort of how we
managed that process,

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.400
or how I managed it as
the VP without-- while

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.590
wanting to empower the
team but also making sure

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.450
we were doing something useful
and strategic for Yahoo.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.470
DAN CAREY: It's
really interesting.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.094
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:06.790
And these were teams
of five people--

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.570
no, six.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.510
Three or four engineers and
then a designer and a PM,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.350
so a very small
team, eight weeks.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.540
DAN CAREY: We do have a
Dory with some questions,

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.370
and we also have
a mic in the back.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.920
So the Dory link, for
anyone on the livestream,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.466
is go/ask-jesslee.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.990
But why don't we bring this
up and take a few of these.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.100
OK, so what's the difference
between being a PM at Google

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.290
and being a CEO at a startup?

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.420
And, in your case, did
you see any challenges

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.669
during that transition, and
how did you get over them?

00:36:38.669 --> 00:36:41.790
JESS LEE: Yeah, so I
think I've mentioned

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.010
some of that, the culture
and the environment

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.440
in terms of having to
think through revenue

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.830
very early on was different.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.370
You know, at Google,
the responsibility

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.800
was much more about
the product and less

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.830
about the people and the org, or
the product became the company

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.485
at the CEO stage.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.700
It was a challenging transition.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.270
Like I said, I constantly
felt like I didn't really

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.610
know what I was doing,
and the job just

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.750
kept evolving underneath
me, then I'd figure it out

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.888
and then it would change again.

00:37:16.888 --> 00:37:19.720
DAN CAREY: So you've been on
both building and financing

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.073
side of products and businesses,
so which would you pick?

00:37:24.073 --> 00:37:26.970
JESS LEE: Oh, that's
a tough question.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.310
There are pros and cons to each.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:33.300
On the building side,
as a founder and a CEO,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:40.029
there's a lot of existential
stress, because you become--

00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:41.445
your identity
becomes the company,

00:37:41.445 --> 00:37:44.610
and you're constantly worried
about are we going to make it?

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.712
You know, I've brought 125
people with me on this journey,

00:37:47.712 --> 00:37:49.170
what am I-- you
know, is this going

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.490
to work out for all of us?

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.370
So it's much more existentially
stressful than being

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.480
on the investor side where
the value of your work

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.210
is spread out across a portfolio
of companies versus all

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.400
your risk tied to
one single company

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.170
that you are responsible for.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.940
So existential stress is much
higher on the founders side.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:14.592
I do miss getting my hands
dirty, like writing code,

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:15.550
making product designs.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.940
I get to do a little bit
of it with my earlier stage

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.310
companies, so that
scratches that itch.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.490
I would say, though, that
the learning is enormous,

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.530
and that's a huge upside,
by being an investor.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:31.250
It's such a privilege to meet so
many amazing founders, working

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.160
on so many different markets.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.640
Every day I learn something
new about the latest,

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.310
greatest state of some
technology or a market

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.230
that I wouldn't have
known anything about.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.930
And it's just a privilege to
meet all those awesome people

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.880
and to just constantly
be learning.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.530
DAN CAREY: So a lot
of times people--

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.000
I mean, you always
hear don't identify

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.310
too much with your work, but you
see people do it all the time.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.601
Do you think that's actually
a useful thing for startup

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:54.730
founders to be doing?

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.490
You said, as a startup
founder, you sometimes see

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.440
people's opinions
of a startup being

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.630
a reflection of your work.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.040
Is that a good
thing to care that

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.470
much, like to be that invested?

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.630
JESS LEE: I think there's
certainly a personal sacrifice

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.690
that comes with it.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.660
But part of me also
feels like it's necessary

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.460
in order to get through it.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.769
So, yeah, I think it's
a little inevitable.

00:39:15.769 --> 00:39:17.560
If you're too checked
out, you don't really

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.300
care what happens
with your company.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.800
I think it's hard to actually
tough it out and make it work.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.466
And I feel like I've been making
startups sound really terrible,

00:39:24.466 --> 00:39:25.630
which it's not.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.900
It's just that it's epic
highs and epic lows.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.156
And the epic highs
made it all worth it.

00:39:31.156 --> 00:39:32.780
I had so many moments
where I was like,

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.210
I can't believe this is my job.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.800
I've found my calling in life.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.740
This is amazing.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.260
I love my team.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.980
This is the best
feeling in the world.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.810
And then also moments
of like, oh my god,

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.240
why did I leave Google?

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.710
But that's just
par for the course.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:49.230
And I think it's like that for
every founder and every CEO.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.730
DAN CAREY: So why don't we take
a live question in the back.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.000
Thanks so much for
coming to Google.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.320
It's really interesting talk.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.070
I have a question.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.800
Did you come across, in Sequoia,
any interesting fashion tech

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.730
companies?

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.490
JESS LEE: Yeah, I
have seen a lot.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:07.000
The problem is I know where
all the dead bodies are buried

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.070
because I did fashion tech.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.380
So they actually say that
a lot of times investors

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.405
are less likely to invest in
things that they know too well.

00:40:16.405 --> 00:40:18.920
So I feel a little
bit like that.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.230
Something-- let's see.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.490
What have I seen?

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.680
I think there's a lot of
interesting computer vision

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.570
stuff that's happening now
that enables fashion companies.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:34.580
Fashion is one of the hardest
recommendation problems.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.194
Netflix had the whole Netflix
prize for figuring out

00:40:37.194 --> 00:40:38.110
movie recommendations.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.040
But, if you think about it,
there's not that many movies.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.664
Like how many movies
come out per year?

00:40:41.664 --> 00:40:42.800
Not that many.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.470
And then, how much does
your movie taste change,

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:48.110
versus fashion?

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.960
It's like not only does your
taste change over the years,

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.390
trends change, seasons change.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:58.110
And then the amount of product
out there is astonishing.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:00.860
And it's very
difficult to describe.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.040
Little touches like silk
or white stripe here,

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.890
it's just so unstructured,
and it's very difficult.

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.850
And people like very
specific things.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.559
And so it's one of the
most difficult problems.

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:14.600
There are some really
interesting computer vision

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.409
companies that are classifying
products that look similar.

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:20.450
And I think that that's
a very interesting space.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:23.100
I think you can do a lot
more once you have vision.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.100
DAN CAREY: OK.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.310
Another question in the back?

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.743
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:25.743 --> 00:41:27.242
Just thanks so much
for coming here.

00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:28.870
I'm [INAUDIBLE] in search.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.530
JESS LEE: Hi.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.030
AUDIENCE: One of the things I'm
curious to know a little bit

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.760
more about is how
did you balance

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.110
having a focus versus writing
a blog, being the marketing

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.502
person, being the salesperson,
being the product manager

00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:42.460
and so on and so forth?

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.810
Can you touch a little
bit more on that?

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.434
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:46.060
So what I tried
to do was I always

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.610
had my core duties of
product management,

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:52.771
and then I tried to only do
one new frontier thing outside

00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:53.270
of that.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.830
So I was not writing code and
doing ad sales and the blog

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.549
at the same time.

00:41:57.549 --> 00:41:59.590
I did the blog first, and
I was like, oh, there's

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.167
a lot of community
stuff to do here.

00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:02.500
Let me hire a community manager.

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.070
And then she took
over that that.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:09.054
Then I think after that
I moved to ad sales.

00:42:09.054 --> 00:42:11.470
I did that a little bit, then
hired a great New York Times

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.160
salesperson.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.970
And so they were more one--

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.270
you know, it's one extra thing.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.252
Yeah.

00:42:19.252 --> 00:42:22.810
DAN CAREY: How many people were
at Polyvore when you joined?

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.966
JESS LEE: Just the
founders, so three.

00:42:24.966 --> 00:42:25.465
Yeah.

00:42:25.465 --> 00:42:26.170
DAN CAREY: OK.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.627
And when you left?

00:42:27.627 --> 00:42:28.210
JESS LEE: 125.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.990
DAN CAREY: OK, so a
little bit bigger.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.615
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:31.360
Yeah.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.180
DAN CAREY: OK.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.660
Another question in the back.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jess.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.706
So two of the things
that you talked

00:42:36.706 --> 00:42:38.080
about being very
important to you

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.820
are having a big impact and
kind of doing a lot of learning

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.910
across disciplinary areas.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.120
It kind of seems like at a
company at a Google scale,

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.330
it can be hard to have as
big of an impact on the thing

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.720
that you're working on and
also to kind of be given those

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.894
additional
responsibilities or even

00:42:57.894 --> 00:42:59.435
to be able to seek
them out yourself.

00:42:59.435 --> 00:43:02.020
Do you have any
advice for I guess

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.730
trying to find those
opportunities when

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:04.855
you're in a bigger company?

00:43:04.855 --> 00:43:05.520
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.610
Yeah.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:10.270
It can be harder, for sure.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.770
What I would recommend, and
what I think I ended up doing,

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:18.372
actually, inside Polyvore as
well, was just go do them.

00:43:18.372 --> 00:43:24.136
If you see something, come up
with a solution or do a little

00:43:24.136 --> 00:43:26.760
bit of that work and then bring
it to the person who maybe owns

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.770
that area or might be a manager
and be like, hey, you know,

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.310
could I work-- look, I already
did some work here, can I--

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.390
prove to them that they
should have you helping them

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.560
before you ask them,
can I help you?

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.570
Just go ahead and do it.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.310
So that was a big
part of my journey,

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.960
and I think that works anywhere.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.016
In terms of impact, Google
touches so many, many,

00:43:52.016 --> 00:43:53.390
many people though
that even when

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:55.340
you own a small
part of something,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:59.360
you might still be as impactful
as working on a huge thing

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.550
inside of a company with
much less, many fewer users.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.560
But I think the
autonomy is maybe

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:09.230
one of the key differences
between small startup

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.296
and large companies, so
that one's very hard.

00:44:11.296 --> 00:44:13.420
I think you just have to
pick where you want to be.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.346
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:15.346 --> 00:44:17.660
DAN CAREY: So another
question from the Dory.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.180
Part of being a CEO and a
PM is making hard decisions.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.763
Can you share an example of one
of these really hard decisions

00:44:22.763 --> 00:44:23.922
and how you approached it?

00:44:23.922 --> 00:44:24.640
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.110
Let's see.

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:33.310
We pivoted our
business model twice.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.680
That's probably-- those
were hard decisions.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.030
And then other hard
decisions were probably

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.354
when people had to leave.

00:44:41.354 --> 00:44:43.645
I would say one thing that's
interesting about startups

00:44:43.645 --> 00:44:45.130
that I didn't realize
until I went through

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.690
it is there are
people who are just

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:51.130
awesome at the early stage, they
love being one of 10 people,

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.410
they're so good, they're
jacks of all trades,

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.320
and they just love the
freedom and the autonomy.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.870
And then as the
company gets bigger,

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.260
they start to feel
really encumbered

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.580
and they don't like it anymore.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:08.130
And you keep trying to make
it work because you just

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.380
love that person, but
really the best thing to do

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.030
is actually let them go free
and find the next company.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.910
So those were some of
the hardest decisions,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.812
because I was like
why isn't it working,

00:45:16.812 --> 00:45:18.270
let's just make it
work, we'll just

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.790
rearrange the universe
to work, and it just

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.340
doesn't work that way.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.340
Some people are just great
for different stages.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.720
So I think that was a hard one.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.970
The other one was, like I
mentioned, just pivoting.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.576
Sometimes there's
pull there, you

00:45:32.576 --> 00:45:34.200
know your business
model is not working

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.825
and you're not making money, and
you have to do something else.

00:45:36.825 --> 00:45:40.562
So those are difficult
to roll out to a team.

00:45:40.562 --> 00:45:43.020
If a whole group of people work
on this particular business

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.800
model and are no longer
needed, that's very difficult,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.050
but you have to do the
right thing for the company

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:52.327
and for the greater
good of that group.

00:45:52.327 --> 00:45:53.910
DAN CAREY: Now that
you are evaluating

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.830
new companies,
potential investments

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.904
and potential founders
that you're looking at,

00:45:57.904 --> 00:45:59.820
do you consider that
when looking at founders,

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.035
like is this person
great in the beginning

00:46:02.035 --> 00:46:03.660
but I worry about
them in the long run,

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.400
or is it too hard to predict?

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.350
JESS LEE: It's pretty
hard to predict.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.876
Honestly, I think if you
met me before Polyvore,

00:46:09.876 --> 00:46:11.250
you might not have
assumed that I

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:14.440
would have been able to get
to the larger company stage.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.650
I'm more on the
introverted side.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.745
I hate public speaking.

00:46:21.494 --> 00:46:22.910
I don't think you
would have said,

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.460
that person can
definitely scale to run--

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.370
you know, have VPs and
stuff reporting in to them.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.100
So I try to be very, very
open minded about that,

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.872
and I just look for that
grit, like distance traveled,

00:46:33.872 --> 00:46:35.330
like can you keep
pushing yourself,

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:36.590
do you have a history
of pushing yourself,

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:38.390
because you might be
able to push yourself

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.223
all the way through.

00:46:39.223 --> 00:46:41.440
Because it's not rocket science.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.350
It's hard, but it's a
lot of trial and error

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.560
and just learning on the job.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.830
So that's more what I look for.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.440
DAN CAREY: Any advice for
introverted PMs or founders?

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.430
JESS LEE: Oh, yeah.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.200
I mean, I think you
can be a great leader,

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.010
even if you're very,
very introverted.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.650
You know, you might not be the
highlight of a cocktail party

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.219
or something, but who cares?

00:47:03.219 --> 00:47:04.760
At the end of the
day, you have to be

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.520
able to convince your team
of what the vision is.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.589
You have to be
able to rally them.

00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:13.130
You know, for my [INAUDIBLE] I
really hated speaking in front

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.810
of the whole company a lot.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.665
So what I did was I actually
had a lot of the other folks

00:47:17.665 --> 00:47:20.040
on the team speak and explain
what they were doing, which

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.340
is actually nice,
because other people like

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.780
being in the spotlight,
they like getting credit

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.363
for what they're doing, instead
of me talking the entire time.

00:47:26.363 --> 00:47:29.550
That was something that I did.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.040
And I was still
able to have lots

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.260
of really meaningful, great
one-on-one conversations

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:34.700
or smaller group conversations.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.630
And, because I didn't
like public speaking,

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:38.640
I would always have slides.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.430
I love to draw, I'm
a designer, so I

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:42.530
would make sure that
whenever I was giving a talk,

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.988
I had a beautiful set of slides
so that everyone be looking

00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:46.624
at that instead of at me.

00:47:46.624 --> 00:47:47.290
And that helped.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:48.380
It made me less nervous.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.400
And it also, I think, was a
guide for what I needed to say.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:53.900
Yeah.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.910
You know, you just find
your tips and your tricks,

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.034
and I think you'd be a
great leader as an introvert

00:47:58.034 --> 00:47:59.240
or as an extrovert.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.160
DAN CAREY: Why don't we take
another question from the back.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jess.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:01.950
JESS LEE: Hi.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:03.604
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you could

00:48:03.604 --> 00:48:05.270
share your most recent
public investment

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.060
and I guess what drove you to
actually invest in that team.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.050
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:14.681
It's in stealth, so
I can't share it.

00:48:14.681 --> 00:48:17.880
Maybe I can tell you a little
bit about what they do.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.790
So this company is an
on-demand staffing platform,

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:26.660
so they match workers,
blue collar workers,

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:31.910
to jobs or shifts at companies
like Target or Uniqlo

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.520
or at a warehouse.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.420
They're live in eight
different cities.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.230
So it's not just a
San Francisco problem.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:40.814
But there's a lot
of people who--

00:48:40.814 --> 00:48:42.980
I mean, there's a lot of
employment in this country,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.021
and some of it is actually
due to inefficiencies,

00:48:45.021 --> 00:48:48.830
so they are a marketplace that
matches people, a really great,

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.140
hardworking, humble team.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.900
They continue to do jobs on
the weekends, themselves,

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.350
just to make sure they
don't forget what it's like.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.990
And a lot of distance
traveled with these founders,

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:02.040
so I really love their grit.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.390
AUDIENCE: I guess
kind of a follow-up.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.310
Do you think that
there's a trend

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.820
of I guess a lot of
startups that focus more

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.690
on middle America and a
lot more blue collar things

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:18.110
that tend to succeed
and might be harder

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.099
to find as an investor
since investors tend

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:22.515
to be in the Silicon
Valley bubble

00:49:22.515 --> 00:49:24.050
or New York, stuff like that?

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.100
JESS LEE: Yes, I do
think that that's true.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.670
It's something I
think about a lot.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:35.290
Like I think, you know, is
this thing gap widening,

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.010
or does it help with--

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.960
obviously, you know, we're not
pure impact social investors,

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.710
like Sequoia is where it is
and has been for 45 years

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.150
because it produces tremendous
returns consistently and has

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:56.360
backed legendary companies
like Google or Apple or Nvidia

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.910
and Airbnb.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:03.950
So it is important that it does
drive performance and drive

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.560
returns, but those are
things that I think about.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.840
And I think there are a lot
of untapped opportunities.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.810
And I think that the
company I just mentioned

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.500
falls perfectly in
that realm, yeah.

00:50:18.204 --> 00:50:20.524
DAN CAREY: So why don't we
take one more Dory question.

00:50:20.524 --> 00:50:21.940
It's what is
something that Google

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.860
can learn from other companies?

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.650
Now that you're back
here after a decade,

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.385
what lessons have you
brought back for us?

00:50:30.385 --> 00:50:33.130
JESS LEE: Oh, I mean, it's
hard to tell Google, hey,

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.040
you're not doing very well,
because that's clearly

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.020
not the case.

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.790
I thought it was
very clever to break

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:43.810
Google into multiple companies,
to give more autonomy

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:47.576
and breathing room and
leadership for a lot of people.

00:50:47.576 --> 00:50:49.450
I thought that was a
very, very clever thing.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:52.210
So I guess that's more something
that other companies can maybe

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:53.510
learn from Google.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:58.330
And I think that comes from
maybe caring about that growth

00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.620
and investing in people.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.078
Or maybe there's
financial reasons.

00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:03.340
I don't know, but that's
how I thought about it.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.300
Let's see.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.970
I do think the focus--

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:10.720
the one thing that I
had already mentioned

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.900
was just knowing that
you have a runway

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.064
and that sense of urgency.

00:51:16.064 --> 00:51:17.980
I do think that sometimes
that can be a really

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.720
helpful forcing function.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.150
Like when you're in a
meeting with someone

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:24.041
for the third meeting
about the same topic,

00:51:24.041 --> 00:51:25.790
and you can't everyone
to agree and you're

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.190
try to get consensus,
sometimes it is good to think,

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.800
like, we have six
months to live,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.692
should we be arguing
about this right now?

00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:37.150
Because I think getting rid of
some of those extra meetings

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:39.010
would make people a
lot happier probably.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.759
So maybe that's my one thing.

00:51:40.759 --> 00:51:43.050
DAN CAREY: And then why don't
we take one last question

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.633
from the back, and
then we'll wrap up.

00:51:44.633 --> 00:51:45.640
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.700
Thanks for the great talk, and
thanks, Dan, for organizing it.

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.949
So, first, let me apologize
by saying that [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:50.949 --> 00:51:54.810
going Polyvore's side,
and so please pardon me.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.880
So I understand
that the users were

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.730
a big component of
your product design

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.800
and success of the
company, and sometimes when

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.370
users get too powerful,
sometimes their power

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.974
is as that troll
mentality as a community.

00:52:07.974 --> 00:52:08.640
JESS LEE: Sorry.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.460
Sometimes there are power users?

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they're power
users within the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:12.780
users.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.160
JESS LEE: Sure.

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:13.255
Sure.

00:52:13.255 --> 00:52:13.755
Yeah.

00:52:13.755 --> 00:52:15.629
AUDIENCE: They troll everything.

00:52:15.629 --> 00:52:17.670
Was this the case in
Polyvore's case that you got

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.210
blindsided by what users
were saying in some cases

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:24.510
or where you had to take
decisions against what

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.630
the users were asking for?

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:26.130
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.970
JESS LEE: Yeah.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:28.470
Yeah.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.590
I think knowing your users
and listening to your users

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:34.699
does not mean doing
everything your users want.

00:52:34.699 --> 00:52:36.240
Because sometimes
they ask for things

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.610
that just don't make sense.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:41.790
If every user was
a product designer,

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.500
then we'd all be
designing products

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.240
and we'd all be
rich entrepreneurs.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.970
So you have to
listen to-- you know,

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.053
when they say I want
something, you have to think,

00:52:49.053 --> 00:52:50.970
OK, you're giving me a solution.

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.220
What was the problem you
were trying to solve?

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.864
And then you have to remember
that for every vocal user,

00:52:55.864 --> 00:52:57.780
there's a ton of silent
users out there, which

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.370
is why, for us, personas
were very important.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.910
So we had clear personas for
the different types of users.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.905
There was the creator,
who made all the content

00:53:04.905 --> 00:53:07.800
and was constantly asking
us for features and talking.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.660
And then there were the more
casual shoppers and browsers.

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:12.970
And we had personas
for them as well.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.170
So I think you use user
research, plus talking

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.960
to your users, plus personas
and all these other tools

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.360
to get a sense of how
much to prioritize

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.050
across your entire user base.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.170
But, yeah, definitely
don't just listen directly

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.014
and do everything that they say.

00:53:28.014 --> 00:53:30.154
DAN CAREY: OK, let's
thank Jess for coming.

00:53:30.154 --> 00:53:30.820
It's been great.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.236
JESS LEE: Thank
you for having me.

00:53:32.236 --> 00:53:33.080
Thanks, Dan.
