00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.500
We're asked to order the
following numbers from least

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.510
to greatest, and I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.200
and try to think
of it on your own.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.240
Order these numbers
from least to greatest.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.700
Well, let's work
through it together now.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.810
So, none of these
numbers have any places,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.980
any value to the left
of the decimal point.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.970
They have no ones here.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.240
0 ones, 0 ones, 0
ones, 0 ones, 0 ones.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.010
So let me then go to the next
decimal place to the right.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.560
So I'm starting with the
largest decimal places,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.150
and then I'm going
to successively

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.640
smaller decimal places.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.600
So I'll go to the tenths place.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.110
So this one right over
here has 0 tenths.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.820
This has 0 tenths.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.910
This has 0 tenths.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.050
This one has 0 tenths.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.160
This one has 7 tenths, so
this one actually has tenths.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.450
This has seven of them, so I'm
going to leave this one here

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.220
as the greatest.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.420
We're ordering from
least to greatest.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.870
Now let's move to
the hundredths place.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.112
So this one, this one, this
one, this one all have 0 tenths.

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:02.570
Let's look at the
hundredths place.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.739
This has 7 hundredths.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.610
This has 7 hundredths.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.790
This one has 7 hundredths.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090
This has no hundredths as well.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.850
This has 0 hundredths, so
this one has neither tenths

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.240
nor hundredths.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570
So this one is going
to be the smallest.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.720
This one has no
tenths, no hundredths.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.510
This one actually has tenths.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.139
All of these-- these three in
the middle-- have no tenths,

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:25.930
but they have some
hundredths, and they all

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.388
have the same number
of hundredths.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:30.170
7 hundredths, 7
hundredths, 7 hundredths.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.670
So now let's look at
the thousandths place.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.330
This one has 9 thousandths.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.120
This one has 0 thousandths.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.200
And this one has 0
thousandths as well.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.120
So out of these three,
this one is the largest,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.340
because this one actually
had some thousandths out

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.900
of these three.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.250
Now let's go look at-- we have
to pick between these two.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.500
Both of these have no tenths.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.240
Both of them have
exactly 7 hundredths.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.850
Both of them have
no thousandths,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.540
but this one has
9 ten thousandths

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
while this one has
no ten thousandths.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420
So this one is
less than that one.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.310
And now I'm done.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.090
I think I have ordered the
numbers from least to greatest.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.810
And the key here is go
to the place value that's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.570
most significant--
I guess you could

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.470
say-- that has the most value.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.920
So that was the ones place.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.210
Compare them on that.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.640
Then go to successively
smaller place values.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.180
Keep going to the right,
and keep comparing them,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.464
and then you'll be
able to order them.
