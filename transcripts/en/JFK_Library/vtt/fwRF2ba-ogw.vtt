00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.644
- I don't like the phrase Fake News

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:05.353
because it delegitimizes the word news.

00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:07.097
I don't think there's
such a thing as fake news.

00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:08.521
If it's fake, it's not news.

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:10.640
I would use the only in quotation marks.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.063
I prefer to call it Imposter News

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:16.043
when it literally takes the
masked head of a newspaper,

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:18.632
the front of a newspaper,
the layout of a newspaper

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:20.563
and tries to pretend it is the newspaper

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:22.409
as it traffics misinformation.

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.334
So that kind of identify theft,

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:26.084
I'm happy calling it Imposter News.

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:29.930
But most of what people,
who are legitimate inquirers

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.773
about it, are talking about,

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:34.813
is what I would call viral
deception, VD, venereal disease.

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:35.646
(laughs)

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:37.240
It transmits quickly.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.383
You would like to
quarantine it if you see it.

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:40.406
You certainly don't want to catch it.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.823
If you catch it, you don't
wanna give it to anybody.

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:43.220
You'd like to eliminate it.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.572
[Woman] I think we use this.

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:46.362
- Viral deception has no source
that is clearly identified,

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.204
or it's an imposter source.

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:50.810
It traffic in misinformation
and importantly,

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.216
when it is caught and
corrected, it does not correct.

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:56.128
One of the hallmarks of journalism

00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.521
is when it makes a mistake, it corrects.

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:02.238
And the stuff the traffics
through the viral deception,

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:05.603
VD channels, moves among
like-minded communities

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:08.964
who are disposed to believe
it, as a result, are uncritical

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:11.866
and are not exposed to
the counter information.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.001
Or if they are, less likely to accept it

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:14.834
and that is.
