GONZALO RODRIGUEZ:
OK, thanks, everyone.

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:04.440
My name is Gonzalo Rodriguez.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm the CEO and
co-founder of Papumba.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.720
We are a developer
of educational apps

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.510
for kids under the age of five.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.000
And today, I wanted to mention
a couple of experiments

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.200
and things, learnings, that we
have in the last three years

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.330
while localizing our
apps and going global.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.850
And I think it's
important, given

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.060
all that has been said today,
especially about the emerging

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.880
markets that are going to be
very important in the next two

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.170
years.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.460
So hopefully, you'll
find it interesting.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
There is a lot of data.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.970
So hopefully it's
understandable.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.680
So I already mentioned, we do
early educational apps for kids

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.850
under the age of five.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.960
We focus in some
certain categories,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.280
like learning the alphabet,
learning the numbers.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.340
And we cover some
certain cognitive skills

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
from kids that are still
learning vocabulary,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.670
like animal sounds, first words.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.040
Until kids that have
reached the age of five,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
and are ready to start school.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.590
So we definitely promote
learning through play.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.010
Our apps are a
combination of learning

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.990
methods that combine a lot
of gaming and interaction.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.260
Especially because our
audience is so, so small.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.050
They need to learn all
the time we're playing.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.380
And at last, we
started the company

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.040
always taking into account or
with a vision of being global.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.600
We started from day
zero with a problem

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.540
that I'm going to tell
you in the next slide.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.410
Next slide, sorry.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.690
I have the agenda.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.490
And it has three parts
of the presentation.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.460
First one is why did we
decided to go global.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
And all the challenges
we had in the meantime.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480
Good challenges,
real fun challenges.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.230
I really promote and will try
to transmit that these fun

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.010
challenges are really good.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.470
And at last, some
experiments and results

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.090
that we can share with you.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.550
And are very actionable
points and data

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.240
that we are going to share,
very intimate of our kitchen.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.480
And I hope you'll find useful.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.910
So first, why would we
decide to go global?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.040
OK.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.100
Why we decided to go global.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.030
As many of the
developers here probably,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.460
not the ones that are
like Cartoon Network,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.060
but more the ones that have
started as entrepreneurs,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.090
we found that there was a
problem, especially when

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.550
kids from our nephews or
sons were trying to use apps

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.770
and they were basically
all in English.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.660
So we had this big
problem that we

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.850
were trying all the
time to translate

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.090
what the voiceover said.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.860
And I imagine in
Portuguese happen the same

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.380
a couple of years ago, there
weren't many alternatives

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.810
in this specific field for
the early childhood category.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.930
So we were asked all
the time, and especially

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.160
in these past three years,
why would you go global?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.890
Why wouldn't you focus, for
example, in the Spanish market.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.450
That we are from Argentina,
we kind of know the language.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.180
And we can make a
different on that.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.250
Or why wouldn't you focus in the
US market that is more mature,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.610
and you have better chances
of making more revenue.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.180
So we thought at that moment
that this particular issue

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.610
was going to be global.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.340
Like many, many people
from all over the world

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.754
were going to use the
apps in English only.

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:39.420
And they were going
to have this problem

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.330
while trying to help
their kids learn

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.850
useful stuff like the alphabet.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.030
On the other hand, we found this
opportunity three years ago,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.530
that when we
started the company,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.900
we found amazing translators
and crowdsourcing services.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.280
That probably 10 years
ago, if we had this vision,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.780
would have been
much more difficult.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.620
But at that specific
moment, we found

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.246
it was quite easy to
get talented voiceovers

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:06.120
in several languages.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.390
I'm going to tell you we
are localizing the apps

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.420
in 15 languages.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.480
And also, it was very
inexpensive, and also very easy

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.120
to implement.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.360
So I think once you start
seeing our metrics in downloads

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.300
and how after localizing
it started to grow,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.250
probably more than
one of you will

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.870
start thinking in localizing
in languages like Asia

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.330
or Eastern Europe
and other countries.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.700
So this graph, I like it a lot.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.880
Because when we
launched our first app,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.920
it was an animal sound.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.740
So very simple.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.900
But we launched it already
in three languages.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.670
It was in Portuguese, in
English, and in Spanish.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.470
As you can see, probably,
Brazil was our first country.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.540
And that was for a
period of 12 months.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.790
We have over 35% of the
traffic coming from Brazil.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.270
Then we have around
40% traffic coming

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.360
from Spanish-speaking countries.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.980
Then US, about 9%.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.420
So we launched the app.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.270
And immediately, we had
like 84% of the traffic

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.500
using their app in
their native language.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.640
Which was great.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.960
The feedback we got and
the reviews were amazing.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.270
Because people were
actually surprised

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.480
that we took care of different
languages in one single app.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.250
And then we have
countries or languages

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.460
like Indonesia,
German, and India,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.100
that were in the
long [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.500
But we were still obsessed
with these last statistics.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.250
We were obsessed that
16% of the traffic

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.020
were using the app in
a foreign language.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.540
And we said OK,
this is happening

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.520
like the same happened to us.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.810
It's happening in
countries like France,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.030
in countries like Italy.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.450
So they are using an app,
and translating the app

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.980
to their kids.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.270
So what we did right after,
we took localization--

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.120
that was something
that has been said

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.340
a lot today-- super serious.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.940
We decided to create
a global team.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.230
I'm going to tell you how.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.170
I'm going to share
our method to do it.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.200
We had to decide at what
point which languages were

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.829
going to be included.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.370
Because there are
too many languages.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.560
And we have to make
at least one cut.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.400
And the decision
for us was pretty

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.140
easy we left some got
some low language.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.010
These are countries
that potentially

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.370
may be very good for
revenue, but short in reach.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.320
And we decided to go for a mega
big in the emerging countries,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.980
in emerging markets.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.010
So we cover languages like
Indonesia, Arabic, Hindi,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.930
Malaysia, Philippines, all with
voiceovers in those countries.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.450
Well, that that is the
hardest part, to get quality

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.100
voiceovers.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.820
But everything is localized.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.810
Even the logo is
localized in India.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.800
And we were crazy trying
to understand if we

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.830
made the correct understanding.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.960
But it turned out great,
and I'm going to tell you

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.300
a little bit about it.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.430
And then we knew
that we were going

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.080
to fail on so many levels.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.420
Especially because we were
facing other cultures.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.220
And, well, people have
different visions.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.590
For example, in some
countries, something

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.470
that you think that is
good culture for you

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.860
might be completely the
opposite in another culture.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.527
So we started to check
the reviews all day.

00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:32.110
And started to respond
and understand,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.080
which were our
weaknesses in our apps.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.610
And we had a lot.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.490
But we started to,
after conversation,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.280
we started to
improve that a lot.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.980
So this is our graphic now
two years later of the same

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.960
that I have shown
before after localizing.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.930
So basically, you can see
here all the blue countries

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.330
are the original languages
that we already covered.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.730
Brazil is still in
position number two,

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.940
still like in the top three.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.040
But then we are in a
lot of new countries

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.430
that are in the top position.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.370
And see, he's happy.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.830
Like Indonesia, it has like 10x
growth in every year for us.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.820
It is massive.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.154
They are downloading
the apps like crazy.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:16.570
And there are some
other countries

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.170
that are-- we say that we are
experimenting in this emerging

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.500
market revolution, but
only the beginning.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.310
India, France, Turkey, Italy.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.260
France and Italy are
obviously not emerging.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.130
But those are the countries
that are now in our top

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.679
10 in downloads.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.720
And for us, it's amazing.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.970
Because it drives
different questions.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.230
Like for example-- I
don't want to go ahead

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.860
of the presentation--
but you have

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.440
to think of different
business models for all

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.710
these variety of countries.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.340
It's not like the
in-app purchases

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.000
that costs $6 in the US
is the same in Indonesia.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.190
Because they have different
acquisition power,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.530
they have different
payment mentality.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.640
So it drives a lot
of good questions.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.460
So what we did was we did
something that we call,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.490
inside the company,
we did a big audition.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.790
Like American Idol, we
felt like Simon Cowell,

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.460
analyzing all kind of voiceovers
from all over the world.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.940
And we interviewed more
than 300 voiceovers.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.690
Because we needed to
cover 15 languages.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.700
I see you are very happy.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.480
Because actually it was
like a complete process that

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.640
took about two or three months.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.870
We knew that we had to do create
a great team that would join us

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.870
for the rest of the app.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.580
Because it was like you get a
voice over that the kids like.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.940
Then you cannot not
change because that people

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.810
doesn't work anymore
as a voiceover.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.060
You have to find quality people.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.280
And then we had the
other challenge,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.140
which was smaller but still.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.560
We had to find quality
translators and editors.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.440
Because especially when you
work in the kids' industry,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.145
you need to be very delicate
about everything you say.

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:06.910
And we found this good team that
now is showing all our games.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.820
So final result,
after 400 people

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.740
that we interview in
this big audition,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.220
we have now a staff that works
with us, 25 voiceover talents.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.120
We cover 15 languages.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.310
So we have 10 substitutes
for any kind of thing.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.980
And then we got 30
translators with editors

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.580
that help us review
and check descriptions.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.730
We have some very-- we
have all the time things

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.920
that we would get from
the editors' team review.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.230
For example, last
time, a week ago,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.070
we had one word in Russian
that says like child, girl.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.510
And there was our little symbol
missing that says poison.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.550
So we get all the time
these kind of situations.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.614
But it's something you
can solve quite easy.

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:55.780
So process took about two
months, like I was saying.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.600
But the good thing
about this is that now

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.940
localizing an app for
us into 15 languages,

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.060
since we have all the text
in the first language,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.920
it takes only 20 days.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.760
So it is very easy.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.240
And once you start thinking
in the products that

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.130
will be global, it's pretty easy
to, in the technological side,

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.060
it's much easier if
you start thinking

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.630
in being global from scratch
than trying then to, well,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.960
start making some fixes.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.490
So these are
another funny thing.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.570
Because when we
started, we obviously

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.180
start revising everything
with our ears, our Spanish.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.479
We understand a little
bit of Portugese.

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:37.270
English, of course.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.300
And then we have a little of
Italian that we understand too.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.850
So we knew that one
of the challenges

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.610
was to reach the same
quality in all languages.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.280
For example, we said we need
to reach the same quality

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.760
Malay-- I don't know, the
crazy language for us,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.760
we don't understand
anything-- as in Spanish.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.424
That was our KPI.

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:06.160
So we have to do a lot of
understanding and reading

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:06.840
reviews.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.010
And this is a very
good example of how

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.870
a simple thing in the content
can change a lot the reviews.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.590
Like in the Arabic language,
we weren't that aware,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.950
but the pig is a very
prohibited animal.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.140
Like in the culture,
and especially for kids,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.930
it's like if you show the
pig, you're messing up.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.820
Like don't do it.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.950
So we got a lot of reviews that
says that the app is quite good

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.920
but you cannot show
this to my children.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.090
We were oh-- we don't want
to start doing this game

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.510
that we have to adapt every part
of the game to every language.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.380
But the reviews kept
coming, kept coming.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.070
And the rating came
really down until 3.9.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.830
So after removing the pig,
now the Arabic language

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.380
is the first in our rating.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.640
And that is something I think
is a good example, of how

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.140
by understanding
and reading reviews

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.890
you can do a massive
improvement in your ratings.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.360
And this is how it lies
in our animal sounds

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.380
app, which is the one
that has more downloads.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.750
That's around 4 million by now.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.230
This is the top
languages in rating.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.020
So obviously, Spanish,
we speak Spanish.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.530
And we don't believe that
in Arabic or in Russian,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.730
we were doing better.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.820
But I think this is a very
good point to understand,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.910
and for you to know
that in those languages

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.410
there are many options
available for kids.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.540
So the users really
appreciate when you create

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.130
quality content for them.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.610
So it isn't possible, I
think, to get better quality

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.940
than your native language.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.380
It seems to be very even.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.460
But there is a plus because you
are doing it in a language that

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.650
is not very common.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.400
And well, there is a
very funny-- or example,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.376
there is Indonesia.

00:13:58.376 --> 00:14:00.250
Indonesia, I was saying,
is the first country

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.850
in downloads with this app.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.670
But we have the lowest rating.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.470
It's 3.98.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.500
And after reading reviews, we
understood what was happening.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.760
They used to say [INDONESIAN].
[INDONESIAN] became like a word

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.110
all the time in our head.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.870
And [INDONESIAN] means I'm
going to try the app first,

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.270
and then I'm going to review.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.510
It happens that they forget
to update the review.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.670
So this is a very
interesting examples

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.176
because sometimes
you think that you

00:14:26.176 --> 00:14:27.550
have something
wrong in your app,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.790
and it's something cultural.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:34.360
And we ask for reviews to
the users on a certain time,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.370
like in the third
or fourth session.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.610
So it might be a
good idea to start

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.360
thinking, for example,
in Indonesia, don't

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.080
ask right away.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.020
Because the users
have this commitment

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.040
to put a review and
then evaluate the app.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.500
So these are the kind
of things that we are

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.430
learning by using the reviews.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.970
Well, there is always
some percentage

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.910
of the people that say the
in-app purchases are expensive.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.250
But that is a main
issue, [INDONESIAN].

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.880
At last, this is what
we are more focused now.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.180
Because we have the
app available in-- we

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.670
have downloads from 140
countries in 15 languages.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.210
So we obviously
know that it isn't

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.070
fair to have the same price
for example in Germany

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.490
as Indonesia.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.510
It just doesn't work.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.630
Like the percentage
of paying user

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.220
is ridiculous, if you have
the same pricing in all.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.500
So we knew that the new
feature of the pricing

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:36.450
tiers and the templates came
out, we started testing a lot.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.300
And I have three things
that I would like to share.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:44.310
Like experiments that
might be some highlights.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.580
So what we did, I will
explain it very simple.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.070
We did a division
of three tiers.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.910
We created a team that was the
top 15 countries in the world

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.420
that spend more in gaming.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.360
And we put them in
the first column.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.850
Then the second like countries
like Brazil, Argentina,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.500
that spend more less
than, let's say, Japan.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.080
And we put them
in the second row.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.050
And then we have
the other countries

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.460
that spend less, or are
more oriented to ads.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.180
And we put them in
the third column.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.190
So basically, the first
column had 100% of the prize.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.990
The second, 70% of the price.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.880
And the other, 50% of the price.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.000
That was the experiment we
were trying to understand

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.430
if that made a difference.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.560
So for example, in
countries like Russia,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.200
when we did this 30% discount,
we saw a 70% increase in sales.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.370
And this is, like, if you start
doing this on every country

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.240
and start focusing, you'll see
that there are differences.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.970
But it is very impressive the
growth we have seen in Russia.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.600
Russia is one of our top
15 countries in downloads.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.174
Then we put a reduced
price in Latin America.

00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:54.090
And we saw that it didn't
make any difference.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.600
For us, at least, it
is just a percentage

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.610
that might pay or not.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.100
But in that specific case,
when we reduced the price,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.300
we had the same amount of
people, but just less revenue.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.030
But it's interesting
to see and try,

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.369
because maybe the
price is still not

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:16.740
very attractive to users that
are willing to spend $1 or $2.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.599
And then at last-- this
is just very simple

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.369
and we were very
angry we didn't do it

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:27.510
before-- we saw a significant
increase by just rounding up

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.310
the Euro price.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.225
Because the Google Play console,
if you do the outer comparison,

00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:37.040
it rounds, for example,
from 0.99, it was 0.89.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.640
8 I think now it's
out of comparison.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.360
But when we understood
that, we said OK,

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.570
we have to round up every price.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.100
Because probably
it was confusing.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.760
People will say why is it 0.89.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.050
And we saw in
countries like Italy,

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.530
we had like 45-50%
of increase in sales.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.705
So that is something
very easy to do.

00:17:57.705 --> 00:18:03.000
And if you have apps distributed
there, I suggest you do it.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.440
So I have been
showing some results.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.660
But I wanted to show you more
the big picture of how once we

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.320
started localizing,
how it turned out.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.280
So we took here two countries,
Italy and France, as examples.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.350
Let's say that Italy
and France were having

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.830
without the localized version.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.280
So when we were having
the three languages,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.180
let's say 100
downloads every day.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.970
So after localizing
just the first month,

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.520
we had three times that amount.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.860
After six months,
we had four times.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.050
After a year, we had five times.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:45.060
So I think it shows quite
good the huge potential

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.750
of localizing.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.660
Because if you do it
on a regular basis

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.840
and with 15 languages
like we did,

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.040
we had like three times
the downloads in general.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.970
And there are some
countries like Indonesia

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.450
that the growth was 10 times.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.200
So I really suggest you do it.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.270
And before localizing, Asia
and Europe was only 18%

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.700
of the traffic.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.890
And after localizing, it's 51%.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.680
And the other localized
languages are still growing.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.240
Not like the ones
that we localize now.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.450
But this gave a huge
percentage of new users,

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.740
especially in revenue.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.850
So this are, I think,
the last two charts.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.240
This is how it looked
like, our revenue,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.740
top grossing countries in
Google Play before localizing.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.900
So basically, we had US, Brazil,
Mexico, Argentina and Chile.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.800
After localizing, we had
the increase or interruption

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.290
of countries like Italy,
Germany, and France

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.606
that are now in our top
five countries in revenue.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.380
And this is
something, since all,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.940
or the majority
of the developers

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.360
are always focusing in English,
it is the most important

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.700
language, it's important to
point that now for us, English

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.920
is still huge, like
44% of their revenue.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.530
But the other is much bigger.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.620
And all combined, we strongly
believe that emerging markets

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.400
will start gaining
every time much more

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.110
in revenue and in downloads.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.328
So expect to see this emerging
market revolution happen.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.300
So the last chart
is our top four tips

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.110
of why we think
users find valuable

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.790
in this specific
thing, in localizing.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.300
So number one is having
native voiceovers

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.930
that can give clear
instructions to children.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.330
Especially if you are
producing jobs for kids

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.330
under the age of five or
under the age of seven,

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:57.950
it's hugely
important for parents

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.770
to have someone that is
guiding the experience.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.780
Then we usually, every day we
enter into a console and answer

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.630
reviews in their
native language.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.910
And that's, sometimes we
get two or three stars.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.830
But after replaying in
their native language,

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:18.550
the outcome is usually that
they at least put four stars.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.990
And we get a lot
of updated reviews.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.580
Like we get the
e-mail and we check.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.430
And it happens a lot.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.550
So we also localize everything,
the [INAUDIBLE], the title.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.785
We even tried localizing
the icons and put a flag.

00:21:31.785 --> 00:21:33.410
In the last [INAUDIBLE]
here in Brazil,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.590
we see that that
was working great.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.930
Turned out that once we
did the icon experiment,

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.920
that didn't work as we expected.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.460
But still, we tried to
localize everything.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.180
Even the app title,
screenshots, everything.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.760
And at last, this is
something that we learned

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.970
by knocking our head a
few times against a wall,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.910
if you start
localizing everything,

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.220
it's very important
that you start thinking

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.970
in not including a lot of text.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.570
Because you are much more
willing to do errors.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:05.930
So the more images and the more
voiceovers you can include,

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.850
that's the better.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.000
So thank you.
