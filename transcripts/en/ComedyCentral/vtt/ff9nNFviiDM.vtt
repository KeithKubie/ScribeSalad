00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.039
- Yamaneika,
J.P. Are we ready?

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:09.675
[cheers and applause]
- Let's roast!

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.078
- So, Comedy Central
has screwed me again.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.747
They gave me another boring
white guy to roast.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.816
I had to Google him.
Google told me to go to Bing.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.751 align:end position:100%
Bing told me
to go to Ask Jeeves.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:23.056 align:end position:100%
Ask Jeeves said, "I don't know
who this [bleep] is."

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.258
- That's pretty good.
First of all, just--

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.360
I want to say what an honor it
is for me to be here

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.528
with some icons of comedy.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.531
I mean, Jay Pharoah, Jim Norton,

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.433 align:start position:0%
Cedric the Entertainer.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.835
[laughter]

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.737 align:start position:0%
There are a lot of great
comics in New York,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.441 align:start position:0%
but truly Yamaneika
really is one of the loudest.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.713 align:end position:100%
- J.P. is a Catholic
Wall Street banker.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:49.615
The only thing whiter
and slimier

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:53.219
than him is the [bleep] on his
back from Father O'Brien.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:55.321
[siren wailing]

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.290
- I knew this was gonna be
a tough battle 'cause, like,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:01.727
we look like we're on
opposite ends of the fire hose.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.630
Let me just say, though,
Yamaneika is so dark

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:09.302
she got cast in
"12 Years a Slave" as the plot.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.604 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Last joke! Last joke!

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.439
- J.P. is from Newtown,
Connecticut,

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.441
where the Sandy Hook
tragedy happened.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.742
And the worst thing
that happened to that town

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.344 align:end position:100%
is that he wasn't
seven years old

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.612 size:88% position:56%
at the time of the shooting.

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.115
[all exclaim]

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.617
[gunshots]

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.787
- Oh! Oh!

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.523
- Got your ass.
- Okay, okay.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.327
Thank you, Fat Thighs Matter.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.662 align:start position:0%
- Oh, shit.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:40.600
- Yamaneika grew up in a White
suburban town in Maryland.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.469
Her nickname in high school
was [gasps].

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.371
[bell dings]

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.207
- Hey, keep it going
for J.P. McDade

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510
and Yamaneika Saunders.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.778
- So much fun.
Super-close.

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.448
- I have to say,
both really great.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.350
Yamaneika had
a great--that Sandy Hook

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.818
joke was brutal
and really great.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.220
And you were great firing back.

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.757
But J.P., I thought
the hose joke was brilliant.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.526 align:start position:0%
I had to go with J.P.
You're kind of creepy

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.827 align:start position:0%
and suburban,
but you're really funny.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.462
- Thank you. Thank you.
- This is exciting.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.796
This is like
watching Leslie Jones

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.600
take on one of her
Internet trolls.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.802
- I love that. I love that.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.804
- You both were [bleep] amazing,

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.674
but I got to give it to J.P.
on the cleverness.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:24.710
The [bleep] jokes were amazing.
J.P.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:25.811
- Interesting.
- That's two for J.P., Jeff.

00:02:25.844 --> 00:02:27.847 size:75% position:38%
- See, this surprises me

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.682
because I thought Yamaneika
won this thing when she said,

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.717
"Got you ass" and spun around.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.653
I thought it was
pretty much over.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.655 size:75% position:38%
My vote's for Yamaneika.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.823
- I honestly loved both of you.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.560 align:end position:100%
I have to tell you,
he's like a Jeselnik

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.528 align:start position:0%
in that he's that sharp
and mean and nasty,

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:43.963 align:start size:75% position:25%
but you like him anyway.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:48.668 size:88% position:44%
Now, her. I like this bitch,

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.903
and I have to vote for--

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.939 align:end position:100%
you're both--
this is by a [bleep] hair.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.741 align:end position:100%
I have to give it to you,
the black girl.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:56.742 align:start position:0%
I forgot your name
but you're terrif--

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:58.711
- Yes! Yamaneika.
- Yamaneika.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:00.446
- Name yourself something normal
like a [bleep] white person.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.548
So, I say vote
for the black chick.

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.816
Come on, clap it up for her.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.251
- Thank you.
- It's tied up.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:08.588
- Uh-oh.
- It all comes down to you,

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.523
ex-SNL cast member Jay Pharoah.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.291
- God dag it. Okay.

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.760
I got ADD but shit. Okay.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.698
I would have to say--
[exhales]

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.732
Don't get mad at me, baby.

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.834
- Oh, [bleep] man.
- Yamaneika.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.603
Bow. I would say--see?

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.271
Look. I deceived y'all
[bleep].

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.772
You see? Yamaneika.
I would say--

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:28.474
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you, [bleep]. You.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:29.942
- Oh!
- I would say you.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.411
- Yamaneika!
- I'm gonna keep battling

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start size:69% position:31%
Yamaneika until I win.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.015
<i> Or I'm just gonna try
 to exact revenge</i>

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:37.617
<i> for the rest of my life.</i>

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.619 align:end position:100%
This affection that you see
right here,

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.321 align:end position:100%
at least on my part,
100% an act.

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.390
<i> Not real at all.</i>
 - Yeah. Ladies, he's mine.

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.259
I'm gonna eat him.
- Help.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.625 line:0%
Please--please send help.
- [laughs]
