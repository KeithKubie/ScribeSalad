00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.890
The Joe Rogan experience.
All right.
Yeah.
So,
yeah,
so,
so you got to Utah and um,

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
you just,
you just wait.
Well is a lot of hiking,
you know,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.460
you go and you essentially you go where you know that the elk are going to be in

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.340
the area and when they're in the Rut,
which is that when you hunt,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.420
that's when it's legal,

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.450
which means they're their mating and breeding and smashing heads together.

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.010
And then you hear them,

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.890
you hear them scream at each other and you're ready to be killed.
Well,

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.590
they are definitely ready to be killed then a little do they know that?

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.520
Then you gotta figure out how to sneak in on them.
They can't help themselves.

11
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:34.560
They just,
they're competing with all these other males,

12
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.440
so they're always like back screaming at each other and smashing heads.

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.710
And occasionally you find one that's dead that was killed by another bowl.

14
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.470
But you don't eat that.
No,
no,
no,
no.
You could,
I mean,

15
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.800
you certainly could if it was like a recent kill,
if you knew,

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.740
if you got to it like right when it was dying.
Yeah.

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.230
The blood was still coming out of its body,
but you will find them.

18
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.830
They get stabbed and they,
they kill each other.
Yeah.

19
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.770
I mean that's the whole reason why those antlers exists.
It's for war,

20
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:00.540
for stabbing.
They just fuck each other up.

21
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.540
They don't even use it to defend against other animals like wolves and shit.

22
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.090
They kicked the wolves most of the time.
So where do you,

23
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.570
how do you get the thing back?
Those things don't,
aren't light.
Yeah,
you have to,

24
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.430
you have to do what's called quartering it,

25
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.830
which is you take the legs off and you take the,

26
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:18.600
the front legs off and then you take the meat off the carcass and then you take

27
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:23.601
the heart and the liver and the edible organs and you have to pack it out.

28
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.880
So you have,

29
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.140
do you have a crew that goes with Eli or is it just you with a big ass knife?

30
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.360
I book,
I'm not very good at hunting.
I'm like,
if,

31
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.220
if hunting was a martial art,
I'd be a blue belt.

32
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.360
Blue Bell is like your white belt,
blue belt,
purple belt,
Brown belt,
black belt.

33
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.550
It's not a black belt.
I'm like a blue belt.

34
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.280
Maybe I could get my purple belt if I like work real hard this year.

35
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.080
But I go with a guide who's going to take me to the places that I need to go and

36
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:49.781
show me.

37
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.530
And a guy who was an experienced outdoorsman who he basically teaches you just

38
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.630
like having a trainer in martial arts.
Exactly.
It shows you,
yeah,
he's,

39
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.830
he knows the landscape is a hardened outdoorsman.
You know,

40
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.510
these guys never get fucking tired and they'll go and take you and show you like

41
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.050
it,
but then it's,
it's your job to execute the shot.

42
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.170
Your job to get close your job,
to stock in your job,

43
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:16.260
to make sure that you don't get what's called winded means the animal smells
you,

44
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.960
the wind's at your back and the wind carries your sent towards the animal.

45
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.130
So you have to move around a lot.
That goes into this.
A lot of thought.

46
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.280
Just go get the gun,
go.
Beautiful.
I don't use it.
I used to be,
oh,

47
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.470
which I have crazier,
but I have used a gun.
I have really?
Yeah.

48
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:32.260
I shot a bow once and it didn't go so well.
It just Kinda,
it's fun.
Boats,

49
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.090
just shooting targets is really fun.
It's very cathartic.

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.110
It says there's like something,

51
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.740
there's a release when that Arrow finds his target just feels really good.
Yeah.

52
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.700
It's probably some primitive shit from back when we used to rely on killing

53
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.160
things with those scenarios that like accuracy.

54
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.810
But there's something about hitting something with a,
uh,

55
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.800
like when you're shooting something at a target and hits it,
it's very,

56
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.010
very satisfying.
Rewarding.
Yeah.
And when you do that with a bow and Arrow,

57
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.040
it's very difficult.
It's more challenging.
It's more avoiding.
Yeah.

58
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.750
Never used a traditional,
but I mean,
I have like a couple of times,

59
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:05.070
but I've never really tried to shoot with like a traditional bow or the kind of

60
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.140
gun,
but they also got that.
No,
no,
I have you draw it.
I mean,

61
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.930
he would have to pull it back,
but it's a compound bow.

62
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.700
It relies on these mechanical,
uh,
these gears that these,
um,

63
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.920
what do they call cams?

64
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.660
He's like the bow and walking dead and we watch the one that's a crossbow.

65
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.020
Crossbow.
Yes.
That's a bullshit.
Oh,
then once that is a shitty gun,
okay,

66
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.600
so this guy's got a trigger zombies.
Now I to do that,

67
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.280
it would make me very angry,
very frustrated.
First of all,

68
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.380
he doesn't even have a broad head on that stupid thing.

69
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.350
He shooting him with a little pencil holes and it's killing him instantly that

70
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.890
that's all he,

71
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.890
that's all he had access to a broad head makeup brought him to break into that

72
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.170
break into a bass pro shop.
[inaudible] some,
you know?
Yeah man.

73
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.440
I actually did see a few bass pro shops in walking dead.

74
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.560
They just walk right past [inaudible] in their brother's dog guys nets and yeah,

75
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.180
gear kayaks.
Um,
so that's a crossbow.
And there's a,

76
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.670
that's a very controversial,
uh,
weapon amongst outdoorsmen.
Why is that?

77
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.120
Because they use those during a bow season.
Okay.

78
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.210
And is the reason why bow season like the,

79
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.370
if you looked at like statistics across the board,

80
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.920
if you have a what's called a tag,

81
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.590
like say if you wanted to go deer hunting you'd have to get a license and then

82
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.590
you'd get a tag and if the tag was available for the air,

83
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.910
you wanted you to pay a certain amount for that tag.
Now if you get a bow tag,

84
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.470
they,
they make the bow season earlier you have a higher,

85
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.090
much higher likelihood of failure with a bow than you do with a gun.

86
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.720
So I could say like 50% of the people that got a a tag,

87
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.800
it's usually not that high,

88
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.880
but if 50% of the people that got attacked for rifle were successful,

89
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.610
it might be 10% with a boat,
it might be even less.

90
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.420
It might be even less in some places,
depending on how rugged the landscape is,

91
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.360
how hard it is to get to where the animals are and you have to be able to shoot

92
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.560
far accurately.
Right.
So you do most of the shooting when you go up there.

93
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.340
Do you have to do all the shooting?
I shoot them myself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a man.

94
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.370
That's a manly.
Asked him to do it.
Well,
you've got,

95
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.740
I don't do a lot of manly shit.
I noticed.
I know.

96
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.860
I'm probably compensating for something.
I didn't want to say that,
but yeah.
