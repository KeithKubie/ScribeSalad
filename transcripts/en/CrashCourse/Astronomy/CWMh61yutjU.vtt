00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.740
Oh. Hey! Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude. I’m just
trying to figure out how far away my thumb is.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.660
How? Parallax.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.280
Centuries ago, people thought the stars were
holes in a huge crystal sphere, letting through

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.700
heavenly light. It wasn’t clear just how big
the sphere was, but it was pretty dang big.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.480
I have some sympathy for them. By eye, and
for all intents and purposes, the stars are

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.280
infinitely far away. If you drive down a road
you’ll see trees nearby flying past you,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.870
but distant mountains moving more slowly.
The Moon is so far it doesn’t seem to move

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.400
at all compared to nearby objects — and
it’s easy for your brain to think it’s

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.100
much closer, smaller, and actually following
you, which is a bit creepy. Sometimes people

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.530
even think it’s a UFO tailing them.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.430
Finding the distance to something really far
away is tough. It’s not like you can you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.220
can just pace off the distance.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.460
Or can you?

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
The ancient Greeks knew the Earth was round
and there are lots of ways to figure that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.280
out. For example, ships sailing over the horizon
seem to disappear from the bottom up, as you’d

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000
expect as they slip around the Earth’s curve.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.340
But how big is the Earth? Over 2000 years
ago, the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes figured

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.729
it out. He knew that at the summer solstice,
the Sun shone directly down a well in the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.700
city of Syene at noon. He also knew that at
the same time, it was not shining straight

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.520
down in Alexandria, and could measure that
angle.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.120
There’s a legend that he paid someone to
pace off the distance between the two cities

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.580
so he could find the distance between them.
But more likely he just used the numbers found

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.010
by earlier surveying missions. Either way,
knowing the distance and the angle, and applying

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.310
a little geometry, he calculated the circumference
of the Earth. His result, a little over 40,000

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.010
km, is actually amazingly accurate!

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.990
For the very first time, humans had determined
a scale to the Universe. That first step has

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.790
since led to a much, much longer journey.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.020
Once you know how big the Earth is, other
distances can be found. For example, when

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.860
there’s a lunar eclipse, the shadow of the
Earth is cast on the Moon. You can see the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.900
curve of the Earth’s edge as the shadow
moves across the Moon. Knowing how big the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.040
Earth is, and doing a little more geometry,
you can figure out how far away the Moon is!

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.500
Also, the phases of the Moon depend on the
angles and distances between the Earth, Moon,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.360
and Sun. Using the size of the Earth as a
stepping stone, Aristarchus of Samos was able

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.180
to calculate the distances to the Moon and the
Sun as well as their sizes. That was 2200 years ago!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.480
His numbers weren’t terribly accurate, but
that’s not the important part. His methods

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.950
were sound, and they were used later by great
thinkers like Hipparchus and Ptolemy to get

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.209
more accurate sizes and distances. They actually
did pretty well, and all over a thousand years

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.060
before the invention of the telescope! And
I think it also says a lot that these ancient

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.140
thinkers were willing to accept a solar system
that was at least millions of kilometers in size.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.600
But at this point things got sticky. Planets
are pretty far away and look like dots. Our

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.020
methods for finding distances failed for them.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.360
For a while, at least.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.239
In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler and Isaac
Newton laid the mathematical groundwork of

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.059
planetary orbits, and that in turn made it possible,
in theory, to get the distances to the planets.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.540
Ah, but there was a catch. When you do the
math, you find that measuring the distances

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.269
to the other planets means you need to know
the distance from the Earth to the Sun accurately.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.729
For example, it was known that Jupiter was
about 5 times farther from the Sun than the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.469
Earth was, but that doesn’t tell you what
it is in kilometers.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.400
So how far away is the Sun? Well, they had
a rough idea using the number found by the Greeks,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.620
but to be able to truly understand the solar system,
they needed a much more accurate value for it.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.099
To give you an idea of how important the distance
from the Earth to the Sun is, they gave it

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:59.659
a pretty high-falutin’ name: the astronomical
unit, or AU. Mind you, not “an” astronomical

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.050
unit, “the” one. That’s how fundamental
it is to understanding everything!

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.730
A lot of methods were attempted. Sometimes
Mercury and Venus transit, or cross the face

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.980
of the Sun. Timing these events accurately
could then be used to plug numbers into the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.590
orbital equations and get the length of an
AU. Grand expeditions were sent across the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.800
globe multiple times to measure the transits,
and didn’t do too badly. But our atmosphere

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.400
blurs the images of the planets, putting pretty
big error bars on the timing measurements.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:36.480
The best they could do was to say the AU was
148,510,000 km -- plus or minus 800,000 km.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.220
That’s good, but not QUITE good enough to
make astronomers happy.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.980
Finally, in the 1960s, astronomers used radio
telescopes to bounce radar pulses off of Venus.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.960
Since we know the speed of light extremely
accurately, the amount of time it takes for

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.380
the light to get to Venus and back could be
measured with amazing precision.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.699
Finally, after all these centuries, the astronomical
unit was nailed down.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:06.940
It’s now defined to be 149,597,870.7 kilometers.
So there.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.940
The Earth orbits the Sun on an ellipse, so
think of that as the average distance of the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.160
Earth from the Sun.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.180
Knowing this number unlocked the solar system.
It’s the fundamental meterstick of astronomy,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.000
and the scale we use to measure everything.
Having this number meant we could predict

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.620
the motions of the planets, moons, comets,
and asteroids. Plus, it meant we could launch

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.150
our probes into space and explore these strange
new worlds for ourselves, see them up close,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.830
and truly understand the nature of the solar
system.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.680
And it’s even better than that. Knowing the
Astronomical Unit meant unlocking the stars.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.120
We have two eyes, and this gives us binocular
vision. When you look at a nearby object,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.560
your left eye sees it at a slightly different
angle than your right eye. Your brain puts

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.150
these two images together, compares them,
does the geometry, and gives you a sense of

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.800
distance to that object.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.850
And you thought your teacher lied when she
said math was useful in everyday life.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.970
We call this ability depth perception. You
can see it for yourself by doing the thumb

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.110
thing: as you blink one eye and then the other,
your thumb appears to shift position relative

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.990
to more distant objects. That shift is called
parallax. The amount of shift depends on how

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.130
far apart your eyes are, and how far away
the object is.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.949
If you know the distance between your eyes
— we’ll call this the baseline — then

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.150
you can apply some trigonometry and figure
out how far away the object is. If the object

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.639
is nearby, it shifts a lot; if it’s farther
away, it shift less. It works pretty well,

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.350
but it does put a limit on how far away we can 
reasonably sense distance with just our eyes.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.740
Stars are a bit beyond that limit. If we want
to measure their distance using parallax,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.570
we need a lot bigger baseline than the few
centimeters between our eyes.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.250
Once astronomers figured out that the Earth
went around the Sun rather than vice-versa,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.230
they realized that the Earth’s orbit made
a huge baseline. If we observe a star when

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.440
the Earth is at one spot, then wait six months
for the Earth to go around the Sun to the

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.569
opposite side of its orbit and observe the
star again, then in principle we can determine

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.369
the distance to the star, assuming we know
the size of the Earth’s orbit.

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:10.369
That’s why knowing the length of the astronomical
unit is so important! The diameter of Earth’s

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:16.500
orbit is about 300 million kilometers, which
makes for a tremendous baseline. Hurray!

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.500
Except, oops. When stars were observed, no
parallax was seen. Was heliocentrism wrong?

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.650
Pfft, no. It’s just that stars are really
and truly far away, much farther than even

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.630
the size of Earth’s orbit. The first star
to have its parallax successfully measured

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:39.340
was in 1838. The star was 61 Cygni, a bit
of a dim bulb. But it was bright enough and

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.729
close enough for astronomers to measure its
shift in apparent position as the Earth orbited

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:51.109
the Sun. 61 Cygni is about 720,000 astronomical
units away. That’s a soul-crushing distance;

00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:53.969
well over 100 trillion kilometers!

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:58.909
In fact, that’s so far that even the Earth’s
orbit is too small to be a convenient unit.

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.649
Astronomers came up with another one: The
light year. That’s the distance light travels

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:08.599
in a year. Light’s pretty fast, and covers
about 10 trillion kilometers in a year. It’s

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:13.520
a huge distance, but it makes the numbers
easier on our poor ape brains. That makes

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.580
61 Cygni a much more palatable 11.4 light
years away.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.620
Astronomers also use another unit called a
parsec. It’s based on the angle a star shifts

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:29.599
over the course of a year; a star one parsec
away will have a parallax shift of one arcsecond—1/3600th

00:08:29.599 --> 00:08:35.110
of a degree. That distance turns out to be
about 3.26 light years. As a unit of distance

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.759
it’s convenient for astronomers, but it’s a terrible
one if you’re doing the Kessel Run. Sorry, Han.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:44.939
The nearest star to the sun we know of, Proxima
Centauri, is about 4.2 light years away. The

00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:48.389
farthest stars you can see with the naked
eye are over a thousand light years distant,

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:51.249
but the vast majority are within 100 light
years.

00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:55.740
Space-based satellites are used now to accurately
find the distance to hundreds of thousands

00:08:55.749 --> 00:09:00.739
of stars. Still, this method only works for
relatively nearby stars, ones that are less

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:05.529
than about 1000 light years away. But once
we know those distances, we can use that information

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:07.249
on more distant stars.

00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:11.329
How? Well, like gravity, the strength of light
falls off with the square of the distance.

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:15.670
If you have two stars that are the same intrinsic
brightness—giving off the same amount of

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.009
energy—and one is twice as far as the other,
it will be ¼ as bright. Make it ten times

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:23.899
farther away, it’ll be 1/100th as bright.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:28.369
So if you know how far away the nearer one
is by measuring its parallax, you just have

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:32.269
to compare its brightness to one farther away
to get its distance. You have to make sure they’re

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:38.320
the same kind of star; some are more luminous than
others. But thanks to spectroscopy, we can do just that.

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:42.889
A star’s distance is the key to nearly everything
about it. Once we know how far it is, and

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:46.709
we can measure its apparent brightness, we
can figure out how luminous it is, how much

00:09:46.709 --> 00:09:50.499
light it’s actually giving off, and its
spectrum tells us its temperature.

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:53.910
With those in hand we can determine its mass
and even its diameter.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.100
Once we figured out how far away stars are,
we started to grasp their true physical nature.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.170
This led to even more methods of finding distances.
The light given off by dying stars, exploding

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.619
stars, stars that literally pulse, get brighter
and dimmer over time. All of these and more

00:10:08.619 --> 00:10:13.879
can be used to figure out how many trillions
of kilometers of space lie between us and them.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.720
And we see stars in other galaxies, which
means we can use them to determine the actual

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.899
size and scale of the Universe itself.

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:26.579
And all of this started when some ancient
Greeks were curious about how big the Earth was.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.040
Curiosity can take us a great, great distance.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.220
Today you learned that ancient Greeks were
able to find the size of the Earth, and from

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:39.309
that the distance to and the sizes of the
Moon and Sun. Once the Earth/Sun distance

00:10:39.309 --> 00:10:44.420
was found, parallax was used to find the distance
to nearby stars, and that was bootstrapped

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.809
using brightness to determine the distances
to much farther stars.
