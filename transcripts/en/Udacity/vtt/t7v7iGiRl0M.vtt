00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.670
How do you plan to pitch your business?

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.550
If you're not sure,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.920
you'll have a hard time getting
investors excited about your message.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.620
That's why you need a pitch deck and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.750
a script of what you plan to say
when presenting your product.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.410
So what is a pitch deck and
how do you make one?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.520
A pitch deck is the first communication
tool to help you raise money

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.320
with a potential investor.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.630
We'll be building that
throughout this lesson.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.000
To pitch your business effectively,
we'll focus on three main parts,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.050
the introduction, the details,
and the closing statement.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.049
Each of these parts have a few pieces
inside of them that you'll be writing

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.540
throughout this lesson.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.740
Let's have a closer
look at each of them.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.650
First, before even starting,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.550
you'll gather all the materials
you've built for your business.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.000
You'll be summarizing these
throughout your pitch.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.750
Then, to introduce your startup,
you'll need a hook,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.690
a description of the problem you solve,
and your solution to this problem.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.655
Next, you'll provide a few
details about your startup.

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.075
We'll focus on the market size,
product, user validation,

00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:00.315
monetization strategy, competitive
analysis, and marketing plan.

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:02.775
This is a lot to cover, so
you'll need to be brief and

00:01:02.775 --> 00:01:05.665
focus on the most relevant
aspects of your business.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:08.197
After all this,
you need to close strong.

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:11.437
You'll introduce your team,
the next steps you plan to take and

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:15.577
finally wrap up everything to leave
investors with something to remember.

00:01:15.577 --> 00:01:18.817
Throughout this lesson, we'll focus on
writing each of these pieces to help

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:20.777
you prepare your pitch deck.

00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:23.947
&gt;From there, you'll be ready to
describe your business in a concise,

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:26.447
engaging story for investors.

00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:28.497
So let's get started
building your pitch deck.
