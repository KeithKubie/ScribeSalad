00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.929
Let's revisit the line integral F.n ds

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:07.792
right over here because I want to make sure we have the proper conception

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:10.090
and I was little "loosey goosey" with it in the last video

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.775
and in this video I want to get a little bit more exacting and actually use units

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:16.557
so that we really understand what's going on here

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:18.654
So I've drawn our path "C"

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:22.119
and we're traversing it in the positive counterclockwise direction

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.939
and then I've taken a few sample points for F

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.559
at any point in the x-y plane

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.113
that associates a 2-dimensional vector

00:00:29.113 --> 00:00:31.110
maybe at that point the 2-dimensional vector looks like that,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.822
maybe at that point the 2-dimensional vector looks like that

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:41.992
and then n is of course the unit normal vector at any point on our curve

00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:47.409
the outward pointing unit vector at any point on our curve

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.119
Now in the last video, I talked about F as being some type of a velocity function

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.574
that at any point it gives you the velocity of the particles there

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.518
and that wasn't exactly right

00:00:56.518 --> 00:00:58.289
in order to really understand what's happening here

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.339
in order to really conceptualize this as kind of flux through the boundary

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.984
the rate of mass exiting this boundary here

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:08.953
we actually have to introduce a density aspect to F

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:15.219
So right over here, I've rewritten F, and I've rewritten it as of a product of a scalar function and a vector function

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.986
so the scalar part right over here Rho of x,y

00:01:17.986 --> 00:01:22.736
Rho is a Greek letter often used to represent density of some kind

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.604
in this case its mass density

00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:30.590
so at any given x,y point this tells us what the mass density is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.680
mass density will be some mass in a 2-dimensional world

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.754
so it's mass per area

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:39.212
and if we want particular units for our example-

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:41.718
once again, this isn't the only way that this can be conceived of

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:45.536
there's other applications, but this is the easiest way for my brain to process it

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:51.907
we can imagine this as kilogram per square meter

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:53.857
and this right over here is the velocity vector

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:57.399
it tells us what is the velocity of the particles of that point

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.726
so this is kind of saying, "How much particles do you have at a kind of a point?

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:05.615
How dense are they?" and this is "How fast are they going and in what direction?"

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:09.864
and this whole thing is a vector, it's a velocity vector

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:11.276
but the components right over here

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:15.290
M of x,y is just a number and you multiply that times a vector

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.231
so M of x,y right over here is going to be a scalar function

00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:21.074
when you multiply by i it becomes a vector

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.460
that's going to give you a speed

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.879
and then N of x,y is also going to give you a speed

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.330
and it tells you a speed in a j direction

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.628
so it becomes a vector and a speed in the i direction becomes a vector as well

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:39.646
but these speeds, the units of speed (let me write this over here)

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:41.887
so now we're talking about in particular M of x,y and N of x,y

00:02:41.887 --> 00:02:49.877
that would be in units of distance per time and so maybe for this example we'll say

00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:52.285
the units are meters per second

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.442
So let's think about the units will be for this function

00:02:55.442 --> 00:03:01.347
if we distribute the Rho, because really at any given x,y, it really is just a number

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:08.253
so if we do that, we're going to get F- I'm not going to keep writing F of x,y

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:12.692
we'll just understand that F, Rho, M and N are functions of x,y

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:22.469
F is going to be equal to Rho times M times the unit vector i

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:31.267
plus Rho times N times the unit vector j

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:36.143
now what are the units here? what's Rho times M- what units are we going to get there?

00:03:36.143 --> 00:03:38.803
and we're gonna get the same units when we do Rho times N

00:03:38.803 --> 00:03:42.801
we'll we're gonna have, if we pick these particular units, we're going to have

00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:51.482
kilograms per meter squared times meters per second

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:53.780
so a little bit of dimensional analysis here

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.634
this meter in the numerator will cancel out with one of the meters in the denominator

00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:00.566
and we are left with something kind of strange

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:05.163
kilograms per meter second

00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:11.445
which is essentially what the- if you view this vector has a magnitude in some direction

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:16.266
the magnitude component is going to have these units right over here

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:19.999
and then we're going to take this and we're dotting it with N

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.211
N just only gives us a direction

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:26.610
it is a unit-less vector- it's only specifying a direction at any point in the curve

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.978
so when I take a dot product with this, it's going to give us essentially what is the magnitude of F

00:04:34.978 --> 00:04:43.240
going in the direction of N. So this right over here, when you take the dot, it's essentially

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.291
a part of the magnitude of F going in N's direction

00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.058
and it's going to have the same exact units as F

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:56.323
so the units of this part, you're going to have kilograms per meter second

00:04:56.323 --> 00:04:58.648
and let me make this very clear-

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:01.918
So let's say we're focusing on this point over here

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:08.803
F looks like that, its magnitude, the length of that vector is going to be in kilograms per meter second

00:05:08.803 --> 00:05:11.914
then we have a normal vector right over there

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:13.579
and when you take the dot product, you're essentially saying

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.953
"What's the magnitude that's going in the normal direction?"

00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:21.317
so essentially, what's the magnitude of that vector right over there

00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:23.568
it's going to be in kilograms per meter second

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:25.752
and we're multiplying it times ds

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:30.717
we're multiplying it times this infinitesimally small segment of the curve

00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:32.584
we're going to multiply that times ds

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:35.769
well, what are the units of ds? it's going to be unit of length

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:37.464
we'll just go with meters

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:39.650
so this right over here is going to be meters

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.830
there's this whole integral, you're going to have kilogram per meter second times meters

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:54.994
so if you have kilograms per meter second and you were to multiply that times meters, what do you get?

00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:59.191
well this meters is going to cancel out that meters and then you get something that kinda starts to make sense

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.955
you have kilogram per second

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:05.308
and so this hopefully this makes it clear what's going on here

00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:09.602
this is telling us how much mass is crossing that little ds

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:12.439
that little section of the curve per second

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.022
and if you were to add up- and that's what integrals are all about,

00:06:15.022 --> 00:06:19.086
adding up an infinite number of these infinitesimally small ds's

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:21.179
if you add all of that up

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:24.854
you're going to get- the value of this entire integral is going to be in kilograms

00:06:24.854 --> 00:06:27.945
and kilograms per second, and it's essentially going to say,

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:34.446
"How much mass is exiting this this curve at any given point? Or at any given time?"

00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:46.128
So this whole integral (let me rewrite it) of F.n ds tells us

00:06:46.128 --> 00:06:57.493
the mass exiting the curve per second

00:06:57.493 --> 00:06:59.402
and this should also be consistent in the last video

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:04.772
we saw that this is equivalent to- and this is where we kinda view it as a 2-dimensional divergence theorem

00:07:04.772 --> 00:07:11.753
in the last video, we saw that this is equivalent to the double integral over the area of the divergence of f

00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:13.900
which is essentially just- well, I could write it 2 ways

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:28.521
the divergence of f and this right over here, that's just the partial of the i component with respect to x

00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:32.213
(let me write it over here, I don't want to do this too fast and loose)

00:07:32.213 --> 00:07:40.699
so this right over here is going to be the partial of Rho M (let me write it like this), Rho M

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:47.360
with respect to x plus the partial of the y component

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:58.856
Rho N with respect to y times each little chunk of area

00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:02.843
Well, what are the units of this going to be right over here?

00:08:02.843 --> 00:08:08.638
we know what Rho M is- Rho M gives us kilogram per meter second

00:08:08.638 --> 00:08:12.555
but if we take the derivative with respect to meters again,

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:18.950
the units for either of these characters

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:25.170
are going to be kilograms per meter second per second

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.356
because we're taking the derivative with respect - sorry per METER, we're taking the derivative

00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:33.692
with respect to another unit of distance so you're going to take per meter

00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:36.856
so you're going to have another meter right in the denominator

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:38.637
that's going to be the units here

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:44.649
and then you're multiplying it times an area

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:49.994
so that would be meters squared, this right over here is square meters

00:08:49.994 --> 00:08:51.941
they cancel it out, and once again

00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.156
this whole part here that you're summing up

00:08:54.156 --> 00:08:59.167
gives us kilograms per second, so you're having a bunch of kilograms per second

00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:07.966
and you're just adding them up throughout the entire area right over here

00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:13.395
So hopefully this makes a little more sense, about how kinda how to conceptualize this vector function F

00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:18.830
if it confuses you, try your best to ignore it I guess

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:26.988
for me at least, this helped me out having a stronger conception of what vector F could kind of represent
