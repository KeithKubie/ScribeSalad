00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:01.940
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.056
think about the
antiderivative of 1/x.

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:07.722
Or another way of thinking about
it, another way of writing it ,

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:10.904
is the antiderivative of
x to the negative 1 power.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:12.320
And we already
know, if we somehow

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.460
try to apply that
anti-power rule,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.990
that inverse power
rule over here,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.739
we would get something
that's not defined.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.889
We would get x to the 0 over
0, doesn't make any sense.

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.680
And you might have been
saying, OK, well, I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000
know what to do in this case.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.790
When we first learned
about derivatives,

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.450
we know that the
derivative-- let

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.850
me do this in yellow-- the
derivative with respect

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.410
to x of the natural log
of x is equal to 1 over x.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.090
So why can't we just say
that the antiderivative

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.055
of this right over here is equal
to the natural log of x plus c?

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:47.870
And this isn't
necessarily wrong.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.650
The problem here is that
it's not broad enough.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.570
When I say it's
not broad enough,

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.690
is that the domain over here,
for our original function

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.590
that we're taking the
antiderivative of,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.660
is all real numbers
except for x equals 0.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.220
So over here, x
cannot be equal to 0.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.320
While the domain over here
is only positive numbers.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.510
So over here, x, so
for this expression,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.650
x has to be greater than 0.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.350
So it would be nice
if we could come up

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.960
with an antiderivative that has
the same domain as the function

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.890
that we're taking the
antiderivative of.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.430
So it would be nice if we could
find an antiderivative that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.240
is defined everywhere that
our original function is.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
So pretty much everywhere
except for x equaling 0.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.400
So how can we rearrange
this a little bit

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.230
so that it could be defined
for negative values as well?

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.960
Well, one one
possibility is to think

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.505
about the natural log of
the absolute value of x.

00:01:49.967 --> 00:01:51.550
So I'll put little
question mark here,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.450
just because we
don't really know

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.210
what the derivative of
this thing is going to be.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.130
And I'm not going to
rigorously prove it here,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.210
but I'll I will give you kind
of the conceptual understanding.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.224
So to understand it, let's
plot the natural log of x.

00:02:03.224 --> 00:02:04.640
And I had done
this ahead of time.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.098
So that right over
there is roughly

00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:09.150
what the graph of the
natural log of x looks like.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.430
So what would the natural
log of the absolute value

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.540
of x is going to look like?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.980
Well, for positive x's, it's
going to look just like this.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.315
For positive x's you take
the absolute value of it,

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:22.970
it's just the same thing as
taking that original value.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.360
So it's going to look just
like that for positive x's.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.260
But now this is also going to
be defined for negative x's.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.400
If you're taking the
absolute value of negative 1,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.250
that evaluates to just 1.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.240
So it's the natural log of 1, so
you're going to be right there.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.520
As you get closer and
closer and closer to 0

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.106
from the negative
side, you're just

00:02:42.106 --> 00:02:43.480
going to take the
absolute value.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.810
So it's essentially going
to be exactly this curve

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.100
for the natural log of
x, but the left side

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.140
of the natural log of
the absolute value of x

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.070
is going to be its mirror image,
if you were to reflect around

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.830
the y-axis.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.454
It's going to look
something like this.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.030
So what's nice
about this function

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.050
is you see it's defined
everywhere, except for-- I'm

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.110
trying to draw it as
symmetrically as possible--

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.440
except for x equals 0.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.880
So if you combine this pink
part and this part on the right,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.840
if you combine
both of these, you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.120
get y is equal to the natural
log of the absolute value of x.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.730
Now let's think
about its derivative.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.310
Well, we already know what the
derivative of the natural log

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.160
of x is, and for
positive values of x.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.280
So let me write this down.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.750
For x is greater than 0,
we get the natural log

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.300
of the absolute value of x is
equal to the natural log of x.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.050
Let me write this.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.080
Is equal to the
natural log of x.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.070
And we would also know,
since these two are

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.450
equal for x is greater
than 0, the derivative

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.880
of the natural log of
the absolute value of x

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.440
is going to be equal to the
derivative of the natural log

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.020
of x.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.480
Which is equal to 1/x
for x greater than 0.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.510
So let's plot that.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.459
I'll do that in green.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.079
It's equal to 1/x.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.940
So 1/x, we've seen it before.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.320
It looks something like this.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.290
So let me do my best
attempt to draw it.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.070
It has both vertical and
horizontal asymptotes.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.640
So it looks something like this.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.270
So this right over here is
1/x x is greater than 0.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.340
So this is 1/x when
x is greater than 0.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.210
So all it's saying here, and
you can see pretty clearly,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.570
is the slope right over here,
the slope of the tangent line

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.400
is 1.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.840
And so you see
that when you look

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.715
at the derivative, the
slope right over here,

00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:58.670
the derivative should
be equal to 1 here.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.630
When you get close
to 0, you have

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.060
a very, very steep
positive slope here.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.480
And so you see you have a very
high value for its derivative.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.729
And then as you move away
from 0, it's still steep.

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.520
But it becomes less
and less and less steep

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.020
all the way until you get to 1.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.740
And then it keeps getting
less and less and less steep.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.770
But it never quite gets
to absolutely flat slope.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.030
And that's what you see
its derivative doing.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.150
Now what is the natural
log of absolute value

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.990
of x doing right over here?

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.010
When we are out here, our
slope is very close to 0.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.710
It's symmetric.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.106
The slope here is essentially
the negative of the slope here.

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:40.230
I could do it maybe clearer,
showing it right here.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.130
Whatever the slope
is right over here,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.860
it's the exact
negative of whatever

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.390
the slope is at a symmetric
point on the other side.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.500
So if on the other side, the
slope is right over here,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500
over here it's going to
be the negative of that.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.330
So it's going to be
right over there.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.580
And then the slope it just
gets more and more and more

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.080
negative.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.160
Right over here, the
slope is a positive 1.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.360
Over here it's going
to be a negative 1.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.000
So right over here our
slope is a negative 1.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.750
And then as we get
closer and closer to 0,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.220
it's just going to get more
and more and more negative.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.330
So the derivative
of the natural log

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.900
of the absolute value of
x, for x is less than 0,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.150
looks something like this.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.770
And you see, and
once again, it's

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.300
not a ultra rigorous
proof, but what

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.760
you see is that the
derivative of the natural log

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.140
of the absolute value of
x is equal to 1/x for all

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.600
x's not equaling 0.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.420
So what you're seeing,
or hopefully you

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.190
can visualize, that
the derivative-- let

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:51.870
me write it this way--
of the natural log

00:06:51.870 --> 00:07:01.310
of the absolute value of x is
indeed equal to 1/x for all

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.790
x does not equal 0.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.540
So this is a much more
satisfying antiderivative

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.300
for 1/x.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.520
It has the exact
the same domain.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.230
So when we think about what
the antiderivative is for 1/x--

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.280
and I didn't do a kind
of a rigorous proof here,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.630
I didn't use the definition of
the derivative and all of that.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.640
But I kind of gave you a visual
understanding, hopefully,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.240
of it.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.970
We would say it's
the natural log

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.730
of the absolute
value of x plus c.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.290
And now we have
an antiderivative

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.660
that has the same
domain as that function

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.990
that we're taking the
antiderivative of.
