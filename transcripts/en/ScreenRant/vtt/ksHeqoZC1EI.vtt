00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.279
When it comes to Star Wars, there are a bunch
of theories out there in the void known as

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.279
the internet.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.930
Some are straight up crazy, some seem entirely
credible.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.219
One of the most popular topics is concerning
who Rey is, the scavenger turned Jedi that

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.860
lead the way in the force awakens.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.860
So who is she?

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.970
Well one such theory may blow your mind if
it turns out to be true.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.540
Give us a like if you think anyone of these
five reasons why we think Rey might just be

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.990
Darth Vader reincarnated can happen!

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:46.321
Dreamworld
Much like Anakin Skywalker before her, Rey

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:50.089
has shown to be so in tuned with the Force
that she possesses the ability to peak into

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.780
the past as well as the future.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.590
Anakin saw flashes of pain and suffering when
concerning those he loved most, namely his

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.210
mother Shmi and his wife Padme.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.150
Rey demonstrated a similar ability when she
touched Anakin’s saber in the force awakens,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.620
getting glimpses at both the past, including
a peak into cloud city where Vader revealed

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:13.330
to Luke his lineage, which may or may not
be Vader’s own memory 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.650
of the event.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.920
She may also get a glimpse into the future,
much as Anakin did, where she witness the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190
Knights of Ren finishing up a massacre on
a rainy planet.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.560
While we don’t know for sure that it was
the future, we do know that this scene is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.680
not Luke’s academy massacre.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.180
Force Ghost 2.0
Another point that fans have been quick to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.460
point out is that Rey shares some facial similarities
to that of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin’s mother

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.780
who was killed by sand people in episode 2.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.750
Could a reincarnated Anakin adopt a look that
would harken back to his beloved mother?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620
And why would the force wait so long to bring
Anakin back as Rey?

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.659
The first force ghost was qui gon jinn, and
it took him almost 10 years to manifest himself

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.659
through the force.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.950
Obi wan shows himself to Luke after 3 (but
being very vocal from the get go) and Yoda

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.090
took another year.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.009
So if Rey is the next step, going beyond force
ghosts and restarting the prophecy, the time

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.660
to learn such a feat may take decades.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.530
The Force is strong in my family…

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.140
Despite having no formal training as of episode
7, Rey has shown she is quite powerful in

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.970
the force, illustrating accelerated feats
of learning and proficiency.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.950
In a matter of days, she has learned and understood
saber combat, besting Kylo Ren, the force

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.130
grab when reaching for the saber in her Excalibur
moment and mastering the Jedi mind trick after

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.849
3 tries, with no prior knowledge that it was
even a technique prior to that.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.650
Maybe she’s born that way?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.100
Much like Anakin, she is also a gifted pilot
and mechanic.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.459
The prophecy of the chosen one
One of the main reasons is the chosen one

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.820
prophecy that was introduced in the prequel
trilogy.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.930
In it, it said a figure would rise up and
bring balance to the force.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.820
Anakin did eventually do this, but not before
almost completely wiping the Jedi off the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.060
map.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.630
So what if the force is giving the Skywalker
another chance via reincarnation to fulfil

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.590
the prophecy with the threat of the first
order, snoke and the knights of ren growing

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.850
ever more darker.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.020
It calls to you…

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.890
Perhaps the most obvious point of contention
for this theory is that the saber straight

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.240
up calls to Rey.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.190
Bear in mind that this saber is not Luke Skywalker’s
but in fact his father’s, Anakin’s.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.460
Luke merely adopted it before crafting his
own green one in return of the Jedi.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.380
So with a powerful connection between Rey
and Anakin being established, could the saber

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.680
be reaching out to its former master, sensing
a familiar presence in the force nearby and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.810
latching over to it?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.000
Kylo is after all Vader’s grandson yet the
saber rejected him and went to Rey, and that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.890
saber helped kill the younglings so it’s
seen some better days.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.550
So there you have it, some chin scratching
ideas to consider while we await the next

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.190
entry in the Star Wars franchise.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.540
Do you agree with this theory or think it’s
downright crazy?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.750
What other theories have you heard of concerning
Rey?
