JUDITH D. SINGER: Thank you all.

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:06.315
I'm Judy Singer.

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:08.440
I'm the senior vice provost
for faculty development

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.990
and diversity, and I
am also a professor

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.540
of statistics at the
Graduate School of Education.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.760
And on behalf of
all of Harvard, I

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.870
would like to invite you to
this new faculty institute.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.390
This is the 11th year that
we've been doing this,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.910
and it's a chance to
bring together faculty

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
from across the university
to meet each other;

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.120
to hear from colleagues who
have, like you, once been new;

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.660
and to hear, in today's
case, from someone who's just

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.680
as new as you, the 29th
president of Harvard

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.390
University, Lawrence S. Bacow.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.040
I'm just going to
say a few words,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.030
and then I'm going to turn the
podium over to President Bacow.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.660
And then I'll come pop up
and say a few more words.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.560
What I hope is that both today
and also in the experiences

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.690
that you've had over
the last few weeks,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.080
you've gotten a chance to see
what a terrific place Harvard

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.850
is to be a faculty member.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.000
We know that all of you
had lots of options.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.710
Anybody we want to
hire wants to be

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.320
hired by a lot of other
institutions as well,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.780
and we are so thrilled
that you made the decision

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.970
to join us here.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.450
You're going to have fabulous
colleagues, fabulous students.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.970
You're going to discover that
the Harvard name, for better

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.280
or worse, opens doors.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.730
And it's also just a terrific
place to do research.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.440
But since President
Bacow is with us,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.120
I'm going to yield the podium
because he takes rank over me.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.200
And I think he needs
no introduction.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.820
I think the one
piece of introduction

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.300
I would give you is that Harvard
is not quite 400 years old,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.570
and he is the 29th president.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.850
So just wrap your
head around that.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.160
You're going to
live a long time.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:57.060
LAWRENCE S. BACOW: From
your lips to God's ears.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.920
JUDITH D. SINGER: Exactly.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.420
LAWRENCE S. BACOW: And
let's hope she's listening.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.295
JUDITH D. SINGER: OK.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.350
LAWRENCE S. BACOW:
Well, as Judy said,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.870
I am also a new faculty member.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.550
My faculty appointment
was processed

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.730
at exactly the same
time all of yours were.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.940
So I would like to say
I'm delighted to be

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.420
a member of your class,
and I look forward

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.360
to getting to know many of you
in a variety of different kinds

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.500
of capacities.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.470
As I was saying to
Judy and your panelists

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.280
up here when we were
just talking in advance,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.930
this sort of brought
me back in time

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.740
to when I was welcomed as
a very, very junior faculty

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.539
member--

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.580
it's hard to admit this--

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.990
41 years ago at MIT.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.560
I spent the bulk of
my career at MIT.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.144
And Judy asked
me, so what advice

00:02:47.144 --> 00:02:48.310
did they give you back then.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.420
And I actually do remember.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.670
I said, god, I can't remember.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.350
Then I remembered the advice
I was given back then.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.590
So I will share that
advice with you right now.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.130
And this is more applicable to
those of you who are joining us

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.170
as your first faculty
appointment as opposed

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.260
to those of you who are lateral
moves and have been faculty

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.170
members elsewhere and are
coming here, in some cases,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.910
as full professors.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.050
I was advised to remember
that in a great university,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.120
best idea wins.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.110
It does not make any
difference what your rank is,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.670
where you came from before.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.390
Treat your faculty colleagues
and others exactly like that.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.710
If you disagree with
them, disagree with them.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.070
Stand up for your own
ideas, your own scholarship,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.360
and you will do well.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.529
It actually was
great, great advice.

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.320
I think it's actually
great advice not just

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.280
for faculty members.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.250
I think it's great advice for
students and for others also.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.630
Just a few weeks ago, I welcomed
entering first-year students.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.300
And before that, I spoke to
first-year faculty advisors.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.910
And when I spoke to
them, I made a point

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.480
of saying if you're going to
be a good faculty advisor,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.600
it's really important
to try and remember

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.980
what it was like when
you were a student,

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.590
and you got sort of
the envelope saying

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.990
you've now been accepted to
blank, or the first time you

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.760
were appointed here at Harvard.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.480
Students at Harvard talk
about dropping the H bomb,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.630
that the fact that
we all work here,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.550
study here-- whatever-- can
be intimidating for others.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.150
But hopefully, it will certainly
not be for our students,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.850
nor will it be for you.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.130
The miracle of Harvard
is that we combine--

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.750
we take great students and
combine them with great faculty

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.920
under temperature and pressure,
and really interesting

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.380
catalytic reactions occur.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.720
And the peer effects here are
really quite extraordinary,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.720
and they make, I think,
everybody better.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.250
That said, everybody
at one time or another

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.890
can find themselves
intimidated by the place.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.120
It's true of new students.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.410
It's true of new faculty.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.210
It's true of new staff.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.860
It's true of new presidents.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.830
So my advice to you is to relax
and try and exploit the place

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.650
in every possible way.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.190
Everybody who works here,
and I do mean everybody,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.120
is invested in your success.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.040
And people are
going to do whatever

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.390
they can to try and ensure
that you can do work here.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.640
You can do scholarship
here that you

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.940
can do perhaps no other place.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.890
And that is, I think--
our collective goal

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.640
is to surround you with great
students; great colleagues;

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.790
great staff; hopefully, great
facilities and resources.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.510
The resources, I
know, will never

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.530
be enough because faculty
have an insatiable

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.660
appetite for resources.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.310
That's how it should be.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.800
But we are here
to try and ensure

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.890
that you can do truly,
truly great things.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.340
So let me just stop there.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.920
By the way, I am
not President Bacow.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.549
I'm Larry.

00:06:29.549 --> 00:06:30.840
That's what everybody calls me.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.160
So when you see
me around, please

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.243
stop and say, hello, Larry.

00:06:37.243 --> 00:06:40.860
And don't hesitate to
stop me and tell me

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.818
how things are going for you.

00:06:43.818 --> 00:06:46.896
JUDITH D. SINGER:
Thanks, Larry, very much.

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.270
I'm just going to
say a few words

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.640
about the university, the sort
of payback on Phil's question.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.680
There are some
things that you're

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.250
going to learn about
Harvard in your years

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.850
here that you see it from
the perspective of being

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.610
in your individual school or
your individual department,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.470
but there's a big
superstructure.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.990
And I'm not talking about it
in lumbering administration.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.210
I'm talking about just
a big superstructure

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.530
for the entire university.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.230
Harvard is a huge place.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.860
Among our Ivy League,
Ivy Plus peers,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.230
we're larger than
pretty much everyone.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.650
And so it means that
you have to work harder

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.780
to break through those
kinds of boundaries.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.080
There are about 1,500 ladder
faculty across the university.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.520
And then we have our
Harvard-affiliated hospitals.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.890
There are 18
Harvard-affiliated hospitals,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.140
and they have another
11,000 faculty.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.070
So if you start to wrap your
head around the sheer magnitude

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.276
of it, there's just a lot of
opportunity to meet people.

00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:49.650
And there are a
lot of people who

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.080
are doing interesting
work that we'd like

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.140
you to be able to partake of.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.490
I'd also say that Harvard
is increasingly diverse.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.170
And if you take a
look at this room,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.570
this is not your
father's Harvard.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.410
When I started on
the faculty in 1984,

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.470
I can tell you I was one of
the few women on the faculty

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.220
at the university.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.190
That is just not
the case anymore.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.780
Overall at the
university, we're now--

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.450
30% of the ladder faculty are
female, 24% are minorities.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.210
And the entering class--
you in this room--

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.070
are particularly diverse--
37% female, 38% minority.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.680
Another feature of
Harvard right now,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.950
and this is more directed
towards the newly tenured

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.260
faculty who are here--

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.450
you're all coming
from the outside,

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.580
but Harvard has moved
to a tenure track.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.330
And so increasingly, your
tenured colleagues, especially

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.220
your earlier career
tenured colleagues,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.900
will have come up from within.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.810
And this is a huge
sea change in terms

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.650
of the sense of the university
and sense of investing

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.210
in people.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.220
We are really invested
in every single faculty

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.480
member that comes here who
are invested in their success.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.860
This whole question of one
Harvard and the tub system--

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.120
you're in a changing era.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.360
So Drew used the
phrase "one Harvard."

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.160
I think Larry is
continuing to adopt it.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.340
And the idea is
that you should be

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.150
building on the connections that
exist across the university.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.130
And in fact, the
panelists we have here are

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.060
a really good illustration of
those kinds of connections.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.820
The decentralization was cited
as one of Harvard's successes

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.700
in an era before technology
and before we were all

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.960
connected to each other.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.570
This is a very
different kind of era.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.810
And we are actually working
on technological tools

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.260
to help you meet other
faculty with common interests

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.250
across the university.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.150
Stay tuned to that.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.890
We're working on developing
some faculty dashboards that

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.190
can help you meet other people
from across the university.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.730
In the meantime, I am
the human faculty finder.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.730
So if you are intere--

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.320
they're all nodding
because they know

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.985
I'm the human faculty finder.

00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:04.860
We are very interested
in faculty development

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.450
and diversity in facilitating
these connections.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.840
So just drop us a line, and
we are happy to hook you up.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.550
I send emails to
people all the time,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.730
electronically introducing
them to each other.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.320
And the whole
rationale for today

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.230
is to bring people together
from across the university

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.310
and at different career stages.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.670
And we're going to hear
from our colleagues

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.670
from also across Harvard
at different career

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:33.270
stages about their experiences
and advice to new faculty.
