And this one is the floor function. You can see that for a given x value, the y

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:10.250
value will be equal to the next lowest integer. Unless x itself is an integer,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.990
in which case y equals x. Please know that the only difference between this

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.190
graph and this one, is the placement of the empty circle and the closed circle

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.109
in each step.
