00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] So when people first showed

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.320
that matter particles like electrons

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.060
can have wavelengths and
when DeBroglie showed

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.620
that the wavelength is Planck's constant

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.280
over the momentum, people were like cool,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.480
it's pretty sweet.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.920
But you know someone
was like wait a minute,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.235
if this particle has wavelike properties

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:20.721
and it has a wavelength,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.690
what exactly is waving?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.350
What is this wave we're
even talking about?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.080
Conceptually it's a little strange.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.010
I mean a water wave, we know what that is.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.430
It's a bunch of water that's
oscillating up and down.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.190
A wave on a string, we know what that is.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.160
This string itself is moving up and down

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.920
and it extends through space.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.240
But it's hard to imagine,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.720
how is this electron having a wavelength

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.130
and what is the actual wave itself?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.860
So physicists were
grappling with this issue,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.556
trying to conceptually understand

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.940
how to describe the wave of the electron.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.270
They wanted to do two things.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510
They wanted a mathematical description

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.240
for the shape of that wave,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.090
and that's called the wave function.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.740
So this wave function gives
you a mathematical description

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.390
for what the shape of the wave is.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.210
So different electron
systems are gonna have

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.880
different wave functions,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.730
and this is psi,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.170
it's the symbol for the wave function.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.010
So this is psi, the psi symbol.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.620
It's a function of x.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.010
So at different points in x,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.150
it may have a large value,
it may have a small value.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690
This function would give
you the mathematical shape

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.523
of this wave.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.900
So that was one of the things
they were trying to determine.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.580
But they also wanted to interpret it.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
Like what does this
wave function even mean?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.920
So we've got two problems.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.430
We want a mathematical
description of the wave

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.490
and we wanna interpret what
does this wave even mean.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.250
Now the person that gave us
the mathematical description

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.040
of this wave function
was Erwin Schrodinger.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.090
So Schrodinger is this guy right here.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.290
Schrodinger's right here.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.420
He wrote down Schrodinger's Equation,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
and his name now is basically synonymous

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.110
with quantum mechanics
because this is arguably

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920
the most important equation
in all of quantum mechanics.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.340
There's a bunch of partial
derivatives in here

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.150
and Planck's constants,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.930
but the important thing is that it's got

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.610
the wave function in here.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.470
Now if you've never
seen partial derivatives

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.810
or calculus, it's okay.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.290
All you need to know for our
purposes today in this video

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.510
is that this equation
is a way to crank out

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.460
the mathematical wave function.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.580
What is this function that
gives us the shape of the wave

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.920
as a function of x?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.610
And you could imagine
plotting this on some graph.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.950
So once you solve for this
psi as a function of x,

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.020
you could plot what this looks like.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.120
Maybe it looks something like this,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.010
and who knows, it could
do all kinds of stuff.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.070
Maybe it looks like that.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.260
But Schrodinger's Equation is the way

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.300
you can get this wave function.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.380
So Schrodinger gave us a way to get

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.110
the mathematical wave function,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.010
but we also wanted to interpret it.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.140
What does this even mean?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.750
To say that this wave function
represents the electrons

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.850
is still strange.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.440
What does that mean?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.150
Schrodinger tried to
interpret it this way.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.600
He said, okay maybe this electron
really is like smudged out

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.430
in space and its charge
is kinda distributed

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.710
in different places.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.010
Schrodinger wanted to
interpret this wave function

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.070
as charge density,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.540
and I mean it's kind of
a reasonable thing to do.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900
The way you get a water
wave is by having water

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.560
spread out through space.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.340
So maybe the way you get an electron wave

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.640
is to have the charge of the electron

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.320
spread out through space.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.360
But this description didn't work so well,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.820
which is kinda strange.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.010
Schrodinger invented this equation.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.370
He came up with this equation,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.140
but he couldn't even interpret

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.140
what he was describing correctly.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.190
It took someone else.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.000
It took a guy named Max Born to give us

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.530
the interpretation we go with
now for this wave function.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.040
Max Born said no, don't interpret
it as the charge density.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.540
What you should do is interpret this psi

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.150
is giving you a way to get the probability

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.680
of finding the electron
at a given point in space.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.040
So Max Born said this,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.420
if you find your psi,
like he said go ahead

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.500
and use Schrodinger's
equation, use it, get psi.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.980
Once you have psi, what you do
is you square this function.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.010
So take the absolute value, square it,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.820
and what that's gonna give
you is the probability

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.930
of finding the electron at a given point.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.330
Now technically it's
the probability density,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.590
but for our purposes,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.400
you can pretty much just think about this

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.530
as the probability of finding the electron

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.400
at a given point.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.870
So if this was our wave
function in other words,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.070
Max Born would tell us that
points where it's zero,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.710
these points right here
where the value is zero,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.430
there is a zero percent
chance you're gonna find

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.400
the electron there.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.820
Points where there's a large value of psi,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.160
be it positive or negative,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.500
there's gonna be a large probability

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.470
of finding the electron at that point.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.210
And we could say the odds
of finding the electron

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.400
at a given point here are gonna be largest

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.630
for this value of x right here

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.536
because that's the point
for which the wave function

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:07.240
has the greatest magnitude.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.450
But you won't necessarily
find the electron there.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.400
If you repeat this
experiment over and over,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.950
you may find the electron here once,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.130
you may find it over here, you
may find it there next time.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.800
You have to keep taking measurements,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.140
and if you keep taking measurements,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.630
you'll get this
distribution where you find

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.720
a lot of 'em here, a lot of 'em there,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.590
a lot of 'em here, and a lot of 'em here,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.867
always where there's these
peaks you get more of them

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:32.910
than you would have at other points

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.700
where the values are smaller.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.530
You build up a distribution
that's represented

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.890
by this wave function.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.610
So the wave function does not tell you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.350
where the electron's gonna be.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.640
It just gives you the probability,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.800
and technically the square of it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.510
gives you the probability of
finding the electron somewhere.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.590
So even at points down here
where the wave function

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.020
has a negative value,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.220
I mean you can't have
a negative probability.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.950
You square that value.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.770
That gives you the probability
of finding the electron

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.760
in that region.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.593
So in other words,

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:02.680
let's get rid of all this.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.160
Let's say we solved some
Schrodinger equation

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.230
or we were just handed a wave function

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.330
and we were told it looks
like this and we were asked,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.710
where are you most likely
to find the electron?

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.450
Well the value of the
wave function is greatest

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.530
at this point here,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.590
so you'd be most likely
to find the electron

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.200
in this region right here.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.580
You'd have no shot of
finding it right there.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.810
You'd have pretty good odds
of finding it right here

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.090
or right here,

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.110
but you'd have the greatest
chance of finding it

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.550
in this region right here.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.703
So you'd have to repeat
this measurement many times.

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:33.440
In quantum mechanics,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.890
one measurement doesn't
verify that you've got

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.220
the right wave function.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.630
Because if I do one experiment

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.930
and measure one electron,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.690
boop I might find the
electron right there.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.230
That doesn't really tell me anything.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.960
I have to repeat this
over and over to make sure

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.360
the relative frequency of
where I'm finding electrons

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.207
matches the wave function
I'm using to model

00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:54.030
that electron system.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.710
So that's what the wave function is.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.360
That's what it can do for you,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.650
although if I were you,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.050
I'd still be unsatisfied.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.590
I'd be like, wait a minute,
okay, that's fine and good.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.117
Wave function can give us the probability

00:07:05.117 --> 00:07:07.960
or the probability density
of finding the electron

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.050
in a given region,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.640
but we haven't answered the question,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.180
what is waving here and what exactly

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.510
is this wave function?

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.960
Is this a physical object
sort of like a water wave

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.070
or even an electromagnetic wave?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.620
Or is this just some mathematical trickery

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.760
that we're using that has
no physical interpretation

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.776
other than giving us
information about where

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:31.590
the electron's gonna be?

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.310
And I've got good news and bad news.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.500
The bad news is that
people still don't agree

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.160
on how to interpret this wave function.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.520
Yes they know that the
square of it gives you

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.280
the probability of finding
the electron in some region,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.110
but people differ on how
they're supposed to interpret it

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.200
past that point.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.810
For instance, is this wave function

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.380
the wave function of a single electron

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.150
or is this wave function
really the wave function

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.750
of a system, an ensemble of electrons,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.050
all similarly prepared
that you're gonna do

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.300
the experiment on?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.730
In other words, does it
describe one electron

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.470
or only describe a system of electrons?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.550
Does it not describe the electron at all

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.440
but only our measurement of the electron?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.560
And what happens to this wave function

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.620
when you actually measure the electron?

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.120
When you measure the electron
you find it somewhere,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.900
and at that moment there's no chance

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.480
of finding it over here at all.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.689
So does the act of measuring the electron

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:30.720
cause some catastrophic
collapse in this wave function

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.280
that's not described by
Schrodinger's Equation?

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.240
These and many more
questions are still debated

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.980
and not completely understood.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.290
That's the bad news.

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.940
The good news is that we don't really need

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.290
to understand that to make progress.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.140
Everyone knows how to
use the wave function

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.490
to get the probabilities of measurements.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.750
You can have your favorite interpretation,

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.100
but luckily pretty much
regardless of how you interpret

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.230
this wave function,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.870
as long as you're using it correctly

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.070
to get the probabilities of measurements,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.727
you can continue making progress,

00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:03.540
testing different models,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.470
and correlating data to the measurements

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.070
that people make in the lab.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.040
Now I'm not saying that interpretations

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.500
of this wave function are not important.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.060
People have tried cracking
this nut for over 100 years,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.380
and it's resisted.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.492
Maybe that's because it's a waste of time

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:21.500
or maybe it's because the
difficulty of figuring this out

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.270
is so great that whoever
does it will go down

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.230
in history as one of the
great physicists of all time.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.130
It's hard to tell right now,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.320
but what's undebatable is
for about 100 years now,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.700
we've been able to make
progress with quantum mechanics

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.740
even though we differ on
how exactly to interpret

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.380
what this wave function really represents.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.260
So recapping the wave function gives you

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.400
the probability of finding a particle

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.130
in that region of space,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.090
specifically the square
of the wave function

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.610
gives you the probability density

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.510
of finding a particle
at that point in space.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.660
This almost everyone has agreed upon.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.600
Whether the wave function
has deeper implications

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.960
besides this, people differ,

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.190
but that hasn't yet
stopped us from applying

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.840
quantum mechanics correctly in a variety

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.403
of different scenarios.
