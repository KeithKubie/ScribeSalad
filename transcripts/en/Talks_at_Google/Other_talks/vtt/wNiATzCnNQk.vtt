to Google, Frederick Marx.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.691
Thank you so much.

00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:33.470
FREDERICK MARX: Thank you.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.570
Well, it's great to be here.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.270
First, I just want
to thank you, Mario,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.210
for going through the trouble to
set this up and make it happen.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.500
And also Bill Duane, who's
part of the same team,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.230
for inviting me here to
speak to all of you today.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.730
It's a real privilege.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.850
I get to fulfill my life's
purpose by being here

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.130
to talk to you.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.200
And I've had the
privilege of coming

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.720
to understand my own life
in very simple terms.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.870
My life is about two
things, art and service.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.310
That's it.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.810
So this presentation today
is the latter part of that.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.610
It's about service,
it's about me

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.980
coming to share
some of what I think

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.080
is important, about what I've
learned about life, with all

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.670
of you.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330
And more on that point
in just a few minutes.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.060
So what I want to do now
is just share with you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.370
this film that we just
finished last March,

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.684
and this is going to be a lot
of what we talk about today.

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:41.648
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.266
-15-year-old.

00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:52.850
-14-year-old.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.980
-A 14-year-old and
an 18-year-old--

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.380
-Relish the destruction.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.190
-Teen and preteen drug
and alcohol abuse--

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.950
-Teenage bullying
is an epidemic.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.115
-A small group of young punks--

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:05.560
-Inducing abortions.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.580
-Theories of murders
and shootings--

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.570
-It was mayhem.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.445
-Boys putting their
own lives at risk.

00:03:11.445 --> 00:03:12.430
-15-year-old.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.432
-A 15-year-old--

00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:14.620
-This teenager--

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.630
- --stole a car--

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.630
-Gangs of young people--

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.840
-Teens in crisis--

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.640
-Punks.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.225
A scene like a war zone.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.630
-When a culture doesn't
provide formal rites of passage

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.670
or initiations, then you get
usually destructive versions

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.410
of it.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.180
-Maybe if we had
other ways for kids

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.830
to illustrate their
adult-like qualities,

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.390
then they wouldn't resort
to these anti-social ones.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.100
-That's what gang activity is
about, that's what vandalism

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.410
and all of that kind of
destruction is about.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.120
It's about how do I prove
to the world that I'm here

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.410
and that I'm a man, that I'm
not a little kid anymore?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.740
-Young people, at
a certain age, it's

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.040
very natural and
important that they

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.190
begin to challenge the
values of their upbringing

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.910
and of their culture, and
to begin to go inward.

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:13.400
-How, as communities, do
we respond to this need?

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.600
Our social infrastructure
has broken down.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.620
Half of our
marriages fall apart.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.470
Everybody's working so hard,
the community is in fragments.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.770
How do we come together to
provide this for young people?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.100
-Without a mentor as a
companion, it won't work.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.440
Initiation depends on the
generosity of the grown-ups,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.600
and the mentor has
to be someone that's

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.980
not going to abandon that boy.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.260
-When communities saw that this
was happening in young people

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.300
and they were beginning to rebel
against the cultural values

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.830
or the parent values, they
knew, OK, this is good.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.870
Something right is happening.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.400
They're ready and it's time
for them to be initiated.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.770
And so for the health
of the community

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.860
and the health of
the individual,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.430
they created rites of
passage ceremonies.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.650
-The question, then,
is do we actually

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.600
consecrate those markers?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.130
Do we celebrate those markers?

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.810
Do we prepare our
young people so

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.900
that-- as they're moving
from one stage to the next--

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.590
that they understand
that for every privilege

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.430
there is a corresponding
responsibility?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.580
In absence of that,
the day a child

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.510
gets a driver's license is the
day they still their mom's car.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.520
The day they are old
enough to buy alcohol

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.230
is the day they get drunk.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.450
And one and on and on.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.660
-We are not addressing
the needs of young people,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.750
and we have taken away, I
think, from many of them

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.970
opportunities to participate
meaningfully in the community.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.930
It deprives them of this chance
to understand themselves better

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.125
and to develop a sense
of being important.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.920
-I don't see it as a
failure of the young,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.480
I see it as a failure
of the elders.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.920
So we, as elders, we
have responsibility.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.530
We have the choice
to speak, to teach,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.835
to show, and hope and bring
the young along with us.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.310
-The human psyche so desperately
needs ceremonial markings.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.030
It is like magic.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.021
-I will find that the
community will be safer,

00:09:06.021 --> 00:09:08.395
we'll find that kids will be
less violent, less confused,

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:09.770
less suicidal.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.400
These are better
than meds, better

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.483
than going to the prisons
and juvenile facilities.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.740
-Every family unit,
every community,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.170
every big [INAUDIBLE], every
village, city, town, state,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.670
whatever, need to figure out--
for their young people-- what

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.710
works.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.735
How do you initiate?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.594
-You start to think about
what your mission is,

00:10:00.594 --> 00:10:02.070
what you want to do.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.060
-Initiation and
mentorship has helped me

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:45.290
by realizing that
it's OK to cry.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.092
Not just in front
of men, but in front

00:10:48.092 --> 00:10:52.680
of women without feeling like
you're any less of a man.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.130
-After my initiation
with women, every time

00:10:55.130 --> 00:11:00.020
I feel myself-- like my
foundation wavering-- instead

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.900
of needing to run to my husband
or to these usual go-to people

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.340
that are holding so
much, it's my sisters.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.430
It's the women that
can really hold me.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.750
-We also have to ask,
what's the community losing

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.895
by not engaging young people?

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:45.740
-If the creator put this
person on the planet,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.070
we're supposed to
nurture them to the point

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.950
that we become recipients
of the gift that they have.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.470
That's what rites
of passage told me.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.280
Assist that person's
growth so that when

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.588
their gift is revealed to the
world, the world will benefit.

00:13:01.588 --> 00:13:02.963
That's an adult's
responsibility.

00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:04.426
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.450
FREDERICK MARX: Well,
thank you for that.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.450
Any questions?

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.765
Well, that is an
overview of everything

00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:19.240
that I want to
talk about with you

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.890
today, so we're going
to just circle back

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.070
and zero in on a number
of different subjects

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.650
that I raised in the
short film there.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.600
And I want to start by
getting a sense of you folks.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.230
So I want to ask
you some questions

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:37.240
and I just ask you to just
raise your hand if you've ever

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.370
asked yourself any of these
questions or, in fact,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.150
might still be
wrestling with them.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.940
What is the purpose of my life?

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.200
What am I here on
this planet to do?

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.860
Yeah, my hand has been up
for all these questions.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.200
In fact, it still is
up for some of them

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.040
and I'm going to be
60 in a few weeks.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.120
So where do I fit in?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.160
What's my place in the
world, in the cosmos?

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.000
What, if anything, is
uniquely mine to offer?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.530
What are my gifts?

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.960
The Native Americans
used the term medicine.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.520
Their belief is that every
human being represents

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.930
a unique medicine that they
are here in this lifetime

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.880
to offer their
community, their family,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.090
all of those around them.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.450
So what is your medicine?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.950
And how will I face my
life's coming challenges?

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.920
How will I get to
be that man or woman

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.620
that I've always wanted to be?

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.620
When will I be
accepted and honored

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:48.790
as an equal among elders, among
other adults in this society?

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.700
And who or what is
going to help me

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.960
across that threshold
of adolescence or young

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.540
adulthood into older
adulthood or more maturity?

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.875
And in fact, am I
still on that journey?

00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:06.820
So even though you all didn't
raise your hands for those,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:13.050
my guess is that those
questions hit reasonably deep.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.590
So the question that
I ask myself now

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.310
is where can young people get
answers to these questions?

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.350
Who is out there to
support them in uncovering

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.840
answers to these
questions for themselves?

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.960
And then, the biggest
question I've asked myself

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.250
is, are rites of passage and
mentorship the missing link

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.140
in youth development?

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.660
In a sense, what I would
call the unifying field

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.615
theory of youth development,
almost a silver bullet perhaps.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.540
So this is the bucket of
challenges that's facing us.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.030
You saw some of
that in the film.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.800
No one is really
connecting the dots

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.210
and considering that
initiation and mentorship--

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.590
which by the way, I think of
as two halves of one whole.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.109
Membership is required
before, during,

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:10.349
and after any kind of initiation
or rite of passage process.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:14.060
That's just one set of problems,
there's also another problem.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.250
If we don't initiate girls
and boys when they're young,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.344
they grow up and they
live out their lives

00:17:20.344 --> 00:17:23.050
in suspended adolescence.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.619
And yeah, Charlie Sheen is the
perfect poster boy for that,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.330
but in fact, take a look around.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.790
We have adults, quote
unquote, "living out

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.760
their suspended adolescence"
in all kinds of institutions

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.670
across this country.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.500
Government I tend to think of
as Animal House half the time.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.090
You know?

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.675
It's a fraternity gone crazy.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.233
Corporations,
other institutions.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.372
So we're all paying
a price for that,

00:17:56.372 --> 00:18:03.790
for the uninitiated serving
in these capacities.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:09.380
It's interesting, too,
I was looking online

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.340
and I was curious
how old Google was.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.680
And as you may or may
not know, Google just

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.770
passed its 17th anniversary
this month, September 4.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.206
That makes Google a 17-year-old.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.310
So I'm asking
myself, well, what is

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.450
Google as an institution
doing to cross

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.720
this threshold of adolescence
into young adulthood?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.370
And frankly, I take it
as a very positive sign,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.510
the mindfulness program
that Tan-- that's

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.290
his last name, right, Tan?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.930
Meng, I'm sorry,
Meng-- started here

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.110
and that Bill Duane
and Mario and others

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:54.080
are implementing across
Googleland, around the world.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.870
To me, that's emblematic
of stepping into maturity

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.890
consciously and I really am
curious to see what other steps

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.110
Google might be taking
in the near future

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.040
to do this consciously.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.150
So long about now you're
probably asking yourself, well,

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.720
was I initiated into adulthood?

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.370
And if so, what comprised
that experience for me?

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:28.130
So for me, that journey began
when I was nine years old.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.960
My dad died suddenly
of a heart attack,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.050
and I say goodbye to him,
goodnight to him, one day

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.320
and he had a heart
attack in the night

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.950
and I never saw him again.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.340
So not only did I
not have any closure

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.620
with him, but on the
way to the funeral

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.321
my uncle-- his younger brother--
he put his hand on my shoulder

00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:52.570
and he said, well Freddie,
you're the man of the house

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.930
now.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.800
And I was nine.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.220
So the problem in that--
there's a lot of problems--

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.240
but one of them is how exactly
am I supposed to do that?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.570
And I wanted desperately
as a nine-year-old

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.320
to take care of my mother,
to take care of my older

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.910
sister and my younger
brother, but I

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.090
had no way of knowing
how to do that

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.630
and how to grow into
that responsible man

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.100
that I wanted to
be in my lifetime.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.440
And of course saying it
doesn't make it real, right?

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.730
I needed initiation,
I needed education

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.100
about becoming the man
that I wanted to become.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.970
So in my teen years, I got
way into drugs and alcohol

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.360
and fortunately survived
it without hurting myself

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.280
or anybody else.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.970
Which is a typical
experience for a lot

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.640
of teens unconsciously--
in my view--

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.530
seeking that experience
of initiation,

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.800
wanting to push
themselves to the edge,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.740
but not having societal
mechanisms to hold

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.830
them and keep them safe.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:09.200
So I never got that
mentorship, my uncle

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.190
didn't stick around to
show me how to become

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.430
that man that I wanted to be.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.320
I never got it from
many other men,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.570
they weren't there in my life.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.810
Fortunately, I did have--
starting in my late '20s--

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.500
a mindfulness practice.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500
And it started with Buddhism, as
I practiced Buddhism and I did

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.030
a chanting practice,
and then it eventually

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.720
lead to long meditation
retreats, a daily meditation

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.890
practice, and now it's really
one of the fundamental pillars

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.670
that holds up my life along
with so-called men's work

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.040
and this rites of passage work.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.820
The two of them
together are really

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.730
what sustain me in my lifetime.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.190
So you might be thinking
for yourself, well,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.700
what is it that sustains me?

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.080
And what was, or did I
have a rite of passage?

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.210
So for me, I finally
had it as I was

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.340
approaching my 40th birthday.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.050
It was almost exactly
20 years ago in Chicago

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.900
that I took a weekend workshop
with a group called The ManKind

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.430
Project, a workshop called The
New Warrior Training Adventure.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.340
48 hours, you come at
5:00 PM on a Friday

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.930
and leave at 5:00
PM on a Sunday.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.050
And I finally had
that experience

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:35.250
that I so unconsciously
craved as a teen.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.190
And it taught me a number of
really fundamental things.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.530
It taught me about
accountability and integrity.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.490
As a young boy, I
intuitively knew

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.810
I wanted to be a man
who could walk his talk,

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.900
that when I said something
it was going to happen,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.310
and people could
rest assured in that.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.950
But I didn't know how
to make that happen,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.900
and I also didn't know
what to do in the case

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.990
where I had to renegotiate
some agreement.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.270
So that's something that
I learned on that weekend,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.050
was about how to walk my talk,
how to be a man of integrity,

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.500
and how to exercise
accountability

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.710
in my ongoing daily life.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.800
Another thing it taught
me was about emotions,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.520
about how not to
fear my emotions

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.460
or hide my emotions,
but actually how

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.690
to learn to recognize
them and to integrate

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.310
them effectively
and meaningfully

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.040
in my ongoing life.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.690
And for most of us-- as men
especially in this culture--

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.710
obviously that is
something we are not

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.170
taught by the dominant
culture, right?

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.260
If we're given any outlet
at all for our emotions,

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:49.670
it's usually anger
and that's about it.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.180
So that was a
revelation for me--

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.040
huge-- that I could actually
access some of these things

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.130
like fear, like grief,
like anger, and use them

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.790
as energizing tools to
live the life that I

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.604
wanted to live as a man.

00:24:06.604 --> 00:24:08.020
The other thing
it taught me about

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.300
was what we call shadows, which
is a neo-Jungian term-- Carl

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.155
Jung, the Swiss philosopher
and psychologist.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.790
Shadows are the dark
side that's in all of us.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.580
Every human being has a
dark side, all of that

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.810
that we hide, repress, and deny,
that we do not want to admit

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.420
is true for the
beings that we are.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.880
So it took 50 strong men
on this weekend workshop

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.540
to basically hold up a mirror
to me and say, take a look.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.270
This is you, too, and you need
to own these parts of yourself.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.710
And if you don't, you're
going to be dangerous.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:50.950
Because what happens is if
we don't acknowledge and own

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.970
the shadows that are in each of
us, they'll leak out sideways.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.250
And before you know
it, we'll be beating up

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:03.780
on children or domestic partners
or abusing ourselves, again,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.240
through drug and alcohol abuse.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.840
Whatever it looks like,
whatever form it takes,

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.300
that shadow-driven
behavior comes

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.770
from some fundamental
misunderstanding

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.090
of who we are as human
beings-- a lie, if you will,

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.000
that we took on
when we were young.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.100
I'm not good enough,
I'm not worthy,

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.500
I don't deserve success,
I don't deserve happiness.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.040
We all-- in a sense--
carry some of these lies.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.680
So the other thing-- a
number of other things

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.138
that it taught me--
but one of them

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:38.080
was how to live in a community
of men cooperatively rather

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.720
than competitively.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.080
I had no idea that was possible.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.400
Being a child of this
dominant culture,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.140
I thought, well, men
are supposed to compete.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.950
They're supposed to compete for
scarce resources, jobs, money,

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.520
women, whatever.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.280
To experience men
in that environment

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.720
where I could actually see
and touch-- if you will--

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.340
their open, vulnerable
hearts and have them do

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.340
the same with mine, was huge.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.100
It also taught me a little bit
about my mission or my life

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.350
purpose.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.910
And everybody has
one, in my belief,

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:15.000
they just need to be
supported in finding it.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.100
And that's something way
bigger than your job or even

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.890
your career, it's fundamentally
what you're here on the planet

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.280
to do, to accomplish
with your lifetime.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.380
And lastly, it taught me
how the meaning of life

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.956
is to be found in service
and not in consumption.

00:26:33.956 --> 00:26:36.080
And that's, of course, the
dominant message, right?

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.780
Despite what the
bumper sticker says--

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.630
whoever dies with
the most toys wins--

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.550
we're actually here to serve
and support each other.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:50.900
And the big
undelivered information

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.230
from the dominant culture
is that's actually

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.070
where happiness lies.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.310
That we'll actually be
happier as human beings

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.520
if we can see the impact of
our actions on those around us

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.760
and how it's making
their lives better.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.670
So that's where I first
learned that lesson.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.760
So those are just some of the
lessons that rites of passage

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.650
teaches.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.610
Now you just saw this
definition in the movie,

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.620
so I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on it,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.040
but I just want to go back over
a couple of key parts of it.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.210
So you know the
old maxim is true,

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.650
that it takes a whole
village to raise a child.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.960
Parents can't do it alone.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.950
And doing so-- reaching out
as a parent to a neighbor

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:40.480
or to a coach or to a teacher
or a friend of the family--

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.390
actually helps rebuild this torn
and broken fabric of community

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.370
that we all suffer from
in this modern world.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:52.360
Broken and torn communities.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.760
So that's one key thing.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.480
The other is perceived to
be transformative by youth.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.470
It's not for us as adults
to say, OK, you've arrived,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.910
you're a young adult now, you're
a man now, you're a woman now.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.660
We need to have
them evidence this,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.595
and they don't do it through
language by and large,

00:28:13.595 --> 00:28:14.720
although that's part of it.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.950
They say wow, I
can't believe what

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.850
I've just experienced but man,
I am a different human being.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.240
That's great, but we need
to see it in their eyes.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.690
Alive.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.631
We need to see it in
their body movements.

00:28:29.631 --> 00:28:31.880
There's some excitement,
there's some aliveness there,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.010
and some groundedness
there, too.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.800
So the other thing is
offer increased status.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.160
They need to know
that they've arrived,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.300
they're equals now
with us as adults.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:52.480
And voting, drinking, driving,
having sex, they're not enough.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.580
We need to ritually consecrate
these moments in time,

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.780
and ideally come
together as community

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:03.770
to celebrate and acknowledge the
learnings, the education that

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.670
has preceded it, that has
justified this moment where

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.250
we can celebrate these young
people for this passage.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.760
It's fundamental.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.160
So there's three main stages,
really, of rites of passage.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.440
And this all comes
from Arnold van Gennep,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.360
who wrote about this
over 100 years ago.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.160
Separation or descent
is really one.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.780
We have to separate young
people from everything

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.700
that is familiar to
them and yes, that

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.990
includes computers and
cell phones and TVs

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.670
and all the rest of it.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.930
We have to separate
them from the patterns

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.550
that establish their
daily life-- sleep,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.165
food, maybe even dress.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.320
And it's also called descent
because it's dropping.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.930
It's dropping into what
we are fundamentally

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.680
as human beings, that
all of that other stuff--

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.010
the trappings of daily
modern life-- obfuscate,

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:03.320
cloud, make difficult to see.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.130
So then the key part--
the ordeal or threshold--

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.990
it's also called
liminality, that word

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.640
that means sort of Twilight
Zone between the worlds.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.810
So there has to be
some kind of ordeal

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:23.360
where the young person is
challenged-- physically,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.530
mentally, spiritually,
emotionally.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.110
They're brought down into
the depths of their being

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.030
and they can experience--
at a fundamental level--

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.555
just how actually resilient
they are, how strong they are.

00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:39.305
They won't know this
until they're tested.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.190
And then the reintegration or
homecoming, as it's called.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:48.020
So you have to come back
from this experience,

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.180
you have to be-- again--
ritually welcomed,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.430
celebrated by your
community and family,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.970
and you have to be
reintegrated so that what's key

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.530
here is the learning, the
learning about who you

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.000
are as a unique individual,
the gifts that you have.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.090
The elders, ideally,
will help you

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:08.700
understand what
those gifts are so

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.710
that you can integrate
them into the community

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.470
and start to give them freely.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:18.730
Because a gift ungiven is a
gift that almost doesn't exist.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:22.630
It has to be given
to those around.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.230
So what does this look
like for an average teen?

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.410
Well, adolescents have to
confront two base fears.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.190
One is leaving
mom and dad, home.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.670
No one wants to do
that, why should you?

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.680
You get three meals
a day, ideally, you

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.220
have a roof over your
head, you're taken care of.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.050
You have to be-- in
a sense-- forced away

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.000
from that relationship.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.900
Some writers on
this subject matter

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.650
call it cutting that
second umbilical cord.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.460
That second umbilical
cord, the one

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.180
that happens at the
end of adolescence.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:03.240
That has to be cut and it's
not happening now in society.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.190
We'll return to that subject.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.540
So the other thing, there
has to be-- at some level--

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.900
a facing of death.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.450
And the simple truth is it's
bad enough, challenging enough--

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.450
and some of you, I'm sure,
have experienced this

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.020
like I have one-- when somebody
close to you in your family,

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.010
somebody dear to you has died.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.480
That, in a sense, can be a
beginning of a rite of passage.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.260
If you have the proper
mentorship from an elder,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.900
they can help you
understand what

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.650
is the meaning of this moment
in time in your lifetime?

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.230
I didn't have that when I was
nine years old, from my uncle

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.500
or anybody else.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.940
But even more than that,
we have to understand

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:46.250
our own mortality,
the fragility and yet

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.920
the preciousness of
this very sacred thing

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.180
of our own human life.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.650
And until we're brought
into proximity with death,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.640
until we at least fear
that we're going to die,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.710
we're not going to
experience that.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.210
It's not going to happen.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.570
We'll unconsciously fear
it the rest of our lives,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.150
but we won't know in
our hearts and souls

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.970
what our capacity is
to withstand challenges

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.240
and to face death.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:20.170
So the ordeal-- in a sense,
what's called for here

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.920
is the young person
needs to metaphorically

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.750
die to their childhood self
to be reborn as an adult.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.210
And then the reintegration--
one of the key lessons that's

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.170
a part of rite of passage
that needs to be brought back

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:40.140
into community is every
child and every adolescent

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:45.380
tends to see the world in
a me, me, me kind of way.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.730
And to be a
fully-mature adult, it

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.570
requires us to see
things as us, us, us.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.570
We need to do it
together, because

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:57.965
without that cooperation,
there is only domination.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.470
So there's lots of different
forms of rites of passage

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.970
that still exist
around the world,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.290
these are just some of them.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.330
And it's interesting
because all of the damage

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.139
that we've done to
indigenous cultures

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.070
around the world who have
understood for thousands

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.692
of years-- the African
proverb that you saw

00:34:25.692 --> 00:34:26.900
at the beginning of the film.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.719
"If we do not
initiate the young,

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.889
they will burn down the
village to feel the heat."

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.820
It's a beautiful proverb.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.770
Indigenous cultures-- in their
own way across the globe--

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:42.639
have understood this,
have understood this.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:52.420
So it's interesting because some
of what has survived in time

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:57.130
are some of these ceremonies,
some of these processes.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:01.070
But I'm curious, are any of
you Jewish out there like I am?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.020
OK, I don't know
about you, but when

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.340
it was my friends'
time for bar mitzvah

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.930
there was one
question that came up.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.550
What did you get?

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.830
What did you get?

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.810
It was not, how are
you transformed?

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.010
Are you a different being?

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.720
Do you feel like a man now?

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.700
And that's just
an example of how

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.040
so many of these processes that
still have survived to this day

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.190
have been co-opted
by consumer culture,

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.890
and they've lost that
essential potency

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.120
that's required to drive
transformation and make

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.210
it happen.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.430
There's a couple of other
key fundamental lessons--

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:45.050
in my experience-- that result
as a process of healthy rite

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.350
of passage or initiation.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.770
Knowing your place in the
cosmos is one of them.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.790
There's a fundamental
paradox that's

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.700
I think at the essence of
every human life, and that is--

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.800
and I was reminded of that
a couple days ago when

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.420
I was watching the beautiful
blood moon in the eclipse,

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.930
I don't know if any
of you saw that-- how

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.990
small and insignificant
we are at one level,

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.740
in the greater
scheme of the cosmos.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.420
We are specks of dust.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.210
But the other half of
that paradoxical equation

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.620
is that each of us is
immeasurably powerful.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.790
Immeasurably, and that there's
literally no limit to what

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:31.720
we can manifest and how
we can impact and change

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.210
the lives of those around us.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:38.070
So holding that paradox-- and
in fact experiencing it almost

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.310
in the bodily way--
is a fundamental part

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.930
of a healthy rite of passage.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.140
So knowing that you're
part of the web of life

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.070
is also a part of that.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:53.370
That you don't exist apart from
trees and rocks and waters.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.460
We don't exist.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.230
Knowing your mission
or life purpose.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.560
I already spoke to that.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.600
Another way of saying that,
again, is gifts or medicine.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.730
Beautiful terms.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.010
Knowing the depths of your
physical and mental capacities.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:11.376
Again, I think that's part of
why young people put themselves

00:37:11.376 --> 00:37:12.000
through trials.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.280
Well, let's see if we
can drink, let's see

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.510
if we can drink three
cases in about 10 minutes.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.110
Unconsciously, I think that
part of the drive toward that

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.730
is seeing, what is the
limit of this physical body?

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.110
Emotions and how to handle them.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.120
I just myself did
another rite of passage--

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.880
if you will-- a
Vision Quest, and I

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.490
spent four days up
in the Eastern Sierra

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:47.380
at about 10,000 feet in a
mountain desert fasting.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.580
It was about 100 degrees
every day, and believe me,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.250
all kinds of emotions came up.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.490
So it gave me an
opportunity again

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:02.090
to look at fear, to look a grief
that surfaced as I recollected

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:07.770
and thought back on mistakes
that I've made in my lifetime,

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:11.430
to look at all of my
emotions and to reintegrate

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:15.510
them and understand
them and not fear them.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.150
Again, service to community.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:22.430
That's an essential component,
as well as self-empowerment.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:27.450
So imagine-- if you will--
that we live in a society

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.566
where all teens have a deep
sense of purpose for their life

00:38:31.566 --> 00:38:33.565
and they're connected to
their deepest passions.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.720
Imagine that we live in a
world where all teens know

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.430
their physical, mental,
spiritual, and emotional limit,

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:48.130
so they don't have to seek them
through unconscious trials.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.280
And imagine all teens know the
rights and responsibilities

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.430
of adulthood, and feel
welcome and accepted

00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:58.860
by elders, by older adults.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.410
And imagine that they're
actually stakeholders

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.510
in their community,
deeply invested

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.110
in a community that's thriving.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.690
I think that's part of the
reason I live in Oakland,

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.880
and I think that's part of
the reason why we have so

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.000
many disaffected young people.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.550
Nobody's coming up to
them saying, I see you,

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.610
I see the brilliance that you
carry, I see some of the gifts

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:20.520
that you have.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.500
Please offer them, bring
them into our community,

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.810
you are a stakeholder here.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.120
And give them the room
to start to manifest

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.680
some of that brilliance.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.630
We don't do it.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.040
So imagine, too,
that all parents

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.610
know when it's their time to
let their young people go forth

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.790
on their own.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.700
This is a problem,
like I said before.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:51.900
And yes, I get it, it's
partly an economic issue.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.630
It's really, really
tough now for most people

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:59.830
in their '20s to get good jobs,
to find decent-paying work.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.170
And it's especially tough--
interestingly enough--

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.430
for boys, for young men,
at an almost two to one

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.200
ratio to women.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:16.110
But in addition to that, there's
no dominant cultural support

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.190
for parents to say, you have
got to turn your young person

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.870
loose.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.300
Otherwise, they won't
manifest their own greatness,

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.040
they won't reach their
potential as human beings.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.917
I gave a talk about a year
ago in North Carolina,

00:40:29.917 --> 00:40:32.000
and there was a woman who
came up to me afterward.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.860
She said, I'm so glad to
hear your talk because I

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.720
kick my kids of the
house at 18 and I just

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.460
felt like they really needed it.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:46.320
And my point is not to condone
or condemn-- I don't know her

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.502
and I don't know her
kids or her situation,

00:40:48.502 --> 00:40:50.710
whether it was the right
choice of the wrong choice--

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.700
but what I do know is there's
no cultural support for her.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.330
There's no community
support for her

00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.560
in making that choice,
in affirming that choice

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.200
or saying no, maybe
it's too early,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.835
maybe they need
another couple years.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.720
And lastly, imagine no
more suspended adolescents

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.720
running the country.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.180
How sweet would that be?

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.200
It's interesting
because it makes

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.310
me reflect on John Boehner
and his stepping down

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.770
from Animal House.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:29.850
I actually think that was
a very moral, and in fact,

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.910
and noble decision
on his part to make.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:37.430
And I saw it as a
real culmination

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.590
in a way of his own
rite of passage,

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.150
in trying to run herd over
this thing called Congress

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.342
over the last few
years where so many

00:41:44.342 --> 00:41:46.800
of the members of his own party
are giving him the greatest

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.790
grief.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:52.940
He's like, no, enough, I'm
going to step away from this.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:58.050
We could go into that, but I
don't have time for it now.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.010
So ultimately, young
people have to find a way

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.550
to live their dreams,
heal their spirits,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.652
and to change the world.

00:42:07.652 --> 00:42:09.360
We need to give them
those opportunities.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.820
This I won't go into, this
is some of what we're doing.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.160
As I said, I'm about
art and service,

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:26.600
I am not the ideal selected
guy to head a social movement.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.410
And yet that's
what I found myself

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.180
doing because I didn't
see anybody else doing it.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.360
And I thought, this is
essential, we have to do this.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.110
So these are some of
the things that we've

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.460
been doing over
the last few years

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.980
to really try to reawaken
the adults of this world

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.520
to their responsibilities
to young people.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.140
So let me share one
last film with you

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.270
and then I'll close here.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:59.790
So this is the voices of
the young people speaking

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.234
for themselves about what
it is that they need.

00:43:03.234 --> 00:43:04.710
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.270
-There's so much struggle that
our kids are going through.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.454
-Kids don't have
the attention, even

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:12.620
from their parents, because
they're so busy working.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.742
-What's our world going to be
in the future, our generation?

00:43:15.742 --> 00:43:17.200
What are we going
to do, how are we

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.060
going to step up to the plate?

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.730
-We have the opportunity to
help other human beings out,

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.010
and I kind of feel it's
our responsibility to.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.815
-So I'll need to be
more giving and I'll

00:43:26.815 --> 00:43:30.200
need to be disciplined to
know what should be going on.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.820
-Sometimes I feel
like I need there

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.610
to be an adult for me to be
able to talk about it, you know?

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:37.550
About sex and drugs
and-- I fear it

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.800
because I don't know about it.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.480
-Don't be afraid to take risks.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.510
-It all starts with
one person, really.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.360
One person can change the world.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.780
-If you respect me--

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.690
-I will hear you.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:53.930
-If you listen to me--

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.070
-I will feel understood.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.090
-If you understand me--

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.750
-I will feel appreciated.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:59.257
-If you appreciate me--

00:43:59.257 --> 00:44:00.340
-I will know your support.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.520
-If you support me--

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.890
-As I try new things--

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.530
-I will become responsible.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:05.920
-When I am responsible--

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.610
-I will grow to be independent.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.760
-In my independence--

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.235
-I will respect you and
love you all of my life.

00:44:21.954 --> 00:44:24.940
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.630
FREDERICK MARX: To get us there,
all that's needed, really,

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.770
are community-based,
culturally-tailored rites

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.865
of passage and mentorship.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:41.580
And the promise that's before us
is that if we do that, then all

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.640
our young people-- in
their independence--

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.420
are going to love us and honor
us for the rest of their lives.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.220
So thank you, appreciate it.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.730
AUDIENCE: You talked about--
in the film-- regionally,

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.870
culturally specific
rites of passage.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.110
I was involved in a summer
mathematics program--

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.555
and I know maybe
other people here

00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:09.660
have been involved in the
first robotics program--

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.300
and there was those sorts of
experiences for people who

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.566
were mathematically-inclined
or technically-inclined,

00:45:16.566 --> 00:45:18.440
but that was a very
specific rite of passage.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.740
It wouldn't work for
lots and lots of people,

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.120
but it really worked
for those people.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.320
But what about those
individually specific rites

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.430
of passage?

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.160
FREDERICK MARX: Well,
that's absolutely-- I'm not

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.160
sure what you're asking.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.140
It's wonderful and
it's appropriate

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.270
and that was right for
you and that's great.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.890
But it sounds like
you weren't alone,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.120
though, you had a
cohort with you.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.460
All the better.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.200
Ideally it's never
an isolated act.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.810
We might be isolated
for parts of the ordeal,

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.910
but we always have
to begin and end

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.670
in integration with community.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:01.280
The more that you can experience
an ordeal in conjunction

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.380
and relationship with
others, the deeper you'll

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.240
understand your
interconnectedness

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.470
and the deeper those bonds
of love will be driven.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.820
So fantastic, great.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:19.730
AUDIENCE: My question is
basically around balancing

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:24.860
between the importance of the
individual and the community.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.410
I myself was raised Catholic
and I went through confirmation,

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:35.540
and it wasn't a very valuable
experience in my mind.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:40.390
So what I'm wondering
is how do you

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:45.650
ensure that these rites of
passage-- in some ways--

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:49.640
don't become codified
to meaninglessness

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.640
when everyone
around you is going

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.470
through the same
rite of passage?

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.350
Such that it doesn't
mean anything

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.931
to you because everyone else
is doing the same thing.

00:46:57.931 --> 00:46:59.680
FREDERICK MARX: Well
again, that gets back

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.930
to the definition of the
efficacy of a rite of passage.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:06.000
We need to hear the testimony
from the young people

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.030
themselves.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:10.350
They have to be the ones to say
I'm the proof of the pudding,

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:11.330
this worked.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.880
And if it didn't, then we need
to offer them something else.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.980
But that's the function
of elders in society,

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.707
too, because they're constantly
alert to the responses

00:47:22.707 --> 00:47:24.790
that the young people are
giving and they can see,

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:28.460
well, Joey's not really
responding to this.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.370
What does he need?

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:32.560
What do we need to
do with and for him

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.240
that's going to give
him a deeper experience?

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.830
So that's essential.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.840
And it's interesting, too-- I'll
use your question to spring off

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.110
a little bit-- it's both and.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.120
Meaning if you're
Catholic, great.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.700
Ideally we have
Catholic confirmation

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.470
as rites of passage that
are potent, that actually

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:54.430
do what they're designed to do,
to grow you into that man you

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:55.620
want to become.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.840
But we also have to
make room for Catholics

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.240
like yourself who say, I don't
want that for whatever reason.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.860
We have to respect that,
too, and offer them

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.970
something else that will
also give them an opportunity

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:10.110
to discover their
gifts, but maybe

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.202
outside of that
Catholic context.

00:48:13.202 --> 00:48:15.660
AUDIENCE: I know there was a
slide that mentioned the three

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:19.180
phases of the rite of passage.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.680
Is there any sort
of research more

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.800
specifically into
various things to do?

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.550
I know, for example,
there's a lot of research

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:32.550
with psychedelics, on
exactly how they help

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.340
and exactly what doses and how
to make this process something

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.840
you could almost
count on for people

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.890
who are dealing with cancer
or dying and stuff like that.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:44.140
But is there a way to
use research and science

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.097
to understand what these
tipping points are for people?

00:48:48.097 --> 00:48:49.680
I know it's a lot
of behavioral stuff,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.050
which then means lots of
people locked away for however

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.570
much time, and then lots
of funding to do that.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.200
But I think everyone would agree
depression's bad, suicide's

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.450
bad, binge drinking's
bad, and all that stuff.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.240
But to have the cultural
shift to understand

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.550
that it's something that
is logical and actually

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:11.050
really important and
good to invest in just

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:15.660
like college or everything else,
that maybe it's something--

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:19.490
Again, this shift away
from I think our approach

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.470
to drugs-- and the same thing,
an approach to rite of passage

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.640
is just a long change
to engender culturally.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.220
And just, I guess maybe, the
specifics around research

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.200
around that or the process.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.720
I think on one of the slides
you mentioned the YMCA, trying

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.820
to collaborate with them, but
just where does the rubber

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.860
actually meet the
road, and how to tip

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:45.890
people's perspective into taking
action and getting involved?

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.390
FREDERICK MARX:
Well that last piece

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.410
was a little bit different,
but the substance

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:54.320
of your question-- I
can say I'm sure there's

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.090
scientific evidence that
is in formative stages

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:03.570
around this stuff, but
this work is so new

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.200
that a lot of the data is
just now starting to come in.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.390
And it's coming in, in
very rudimentary forms.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:14.030
There's a group in San
Diego called Boys to Men,

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:17.140
so they have statistics that
verify that attendance goes up,

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.800
grade average goes
up, et cetera,

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:22.550
for high school boys who attend
their program, et cetera.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:25.760
But by and large, we're still
in the very early stages

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.090
of the scientific evidence
that you're alluding to.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.010
But the whole issue of
drugs that you raise

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:33.510
is also an interesting
one, because certainly

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.640
many indigenous cultures
throughout the planet

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:42.260
use psychotropic plants as part
of the initiation ceremonies.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.640
In fact, Iowaska--
which most of you

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.490
are probably familiar
with, it's come now

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.620
to North America
from South America--

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.160
was used fundamentally for
that purpose for many years.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.700
And there's also
Martin Prechtel,

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.570
who wrote many wonderful
books about Central American

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.390
initiation, the
native Mayan people.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:06.140
One of the things that he talked
about was how one of the first

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.010
exercises they would
do with the elders--

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.990
they'd take the boys
out in the wilderness

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.720
and get them drunk as
skunks so that they

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.700
could begin to experience that,
but in a safe and contained

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.780
way.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.450
So that's the best answer I can
give you, I'm afraid, for now.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:22.560
Do you have a follow up?

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.200
AUDIENCE: I guess just maybe
organizations like the YMCA

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.660
or actual behavioral research
in a university setting.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.466
Some way where the Western
mind or the North American

00:51:32.466 --> 00:51:33.840
mind-- and I know
every culture's

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.620
very different, even within.

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:38.050
There's micro-cultures,
obviously, within our country--

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.720
but to understand
in a pragmatic way,

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.510
regardless of your religion
or your family structure

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.610
or whatever else,
that these are things

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.380
that grade attendance goes up.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.970
And maybe it's leapfrogging
off that Boys to Men thing

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:53.510
but as opposed to
one organization,

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.840
that it becomes a
cultural thing that people

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:59.740
are aware of as being extremely
helpful-- that can meet

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:04.890
organizations like schools
and/or religious organizations

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:08.802
of all kinds-- and that
it's a human experience.

00:52:08.802 --> 00:52:10.260
The reason I ask
about the research

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.950
is there's something--
I think when

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.880
you push your physical
limits in a fast

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.490
or in certain endeavors--
that nothing else matters,

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:21.890
because you are feeling
things in a way-- in the fiber

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:23.970
of your bodyy-- that can't
be ignored regardless

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.095
of what you thought
before or anything else.

00:52:27.095 --> 00:52:27.970
FREDERICK MARX: Yeah.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:32.300
Well again, the
scientific evidence

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.180
is just in the formative
stages, but that

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.490
is part of the task of the
organization that I co-founded

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:42.120
called Youth Passageways, is to
begin to assemble and collate

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.050
all of these studies
and all of this data.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.300
But in addition to that--
and I went through the card

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:51.030
so quickly, I'll restate
it-- we at my company--

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.840
it's a nonprofit
called Warrior Films--

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.620
we have written six world-class
curricula or toolkits.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.880
Parents; high schools;
colleges and universities;

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.530
therapists, counselors,
psychologists;

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:08.300
youth development centers;
and faith-based institutions.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.410
So we're basically
offering them ideas

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.280
for curricula, how
they can implement

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.970
some of these practices
into their own cultures.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.720
So places like
YMCAs, for example.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.820
So please, go online and help
yourselves to these things.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:24.910
We're giving them away.

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.950
And there's a lot of
helpful tools in there,

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.990
especially if any
of you are parents.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.050
Most of you are probably
too young to have teens,

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.510
but at any rate, if
you know people who are

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:35.340
parents with struggling teens.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.010
And even the high
school curriculum,

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:41.110
we broke it down by job.

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.680
So teachers, there's
one set of ideas

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.620
for, administrators,
and also counselors.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.740
So this is-- yeah, enough said.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.910
Yes?

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:53.820
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up on that question,

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.220
you mentioned beautiful
things like creating

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.685
teens more connected to
their deepest passion

00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:01.530
and feeling accepted,
reaching potential.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.340
And you were saying
that you have

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.880
practical tools for parents
so they can actually know

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.720
how to support their teens.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.799
Do you have maybe a
few highlights or tips

00:54:12.799 --> 00:54:13.840
that you can mention now?

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:16.610
Like what are the things that
you suggest to those parents

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.715
to actually help their teens
to go through that process?

00:54:20.715 --> 00:54:22.090
FREDERICK MARX:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:24.340
Well in fact, the
parents curriculum,

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.570
it starts with them at
about sixth grade-- so 12,

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:29.740
13 years old.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.260
And for every year
for six years,

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.120
we have a whole set of different
ideas for things we can do.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.470
So one example that
comes right to my mind--

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:42.450
because I faced this
with my niece recently--

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:45.360
she just turned 16
in January and we

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.090
were trying to get
her-- on her own--

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.610
to take a trip out to see us.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:54.660
She lives with my sister
right outside New York City.

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.860
And that's one of the things
that is in this program,

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.450
it's designing trips
for young people

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:05.590
to experience the
world on their own.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:08.860
It can start with day
trips, just even walking

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.470
around their community
and seeing it, perhaps,

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:14.300
for the first time with
new eyes in different ways.

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.320
And building up to
things like that,

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.400
where you go
cross-country on your own,

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.180
the first time ever on
a plane by yourself,

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.430
and get yourself
to someplace else.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:26.530
And then to also
journal along that way,

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:30.280
so that they can begin to
track their own fears and then

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.880
their own surmounting
of those fears.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.277
So I hope that's a good example.

00:55:37.277 --> 00:55:39.360
AUDIENCE: I actually came
because I just signed up

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.010
to be a mentor for
the first time.

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:41.450
FREDERICK MARX: Yay.

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:43.616
AUDIENCE: So I came more
for a personal perspective.

00:55:43.616 --> 00:55:46.010
And I was wondering if you
had any suggestions or advice

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:49.030
for how-- as a mentor
on a limited timeframe--

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:51.360
I can actually help this
transition along given

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.240
that I can't create or implement
a specific rite of passage.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.990
FREDERICK MARX: Well,
I'll try to give you

00:55:55.990 --> 00:56:01.180
a crash course in what I know of
mentorship in a minute or less.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.570
First of all, you've
got to be accountable

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:05.890
to that young person.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.709
So whatever time you set to
meet them, you've got to do it.

00:56:08.709 --> 00:56:10.625
And if you don't, then
you have to renegotiate

00:56:10.625 --> 00:56:12.530
and be accountable for it.

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:15.140
Regularity is key, as you
probably already know.

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.140
Ideally once a week or
more for a couple hours.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:24.180
I use the 80-20 ratio, listening
to them 80% of the time

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.070
and speaking 20%.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:28.880
So many of us think,
OK, I'm a mentor now,

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.639
I've got to share
all my life wisdom

00:56:30.639 --> 00:56:32.180
and I'm going to
tell you what to do.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:35.530
No, it's about listening to
them and deeply understanding

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.110
where they're at,
and going from there.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:42.010
Just in that listening,
we bless them

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.110
through our kind and
compassionate attention.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.300
That is one of the greatest
gifts a mentor can bring.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.510
So that's some of it.

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:54.590
I hope that's helpful.

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:55.930
And bless you for doing that.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:58.590
In fact, that's my final
question to all of you.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:03.470
How many of you are
mentoring and how many of you

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.220
are being mentored?

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:09.280
Because that's how we reform,
again, the torn fabric

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.200
of community and that's how
we create links through time.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.450
That's how generational
links happen.

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.390
So as I told you, I'm
turning 60 in a few weeks.

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:22.820
Believe me, I still have
mentors who I can turn to,

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.780
to give me all kinds of
advice when I need it

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.180
and also to kick my
ass when I need it.

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.120
And I sure as heck
am also mentoring

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.680
a number of young people.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.590
And sometimes not young--
my age or even older--

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:36.640
but also offering
those that mentorship.

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.430
So I really invite you to do
that, because it's essential.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.340
And here's another one for you.

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.050
If you're not growing as
much as that young person,

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:46.570
something's wrong.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.780
Something is
fundamentally wrong,

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:53.010
because you need to be growing
yourself in the process.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:56.890
And if you're not, then you
really need to retool it.

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.950
Thank you all again.
