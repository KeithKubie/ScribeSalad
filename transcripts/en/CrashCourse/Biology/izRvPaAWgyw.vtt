00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.710
For the last 38 episodes
of Crash Course Biology,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.950
we've talked about how
to make an organism.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.420
And you know what I've
learned in those 38 weeks?

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.120
Putting a living
thing together is hard!

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.730
There are molecules that make
up organelles that run cells,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609
which come together
to form tissues,

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.300
which make up organs
that make up systems.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.140
And knowing this stuff
is incredibly important,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.050
because it shows us the ground
rules for being a living thing,

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.849
on this particular planet anyway.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.429
But still, there's so much
more to biology than that!

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.439
I mean, understanding how an
organism goes about its internal

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.739
business is great,
but it doesn't tell us much

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.550
about its place in our world.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.519
For that, we need ecology,

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.969
the study of the rules of engagement
for all of us Earthlings.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.660
Ecology seeks to explain why the
world looks and acts the way it does.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.559
Why the South Pole looks
different from the Congo,

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.429
and why there are mosquitos
all over the place

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.820
while black rhinos are
practically extinct.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.579
The short answer to
this question is:

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.010
because the world is crammed
with things, both animate and not,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.300
that have been interacting with
each other all the time, every day,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.940
since life on this planet began.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.750
The even shorter answer is that
all life and all of these things

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.680
interacting with each other
depend on just two things.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.159
Try to guess what they are.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.399
In the meantime, get ready, because
Crash Course Biology is taking

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.270
its final voyage outside the
body and into the entire world!

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.380
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.380
In a way, you can think of all
living things, great white sharks,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.729
pond scum, potato plants, as
molecules that react with each other.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.439
Each one of us organisms is pretty
piddling in the scheme of things,

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.930
just like a single oxygen molecule,
which we need to make ATP

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.079
to fuel our bodies.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.030
But it can't get
much done by itself.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.140
But if you get a million
oxygen molecules together with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.729
some other types of molecules,
suddenly they're unleashing

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.490
a googlejillion
megawatts of ATP power

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.590
to animate the bag
of meat that is you.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.469
This same principle
applies to organisms:

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.640
As you put individual
organisms together,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.590
they can interact with each
other and their environments,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.219
to create something larger
than the sum of its parts.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.549
And just as every organism has
a hierarchy of biological systems,

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.860
from molecules to organelles,
cells, tissues and organs,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.460
so too does Earth have
tiers of ecological order.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.460
Like, when a bunch of members of
a species are together in a certain

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.650
area, and they interact pretty
often, you've got a population.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.570
Population ecologists study why
populations grow or shrink over time,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.300
depending on where they are.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.960
When two or more populations of
different species live together,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.970
we call that a community.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.230
Think of an ecological community
as Mr. Roger's Neighborhood,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.680
but with the people
in the neighborhood

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.190
eating each other sometimes.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.300
Because that's what
species do when they

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.380
live together, they interact.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.350
Sometimes that means predation,
sometimes cooperation, and sometimes

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.160
competition for resources like
food, water and living space.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.010
So, a community ecologist studies
how the interactions between

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.720
community members and their
environment affect how many of each

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.690
species there are within a community.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.530
One level up from
communities are ecosytems,

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.180
which are made up of groups
of organisms in a specific area

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.130
and the nonliving parts
of their environment,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.390
like soil, water, and air.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.970
If you take a bunch of living things
and plop them down in one place

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.100
that has a specific mix of climate,
soil chemistry, and topography,

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.230
that's going to make up
one kind of ecosystem.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.910
But if you put them down in
a completely different place,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.550
they're going to work in
completely different ways to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.680
form a completely
different ecosystem.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.230
Ecosystem ecology specifically
explores how energy and materials

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.390
flow through an ecosystem,
and how the physical environment

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.610
impacts the stuff living there.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.220
Now, a lot of people
get ecosystems confused

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.350
with the next step
up: which is biomes.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.450
A biome, however, is where
organisms have evolved similar

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.970
techniques to adapt to a
general set of conditions.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.380
For example, a grassland is
a kind of biome, there are scores

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.030
of different grassland
ecosystems all over the globe,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.460
but the organisms in each one
have made similar evolutionary

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.080
concessions to all the
conditions that grasslands share,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.190
like hot summers, cold winters,
and not too much rain

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.110
but more rain than you'd
find in a desert biome.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.960
Other biomes include
tropical rainforest,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.520
tundra, deserts, and oceans.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.190
The only level above the
biome is the biosphere,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.780
which includes the atmosphere,
the whole earth and everything

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.670
that gets used by
anything that's alive.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.270
So, why do all of these many
levels of ecological activity

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.740
look the way that they do?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.490
Like, why do some organisms like to
live in one place but not another?

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.340
And what makes Earth's
various populations, communities,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.100
ecosystems and biomes
different from each other?

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070
Well, factors that determine
what a place is gonna look like

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.379
fall into two different
categories: biotic, or living,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:19.060
and abiotic, not living.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.939
Biotic factors include
stuff like predators,

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.719
as well as animals or plants
that provide either competition

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:25.740
or some benefit,
like food or shelter.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.389
Abiotic factors, on the
other hand, include temperature,

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.780
moisture, sunlight, elevation,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.719
elements that have nothing to
do with organisms in the ecosystem,

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.490
but which influence them just as
much as other living things do.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.180
Now, from these two categories,
the most influential factors

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.159
are the ones that living
things are most particular about.

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.699
That is, the things they need
most, but only at certain levels.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.319
And these preferences all
come down to chemistry.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.340
For example, almost all chemical
reactions that happen inside

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.199
living things are
governed by enzymes.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.500
They're the catalysts
for pretty much

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.620
all the action
going on inside you.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.449
And these enzymes are most effective
within a set of temperatures:

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.039
Chemical reactions within the body
slow way down when it's really

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.759
cold, and very high temperatures
change the shape of enzymes,

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.939
making them less effective.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.819
So temperature is one of the
major factors that determines

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.759
why animals live in certain places.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.520
And if you look at the places
on the earth with the most

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.590
biodiversity, or different
kinds of living things,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.749
you'll find that it's in the
places where the temperature's

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.080
within the ideal range
for enzyme function.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.939
What else? Well, everybody's
got to eat, at least if you're

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.169
an animal or a fungus or
some other kind of heterotroph,

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.550
so you'd think that food
would also be way up on the list.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.610
But actually, it's plants and
other autotrophs like cyanobacteria

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.870
and protists that are the
base of nearly every food chain,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.439
and they have to be fed, too.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.009
So again, it comes down to chemistry.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.800
The key ingredient plants need
for photosynthesis is water,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.189
which is also what
we need to burn ATP,

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.930
maintain homeostasis in our
bodies, and all that jazz.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.240
So the quest for food ultimately
comes down for a need for water.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.969
So, yeah: surprise! Water and
temperature are the two things

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.870
that organisms care about the most.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.990
Ergo, they're what ecologists
focus on when determining

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.169
why certain organisms hang out
in one place over another.

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.360
Together, these two factors define
every biome on the planet.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.569
For instance, a Saguaro cactus
has evolved to live in the

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.349
Sonoran Desert of North
America, which is super hot

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:10.759
and gets very little precipitation.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.159
So, the Sonoran Desert is full
of animals and plants that can,

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.029
just like the Saguaro, take the
heat and also the extreme,

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:19.289
face-crumbling dryness.

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.789
But if you put these animals
in the Amazon rainforest,

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.439
even though it's hot enough
for them, it's just too wet.

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.330
So, yeah, the things that
live in a biome are ultimately

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.180
determined by how much water
is there and the temperature.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.909
And in turn, these
inhabitants determine

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.439
how the biome looks,
called its physiognomy.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.330
So now, we are going to take
a look at all the different

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.800
types of biomes out there.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.439
There are places on the planet
that get lots and lots of rain,

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.590
around 300 centimeters a
year, and are pretty warm,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.240
around 25-30 degrees C on average,
which is Speedo-wearin' weather,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.529
as far as I'm concerned.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.840
These biomes are the tropical
rainforests, which generally

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.020
hug the equator and have unbelievably
high biodiversity because

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.889
everybody's wanting to get a piece
of that sweet tropical action.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.779
And then on the complete
opposite side of that scale,

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.059
we have the tundra, most of which
is above the Arctic Circle,

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.749
in Antarctica, or way up at
the top of some mountains.

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:12.860
Tundra gets little precipitation
and some well-below-zero temperatures.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.789
And what lives there? Not much.
A couple of mosses and liverworts,

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.460
maybe a few species of grasses,
some birds and a handful of mammals.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.439
The same goes for the desert biome,
where there's very little

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.439
rainfall and very high temperatures.

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:27.759
Like the tundra, without much water,
there can't be very many large plants.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.909
And where there aren't a lot of
plants, there aren't a lot

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.680
of other organisms,
even when temperatures are close

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.379
to what makes living things happiest.

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.909
Between these three extremes,
we've got biomes that require

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:40.680
more or less water, combined with
high-ish or lowish temperatures.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.860
These are your moderate
or temperate biomes,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.219
and they include temperate
grasslands, like what you find

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.229
in the North American prairie,
or temperate deciduous forests,

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:50.419
found over much of
Europe and North America,

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.580
and taigas or coniferous
forests, found across Canada,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.990
much of northern
Russia, and Scandinavia.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.979
So, if all these biomes in the
middle experience pretty moderate

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:00.370
temperatures most of the time,
the availability of water

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.229
must be what makes them
different from each other.

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.909
Some of these biomes have a
lot of trees, and as we know,

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:06.439
trees need a lot of water.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.360
So if you find yourself
in a temperate forest,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.960
it's a pretty safe bet that
that particular ecosystem

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.599
gets a fair amount of precipitation.

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.150
And if the Carboniferous
forests taught us anything,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.919
it's that having a bunch of trees
around changes the landscape,

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:19.939
the climate, and even
the geology of a biome.

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:21.879
If you don't have a lot
of trees in a biome,

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.349
it means you probably don't get
enough rainfall for their liking.

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:26.960
And without trees, more sunlight
reaches the ground and gets to

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.849
grasses and other small plants,

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:30.930
leading to more of a
temperate grassland ecosystem.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.190
And where you get grass, you get
animals like bison and pronghorn

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.700
and other ungulates whose digestive
systems are big fermentation

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.520
vats that process
cellulose all day long.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.530
And then when you've got
ungulates, you also get predators.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.290
All these animals are way different

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.410
than what you'd find
in a temperate forest.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.370
So, biomes are different, because
the plants are different,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.250
because the rainfall and
temperatures are different.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.680
But, of course, there are also
biomes entirely underwater.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.190
We can't forget that the surface of
the planet is three-fourths water.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.830
And since water availability
isn't an issue in the ocean,

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.750
marine biomes differ in things
like temperature, pressure,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.220
oxygen content, how much light
is available, and stuff like that.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.210
So, thanks to the science of ecology,
we know that the way the world

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.260
works can be explained mostly
by temperature and water.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.850
But this is just the beginning
my friends. Oh yes!

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.660
The end of Biology 101, maybe.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.450
And we'll always have that time we
spent learning and loving, won't we?

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.030
But there's so much more
to find out together!

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.510
How do living things affect the
climate, the chemical makeup

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.410
of the atmosphere, even the
geology of our planet?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.650
How do they affect each other?

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.480
And maybe more importantly,
how are we humans affecting all

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.190
of these things, and what can we
do differently to ensure

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.280
that we all get to keep existing?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.500
Join me as we get
to know our planet

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.100
on a whole new level,
starting next week!

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.950
Thanks for watching this final
episode of Crash Course Biology

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.630
and if you've been
with us the whole time

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.040
thank you for participating and
learning with us here at Crash Course.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.010
And of course, thank you to all
the people who helped write

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.980
these episodes, who helped do
these awesome animations,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.800
the people who filmed
and edited them.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.820
It really is a team effort
here at Crash Course.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.540
If you want to review anything
that we talked about in this

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.600
episode there's a table
of contents over there.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.580
And if you have any questions,
we're on Facebook, Twitter,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.199
and of course, in
the comments below.
