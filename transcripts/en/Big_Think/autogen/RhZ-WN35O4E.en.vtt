when the internet came out it would be

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
when the internet came out it would be
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600
when the internet came out it would be
provide everyone new fundamental tools

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610
provide everyone new fundamental tools
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.609
provide everyone new fundamental tools
to learn about the world around them and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
to learn about the world around them and
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.099
to learn about the world around them and
it would actually remove the censorship

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
it would actually remove the censorship
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050
it would actually remove the censorship
and information that we get before the

three TV stations and they were it was

was the reason it was actually created

by particle physicists working at

now is because thousands of physicists

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
now is because thousands of physicists
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900
now is because thousands of physicists
needed to communicate with information

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
needed to communicate with information
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.189
needed to communicate with information
without caring about where the source

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
without caring about where the source
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740
without caring about where the source
came from but that the fact that the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
came from but that the fact that the
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.600
came from but that the fact that the
source is is shielded is of course of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
source is is shielded is of course of
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.500

great concern

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
great concern
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149
great concern
nowadays in the political world among

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
nowadays in the political world among
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.830
nowadays in the political world among
other things and so we have to think

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
other things and so we have to think
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.000
other things and so we have to think
about ways that we can address that now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
about ways that we can address that now
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160
about ways that we can address that now
of course information providers can try

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
of course information providers can try
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410
of course information providers can try
and work on that too but we basically

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
and work on that too but we basically
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510
and work on that too but we basically
all have our own responsibility to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
all have our own responsibility to
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090
all have our own responsibility to
become our own filters we have and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
become our own filters we have and
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.350
become our own filters we have and
that's why it seems to me the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
that's why it seems to me the
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060
that's why it seems to me the
educational system has to provide those

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
educational system has to provide those
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520
educational system has to provide those
tools those filtering tools and that's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
tools those filtering tools and that's
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.899
tools those filtering tools and that's
one of the reason why I think science is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
one of the reason why I think science is
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.550
one of the reason why I think science is
so important because it's built in

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
so important because it's built in
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219
so important because it's built in
filtering tools it recognizes that we

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
filtering tools it recognizes that we
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.770
filtering tools it recognizes that we
all want to believe and the end as

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
all want to believe and the end as
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.060
all want to believe and the end as
Richard Feynman said the person you have

to question most is yourself knowing

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
to question most is yourself knowing
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170
to question most is yourself knowing
that you want to believe when you when

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
that you want to believe when you when
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490

you read something that validates your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
you read something that validates your
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200
you read something that validates your
beliefs you should be skeptical of it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
beliefs you should be skeptical of it
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940
beliefs you should be skeptical of it
and your beliefs and you should look out

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
and your beliefs and you should look out
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010
and your beliefs and you should look out
for other sources so we have to train

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
for other sources so we have to train
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.840
for other sources so we have to train
people that one source on the Internet

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
people that one source on the Internet
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210
people that one source on the Internet
is not good enough you have to search

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
is not good enough you have to search
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830
is not good enough you have to search
broadly to see if it's validated

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
broadly to see if it's validated
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
broadly to see if it's validated
moreover you have to empirically test

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
moreover you have to empirically test
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.149
moreover you have to empirically test
those ideas if claims are made you can

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
those ideas if claims are made you can
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980
those ideas if claims are made you can
look out and look at the data to see if

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
look out and look at the data to see if
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.440
look out and look at the data to see if
those claims are validated we all have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
those claims are validated we all have
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330
those claims are validated we all have
this new responsibility because we have

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
this new responsibility because we have
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.169
this new responsibility because we have
a sudden wealth of information to become

a sudden wealth of information to become
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.280
a sudden wealth of information to become
our own filters and I can't see any way

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
our own filters and I can't see any way
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.470
our own filters and I can't see any way
that we can move into a an Internet

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
that we can move into a an Internet
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.440
that we can move into a an Internet

tools to distinguish sense your nonsense
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.940
tools to distinguish sense your nonsense
and and for me that's one of the reasons

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
and and for me that's one of the reasons
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.170
and and for me that's one of the reasons
why I talk about science because I think

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
why I talk about science because I think
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.599
why I talk about science because I think
it provides us one of the key tools to
