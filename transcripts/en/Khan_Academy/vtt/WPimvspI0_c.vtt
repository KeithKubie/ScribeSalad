00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.480
Simplify 48/64 to
lowest terms.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.440
Let's see if we can
visualize this.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.180
So we have 64.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.200
I guess 64 would be a whole,
so let's draw a whole here.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.400
So let's say that's a whole.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.020
Maybe we're talking
about a candy bar.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.910
Let me draw the whole.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.230
We're talking about
a whole candy bar.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.790
That would be 64 fourths.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.230
It would be the whole candy
bar right there.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.360
And 48 of the 64, you could
imagine splitting this up into

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.930
64 super-small pieces.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.180
You wouldn't be able to see what
I drew here, but if we

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.090
had 48 of them, it would get us
about that much of them, so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.960
that would be the 48
out of the 64.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.370
So this whole blue area is 64.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.550
The 48 is this purple area
right over here.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.360
So let me write it over here.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.700
48/64, and we want to write it
in lowest terms, and we'll

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.110
talk more about what lowest
terms even means.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
Now, is there a way to group
these 48 or these 64 into

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.890
groups of numbers that
will maybe simplify

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.890
them a little bit?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.740
And to think about that, you'd
have to think about what is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.100
the largest factor that is
common to both 48 and 64?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.550
Or you can think of it
as what is their

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.230
greatest common divisor?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.640
Well, the largest number that I
can think of that goes into

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.650
48-- you could do it either by
just thinking about it or you

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.200
could actually write out
all of its factors.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.310
But if you were to write all the
factors for 48 and all the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.630
factors for 64, the one that
pops out at me as the largest

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.930
that goes into both is 16.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.860
So you could say that 48 is
equal to-- well, what is it?

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:53.770
It's 3 times 16, and
64 is 4 times 16.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.080
Now this is interesting.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.135
So this 48 that we drew in
magenta right here, we could

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.500
view this as three
groups of 16.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.190
So that's one, two--
let me make them a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.210
little bit more even.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.730
So one, two, three groups of 16,
so that's 16, that's 16,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.140
and that is 16.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.170
That would be 48.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.830
I could draw 16 bars here so
that we have 16 pieces, but

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.040
that's a group of 16, a group
of 16 and a group of 16.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.790
That's what 48 is.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.960
Now, 64 is four groups of 16.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.050
So we could make, if you look at
the 64, that is a 16, that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.750
is a 16, that is a 16, and
then that is another 16.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.585
These should all be
the same length.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.300
I drew it a little bit off.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.750
So what is 48/64 in
lowest terms?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.590
We want to write this in as
simple as possible fraction.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.390
Well, if we make each of the
pieces equal to 16 of our old

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.450
pieces, if we make this into one
piece, if we turn 16 into

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.790
one, then we are talking about
instead of 48/64, we're

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.310
talking about three.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.920
So this is one piece, two
pieces, three pieces of a

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.320
total of four.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.840
So this is going to
be equal to 3/4.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.820
And hopefully, you see kind
of a mathematical way of

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.890
immediately thinking about it.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.710
If you can factor this out and
you can actually factor out

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.510
its greatest common factor, so
48 is 3 times 16, 64 is 4

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.930
times 16, and then these
cancel each other out.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:42.430
view This is equivalent
to 3/4 times 16/16.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.810
This is the same
thing as that.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.290
And 16/16 is 1, and you're
just left with 3/4.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.520
Now, if you didn't immediately
recognize that 16 goes into

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.300
both 48 and 64, you could
do it step by step.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.440
So let's say we started
off with 48/64.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.680
Now, the key thing to remember
with any fraction, whatever

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.780
you do to the numerator, you
have to do to the denominator.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:17.589
So let's say we divide the
numerator by 2, we also have

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.470
to divide the denominator
by 2, so we could get 2.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.010
We know that these are
both divisible by 2.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.800
They're both even.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.160
So that would get us to 24/32.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.780
And we'll say, well, look, these
two numbers, those are

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.020
both divisible by 2.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.240
Well, see if we can think
of a larger number.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.830
Well, actually, they're both
divisible by 4, so maybe you

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.180
don't realize that they're
also both divisible by 8.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.770
So let's say you
did it with 4.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.800
So now we divide the top by 4.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.580
So we're going to divide by 4.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.680
We get 6.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.880
You have to do the same to the
bottom, to the denominator.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.520
Divide by 4, you get 8.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.880
So 48/64 is the same thing
as 24/32, which is the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.560
same thing as 6/8.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.140
And these are both divisible
by 2, so if you divide the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.170
numerator by 2, you get 3.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.860
You divide that the denominator
by 2, you get 4.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.030
And so this is the simplest
possible terms, because 3 and

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.400
4 share no common factors
greater than 1, so we're in

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.920
lowest possible terms.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.800
So however you want to do it.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.520
The easiest way or the fastest
way is to say, hey, 16 is the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.290
biggest number that goes
into both of these.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.120
Divide both by 16.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.400
You get 3/4.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.660
And really when you're dividing
the numerator and

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.770
denominator by 16, you're
turning groups of 16 into one

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.460
piece or 16 super-small pieces
of the pie into one bigger

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.480
piece of the pie.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.310
So this goes from 64
pieces to 4 pieces.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.630
This goes from 48 pieces
to 3 pieces.
