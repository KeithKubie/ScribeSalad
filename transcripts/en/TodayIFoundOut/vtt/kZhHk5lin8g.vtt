00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.710
Loch Ness is a long, narrow lake southwest
of Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.160
It is the second largest loch in Scotland
by surface area and the largest by volume.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.650
It is also the second deepest loch, at an
astounding 755 feet (230 meters) at its deepest

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.650
point.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.390
The water is dark and murky due to the high
levels of peat in the surrounding soil.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.630
The breadth, depth, and low visibility of
this particular loch make a prime environment

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.190
for someone’s imagination to run wild, particularly
when other lake monsters were plentiful in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.480
Scottish legends.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.440
The first recorded sighting of Nessie was
in 565 A.D. by Saint Columba.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.010
Saint Columba was an Irish missionary praised
for spreading Christianity in Scotland.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.011
On one trip to the highlands, he ran across
a group of people burying a man who had been

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.190
bitten by the monster in the River Ness.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.440
The Saint supposedly asked another man present
to swim across the river.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.070
When the man jumped in, the monster rose from
the depths and Saint Columba, invoking God’s

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.280
power, banished it.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.970
The story was written nearly a century after
the supposed encounter; but even so, it remains

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.690
a popular piece of “evidence” used to
demonstrate Nessie’s existence.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.680
The next recorded sighting happened over 1300
years later in 1933.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.580
George Spicer was out driving with his wife
when they saw a large creature walk in front

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.110
of their car near the loch.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.150
The creature supposedly had a huge body, long
neck, and they couldn’t see any limbs before

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.760
it lunged toward the Loch Ness.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.090
A few weeks later, a motorcyclist claimed
to have nearly run into a similar creature,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.560
describing it as a type of plesiosaur—a
prehistoric marine creature with four large

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.230
fins and a long neck, fitting the Spicers’
description.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.810
Soon, with the building of a road along the
loch’s coast, many more reports of sightings

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.200
of the monster flooded in.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.780
The 1933 sightings proved to be the beginning
of a long, fruitless search for the monster.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.850
The first picture taken of the monster was
in November 1933 by Hugh Gray.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.560
He supposedly saw a large creature rise above
the surface of the water and snapped several

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.920
photographs before it disappeared, but only
one photo turned out when developed.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.950
The picture shows a creature with a long neck
and a thick body, with four lumps at its side

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.000
which might have been flippers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.729
However, it should be noted that critics claim
that the photo is of a dog swimming with a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.050
stick in its mouth… not remotely frightening.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.560
Later that year, a man named Marmaduke Wetherell,
a well-known big game hunter, was hired by

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640
the Daily Mail to find evidence of the Loch
Ness Monster.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.030
He later found large tracks on the edge of
the lake and made molds, but the Natural History

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.500
Museum examined them and said they were likely
from a dried hippo’s foot which had become

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.500
popularly used as umbrella stands.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440
Wetherell was fired for failing to find any
substantial evidence.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.700
On April 21, 1934, the most famous picture
of the monster was published in the Daily

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Mail.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.400
The picture was supposedly taken by a doctor
named Robert Kenneth Wilson, but he didn’t

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.300
like having his name associated with the photo
so it became known as the “Surgeon’s Photograph.”

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.440
The picture shows, from a distance, the long
neck and head of the monster rising from rippling

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440
water.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.150
The picture is convincing to the untrained
eye, though critics, certain the photo was

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.610
a hoax, claimed it was everything from an
elephant to a diving bird.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.770
It turns out, the photo was a hoax. (shocker)
In 1994, Christopher Spurling, the stepson

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.610
of Marmaduke Wetherell, admitted to being
involved in creating a model of Nessie’s

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.610
neck and head and placing it on a toy submarine.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.500
The pair then took the model to Loch Ness
and took photos of it in the water.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.090
Wilson was then given the photos because he
was a trusted man, being a doctor.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.650
Wetherell was said to have come up with the
hoax because he was humiliated by his previous

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.380
attempt at finding the monster.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.980
Since then, countless videos, photos, and
eyewitness accounts have emerged claiming

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.620
to prove the existence of the Loch Ness Monster.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.890
In 1954, the first contact via sonar was made
on Rival III, a fishing boat.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.610
480 feet below the boat, a large “object”
was seen keeping pace with the boat’s speed.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.370
In 2011, sonar contact was made again by Marcus
Atkinson who saw an object about five feet

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.319
long and 75 feet below the surface.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.750
It kept pace with his boat for two minutes
before it disappeared.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.420
The sonar image has been examined and critics
have dismissed it as an algae bloom.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.930
However, believers have said that algae couldn’t
survive at 75 feet as it needs sunlight to

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.080
thrive, and as murky as the waters of Loch
Ness are, very little sunlight would reach

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.610
so far below the surface.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.740
Many other searches have taken place to find
the monster than those already listed.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.790
In 1934, twenty men sat at various locations
around the loch with binoculars and cameras

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.180
in the Sir Edward Mountain Expedition.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.200
They remained there from 9 to 6 every day
for five weeks.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.660
21 pictures were taken and examined, but they
were thought to be of seals, not a monster.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.139
In the 70s and early 2000s, Robert Rines conducted
a number of underwater investigations hoping

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.270
to find Nessie.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.370
His studies resulted in several underwater
photographs of possible fins and tails.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.999
However, in 2008 he claimed that, based on
fewer sightings and sonar readings, Nessie

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.080
had likely died due to global warming…

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.350
The most recent photograph was taken by George
Edwards in November 2011.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.550
Edwards claims that it is the most convincing
photograph yet, which perhaps shouldn’t

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.758
be too much of a surprise given advances in
easy to use and readily accessible home photo

00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:44.758
editing software.

00:04:44.758 --> 00:04:49.099
However, in this case, even other Loch Ness
Monster researchers have questioned the authenticity

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.090
of the picture, claiming the hump rising from
the water in the picture is actually a fiberglass

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.319
model that was used in the filming of a documentary
by National Geographic, which Edwards had

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.319
participated in.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.500
With all of the sightings and hunts for the
monster, Loch Ness has become a popular tourist

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.620
destination and interested parties can hop
on a boat and travel around the loch looking

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.710
for the famous monster.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.400
Of course, Nessie is discounted by scientists
as a myth, but people need something to do

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.650
with their free time and vacation dollars,
and this is perhaps at least more scenic than

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.219
traveling to the equator and paying to watch
the different way water spins down toilets

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.080
and drains depending on which side of the
equator you’re on.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.270
(Note: this one’s also a myth, but you’ll
be hard pressed to find a tour guide around

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.860
the equator who doesn’t demonstrate the
differing rotation of the toilet water based

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.599
on moving about a mile on one side of the
equator or the other.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:47.580
In fact, what hemisphere you are in has almost
nothing to do with the way water spins down

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:57.250
the drain.)
