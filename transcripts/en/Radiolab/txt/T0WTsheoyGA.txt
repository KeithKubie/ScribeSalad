Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. E. N. N. P. R.

Speaker 2:          00:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:28          Okay. So Robert, you know that like talking about music in a way that's compelling can be kind of hard, very hard, particularly the music you like. Yeah, exactly. It's really hard to sit to, to build a bridge. And so when people do it well, I just feel like you got to give them prompts.

Speaker 1:          00:43          And I just ran into a really great podcast that I think everyone should be listening to. It's called meet the composer. Uh, it's from Q2 music, uh, which is sort of the digital sister station of WQXR. And it's kind of what it sounds, you know, every episode they introduce you to one composer, but they do such a good job of seducing you into listening and maybe caring about music you wouldn't normally listen to care about that. I just thought, you know, I really want to play some of their latest episode for you because they just focused on one of my favorite composers, a guy by the name of John Luther Adams. Oh, the opera guy, John. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is John Luther Adams, different John Adams and the other guy I've heard of John Quincy Adams when he was a former president United States. Yes. This John Adams is a composer who makes music that sort of conjures these wide open spaces that kind of invite you in but also seems sort of indifferent to you and maybe might kill you. It has that kind of feeling to it. I am intrigued. Okay. So, so how does it be like we're going to speak to this guy, this and this? The, uh, the documentary begins, um, and by the way, it's hosted by Nadia Sirota. It begins, uh, with John Luther Adams as a boy playing in a rock band. Imagine 14 year old John in a cover band in New Jersey opening for acts like Buffalo Springfield and playing predominantly the three bs or the three base, the Beatles,

Speaker 2:          02:06          the beach boys.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Okay. So we started out as a cover band and I got bored with that and so did my buddies. And, uh, over time we started trying our hand at songwriting and I was a big fan of Frank Zappa,

Speaker 2:          02:37          Frank Zappa, the tee totalling 1960s and seventies musician and polymath with wildly eccentric tastes expanding from rock to jazz to European modernism. [inaudible] off as good as no should, contemporary classical pieces.

Speaker 3:          02:51          And on the back of Frank's early LPS, there would always be this intriguing little quote, the present day composer refuses to die at Garver Rez and my little rock and roll buddies. And I would read that and scratch our heads and wonder how, Oh, who is this for? Easy Guy, right? And

Speaker 4:          03:14          one day my friends take Einhorn was how much Jane through the record bins and a shopping in the West village and came across this album with this mad scientist on the cover with the great shock of electrostatic green hair, bushy eyebrows, stern countenance. And the title was the music of that guy for his volume.

Speaker 5:          03:39          So he bought it home and we were Alpha groups.

Speaker 4:          03:48          It just all sounds like a bunch of noise to me. Her, this desert, this ocean. This is forbidding mountains of, of sound. And I remember thinking, I'll never be able to know where I am in this. I don't know what to hang on to.

Speaker 3:          04:11          So your response to what is this music was just to immerse yourself. Give me more. Yeah. Which has always been my response to any new experience. And I often encourage young musicians, especially young composers, you know, listen to everything you can get your ears on, especially the stuff you think you don't like.

Speaker 4:          04:30          I started to realize, oh, okay, there's that repeated note on the oboe and okay, that's a landmark. They can grab onto that. Oh, and here's this place where there's sort of a, a tattoo figure, what the snare drums, and then these unisons stabs in the rest of the percussion. Gradually we began to learn how to listen to the forbidding deserts of rent.

Speaker 6:          04:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:05          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          05:22          Did that affect the music you guys were making? Oh, sure. It meant that the process that was already underway was just accelerated. We rapidly abandons the, the one four five chords and the backbeat and the four bar phrases and started discovering cage and Feldman in nine. Carol and Pauline Oliveros Wilson were coffers and on and on, so thank you Frank Salpa.

Speaker 7:          05:48          I love that. That was his response to music that you know, can be defined as very alienating. I mean for Rez is not easy stuff, you know, but instead of just writing it off as ugly, he was like ugly. How? Yeah, exactly. In case, just to skip forward a little bit, in the meeting composer hour from Q2, John Luther Adams goes off to school. He has a teacher named a, I believe it's James Tenney is one of his first big influences, but he goes off to school at Cal Arts and right afterwards he meets one of his next big end [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          06:22          Well, I had just left cal arts, hadn't yet gone to Alaska and I would take long walks in the early morning and again at dusk and I became captivated by this singer. Then I kept hearing deep in the woods and I could never find the bird, but I couldn't get enough of the song. I started taking notes. The birds became my teacher after James Tenney

Speaker 8:          06:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:00          and the result was a series of pieces that I composed between 1974 and 79 called simply songbird songs.

Speaker 6:          07:15          Woo

Speaker 2:          07:31          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          07:34          What was the translation process between hearing this bird song that you just couldn't get enough of and constructing a narrative in working with the bird songs? I just tried to take dictation. I try to listen carefully to the birds where they are as they're singing and write down what I hear. I'm not interested in accuracy because if I were, I just make recording and play the recording

Speaker 8:          08:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:10          I'm interested in what gets lost in translation because after all, this is music. This is perhaps a language that we will never understand.

Speaker 2:          08:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:33          also, there weren't very many field recordings available in those days, but there were some and I decided, no, I'm not going to use though. I really wanted to hear them and to learn them for myself. Now it's actually very different from the way I work much of the time. Rather than working with very specific details of the music and then building a piece up, I usually sculpt away the whole field of sound and I'll work with one big shape or image or color or atmosphere then that I have in mind that I can't quite hear, but I want to hear and try to hear that sense that, write that down as clearly as I can. And then all the moment to moment details of the music.

Speaker 9:          09:28          We're listening to excerpts from an hour from QT music, from their fantastic series, meet the composer. This one is on the, uh, composer, one of my favorites, John Luther Adams. No, after the a songbird piece, John is living in la

Speaker 3:          09:44          and he gets kind of fed up. I hated [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:46          Los Angeles the whole time that I was there. I felt lost and not in a good way. It was such an interesting contrast because it was one of the most explosive periods of my life in terms of, of discovery. But at the same time, uh, there was this kind of inner knowing like just felt lost in the freeways and all that sprawl city that seemed to just go on forever. It made me long for home, which I never felt that I had because we moved all the time and I had grown up here and there in equally homogenous suburban surroundings. So there was this deep in articulate hunger to find a place to which I might belong.

Speaker 2:          10:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          10:35          the place where Adam's belonged, it turns out was off the grid in wild open spaces.

Speaker 2:          10:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:47          I went north in the summer of 1975 so I was 22 that summer. And from the moment I arrived, I knew I'd found home. When you showed up in Alaska, what did you see? What did you hear that made you feel like you knew you were home? We're here to begin. It all really starts in the summer of 1975 when I first canoed across admiralty island, went into Glacier Bay, hiked on the Tundra of Donnelley. I eventually made my way to the Brooks range to the Arctic. You know, there was and still is in those places a sense of openness and space and possibility as well as danger. These are big places in which we feel very, very small and we realized that we're insignificant and the place doesn't care if we are there or not. And uh, the weather or the bear or the river can rise up at any moment and snuff me out. And you know, I find a certain reassurance, a certain profound comfort in that I was trying to reconnect with the larger, older world that we still want to have it, but that we, that we forget

Speaker 2:          12:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:31          then Alaska allowed me to feel like I was the only person in that place.

Speaker 2:          12:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:59          so in the summer of 1977, I visited the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and we flew over the crest of the parks range and Allan to the coastal plain, the Arctic coastal plain in there. And the distance was the ice Iceland. And of course the sun, even even in mid summer, the sun doesn't get very high on the horizon. So there's this incredible deep, warm, saturated light like the colors. And the shadows and everything just stands out. And then you get out on the Tundra and you lose all sense of scale. I remember one evening was a buddy. We are just so excited to be alive and out in that Arctic evening. Alight. And we saw this white rock out across the Tundra and this odd looking thing. And I said, well, why don't we walk over there? Why don't we hike to that rock? We hiked and we high. And of course the Tundra is not easy to walk on, but we kept walking, we kept walking, you know, the rock didn't get any closer. So we kept walking and then suddenly we stopped because the rock flew away. Huh? The Rock was a snowy owl sitting on the Tundra

Speaker 4:          14:20          and you know, it could have been a 12 foot outcropping of white stone. You just, you lose yourself in that place, in that light, into that endless space. And that's what I want in music. That's so beautiful. We're hearing bits from Q2 music's meet the composer series. This one on John Luther Adams. Continue in a moment. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:01          We're back. I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember Krulwich. This is radio lab and uh, we're taking a, uh, we're taking this podcast to present some music, right? I'm, uh, I'm foisting it on you, Robert, and on our listeners, but we notice that I'm not, I'm not, you're not running away scared. I'm, that's good. I take that as a sign of success and a, the excerpts that you've been hearing come from Q2 a wonderful series meet the composer particular hour that they've just produced on the composer John Luther Adams, who after he moved to Alaska began to make these amazingly huge, sometimes serene, sometimes violent pieces. And you know what I think about when I hear his work, I remember when I first encountered looney tunes and the way that the like them them has this sort of an inherent meaning to it. It feels like falling it the music of action.

Speaker 1:          17:50          Yeah. Bumping, bumping, tiptoeing. Yeah. Bonking all of these things have a kind of musical expression that feels almost like a physical language that we came into the world with and never had to learn. And when I went to music school, it was so difficult in dense because suddenly I was thrust into this world of contemporary classical composition and it was all about understanding the rigor of serial 12 tone composition, which is like you create these little mathematical systems that guide your choices. And I was like, I don't know what this has to do with music. I don't understand this. And then you hear it and you're like, I might, you can't pick up on it. I feel lost. You feel like you're literally in the forest. But then I encountered composers like John Luther Adams where it wasn't about that at all. Something more primal. It was about like the movement of bodies, you know, masses of sound, that sort of crescendo decrescendo waves.

Speaker 4:          18:47          Yeah. I do think of the sounds of musical forms and events as forces as natural elements in some way. And it may sound ridiculously grandiose or laughably naive, but I've always imagined that I might be able to work in a space that's just outside of culture. Of course, it's patently absurd. There's no way that we work outside of, of culture and these days, so many cultures. And yet as my friend Barry Lopez, the Writers' says, landscape is the culture that contains all human cultures. And, uh, I believe that everything we do, everything we think, everything we think we create, anything we are derived from the world that we inhabit, our language, our music, our, our minds, everything is, is shaped by this incredibly complex and wondrous world that we inhabit. So ultimately this major culture or dichotomy in a way doesn't exist, but it's been a useful conceit for me to feel that I'm after something that that is not, it's not part of a musical tradition. It's not specifically cultural that somehow more elemental

Speaker 2:          20:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          20:23          Where does music come from? How does a composer take an assignment like write an 11 minute piece for string quartet and translate those instructions into a concept, into notes, into a score for composer John Luther Adams? It seems almost like the transformation happens in his sleep. I try to resist composing for as long as I can. I really want to get at something essential

Speaker 3:          20:49          before I start manipulating notes, pushing things around. I try to hold things in my mind's ear as long as I can. It's a, it's maybe an inefficient way to work, but it has worked for me. I find that if I'm trying to remember, I'm trying to hear something that I can't quite name. It focuses my attention in a certain way and then I finally start composing when I can't not compose, when I have to write it down. I'm thinking about like the way that we are discovering how memory and the brain works and every time you remember something you're actually recreating a story. Yes. So I really like that you have an idea and you are continually remembering it. So basically you're making a lot of mental xeroxes of it over and over again until it becomes something which is so steeped in your brain stuff than it is. It is a piece. Exactly. So night after night when I lie down to go to sleep, I'm imagining this group of instruments in this particular space and what they might sound like and how they might move through the space physically and through the musical space of, of the piece. And it's repetitive. I'm doing it every night. At a certain point I lose it and I drift off to sleep.

Speaker 9:          22:16          That nocturnal composition process is apparently what happened with John Luther Adams. Most recent, most famous piece. This is a piece I literally tried to copy during our recent apocalyptical tour and it just won the Pulitzer Prize. Apparently John was, uh, spending some time near the Pacific Ocean and he would fall asleep to the sound of ocean waves and it seeped into his dream. And what emerged when he finally started to compose was this orchestral piece for three orchestras actually it's called become ocean. And what happens in the pieces that over the course of about 40 minutes, all three orchestras form these massive swells of sound. With these three huge crescendos, like massive tsunamis coming crashing

Speaker 2:          23:45          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          23:51          I'm talking about the title of the piece become ocean. John Luther Adams said, life on this earth first emerged from the sea. As the polar ice melts and sea levels rise, we humans find ourselves facing the prospect that once again we may quite literally become ocean.

Speaker 4:          24:06          Um, well here he is in a conversation with WQXR is Helga Davis. This is a global warming piece and I would say everything that I do these days is in some way, um, addressing the, the state of the world and the delicate and, and precarious position of we're human animals in the world. Um, and yet I will also have the other side of my mouth insist that it has absolutely nothing to do with, with current events or politics or activism and that music must stand on its own as music. And um, like I like to believe that we can have it both ways.

Speaker 2:          25:05          It is very, very outdoors. Yeah. And it's, it's without, it seems like it hasn't had people in it all as just openness. Yeah. Yeah. You're floating on the surface if you're there at all, eh, [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:34          one of the many reasons you should go to iTunes and download Q2 meet the composer hour with John Luther Adams is that they play this unreleased track of his string quartet called the wind in high places, which is just beautiful. Go to radio lab.org. We will link you to more information about meet the composers. I highly recommend this podcast.
