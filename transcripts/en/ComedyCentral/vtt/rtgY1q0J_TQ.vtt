AT A--AT A STRAIGHT WEDDING.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.242
- NOW, NONE OF US ARE GAY,
SO I ASSUME

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.811

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.613

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.326
THAT WERE FRIENDS WITH
OR THAT YOUR FAMILY'S MEMBERS,

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.830
- SO WE JUST GUESS WHO'S GAY.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.331

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.332

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.307
THIS IS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY,
SO YOU--

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.175
YOU WOULDN'T BE SINGING THAT
DURING THE SERVICE.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.509
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.877
- NO, I'M JUST ASKING.

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.345
- I'M NERVOUS 'CAUSE
I CAN ONLY DO JAZZ HANDS

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.114
FOR ABOUT THREE MINUTES 'FORE
MY HANDS START TO CRAMP.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.517
- OH, SIR, I DON'T THINK
ANYONE'S GONNA EXPECT YOU--

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.351
I DON'T THINK ANY--
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S GONNA

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:02.054
EXPECT YOU TO HAVE
TO DO JAZZ HANDS.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.356
- NOW CAN WE SEE THE PONY SHOW
FROM THE STRAIGHT SECTION?

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:06.025
OR ARE WE WAY
IN THE BACK SOMEWHERE?

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.061
- MA'AM, AGAIN,
THERE'S NO STRAIGHT SECTION.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.195
WHAT IS A PONY SHOW?

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.697

WHEN Y'ALL GO LIKE THIS.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:12.998
- NO, THERE WON'T BE--

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.700
THERE WON'T BE ANY OF THIS
DURING THE CEREMONY.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.302
- OH. OH.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.871
- WHEN DO WE SING<i>YMCA?</i>

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.474
- OH.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:22.641
- OKAY.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.844
- WHAT ABOUT<i>MACHO, MACHO</i>MAN?
- NO.

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.579
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO BUY NO GAY PRESENTS.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.548
- WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT A GAY PRESENT IS.

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:31.216
USUALLY, WHAT COUPLES
DO IS THEY JUST--

00:02:31.216 --> 00:02:32.918
THEY JUST REGISTER AT A STORE...

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:33.986
- HUH.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.388
- LIKE A STRAIGHT COUPLE WOULD.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.756
- THE GAY STORE, OR--
- JUST A REGULAR STORE.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.259
- WHERE DO YOU GET THE EUROS
TO BUY GAY GIFTS?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.560
- ARE YOU SAYING EUROS?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.329
YOU WOULDN'T--
YOU WOULDN'T USE EUROS.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.732
- NO, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, FINNEY.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.500
WE--WE SHOULD MAKE
SOME EYE CONTACT

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.736
SO WE MAKE SURE THAT
THE COMMUNICATION'S HAPPENING.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:51.237
- YEAH.
- I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.672
IS IT, LIKE, A--YOU KNOW,
A DIFFERENT CURRENCY?

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:55.441
OR IS IT MORE LIKE CAMEL CASH?

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.077
- NOPE, JUST GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
U.S. DOLLARS, YEP.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:00.112
- DO WE HAVE TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE ANAL SEX?

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:01.580

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.383
AND CHEER IN A FIREMEN'S HAT?

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:05.418
- NO, THERE'S NO ANAL SEX
AND NO FIREMAN'S HAT.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.553
- OH, OKAY.
- IT'S CUNNILINGUS.

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:08.787
- IS THAT A QUESTION, SIR?

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.123
- WHEN DO WE GET TO SING
<i> IT'S RAINING MEN,</i>

00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:13.426
<i> HALLELUJAH, IT'S RAININGMEN?</i>
- YOU DON'T.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.127
- SO THERE'S NO GAY HYMNS
IN THE CEREMONY?

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:17.930
- SIR, THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS A GAY HYMN.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.598
- WHAT?
- WELL, DOES THE FAKE PRIEST

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.768
LOOK LIKE A REAL PRIEST
OR LIKE A NUN?

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:24.770
- IT'S GONNA BE A REAL PRIEST.
- OR...

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.938
- NO, THERE'S NO "OR."

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.639
- IS IT A SEXY BOAT CAPTAIN,

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.808
THEN HE TAKES HIS CLOTHES OFF?

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.776
all: OHH.
- WHAT? NO. NO.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.378
- DO WE THROW SOMETHING
OTHER THAN RICE?

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.412
- LIKE WHAT, SIR?

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.081
WHAT WOULD YOU THROW
OTHER THAN RICE?

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.448
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:38.284
COUSCOUS.
SKITTLES.

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:42.555
- GUYS, A GAY WEDDING IS JUST
LIKE A STRAIGHT WEDDING, OKAY?

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.157
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:47.460
- WELL, WHEN THEY KISS, IS IT
OKAY TO STAND UP AND SAY, "EW"?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.162
- NO, IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT WOULD
BE--THAT WOULD BE HOMOPHOBIC.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:52.765
- THIS FROM THE MAN
WHO WON'T ALLOW GAY HYMNS

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:53.966
AT THE GAY WEDDING.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.770
- OKAY, BUT LIKE
A INVOLUNTARY GASP.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.306
- I WOULD JUST, I GUESS,
TRY TO CURB THAT BEHAVIOR.

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.974
- OKAY.
I'LL--I'LL LOOK AWAY THEN.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:05.010
- OH, MY GOD.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.013
- NO, I DON'T THINK
DELROY KNOWS RUPAUL.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.615
- UH, NEIL PATRICK HARRIS?
- NO.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.982
- OOH, DOOGIE.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:11.117
- WHAT IF YOU DON'T WANT
YOUR PICTURE ON THE INTERNET?

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.119
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
- EXCUSE ME, GARY.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.021
"RIDICULOUS."
IS THAT A GAY TERM?

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.822
- OKAY, YEP.
I'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.791

ISN'T HE?

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.859
