00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.920
As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,
I have to have music to focus.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.760
But I have friends who need *complete silence*
to study, write, or be productive.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.580
So which one’s better for our brain and our body?

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Let’s start by finding out what noise, the
opposite of silence, does to our bodies.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.880
Studies were conducted by the World Health
Organization that linked noise pollution,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.100
like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure
and a higher chance for a fatal heart attack.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.780
All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing
Migos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.840
but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment
can lead to cognitive deficits as well.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.160
Studies have shown that students in schools
near airports and train stations have suffered

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.060
negative effects on long-term memory and reading
comprehension, leading some cities

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.380
to require soundproofing in schools. 
So, noise may not kill you,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.160
but it increases your stress levels, 
which is no bueno for your brain long-term.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.140
Are you hearing this, construction workers
who have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.?

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.600
Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.420
Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated
with lower stress hormones.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.780
Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that
those exposed to silence over white noise,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.320
or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of
neurogenesis, or the production of neurons,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.400
in the hippocampus, the part of the brain
that processes memory.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.340
Further studies found more evidence that the
brain is processing and evaluating

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.600
new information faster in times of silence over sound.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.320
So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic
connections and memory formation?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.040
Sounds good for productivity.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.480
I know what you’re thinking: “but I do
my best work when listening to Evanescence!”

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.000
Me too. I love "Bring Me To Life."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.480
But be patient, we’re getting there!

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.060
Music permeates all parts of the brain; not
just the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll
activate your amygdala

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.780
and parts of your limbic system 
responsible for emotional response.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.920
What’s more, both music and language are
auditorily processed; both are forms of communication,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.159
and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider
music like a language.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.740
I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? 
That's from a different alien race.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.560
New research shows that there may be neurons
in the auditory cortex

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.680
that activate specifically for music; 
not language, or other random sounds.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.020
So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,
lyrics, and now there’s these new

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.980
other neurons firing, how much attention is left
to remember SOH CAH TOA?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.940
...I'm old.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.580
Science says...it depends.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.980
A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive
abilities if you’re trying to memorize

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.500
a specific order; it could be thrown off by
a key change, a lyrical choice,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.660
or Drake getting you deep down in your feelings.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.100
Even if you’re not distracted, a 2006 study
measured the effects of tempo

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.760
on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.260
Slow, meditative music can get us to relax,
slowing both your heart rate and breathing

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.940
but this study found that we’re the most
relaxed when there’s a wait for it...

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.380
...pause. See what I did there?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.940
So, silence wins?

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.180
Well, if your goal is complete zen relaxation
while you write that final,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880
then, yeah, try silence.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.740
But again, this all depends on a lot of variables:
lyrics, tempo, and genre have all been shown

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.940
to have various effects on focus, mood, and
productivity.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.320
But if you have to listen to that Randy Newman
to get those reports in, more power to you.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.780
If you have a work or study playlist,
go for it!

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.780
Verdict: do you!

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.940
If you’ll excuse me, I have to go listen
to some Celine Dion, because I love Titanic.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.420
♩ Near, far, where--- later, later.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.000

for everything scientists know about it.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
If you've got two cents
