00:00:00.518 --> 00:00:02.528
We're asked to move the orange dot

00:00:02.528 --> 00:00:06.967
to the number that equals five times 1/3.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:08.775
Alright, so one way to think about it,

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.825
we just have to move 1/3 five times.

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.033
So let's do it once,

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.488
so that's going to be 1/3,

00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:17.520
you do it twice, you get to 2/3,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.213
you do it three times, you get to 3/3,

00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:23.000
four times, you get to 4/3,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.529
five times, you get to 5/3.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.608
Five times 1/3 is gonna be 5/3.

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:32.651
Or you could say five 1/3,

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:34.933
which is the same thing as 5/3,

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.776
hopefully that makes some sense.

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.509
Let's do some more examples here.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.224
So let's say we need to figure out,

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.261
so let's see, it says move the orange dot

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.274
to the number that equals two times 4/3.

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:52.244
Alright, so one times 4/3
is just gonna get us to 4/3,

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:54.583
and then if we have another 4/3,

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.120
we're gonna add 4/3 to that,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
so we're gonna move
another 4/3 to the right.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.848
So 4/3 plus 4/3 would get us to 8/3.

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:06.210
8/3, I'm having trouble moving this, 8/3.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.318
So one times 4/3 is just 4/3,

00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:12.615
and then two times 4/3 is 8/3.

00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.600
And notice that's the same
thing as two times four,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.953
which is eight, over three, 8/3.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.184
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:23.189
So, move the orange dot to the number

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.296
that equals three times 3/2.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.443
So this is gonna be 0/2, that's just zero,

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:31.992
so you could do that a zero times 3/2.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:35.933
One times 3/2, well that
will just get us to 3/2.

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.743
Two times 3/2, we'll add another 3/2,

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:41.170
so that'll get us to 6/2.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.797
And then three times 3/2,

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:44.371
we'll add another 3/2,

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.813
that gets us to 9/2, and we're done.
