00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
So, the fact that we have society at all is
kind of amazing.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.959
Think about it:

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.250
People with different interests, different
amounts of money, members of different subcultures,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.760
races, and sexual orientations, somehow all
manage to hold together, in this thing we call society.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.020
A thing that, at least kind of, works.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.860
But it doesn't just hold together.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.070
Society has to somehow endure periods of intense
change without falling apart.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.380
Political change, technological change,
population growth, economic crises – all these
things can be massively disruptive.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.039
Sometimes we might even worry that the fabric
of society won't be able to take the stress.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:39.060
And it’s these questions of how society holds together, and how to understand when it goes wrong, that Émile Durkheim, one of the founders of sociology, tried to answer.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:49.700
[Theme Music]

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.200
You know who knows a thing or two about social
disruptions?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.460
France. Émile Durkheim lived in France from 1858
to 1917, which means that he lived almost his entire life
under France's Third Republic, founded in 1871.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.140
But, despite being the third republic, it was
the first stable republic in France's history.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.040
Between 1800 and 1871, France was governed
by two republics, two monarchies, and two empires.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.040
But the turmoil wasn't just political.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.740
France was also dealing with major economic,
technological, and cultural changes, as industrialization
took hold, and the traditional authority of the Catholic
Church weakened.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.540
Given all this, it should be no surprise that Durkheim
was concerned with the question of what kept societies
together, so that he could make sure that his didn't fall
apart again.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.280
And this was the task of sociology, as he
understood it.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.480
Sociology was to be a truly scientific study
of society.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.960
With it, we could understand its normal and abnormal
functioning, we could diagnose how it was changing,
and we could deal with the consequences.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
To Durkheim, sociology was to society what
biology and medicine were to the human body.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.220
He actually thought of society as a kind of organism,
made up of different parts, which all had to function well
together in order for that organism to be healthy.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:01.000
This basic understanding of society in terms of structures that fit together, and which function either well or poorly, makes Durkheim the founder of the structural functionalist paradigm that we discussed in episode 2.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.040
Now, if sociology was to be a true science,
then it needed well-defined methods.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.080
And Durkheim focused a lot of his effort on
this problem.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.440
He was committed to sociology as an empirical
endeavor.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.160
And his ambitious book, called “Suicide” is really
the first piece of sociological work to use statistical
methods as its primary mode of argument.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.200
Durkheim was also the first in the field to think in
terms that we now consider standard in sociology.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.520
Like, thinking about the problem of operationalizing variables, and puzzling over how intangible concepts, like social integration or solidarity, can be reflected in things that we can actually measure.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.820
And beyond this question of method lies an
even bigger question:

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.800
If sociology is a science, then what does
it study?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.280
Durkheim thought that any science needed a
well-defined object of study.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.490
And the object for Durkheim was the social
fact.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.230
In his book, “Rules of Sociological Method,”
he defines social facts as

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:55.600
"consist[ing] of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him."

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.100
OK, there are three things to highlight in
this definition.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.500
First is the fact that it’s really broad.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.580
Social facts include everything from political
systems, to beliefs about right and wrong,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.599
to suicide rates, to holiday celebrations,
and architectural styles.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.280
Second, notice that social facts are external
to the individual.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.820
This might seem a little confusing; I mean, how
can a way of thinking be external to a person?

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.560
But what Durkheim means here is that social
facts have a life outside of you or me.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.060
For instance, if you give gifts at Christmas,
think for a second about why.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.580
That’s not something that you came up with
on your own.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.520
Giving gifts at Christmas wasn’t your idea.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.781
It’s a social fact, with an existence that’s
external to you.

00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:36.319
If you don’t celebrate Christmas, the strength
of Christmas as a social fact in the US means

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.760
you’ve probably already experienced the
third thing I want to highlight:

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040
The idea that social facts are powerful, and
coercive, and they can make you do things
you otherwise wouldn’t.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.380
Don’t believe me?
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.150
Imagine a hypothetical family at a hypothetical
Christmas.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.430
None of them want gifts, and all of them have
better things to do than spend money buying
gifts for anyone else.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.940
In fact, none of them are even that committed
to celebrating Christmas at all.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.340
And yet, come Christmas morning there’s
a pile of presents under the tree.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.360
And there’s a tree there in the first place!
Why?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.960
Well, maybe no one was willing to say that
they didn't want a gift.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.660
Or maybe they all said that, but they each
bought gifts anyway, because they were afraid
that the others would too.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.160
The point is, the specific explanation for the
behavior in this family doesn't really matter.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.980
What's important is that we can see here the
power of a social fact, even in a situation where
no one directly involved believes in it!

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.100
If that's not an external coercive power,
I don't know what is.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.720
But this doesn’t just happen with gift giving
at Christmas.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.779
Social facts include all kinds of things.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.300
They help dictate how you interact with your
neighbors and how you relate to society.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.120
Social facts and their coercive power represent
a form of social cohesion, which points us
back to our original question:

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.900
how societies hold together
and how they can go wrong.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.280
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.660
Durkheim's answer to the question of
social cohesion is what he called the common or
collective consciousness.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.880
The common consciousness is basically the
collection of all the beliefs, morals, and ideas
that are the social facts in a given society.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.039
And, like with gift-giving at Christmas, these
beliefs aren’t necessarily held by everyone.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.140
They’re just the beliefs that hold coercive
power.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.240
They’re the ideas that people give life
to, in their interactions with one another.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.540
So, common consciousness holds a society together.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.500
But what are the problems?
What is social dysfunction?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.539
For Durkheim, if society is an organism, then
dysfunction must be thought of as a disease.

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.529
Now, you might think that something like crime
would be a social dysfunction.

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.580
But, by Durkheim’s thinking, crime can't
be a disease, because every society has it.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.710
So, you might not like crime, but some amount
of crime is normal.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.920
In the same way, you might wish you didn't
have to sleep, but that doesn't make sleeping
a disease.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.640
It's just a normal part of the way the human
body works.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.160
And just like sleep, Durkheim argued that
crime serves a purpose.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.939
For example, he said that crime helps strengthen
the common consciousness.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.999
To him, crime and punishment were a kind of
public lesson in right and wrong:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.860
When someone is judged and punished, that
shows us both society's morals and how strong
those morals are.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.180
Crime can also point to possible changes in
the common consciousness.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.140
When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat
and move to the back of the bus, she committed
a crime.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.560
But her crime set off a city-wide bus boycott
that resulted in the law being struck down.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.820
So crime in and of itself isn’t necessarily a
dysfunction, but, just like how sleeping 18 hours a day,
every day might be a sign of disease,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.529
if the level of crime in a society becomes excessive,
it would eventually stop serving these functions,
and the society could no longer function normally.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.680
And that’s what social dysfunction is for
Durkheim: something that impedes the normal
functioning of society.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.500
Since Durkheim is a structural functionalist, social
dysfunctions always have larger structural causes –

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.600
they’re created by some underlying
problem with the social organism.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.020
Durkheim applied this idea in his famous book
on suicide.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.100
Now, it might be strange to think of suicide
as social at all,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.480
but Durkheim argued that there was actually
a very strong link between societal structure
and people taking their own lives.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.220
And he found this link in a dysfunctional
aspect of his society: namely, in a lack of
social integration.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:51.640
When Durkheim looked at the statistics on suicide
in Europe over the 19th century, he saw a massive
increase, one that coincided with the shift from
traditional to modern society.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.480
Durkheim argued that traditional societies
– like, those of feudal Europe – were highly 
socially integrated.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.280
People knew their place in society, what that
place meant, and how they related to other people.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.860
But modern society, over the preceding century,
had suffered from a loss of social integration.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.460
The decreasing importance of religion, and of other traditional ways of thinking, resulted in a smaller, weaker common consciousness and a less intense communal life.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.319
As a result, people were less strongly bound
to their society.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.260
They didn’t necessarily feel they had a place
in it and couldn’t understand how they fit.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.779
This, Durkheim argued, resulted in a dramatically
increased suicide rate.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.060
Now, suicide is certainly a personal act,
motivated by personal feelings or psychological
conditions.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.520
But Durkheim showed how these personal
feelings were not purely personal, and that they
were influenced by the structure of society.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.600
In this case, he argued that the values holding
society together were being pulled apart,
and so people lost their sense of place.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.599
Feelings of isolation or meaninglessness could
be traced back to large social changes.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.449
And Durkheim, in diagnosing the problem,
believed he had a solution.

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:51.960
If a high suicide rate was a disease, Durkheim’s
prescription was to strengthen social organizations

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.569
– especially those based around the
workplace, because that’s where people were
spending more and more of their time.

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:02.540
He figured that these organizations – sort of like
workers’ guilds – could help provide people with that
sense of place that they were lacking.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:08.660
Now, many sociologists today see that Durkheim’s
work on suicide was undermined by the poor
quality of statistics at the time.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.980
But still, he used those statistics in new ways,
as evidence and tests for theories of society.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.300
And you can see in his research how Durkheim
tried to answer big questions.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.220
Society is composed of social facts, and bound
together by common consciousness.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.420
This normal functioning can evolve, but it
can also be disrupted by rapid change.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.500
And that, Durkheim believed, is where
sociology steps in.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.360
By studying society scientifically, and
understanding social facts, sociologists can
diagnose the disease and prescribe the cure.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.060
Today you learned about Émile Durkheim, and
some of his major ideas.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.570
We talked about social facts and how he framed
sociology as a science.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.580
We introduced the idea of common
consciousness and tried to understand how it
binds society together.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.360
And we looked at suicide as an example of
how Durkheim applied his concepts to a specific
social problem.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.720
But there are lots of other ways to understand
the purpose of sociology,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:01.220
and we'll see a very different understanding
next week as we continue our whirlwind tour of
the founding theorists with a look at Karl Marx.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:07.100
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the
