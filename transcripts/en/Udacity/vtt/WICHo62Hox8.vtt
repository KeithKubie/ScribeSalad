The third question asked, what is the maximum possible path length in B?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's pretty straightforward to see the chains have a maximum possible path length of n-1

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and this n-1 is an upper bound on the path link of any graph with n nodes

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and so we are checking to see if we can make B into a chain.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If we can, then n-1 will be the maximum possible path link

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and this is about as close as we can get into making B into a chain.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In fact, it doesn't matter how many nodes are on the left side. We can still only get a chain of six.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For another node on the right side, we can make our chain to it as longer, and so the maximum

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
possible path link in a bipartite graph depends on the number of nodes in the smallest group,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and so in general the maximum possible path link in a bipartite graph is the minimum

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of 2 times the number of nodes in the left group or 2 times the number of nodes in the right group

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or the number of nodes in total minus 1.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For B, we get that the possible maximum path link is six edges.
