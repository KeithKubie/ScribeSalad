you thought that it's all too easy for
us to fall into a sort of rut in our

so good you can feel so certain that
it's right that we can't even realize

it's right that we can't even realize
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.290
it's right that we can't even realize
that we're stuck in a rut part of this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
that we're stuck in a rut part of this

like this kind of effect and that is

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
like this kind of effect and that is
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.980
like this kind of effect and that is
this sort of you see one approach to do

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
this sort of you see one approach to do
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530
this sort of you see one approach to do
things and you are convinced it's right

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
things and you are convinced it's right
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.810
things and you are convinced it's right
and even if it isn't the best approach

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
and even if it isn't the best approach
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.030
and even if it isn't the best approach
you just can't see other approaches

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
you just can't see other approaches
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.650
you just can't see other approaches
because you've already locked in that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
because you've already locked in that
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.060
because you've already locked in that
first approach and to some extent we do

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
first approach and to some extent we do
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510
first approach and to some extent we do
that in everything we do in life because

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
that in everything we do in life because
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.229
that in everything we do in life because
as we grow as we go from infants and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
as we grow as we go from infants and
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.430
as we grow as we go from infants and
we'll maturing there are synoptic we're

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
we'll maturing there are synoptic we're
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.389
we'll maturing there are synoptic we're
going and kind of our earliest years we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
going and kind of our earliest years we
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.689
going and kind of our earliest years we
have lots of synoptic connections and as

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
have lots of synoptic connections and as
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000
have lots of synoptic connections and as
we don't use some of them they just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010
we don't use some of them they just
 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.149
we don't use some of them they just
wither away and die so even by six

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
wither away and die so even by six

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750
months of age what happens is you've
lost the ability to even hear certain

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
lost the ability to even hear certain
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.660
lost the ability to even hear certain
sounds of other languages because you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
sounds of other languages because you
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969
sounds of other languages because you
haven't actually used those those

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

to realize how easy it is for people to
 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.690
to realize how easy it is for people to
get in a an echo chamber where they they

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
get in a an echo chamber where they they
 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.940

outside their own echo chamber so I saw
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.120
outside their own echo chamber so I saw
that on the trawlers that I worked on

were in big trouble and to some extent I
 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.580

see a little of that going on in our

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590

society today people become very
polarized because they only listen to

polarized because they only listen to
 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.040
polarized because they only listen to
news that relates to something that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050
news that relates to something that
 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.030

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880
so it's almost a little bit like that or
 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.850

the old days when I was working with the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860
the old days when I was working with the
 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.160
the old days when I was working with the
Soviets because there's this sort of

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170
Soviets because there's this sort of
 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.970
Soviets because there's this sort of
groupthink that we're right and and also

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980
groupthink that we're right and and also
 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.690
groupthink that we're right and and also
fear if you say the wrong thing amongst

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700
fear if you say the wrong thing amongst
 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.290
fear if you say the wrong thing amongst
your group and this is this is a

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300
your group and this is this is a
 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.800
your group and this is this is a
dangerous sort of societal situation to

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
dangerous sort of societal situation to
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.050

fall into where you're not listening or

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060
fall into where you're not listening or
 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.870
fall into where you're not listening or
talking to one another and I think it's

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880
talking to one another and I think it's
 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.840
talking to one another and I think it's
important that as much as possible to

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
important that as much as possible to
 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.110
important that as much as possible to
maintain dialogue between different ways

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120

think critical thinking involves not

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.430
think critical thinking involves not
being totally vested in one side or

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440
being totally vested in one side or
 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.890
being totally vested in one side or
