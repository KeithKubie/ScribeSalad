00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.190
Koalas have an organ
unlike anything else

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.180
in the animal kingdom that makes
them sound like Barry White.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.260
Oh, yeah.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.020
Hey, friends.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.219
Trace here reporting on
the cute koala for DNews.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.270
Nature sort of
determines how everyone

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.870
sounds based on their size.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.282
Koalas are small, so you'd
think they'd make high-pitched

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.240
noises, but they don't.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.760
Vocal cords are folds
of tissue stretched

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.650
across the inside of the larynx.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.790
These folds determine how
I sound to you right now.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.880
Generally speaking,
smaller animals normally

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.960
have smaller folds, and thus
make higher-pitched sounds.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.590
It would be weird to see a
small dog with a deep bark

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.560
because their vocal
cords shouldn't allow it.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.030
Koalas break the mold.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.570
And until recently, we didn't
know how they were doing it.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.690
Koalas are arboreal,
herbivorous marsupials.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.660
They are not tiny bears.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.320
They weigh as much
as 20 pounds, which

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.934
would make you think
that they sound

00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:54.600
like that little cute
Kristin Chenoweth.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.690
But instead, they
sound like Barry White.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.240
Scientists from the
University of Sussex in the UK

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.490
found that, unlike
any other land animal,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.979
koalas have a second set of
vocal folds outside the larynx.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.520
National Geographic
says that they've

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.269
got the vocal depth
of something more akin

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.230
to an elephant
considering their size.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.084
Oh, baby.

00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:12.500
These folds are
at the point where

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.799
the oral and nasal cavities
meet called the pharynx.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.090
When the koala inhales and
exhales through the pharynx,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.040
it sounds like it's
repeatedly snoring

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.350
and then belching, which
might not sound sexy

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.809
to you, but for a lady
koala, bow chicka wow wow.

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:26.850
Now, their mates like it.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.110
And in fact, the deeper snorey,
burping sounds they can make,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.591
the hotter the ladies think
that their speaking is.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:34.340
The lowest it would
seem that they can get

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.096
is about 9.8 Hertz, which is
lower than we can even hear.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.470
These deep voices
might determine

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.680
whether the koala can
pass on its genes.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.750
There's not a lot of energy
in eucalyptus leaves,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.290
so they can't
exactly fight it out.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.050
Instead, they sort
of koala purr,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.590
attract their mates
more passively.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.410
Fun fact.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.670
Koalas are kind of dirty.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.230
Chlamydia, pretty
common in their species.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.824
Ew.

00:01:53.824 --> 00:01:55.740
Since we're talking about
cute, fuzzy animals,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.660
our friends over at
the Animalist Network

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.701
have a new show that you
might want to check out.

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.120
It's called Cat Mojo
with Jackson Galaxy.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.990
All right, people.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.820
Are you ready for some cat mojo?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.570
When I started working with
cats almost 20 years ago,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.110
it was this very pure place.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.417
But back to koalas.

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:17.625
If you could have a deeper
voice, would you want one?

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.834

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:20.583
And you know what?

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:21.830
Why not share this video too?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.970
It only takes a second.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.850
Thanks for watching, everybody.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.510
See you later.
