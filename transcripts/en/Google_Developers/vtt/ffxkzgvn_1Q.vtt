[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:07.190
MELISSA DANIELS: Hi, all.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.940
Welcome to Women
Techmakers Panel--

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.500
Experiences Developing
On Android Things.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.580
My name's Melissa.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm a Program Manager
here at Google.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.841
And I work on the
Android Things team.

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.340
And so in a moment,
I'm going to let

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.920
the wonderful and
amazing women to my side

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.980
introduce themselves.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.688
And we're going to
talk about how they're

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:26.960
all Googlers, and how
they all work together

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.960
on a series of projects actually
based on Android Things.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.430
So over the next
40 minutes, we'll

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.220
actually walk you through their
prototype to production story.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.720
What they learned, what they
loved, and of course, what they

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.670
loathed along the way.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.360
So let's meet our lovely ladies.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.940
Let's start with Rachel.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.315
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Sure.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.820
Hi, I'm Rachel Petterson,
and I am a Software Engineer

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.407
at Google, obviously.

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:50.240
MELISSA DANIELS: I'm
going to interrupt you.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.720
Let's do this true
Google fashion.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.844
So why don't you tell us
how long you've been here?

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:55.250
And also, a fun fact, too.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.180
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Sure.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.638
I can tell you what
I work on also.

00:00:57.638 --> 00:01:00.320
So I have been at
Google for 10 years.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.080
I work on Google Cloud Search,
which is our enterprise search

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.099
solution.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.110
And a fun fact is that
before coming to Google,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.943
I used to work on visual
effects for movies.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.940
And I've got a credit
in "Transformers."

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.940
MELISSA DANIELS: Nice.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.020
CARSON HOLGATE:
I'm Carson Holgate.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.600
I'm the Tech Lead on one of
Google's internal communication

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.740
tools.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.340
I've been at Google
for five years.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850
And a fun fact about myself
is that I wrote the software

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.820
for a bartending robot.

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:24.570
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.830
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.290
I'm Vaas Krishnamurthy.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.530
I'm an Embedded Software
Engineer at Nest.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.900
I've been there five years.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.100
And fun fact about me, I've
been part of this dance group

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.110
called Bay Area Flash Mob.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.000
We have danced at hundreds
of places in San Francisco,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.260
from Pier 39 to Union Square
to even the Mayor's Ballroom

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.530
in the City Hall, by just
mingling with the crowd

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.280
and then just breaking
out into a dance.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.080
MELISSA DANIELS: Did
you intentionally

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.550
dance in the Mayor's
Ballroom, or did he

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.930
not know that you were
going to [INAUDIBLE]??

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.010
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
No, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.720
It was for a wedding
that was happening.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.711
MELISSA DANIELS: Oh my gosh.

00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:00.210
Nice.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.920
BRITTANY WILBERT:
That's awesome.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.461
And then, my name's
Brittany Wilbert.

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.040
I am a Privacy Engineer
here at Google.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.830
And one fun fact about
myself is that I'm

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.430
a builder and a tinkerer.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.680
And most recently, I
built three 3D printers.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.730
MELISSA DANIELS: Awesome.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.813
So thanks for introducing.

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.120
So you guys will all hear a
little bit about everything

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.744
that they've done
along the way and how

00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:20.820
they use Android Things.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.849
And so for those of you
who aren't familiar,

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.640
all these projects were
built for something

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.473
called Grace Hopper.

00:02:27.473 --> 00:02:31.200
So Grace Hopper is the
world's largest gathering

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.300
of women technologists
every year.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.040
And each year,
Googlers participate.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.690
And this past year,
my team, Android

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.420
Things, partnered with
the Women Techmakers Team,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.420
which is a global program
for women in technology.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.370
And so Google's Women Techmaker
Team actually helps to work,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.580
provide visibility,
community, and resources

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.730
for women in technology to drive
innovation and participation

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.810
in the field.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.480
So they do this through things
like hosting events, launching

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.840
resources, piloting new
initiatives in organizations.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.430
And obviously, teaming up
with fun teams like mine.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.454
I mean, I'm a little biased
because it is my team.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:05.370
But to make sure that
women all over the world

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.139
are supported in their industry.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.180
So naturally, when the
opportunity came up for us

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.680
to work with the
Women Techmakers Team,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.721
and then find a whole
bunch of amazing volunteers

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:15.760
across Google to build things,
we jumped at the chance.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.670
So how did you
guys get involved?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.270
So I know, obviously, how I got
involved because I got excited

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.670
and was involved with the
Women Techmaker Group.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.970
But how did you
guys get involved?

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.178
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON:
Sure, I'll take that one.

00:03:28.178 --> 00:03:29.840
So around sometime in July--

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.260
so Grace Hopper is October.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.720
Around July, Melissa
sent out an email,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.740
basically asking for volunteers
to work on something for Google

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.240
involving Android Things.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.880
I personally had been involved
with Grace Hopper at Google

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.730
for many years.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.790
And so this sounded
like something

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.042
different and interesting, so I
was really excited about that.

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.500
And plus, I had
really been wanting

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.090
to get involved in
internet of things

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.244
and this seemed like a great way
to blend those two interests.

00:03:54.244 --> 00:03:56.910
CARSON HOLGATE: And I was trying
to get tickets to Grace Hopper,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.437
but I couldn't.

00:03:58.437 --> 00:04:00.020
MELISSA DANIELS: I
was your free pass?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.960
CARSON HOLGATE: Yes,
you were the free pass.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.500
Also, the free pass to I/O.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.667
MELISSA DANIELS: Don't tell.

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.250
CARSON HOLGATE: So I wanted to
get involved with Grace Hopper,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.910
and I saw this email come from
Melissa about Android Things.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.951
And I have some Android
experience and some hobby

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:13.654
hardware experience, so I figure
I'd be able to contribute.

00:04:13.654 --> 00:04:15.570
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: And
I saw Melissa's email,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.760
and I had heard about Android
Things, never used it.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.130
So thought, this is
my chance to use it.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.280
And also, this was my chance
to meet other great women

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.640
at Google, which I did.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.430
And so I signed up.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.550
BRITTANY WILBERT: And for
me, I was actually a Noodler,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.320
a new Googler at the time.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.380
So I wanted to find something
that would be interesting,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.430
where I could meet new fellow
Googlers at the company

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.390
and just learn more.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.390
So fortunately, this
came in my mailbox

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.059
and I was able to
take a part of it.

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:45.600
MELISSA DANIELS:
And none of you guys

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.465
really knew each other
before this, right?

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:48.840
You guys kind of
knew each other?

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.850
CARSON HOLGATE: We
knew other, yeah.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.460
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.970
Not as well as we
do now, though.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.386
CARSON HOLGATE:
Yeah, that's true.

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:55.680
MELISSA DANIELS: Now,
you tolerate each other.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.450
And from that, you
guys just instantly

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.050
knew what you wanted
to build, right?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.910
So you saw that email from me
and you're like, Grace Hopper.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.760
Android Things.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.580
Got it.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.650
Going to do this.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.747
I know exactly what's
going to happen, right?

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:07.580
CARSON HOLGATE: Yep.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.580
MELISSA DANIELS: Oh, OK.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.100
I feel like you're lying to me.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.560
Actually, can we go through
what that process was like?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.370
How did you come up with-- or
ideate and go through things?

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.930
What did you build?

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.305
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:21.320
So for Steve--

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.590
OK.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.420
Well, I'll talk about
what we did build.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.260
We built Steve the Tree,
which Steve is a giant

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.600
20-foot-by-20-foot footprint
and 17-foot-tall tree.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.840
So it takes up a
lot of space there.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.310
Steve is a Joshua Tree.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.590
That's what he was based on.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.280
And we built
everything in Steve.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.035
So the tree itself.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:48.450
It's got Rebar core, foam,
completely flame retardant.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.920
Fire Marshal was
all good with that.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.960
And then, he's covered
in about 5,000 LEDs

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.930
and 20-some-odd
sensors, including

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.010
force-resistive sensors,
microphones, light sensors,

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.100
gesture sensors, so that
attendees to the event

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.100
could interact with
Steve and wave to him.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.280
And he reacts through his LEDs.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.530
Through the frequency,
and the color,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.260
and how many are showing.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.510
But Carson, you want to talk
about what he started as?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.530
CARSON HOLGATE: Sure.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.615
We didn't start with the
idea of Steve the Tree.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.490
Steve was originally
supposed to be a smaller

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.180
part of a larger open-world
interact with the things

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.530
kind of game.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.637
And it all converged into Steve.

00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:32.220
And we incorporated
a lot of the ideas

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.595
for the different
kind of sensors

00:06:33.595 --> 00:06:35.520
and the light show
into the main tree.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.660
MELISSA DANIELS: So you
keep calling him Steve.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.550
Why?

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.230
Where did the name
Steve come from?

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.800
CARSON HOLGATE: So all of
my things are named Steve.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.320
The bartending robot
is named Steve.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.210
My Roomba is named Steve.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.835
MELISSA DANIELS: Is
there a real Steve?

00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:47.880
CARSON HOLGATE: There
is a real Steve.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.470
Steve was a friend of
mine who works at Verily.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.375
He's the nicest guy
you will ever meet.

00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.710
MELISSA DANIELS: Is
he also a bartender

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.270
or a tree in his free
time, or anything?

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.530
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.310
MELISSA DANIELS: Oh, OK.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.780
Good to know.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.930
So based off of this,
it sounds like you were

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.609
building with tons of sensors.

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:04.650
What does this look like?

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.570
So what were you
guys doing here?

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.509
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Right.

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.800
So they were working with a
bunch of different sensors.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.320
And prior to this, I hadn't
worked with Android Things.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.689
And I hadn't really
done much with hardware.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:18.480
Actually, the slide
that you're seeing here

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.410
is me connecting two
different-- actually,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.660
four different
force-resistive sensors using

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.330
analog-to-digital converter.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.000
There are easier ways to
do this that I now know,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.370
but there was a lot of
learning that took place

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.825
in building Steve.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:37.950
MELISSA DANIELS: And then,
these are all the lights

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.550
that you're talking about?

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.216
CARSON HOLGATE: This is the demo
that we did in the local Google

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:42.450
Makerspace.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.380
Laid out all 16
strands of 5-meter LEDs

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.010
and wrote different values so
we could show the light show

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.662
and make sure it all worked.

00:07:52.662 --> 00:07:54.370
MELISSA DANIELS: So
is Steve here at I/O?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.067
Can we find him?

00:07:55.067 --> 00:07:57.150
CARSON HOLGATE: Steve would
have loved to make it.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.400
And we would love
to have him here,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.870
but he put down
roots in Houston.

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:03.530
MELISSA DANIELS: And
this is basically--

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.465
you mentioned he was built
with Rebar and all this stuff.

00:08:05.465 --> 00:08:07.050
So this is basically
the construction.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.240
He's pretty big.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.410
I mean, that's pretty
impressive and massive, right?

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.930
I mean, I've never
built a 20-foot tree.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.520
I don't know about you guys.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.170
So what about you two?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:20.519
So tell us what you guys built.

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:21.560
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.140
We built Rosie the Android.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.460
She is a walking
and talking android.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.910
So she is controllable
using a phone app

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.350
using a nearby connection.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.970
And on the top, she has a camera
that can capture a picture.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.799
And it can do some
image processing.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.620
And it can detect
facial expressions.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.530
And it can detect accessories
and speak to the audience.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.231
She can also tell
them, hey, nice hat.

00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:45.980
I like your smile.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.688
Nice to meet you.

00:08:46.688 --> 00:08:50.790
So she would raise her right
arm and offer a handshake.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.496
MELISSA DANIELS:
So how big was she?

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:53.870
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
She was huge.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.400
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yeah.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.910
So the first version of
Rosie was about 4 feet tall,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.080
including the rubberized
wheels that were at the bottom.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.030
She was actually made out of--

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:10.340
the first version, out of styler
foam, wood pallets, and a trash

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.130
can.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.820
So we initially wanted
to use other methods,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.150
but this was the
solution that we can make

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.030
in such a short amount of time.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.037
MELISSA DANIELS: And so I heard
there's a rumor that Rosie

00:09:26.037 --> 00:09:27.674
is here on-site today.

00:09:27.674 --> 00:09:28.340
Is that correct?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.214
Is this the same version
that you guys built,

00:09:30.214 --> 00:09:31.650
or is this a different version?

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.230
Or what did that
process look like,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.994
from going from a
base like this--

00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:37.660
I believe that's a
trash can lid, right?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.201
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
Yeah, that's just

00:09:39.201 --> 00:09:40.900
the lid of a trash can, yes.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.400
MELISSA DANIELS: So how did you
go from a trash can lid to--

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.102
I believe there's a
giant robot outside?

00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:46.310
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Oh, yeah.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.268
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yeah.

00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:48.150
It was a lot of work.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.940
So the initial
version of Rosie was

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.030
going to be something similar.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.200
Maybe not as similar as what was
happening today, but we went--

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.180
going to hardware design.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:05.300
But today, it has evolved to
a 5-foot-tall android that

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.880
can roam around that uses
machine learning techniques,

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.180
as well as the implementation
that Vaas worked on as well.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.344
So it's really awesome.

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:18.510
MELISSA DANIELS: So it's
really like the prototype--

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.426
you guys truly went
through and prototyped her

00:10:20.426 --> 00:10:23.150
and had your initial
contact version of Rosie.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.550
And then, took your
iteration of her,

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.730
and then ended up with
sort of a production

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.130
version that we see out in
the world right now, right?

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.600
And all built in Android Things?

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.050
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yes.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.490
MELISSA DANIELS:
It's pretty cool.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.625
I mean, I've
interacted with her.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.520
She's pretty awesome.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.561
OK.

00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:42.560
It looks like you guys--

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.018
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
Yeah, that's us

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:47.900
at a hardware store
buying the trash can.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.780
And yeah.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.400
MELISSA DANIELS: So was that
always the plan, to build her--

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.960
you mentioned that
you had to shift

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.480
the plans and stuff like that.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yes.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.850
MELISSA DANIELS: What
was your initial plans?

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.160
If it wasn't to use a
trash can and to use foam,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.492
how did your design and
your evolution change?

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.450
BRITTANY WILBERT: So the
first version of Rosie

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.600
was actually created
using a CAD file.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.320
So it took about two weeks
to create the CAD file,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.720
and then we went around to
different shops to ask them,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.720
hey, can you build--

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.150
can you fabricate a 5-foot-tall
android in about a week or so?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.400
And unfortunately, they said no.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.010
And one of our fabrication
labs that is here at Google,

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.900
they said that it was way too
big for the specifications

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.970
that we provided.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.740
So basically, with a
week and a half left,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.950
we decided we still
want to do this.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.080
So we went to the
hardware store.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.250
And we went to fabric stores and
got a cake box and other sort

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.370
of supplies.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.411
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Brittany
was really creative.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.040
She got a styrofoam cake
box cover for the head.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.080
We used PVC pipes for the arms.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.250
And we used this giant
trash can for the body.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.057
Yeah, it was quite
a lot of work.

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:05.390
MELISSA DANIELS: Definitely
an iterative process, right?

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:05.760
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yes.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.350
BRITTANY WILBERT:
Yes, definitely.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.100
MELISSA DANIELS: It's amazing.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.190
So we know how
Steve got his name.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.560
So why Rosie?

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.700
Where'd that come from?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.950
BRITTANY WILBERT: It's from
Rosie the Riveter, the World

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.040
War II-era individual who
inspired a lot of women

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.990
to decide to go out
into the working place.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.160
So we wanted to have something
that a lot of visitors of Grace

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.040
Hopper would be interesting
in understanding

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.134
and have a good
experience with it.

00:12:33.134 --> 00:12:34.550
MELISSA DANIELS:
It's pretty cool.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.190
And I understand that's part of
like, what's built in to her ML

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.744
tech right now, right?

00:12:38.744 --> 00:12:39.660
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yes.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.415
MELISSA DANIELS: So you can
flex just like her head.

00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:42.373
That's my poor flexing.

00:12:42.373 --> 00:12:44.510
I don't know how
to flex apparently.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.270
Just like Rosie.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:46.645
And then, it will
trigger her ML?

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:47.050
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yes.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.100
MELISSA DANIELS:
That's pretty cool.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.612
So getting back to all the
tech, you guys have all kind of

00:12:51.612 --> 00:12:52.820
touched a little bit of this.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.960
But all these MOs are
built using Android Things.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.100
So before you started
working on Android Things,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.120
did you guys have any
hardware experience?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.660
Rachel, you said
no or a little bit?

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.470
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON:
Most had been some LEDs,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.180
but not really with
microcontrollers.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.263
MELISSA DANIELS: Brittany,
you built a 3D printer?

00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:08.845
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yes.

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:09.525
Vaas and Carson?

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:11.030
CARSON HOLGATE: I have half an
electrical engineering degree,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.589
and I've done some hobby
hardware in the past.

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:14.130
But nothing--

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.600
MELISSA DANIELS:
Just half a degree?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.680
CARSON HOLGATE:
Half a degree, yeah.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.770
But nothing of the
scale of Steve the Tree.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.811
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:22.640
I've had hardware experience,
but I've never built anything

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.155
from scratch or to the scale.

00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.780
MELISSA DANIELS: And
you guys had never

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.190
used Android Things before?

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.680
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
No, not at all.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.500
CARSON HOLGATE: No.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.360
MELISSA DANIELS:
Well, not bad, right?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.680
So because you hadn't used
Android Things before,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.490
how did you actually
validate your software

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.740
through the development cycle?

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.601
So deciding to make Rosie's
arm move or Steve's lights

00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:43.850
and all the sensors and stuff?

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.805
So what did that process
kind of look like?

00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:47.180
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.790
So in the case of Steve's,
each of the sensors

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.040
connects to an
Android Things card.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.900
And the LED strips
also connect to cards.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.640
But what we did was we
had each of the cards

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.670
would write to a
Firebase database.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.830
And they would write
the raw values there.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.650
And part of the
reason we did that was

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.260
because we didn't know
exactly what the situation was

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.120
going to be when we got to
the Women Techmakers event.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.000
So for example,
the four sensors,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.800
we knew that those
were going to have

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.309
grass over the top of them.

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:19.850
And we didn't know how much that
would affect the resistance.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.160
And for the sound,
we had no idea

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.130
how loud people-- if people
were going to be shouting at him

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.210
or if there was going
to be background music.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.440
So we accounted for that
by having everything

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.660
write to the database,
so we could then modulate

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.365
those values once we got there.

00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:35.240
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.670
So the sensors would write
to the Firebase database,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.170
and then we had
Cloud functions that

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.870
would translate those raw
values into an aggregate

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.534
that the tree--

00:14:42.534 --> 00:14:44.450
the individual strands
of LEDs would read from

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.533
and used to determine like,
how fast they're going

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:48.860
and what color spectrum
to run through.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.017
That way, during the
event, if it got louder

00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:53.600
or like something happened with
the four sensors on the floor,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.910
we could change the code
on the fly on the server

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.982
and not have to go around to
every board and reflash them.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:14:59.940
MELISSA DANIELS: Great.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.550
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
And for Rosie, I

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.220
started just by
downloading Android Studio,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.750
trying out a sample app.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.540
And then, I started looking
on GitHub for samples

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.400
that I could potentially
use on Rosie.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.740
And I found this perfect
one for the movement

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.530
of the robot, which was--
it's called the Robot Car.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.220
It's on GitHub.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.720
If you look for
it, you'll find it.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.136
So basically, it
gives you instructions

00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:22.760
on how to compile,
how to load the app,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.860
and build a small race car kit.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.280
So I started with just building
this Range Rover race car kit.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.030
And while debugging it,
Android Studio was great.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.130
Because once you
plug in your phone

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.370
and your IMX 70, the
development board, you can see--

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.810
in two parallel tabs,
you can see the logs.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.390
So you can debug the
connection that way.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.000
So once I got the small
robot car working,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.780
it scaled up to much bigger
wheels and much bigger,

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.410
higher-torque motors
that we needed to carry

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.760
the weight of the robot.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.304
And similarly for the portion
with the image recognition,

00:15:57.304 --> 00:15:58.220
we did the same thing.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.710
I looked for things that
I could use with a kit.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.860
The kit comes with an LCD
screen and a camera module.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.170
So I went to GitHub and
looked for a sample that

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.490
would let me use all of this.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.899
And again, I found this
Smile Detector sample

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:11.690
that was out there.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.890
And that was great.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.530
And I had replicated
the same thing

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.780
and pulled it in and
changed a bunch of things

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.220
to get it working on Rosie.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.010
And for the arm
movement as well,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.470
there is a simple PWM sample
that's in Android Things.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.460
And yeah, put all these
different pieces together.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.580
There were, obviously, a lot
of challenges for all of them

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.750
to work together.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.640
For example, now
when I scaled up

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.070
to these bigger motors,
higher torque motors,

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.770
now they needed a much
more bigger battery.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.960
That was operating on
a different voltage.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.350
It was operating on a
much higher current.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.650
So I had to buy a huge
light bulb battery.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.420
But then, this board was still
powered off a 5-volt supply.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.580
So a lot of learning there.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.877
Definitely, a bunch of
burned motors in the course.

00:16:55.877 --> 00:16:57.460
MELISSA DANIELS:
Just a couple, right?

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.700
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.154
So in the end, everything
kind of came together.

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:02.070
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yep.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.119
And Vaas did all the hard part.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:04.910
I just did--

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.742
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
No, I don't think so.

00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:07.359
MELISSA DANIELS:
I have a feeling

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.760
that's not even close to true.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.885
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: No way.

00:17:09.885 --> 00:17:11.810
MELISSA DANIELS: Very
shared distribution.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.550
So when you guys all
started at Google,

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.216
did you ever think
that part of your job

00:17:15.216 --> 00:17:17.540
would actually entail
building, like giant robots

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.619
and giant trees?

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.859
Is that part of the Google--

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.275
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah, that's
like standard Google software

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:22.896
engineer.

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:23.390
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: No.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.979
MELISSA DANIELS:
I don't remember

00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:25.430
seeing that [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.109
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Not at all.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:26.300
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah, I

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.833
missed that part of orientation.

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.950
CARSON HOLGATE: You must
have been [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.370
MELISSA DANIELS: Yeah.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.720
So does any of this actually
translate over into the work

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.612
that you do every day?

00:17:37.612 --> 00:17:39.770
I hope it does.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.640
BRITTANY WILBERT:
Not so much anymore.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.994
Well, like I said, I'm
a Privacy Engineer,

00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:45.410
so I work in
security and privacy.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.540
So most of my time
is set in the screen.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.460
So having the opportunity
to be able to do something

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.820
on the side that is,
I guess forward-facing

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.380
is really awesome.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.279
MELISSA DANIELS: Nice.

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.820
So if someone's
actually just getting

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.327
started with Android Things.

00:18:01.327 --> 00:18:02.910
And they've poked
around a little bit,

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.870
and they have maybe a Raspberry
Pi or a microcontroller,

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.000
or they just have an idea.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.240
Dream and a prayer, right?

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.310
Isn't that the phrase?

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.600
How do they get started?

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.680
What would you
recommend for how they

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.930
can build their own robots?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:16.780
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: I would

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.390
jump on the Android
Things website

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.920
and take a look
at the code labs.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.500
So there are some code labs
on there that are really good.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.730
They walk you through setting
up the whole Android Things.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.420
So if you get a
kit-- and I think

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.295
there's a way to get a
kit while you're here.

00:18:31.295 --> 00:18:32.850
MELISSA DANIELS: Yeah, I think
there's a scavenger hunt.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.450
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON:
There's a scavenger hunt.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.910
MELISSA DANIELS: And also,
a giveaway, just FYI.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.110
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON:
So if you have a kit,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.260
the code labs will walk you
through the entire setup

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.077
process.

00:18:41.077 --> 00:18:42.660
And by the end of
them, I know there's

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.820
one that uses TensorFlow to
take pictures and identify dogs.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.230
And that one's really cool.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.672
But the important thing
is that by the end of it,

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.130
you've gone through
the experience.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.510
And basically,
done the hard part

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.200
of learning how to get stuff
on Android Things and make it

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.400
do things.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.530
And so once you jump
over that hurdle,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.010
actually making changes and
doing stuff and adjusting it

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.715
for what you want
gets really easy.

00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:07.590
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.340
And I would say you
don't even really need

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.587
Raspberry Pi or
microcontroller experience.

00:19:11.587 --> 00:19:13.920
If you know a little Android,
if you know a little Java,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.270
it's easy to get up and started.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.550
And the kits come
with a rainbow hat,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.980
which has enough sensors to
build something cool right out

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.709
of the box.

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:21.750
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.166
And you don't need hardware
or embedded experience either.

00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:28.660
All the drivers for Android is
hidden behind these clean APIs.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.110
So if you want to just
control the motor,

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.450
all you say is you set the
direction and the speed.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.170
And that's it.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.740
So you're not rewriting all the
device drivers from scratch.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.590
You get the various
components working.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.080
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yeah.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.040
And I guess the biggest
thing, or least for me,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.080
is to not be afraid.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.720
I think a lot of people,
when they look at programming

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.110
opportunities, there can
be a concern that, hey, I

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.870
don't know what I'm doing.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.170
But the Android Things
community is a great resource.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.470
And then also, just
learning about it

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.690
and taking part and
getting hands-on

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.084
is a great way to get started.

00:20:00.084 --> 00:20:02.250
MELISSA DANIELS: So it
sounds like between the group

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.890
of you guys, you're all
super-equipped, amazingly

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.560
talented.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.820
Which no sarcasm, a
completely honest statement.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.620
But everything went perfectly.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.070
And so that you didn't need any
help building your giant trees

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.240
or your giant robots.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.930
And you didn't run into
any problems at all, right?

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.930
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yep.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.930
BRITTANY WILBERT: No.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.120
MELISSA DANIELS: Not even close?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.040
Or should we talk about
the stuff that went wrong?

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.240
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Yeah.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.656
MELISSA DANIELS:
Start with Rosie?

00:20:25.656 --> 00:20:26.940
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yes.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.520
Like I said before,
we were planning

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:38.640
on building Rosie version 1 from
3D printers using fabrication

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.530
techniques to do so.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.200
Unfortunately, it
was really big.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.860
I didn't realize
that having something

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.230
like a 2-foot diameter waist
and all these other components

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.000
could cause such a concern.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.860
So about two weeks before, after
exhausting every single option

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.710
made available to
us, we just said,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.910
hey, we're just going to just
be scrappy and get stuff done.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:13.110
So that's where the going
around a million hardware stores

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.130
came in.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.630
MELISSA DANIELS:
So you're basically

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.762
saying your project was
too big for Google, right?

00:21:17.762 --> 00:21:19.470
BRITTANY WILBERT:
Maybe at the time, yes.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.511
MELISSA DANIELS: At least
for Google's 3D printer

00:21:21.511 --> 00:21:22.369
at the time, right?

00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:23.910
I feel like that's
an accomplishment.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.243
That's pretty impressive, right?

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.740
So like, [INAUDIBLE]
moonshot the printers.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.790
Isn't that the goal
[INAUDIBLE] So it's not bad.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.335
So then, it sounds
like you guys,

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:36.210
when you went through
it, to move forward you

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.650
immediately-- your
next steps were

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.960
to think about the same
structure and redesign.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.710
And then, think about how the
materiality came into play

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.460
with the software.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.190
Is that correct?

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.565
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
That's right.

00:21:46.565 --> 00:21:48.610
So we started out
with something.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.210
For example, we got
PVC pipes for the arms.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.950
But later, when we
put the motor on it,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.580
we found that that
was getting stuck.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.799
And the PVC pipes
were just too heavy.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.840
So we had to come up with
another solution, which

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.680
is when Brittany found
these perfect foam

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.970
arms that we could use instead.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.620
And there are a lot
of other things, too.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.830
For example, when we
put Rosie together,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.140
even on these bigger
wheels, the weight

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.790
was too much for the
wheels to handle.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.270
Because these wheels were
designed for a fast race car.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.180
And so they couldn't take
the weight of the trash can.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.980
So we had to cut
pieces of plastic

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.570
out so it can carry the weight.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.680
And a lot of things.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.420
Even with the camera, we
had to have enough lighting

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.130
to get the exact expression.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.810
And we had to put it
at the right angle.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:34.050
So every single step,
we had learned a lot.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:38.130
We iterated and came up with
some solution for everything.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.220
MELISSA DANIELS: Sounds like
a lot of time to get to it.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.830
So obviously, I'm guessing
you had a ton of time

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.819
to build this, right?

00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:46.860
How long did it take for
you guys to build Rosie?

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.410
BRITTANY WILBERT: So we
had a month initially.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.230
But once the 3D
printing option failed,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.600
it was about a week and a half.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.720
And I guess more accurately,
more like three days

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.830
of late nights and a
few weekends trying

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.197
to figure out what we were
going to do when solving it.

00:23:07.197 --> 00:23:08.780
MELISSA DANIELS:
That's not much time.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.780
And how about for Steve?

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.660
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON:
Steve, I think we put--

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.701
from the sensor side, I
think we put most of that

00:23:16.701 --> 00:23:18.950
together in about
two to three weeks.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.410
I mean, ideally we would
have had more time.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.950
We would have
started immediately

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.780
when you sent out the email.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.870
But there was a
lot of figuring out

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.200
what we were actually going
to do with Steve until Steve

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.305
became Steve.

00:23:34.305 --> 00:23:35.180
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.065
MELISSA DANIELS: And
you guys needed--

00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:38.540
you felt like that was a
sufficient amount of time,

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.561
or you both needed
a lot more time?

00:23:40.561 --> 00:23:42.560
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: I
think we would have needed

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.414
two months at least full-time.

00:23:44.414 --> 00:23:46.080
MELISSA DANIELS: But
you had three days?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.038
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: Well,
we had like two weeks

00:23:48.038 --> 00:23:49.880
to try and scramble.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.665
But the last three
days were just insane.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.520
The truck was waiting for us.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.630
Rosie was still in parts.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.820
We were still working on it.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.890
And then, like packing
things that were done.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.550
The head.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.880
I had to carry the head
with me in the flight

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.735
because the rest of it
was already shipped.

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:09.110
So I carried the head of the
robot with me on the flight.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.026
BRITTANY WILBERT: TSA
must have been very fun.

00:24:11.026 --> 00:24:13.390
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: What's that?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.890
MELISSA DANIELS: That's crazy.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.837
And so when you're building
Steve the Tree, a 20-foot tree,

00:24:18.837 --> 00:24:20.170
nothing went wrong there, right?

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.160
So everything was perfect.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.400
CARSON HOLGATE:
Everything was perfect.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.370
MELISSA DANIELS:
That's good to know.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.490
So just moving on.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.690
CARSON HOLGATE: Not quite.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.934
So I designed the main tree.

00:24:26.934 --> 00:24:28.600
And while I was
designing the main tree,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.340
I made a lot of assumptions
about how the hardware

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.820
and the software would work.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.484
And of course, most
of them were wrong.

00:24:33.484 --> 00:24:34.900
Initially, I thought
we were going

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.090
to be able to control
four strands of LEDs

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.130
from each board.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.179
And then I got some
of the stands of LEDs

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.970
and I got some of the
boards and I realized

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.560
that this is not going to work.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.332
The way that the LED strands
had implemented the standard

00:24:47.332 --> 00:24:48.790
meant that I couldn't
do the things

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.873
that I thought I could do.

00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:53.920
So the problem was
that the boards only

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.410
have one MISO pin to do the
data writing to the strand.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.170
So I looked at using a technique
called bit banging, where

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.120
I picked apart the
headers in the standard

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.200
and I wrote just the individual
bits out through a GPIO pin

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.390
to light up the strand
and do the light show.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.322
But I got about three
seconds per frame.

00:25:12.322 --> 00:25:14.530
Whereas, doing it the right
way through the data pin,

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.240
I got 30 to 60
frames per second.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.660
So I reached out to the
Android Things community.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.070
And I'm like, this is
what I'm trying to do.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.240
This is what I'm
expecting to happen.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.560
And this is what's
actually happening.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.060
And I hear back
that there's a layer

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.460
of abstraction between the
GPIO pins and the software.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.309
For security reasons, of course.

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:31.600
So it wasn't going to work
the way that I wanted it to.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.190
And this is like a common thing
with operating system-based dev

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.740
boards.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.100
MELISSA DANIELS: Called
bit banging, right?

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.975
CARSON HOLGATE: Bit
banging was the technique

00:25:39.975 --> 00:25:42.610
that I used to write
to the GPIO pins.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.440
Then conveniently, we were able
to get a bunch more boards.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.340
And the base of Steve the Tree,
as you saw in previous photos,

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.490
has 16 dev boards kind of
sitting around the base.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.920
Each board is controlling
one strand of LEDs.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.700
So it worked out on the end.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.200
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.090
And then, another
thing that we ran into.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.460
So I mentioned before that
we were writing everything

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.400
to the Firebase database
so that we could make sure

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.400
that we could modulate
when we got to Grace Hopper

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.860
to account for the
different environment.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.320
Well, we didn't really
account for the fact

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.430
that we had 20 sensors
writing about every second

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.990
to the Firebase database.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:21.380
And we had 16 strips of
LEDs reading from it.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.684
So it was a lot of in and
out to the Firebase database.

00:26:24.684 --> 00:26:26.350
CARSON HOLGATE: It
was fine for a while,

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.810
until the night before the
event, when the whole tree was

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.190
set up and the sensors
were ready to go

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.523
and we were just testing things.

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.550
And then, the DJ got
there to test her setup.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.740
I think she was playing a Bruno
Mars song with a lot of bass.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.660
And because the tree
had microphones on it,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.680
it was reacting.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.360
It was like dancing
along to the music.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.866
Then suddenly, the whole
tree stops working.

00:26:42.866 --> 00:26:44.740
So we scramble to figure
out what's going on.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.864
Like, we check connections.

00:26:45.864 --> 00:26:48.460
And eventually, I open
the Firebase database logs

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.980
and I see that we're
out of free quota.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.970
And I'm just so happy.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:53.560
MELISSA DANIELS: I
feel like you've all

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.450
run into this problem
at some point, correct?

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.950
CARSON HOLGATE: I'm
just so happy it

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.244
happened the night before the
event and not during the event.

00:27:00.244 --> 00:27:01.660
So Melissa and I
start scrambling,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.730
trying to figure out how
to fix our quota issues,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.350
like going through
official channels.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.090
And eventually,
reach out to someone

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.923
I'd worked with on the
Firebase team before.

00:27:08.923 --> 00:27:11.422
Because my real project
works with Firebase.

00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:13.130
And he was able to
fix the quota problems

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:14.560
and we were up
and running again.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.935
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:27:15.935 --> 00:27:17.230
And so later that night--

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.390
the event took place at Epcot.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.236
And Epcot does this whole
laser light, fireworks show.

00:27:22.236 --> 00:27:24.610
And so later in the evening,
the fireworks are going off.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.820
And Steve is going
with the fireworks.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.380
And it was kind of
like a nice sign

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.460
that, OK, everything is
going to be all right.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.220
CARSON HOLGATE: Going to work.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.803
MELISSA DANIELS: But
does some of this

00:27:34.803 --> 00:27:37.230
mean that you guys
didn't account for noise?

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.580
Does this also mean you
were just more successful

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.455
than you anticipated?

00:27:40.455 --> 00:27:41.829
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:44.110
It was more about the
scale of the project.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.770
MELISSA DANIELS: Hard to design
for something at that size,

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:46.300
right?

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.100
I think that's a good takeaway.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.810
That when you're
starting out, it's

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.530
really hard to think
about something

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.190
at giant magnitude and stuff.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:59.210
And so you're able
to build and iterate.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:03.800
So it sounds like between all
of you guys, your software

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.222
experience and background
with Firebase actually helped

00:28:06.222 --> 00:28:08.180
with learning a little
bit about Android Things

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.700
that troubleshooting some of
the problems that you ran into.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.949
Is that an accurate statement?

00:28:11.949 --> 00:28:14.000
Do you think it made
it a little bit easier

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.140
to get going [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.570
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.236
And definitely having
Android experience

00:28:17.236 --> 00:28:19.550
helps, especially with an
Android-based platform.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.260
And the Firebase
stuff was great.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.690
Because usually, when you're
working with dev hardware,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.830
you have to figure
out how the boards are

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.705
going to communicate.

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:27.110
Is it going to be Bluetooth?

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.460
Is it going to be [INAUDIBLE],,
one of those things?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.340
But because this is Android,
and all of the Android libraries

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.127
and ecosystems come
along with this,

00:28:33.127 --> 00:28:34.460
we could just write to Firebase.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.075
We didn't have to worry about
the inter-board communication.

00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:39.500
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Yeah.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.237
If you know any
Android, it makes

00:28:41.237 --> 00:28:42.320
it a lot more comfortable.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.260
Because at least
in my case, I was

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.280
learning internet of things
mostly for the first time.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.120
And so Android was a very
comfortable environment for me,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.390
so I could focus on
the internet of things.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.190
And I wasn't learning 16
different things at once,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.980
just focusing on
the one I needed to.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.140
MELISSA DANIELS: You guys?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.348
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: I had
no experience with Android,

00:29:01.348 --> 00:29:02.840
so this was all new.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.650
MELISSA DANIELS:
Everything from scratch.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.650
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
Everything was from scratch.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.122
But having the hardware
experience helped definitely.

00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:09.080
MELISSA DANIELS: Great.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.038
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yeah.

00:29:10.038 --> 00:29:13.670
And for me, like I said,
software engineering

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.260
isn't directly my
day-to-day job,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.410
but looking up the
Android community,

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.460
and then having coworkers
who have experience

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.217
has been really great and
was a great experience.

00:29:26.217 --> 00:29:27.800
MELISSA DANIELS: So
what was something

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.030
that you guys took
away from this?

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.020
Or is there anything
that you felt

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.436
like you've learned from this?

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.810
Hopefully, you
learned something.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.230
Maybe?

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.880
Yeah.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.070
Any big takeaways?

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.736
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON: So I
learned that overnight shipping

00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:41.630
is really awesome.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.995
There were definitely
a lot of things

00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:45.620
that I ran into
working on the sensors.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.650
For example, realizing
that I needed

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.690
analog-to-digital converters the
night before we had to leave.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.620
And doing some
late-night soldering.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.140
So getting those
overnighted was awesome.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.624
So yeah, that--

00:29:59.624 --> 00:30:01.040
MELISSA DANIELS:
Lifesaver, right?

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.081
CARSON HOLGATE: I learned
just to ask for things.

00:30:03.081 --> 00:30:04.580
When I started
designing the tree,

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.594
I looked for the open source
drivers that were available

00:30:07.594 --> 00:30:09.260
and the kinds of LEDs
that we could use.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.690
And I found these
5-meter strands of LEDs.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.670
And I'm like, OK.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.850
We're building a tree.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.840
We want to be able to
get to the base of it,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.950
so the branches
should probably start

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.340
about six feet off the ground.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.120
So 5 meters minus 6
feet is about 10 feet.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.420
So then suddenly, we have this
20-foot-by-20-foot footprint.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.840
And I'm like, this is insane.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.020
But I kept going, just so
I'd have the design doc

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.610
and be like, look at this
thing that we could have built

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.540
that would have been awesome.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.164
And at the end, I
put in a couple notes

00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:32.750
about how we could
make it smaller

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.980
or cut it in half
because I didn't

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.280
think it would fit within our
budget or in the event space.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.850
And then I sent it off to
Melissa and she's like, oh, no.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:38.391
This is fine.

00:30:38.391 --> 00:30:39.762
We can do this.

00:30:39.762 --> 00:30:42.830
MELISSA DANIELS: No big deal.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.690
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
So for me, when

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.760
I signed up for this project,
I had no idea what was coming.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.220
I didn't even know we were
going to build a robot.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.761
We had a lot of ideas we were
throwing around, figuring out--

00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:53.390
and hey, robot sounded cool.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.190
So we signed up.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.520
But everything seemed
doable to a certain extent

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.310
until the 3D printing
fell through.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.950
And at that point,
we weren't sure

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.630
whether we should
give up or keep going.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.660
And then, just build it
from scratch ourselves.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.470
So that was really,
really scary.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.630
But we didn't give up.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:13.990
We just kept going and going.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.900
Pushed it.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.440
And finally, we said, OK,
let's get one portion working,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.240
and then let's move
onto the other one.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.720
But in the end,
everything came together.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.650
All the electrical
circuits worked perfectly.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.020
And she looked beautiful,
like a pretty Android.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.550
And everything was great.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.040
So my takeaway is that--

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.390
have the confidence in yourself.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.470
Believe in yourself.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.400
And keep trying.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.750
It will pay off.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.250
BRITTANY WILBERT:
And for me, I know

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.990
this is cliche, but don't
be afraid of failure.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:44.270
Vaas was mentioning, we
had a lot of iterations.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.725
We were first going to use a--

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:53.580
rather well-known licensed
character from a large company,

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.620
but then we evolved
from that to Android.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.450
And then, the 3D
printing failing.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.800
And just a lot of
things in between that

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.080
didn't come out as the way
that we initially thought.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.160
But ultimately, we used
those failures as a way

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.940
to learn and understand what
was going on and improve.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.040
And we were able to get an
awesome result after that.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.040
MELISSA DANIELS: I don't
think they're failures.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.080
I think they're just like
growing pains, right?

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.890
BRITTANY WILBERT: Maybe like
constant iteration periods

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.650
to a successful model.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.610
MELISSA DANIELS:
So then, from that

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.560
I can't let you guys
go without asking,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.101
what's the next
thing you're planning

00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:34.382
to build using Android Things?

00:32:34.382 --> 00:32:35.840
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: So when

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.010
I'm not a software
engineer or normally

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.730
building Android Things,
I do a lot of dancing.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.890
And so I'm really,
especially now

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.510
that I know that the microphones
worked really well with sound,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.700
I'm hoping to incorporate
some Android Things

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.257
props into some of the dance
performances that I do.

00:32:53.257 --> 00:32:54.840
CARSON HOLGATE: And
I'm looking at how

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.399
to add Android Things
to my bartending robot.

00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:59.190
So that when someone
walks up with a glass,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:01.648
it'll trigger the assistant
integration and be like, hello.

00:33:01.648 --> 00:33:03.565
What are you drinking today?

00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:05.940
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: And I'm
planning to build a Halloween

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.110
project for my kids.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.760
And the kids in the block.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.610
It's probably be
a candy dispenser,

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.360
which has a bunch of pressure
sensors and proximity sensors.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.230
So when kids walk up to it,
it'll dispense candy for them.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:18.188
BRITTANY WILBERT: Yeah.

00:33:18.188 --> 00:33:19.890
And for me, I have
recently learned

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:22.010
how to use a sewing machine.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.090
I always knew how to hand
knit, but I was always

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.760
scared of the machine.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.800
So my goal is to hopefully
integrate Android Things

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.380
into some of the textile
work that I'm working on.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.460
MELISSA DANIELS: Great.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.020
And then with that,
is there anything

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:37.440
else you think that people
should know before we

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.140
bid this all adieu and move on?

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.170
No?

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:41.610
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Well, definitely

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.760
do the scavenger hunt.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.230
CARSON HOLGATE: Yeah.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.646
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: So you

00:33:44.646 --> 00:33:46.510
can get yourself an
Android Things kit.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:46.960
MELISSA DANIELS: Cool.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.710
RACHEL WEINSTEIN PETTERSON: And
then, hop on those code labs.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.810
MELISSA DANIELS: Yeah.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.500
All right.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.470
Thank you so much.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.830
And also, thank you
so much for building

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.660
the amazing projects you guys
did in working with our team.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.010
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: Oh, yeah.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.010
We do have-- so just
to mention real quick--

00:33:59.010 --> 00:33:59.490
MELISSA DANIELS: There's more.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.156
RACHEL WEINSTEIN
PETTERSON: We do have--

00:34:01.156 --> 00:34:06.970
we've got hackster IO pages
for both Steve and Rosie.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.429
So if you want more
details, if you

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.303
want to be able to see
some of these pictures

00:34:10.303 --> 00:34:11.260
up close and personal.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.239
And really, hopefully
compliment our work.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:18.850
Not analyze it too much, you
definitely take a look at those

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:19.959
and check him out.

00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:21.500
Also, if you have
questions about it,

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.620
it's a great way to
post those questions.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.451
And hopefully, we can
answer them for you.

00:34:25.451 --> 00:34:26.409
MELISSA DANIELS: Great.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:27.820
Sounds good.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.739
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY: I
want to thank Melissa.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:32.620
Without Melissa's efforts
and initiators, none of us

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.960
would even know each other.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.677
Thank you.

00:34:35.677 --> 00:34:36.760
She's always there for us.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.134
She's always there
to support us.

00:34:38.134 --> 00:34:39.961
And we really, really
appreciate everything

00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:40.960
that you've done for us.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.585
MELISSA DANIELS: I
just gave you stuff.

00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:44.585
BRITTANY WILBERT: No, you
did all the hard work,

00:34:44.585 --> 00:34:46.330
like providing water
and food while we

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.120
were about to go crazy.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.530
Crazy's not the right word.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.339
As we were trying
to get work done.

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:53.980
VAAS KRISHNAMURTHY:
Thank you, Melissa.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.580
MELISSA DANIELS: Happy to help.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.690
And I'm so happy this
was able to happen.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.956
So thank you, guys,
all for attending.

00:34:58.956 --> 00:34:59.830
So happy you're here.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.300
