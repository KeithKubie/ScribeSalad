00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.790
Hey,
what's going on?

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:07.020
It's bill burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.060
November 14th,
2016 what's going on?
I,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.890
why Ya?
Uh,
my voice is a little messed up here because,
uh,

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.470
you know,
I've been traveling,
traveling,
traveling.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.320
I've been taking my vitamins as they say,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.590
over in Europe or a gyno determines tomatoes.

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.720
Um,
Basel I don't understand why with ingredients,
you know,

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.160
everything else we pretty much pronounce,

10
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.570
pronounce the same as fucking Great Britain.
But when it comes to spices,

11
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.190
everything is different.
We say Reagan and we say Basil.
They say Organa Basel,

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.840
whatever the fuck they say,
tomato vitamins.
Um,

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.350
the only time I really experienced that in the United States as we say,

14
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:56.760
Carnegie in Pittsburgh says,
Carnegie Bill,
what are you talking about?

15
00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:00.210
I don't fucking know.
I just got off of Goddamn plane and I,
uh,

16
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.850
watched all the football on the way out.
Oh my God.

17
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.910
Underrated flying on football fucking Sunday when there was too fucking games

18
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:14.160
back to back with seven fucking lead changes.
Um,

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
the boring NFL with their ratings down.
How great was Sunday?
Fucking amazing.

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.700
Fucking amazing man.
Um,
that Dallas,

21
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.090
Pittsburgh game was incredible.
Um,

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.050
and the Pittsburgh Seattle game was great.
And uh,

23
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.550
I know a lot of people would think like the thing,

24
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.330
you know what the thing I was most upset about,
it wasn't the final score.

25
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.610
It wasn't the,
the lack of a call on,
on the last play with Gronk.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.380
It was the Tom Brady picture.

27
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.110
What the fuck was that with his hand on his hip and his other hand up underneath

28
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.430
his jaw.
What in the fuck was that?

29
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.320
That's what happens when your data's supermodel.
She's in his Goddamn me.

30
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.780
Or just be like,
Tom,
you're just standing there like everybody else.

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
You need to establish your brand,
have fun with it.
Be a little Sassy.

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.320
Um,
yes,
you're probably not gonna hear this from a lot of patriots fans,

33
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.410
but I love the no call at the end of the fucking game.

34
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.210
I am forever sticking up for quarterbacks in the NFL when it comes to their

35
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.140
right to be there to try and prevent a score.

36
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.371
You know,

37
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:27.600
you know how this all started old Jim or say out there in Indianapolis couldn't

38
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.800
beat the Patriots defense.
So he's the one that created the whole,
hey,

39
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.630
the cornerback can't even look at the receiver past five fucking yards,
you know,

40
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.540
so I love the no call.

41
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.570
I thought Gronk did that thing where he ran right into him.

42
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.120
He didn't quite push off,

43
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.530
but it was one of those gray area thinks you usually get a call on that.

44
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:53.730
I feel like 70% of the time I'll just throw that stat out there.
You know,

45
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:57.600
I don't read right.
Um,
I loved the no call.

46
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:02.140
I wish that they would do that.
Um,
but other than that,

47
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:03.550
it was just a great fucking game.

48
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.430
And I liked it too because Seattle is kind of just played the game rather than

49
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.040
doing all that peacock and around every time they do something,

50
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.730
there was one guy,
that fat guy,
that nose tackle for Seattle.

51
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:14.680
I was fucking dying laughing on the plate.

52
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.880
That first drive the Patriots had where they just went right down the field and

53
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.290
gave him the old right there,
Fred.

54
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.250
Every fucking play was positive yardage except for one.

55
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.170
So we had like six,
seven plays in a row or were just crushing it,
15 yards,

56
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:32.380
10 yards,
eight yards,
20 yards right down the field.

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.100
If you judged the game on that first fucking drive,
you'd be like,
oh my God,

58
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:39.790
this is going to be a fucking landslide.
Right.
And then one plate,

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120
I think they handed it off to likely Garrett Blunt and he just runs in to the

60
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:50.221
offensive line for no gain in that fat dude stands up and he wags a finger like

61
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.410
mud tumble over at Belichick and the Patriots bench.

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.790
Hey,
all those other players are going to work,
but not that one.

63
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.200
Don't try that one.
It's the funniest shit ever to me.
But um,

64
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.091
you know,

65
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.880
it was an amazing game and I actually liked the fact that we lost to them,

66
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:11.170
even though they didn't have Bennett.
You know,

67
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:14.320
they were kind of hurt and we still lost to him and it was in our house,

68
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.320
you know.
Did I just say our house?
I'm sorry it was in our stadium.
Um,

69
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.390
it didn't bug me because if we meet them again in the playoffs,

70
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.590
I'd rather have lost the regular season game.
Um,
you know,

71
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:29.530
they always say that shit like,
you know,
you got a,

72
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.370
you always learn more during a loss.
I liked way better losing,

73
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.863
you know,

74
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
I think the biggest thing that fucked the 2007 Patriots undefeated regular

75
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.540
season Patriots was the fact that we were undefeated also.

76
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.430
Spygate everyone was just rooting against us.

77
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:50.431
I would have loved it so much more if we went into the playoffs 14 and two or 15

78
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.310
and one just to,
you know,
so everybody will didn't like,

79
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.300
didn't have such a chip on his shoulder to fucking play.
Um,

80
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.330
I can't even,
why the fuck I just made that point?
Oh,

81
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.450
I know why because I've seen so many times.
Like,

82
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.930
it's like you beat them in the regular season and then they see you a month or

83
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.080
two later and then they come back and beat you.
Giants did that to us.

84
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.730
The jets did it to us.
We beat them first.
No,
they beat us first.

85
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.140
Then we just steroid them at home and then a month later they beat us in the

86
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:24.460
playoffs.
And it's just kinda how it goes.
So,
uh,
I'm all right with it.

87
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.870
Um,

88
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.820
I'm still not too thrilled with our defense and uh,

89
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.040
can somebody,
by the way,

90
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.890
for the love of fucking God,

91
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.870
and I don't want to hear this from a fan,
I need it from a football coach.

92
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.100
Can somebody explain to me the prevent defense?

93
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.130
I know I've asked this before,
but for the love of God,

94
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.430
can somebody please explain to me at the half the Patriots score a touchdown

95
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.940
we're playing with these guys were covering,
they're not getting any big place.

96
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.160
We completely abandoned that.

97
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.550
This 59 seconds to go in the half,
we completely fucking abandoned that.

98
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.750
We start playing a zone defense or maybe we were playing zone up until then.

99
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:13.340
I don't know,
whatever the fuck we were doing was working.

100
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.400
We were in a zone defense giving them a 20 yard cushion.

101
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.930
Basically you can see a field goal.

102
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.780
Okay.
And we just,
in 59 seconds,

103
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.680
these fucking guys,
seven plays,

104
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.090
seven 75 yards in 59 fucking seconds

105
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.770
and the last plate for the touchdown watching that wide receiver going from one

106
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.390
zone to the defense to another.
You know what he look like,

107
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.470
you have a see when a fan just runs out on the field and he's just running by

108
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:51.290
players and they're just looking at them.
You know what I mean?

109
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.630
Cause it's all that's a fan security.
We'll handle that.

110
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.810
This fucking guy because of the prevent defense was standing by himself like a

111
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:05.450
yard out from the end zone if not on the end zone line waving his fucking arms.

112
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.960
I mean he might as well have been dressed in street clothes.

113
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.900
The level of like non coverages that is,

114
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.050
and I understand the concept behind the prevent defense is basically we'll give,

115
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:23.291
we'll give up the middle of the field will protect the sideline and they'll make

116
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:24.224
completions.

117
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.310
We'll tackle them and then they're going to somehow eat up this 59 fucking

118
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:33.020
seconds.
It never happens.
I swear to God,
I think it's a conspiracy.

119
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.180
It's a business move by the NFL.

120
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.930
It's to increase scoring slash add to the drama.

121
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.550
If another team is only up by one fucking score and the other team goes into a

122
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:46.180
prevent,

123
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.950
the game is going to end with three or four shots at the end zone or they're

124
00:07:50.951 --> 00:07:55.090
going to kick a field goal to try and win it.
It just,
it.

125
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.110
It just doesn't fucking work.
And you know what's funny?

126
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.950
So we go into the fucking prevent and they go right down the field.

127
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:05.750
Give us the all right there.
Fred.
Score of fucking touchdown.
All right,

128
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.880
very deflating.

129
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.600
No Pun intended for the Patriots is if we go into the locker room.
All right,

130
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.620
now we've got to kick off to Seattle.
We kick off to Seattle.
We played defense.

131
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.590
They go three and out.
It's like,

132
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:21.770
why the fuck did we do that before the half?
Sorry.

133
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.550
Half of this is emotionally only half as I smoked two cigarettes two nights in a

134
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:27.590
row.
Which I can't fucking do.
Um,

135
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.290
I don't understand that on any fucking level.
I also don't understand

136
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.350
when the end of the game,
Seattle scores a touchdown.

137
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:42.770
They go up by seven points.
Why wouldn't you just kick an extra point?

138
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.490
Go up by eight,
you're acting like a two point conversion.

139
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.760
Is it done deal?

140
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:53.420
Which is isn't which we saw when Seattle went to go for it and didn't get it

141
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.910
right.
Am I there?
Cause I kind of looked away from the screen.

142
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.780
Um,
they went for two there,
right?

143
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.120
And they didn't get it and then they were only up by one.
Maybe I'm,

144
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.640
maybe I'm wrong here.
I might be wrong if that's what happened.

145
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.370
Can somebody explain that move that they went to go up by two,

146
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:11.550
so they'd be up by a touchdown in a field goal rather than just go on,

147
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.600
let's go with the fucking 90 something percent thing and kick a fucking extra

148
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.434
point.

149
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.530
Go up by eight and make the Patriots not only have to score a touchdown but then

150
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.080
convert a fucking two point conversion

151
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.080
if that is in fact what happened.
Like I said,
I was on a plane and,
uh,
you know,

152
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.520
there was shit to fucking look around that.
Um,
and it also kind of like,

153
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.320
what I like to do is I like to,
uh,

154
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.440
I like to listen to like ACDC and shit like that when I'm on a plane.

155
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:41.790
So I listened to like the whole flick of the switch album while I was watching

156
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.490
the game.
It's actually pretty fucking cool.
Um,

157
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.110
and also you can actually just sort of watch the game and not getting nearly as

158
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:52.740
emotional,
you know,
because when your team is losing,

159
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:55.800
you start thinking that the announcers are against your team and vice versa and

160
00:09:55.801 --> 00:10:00.030
all that type of shit.
So I,
um,
I dunno,

161
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:01.680
but I thoroughly enjoyed that game.

162
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.570
I'm not one of those fucking fans that fucking,
you know,

163
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.110
his team loses and then thinks,
oh,
we got fucked and blah,
blah,
blah,

164
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:09.120
and all that bullshit.
Okay.
I don't,
uh,

165
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.940
I don't think that it was a fucking great game and I know you guys didn't have

166
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.890
Bennet and uh,
you know,
and it was great seeing two of the most fucking,

167
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.730
uh,
the two biggest cheetahs facing off with one another.

168
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:23.010
One guy gets all the press,
the other guy doesn't do you know,

169
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:27.500
Seattle since like 2010.
Um,
I think they recently got passed by the Redskins.

170
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.470
They were the most,
they had the most um,
people busted for uh,

171
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.440
taking roids.
You'd never know that they're in Seattle,
man.
They make coffee.

172
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:38.520
Nobody gives a fuck.

173
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.910
You do that where there's a little bit of foliage and all of a sudden it's a

174
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:46.860
fucking national story for fucking year and a half
because you let a cons.

175
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:51.090
Here's what the air out of a fucking ball.
It's hilarious.
It's amazing to me.
Um,

176
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.330
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
I uh,

177
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.800
I also got to do one of my favorite charitable events,
um,

178
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.800
other than the Patrice O'neal company benefit.
Um,
tickets are on sale.

179
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.380
They are on sale.
I will tweet out the link again today.

180
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.690
It's going to be at the New York City Center,

181
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.420
I believe February 21st I think it's a Tuesday bill.

182
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.170
It'd be Kinda Nice if he had the actual fucking information wouldn't it?

183
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.240
Clicking on the camera,
camera coupling on the calendar.
All right,

184
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.460
going in.
It's,
yes,
February 21st Bam.
Um,

185
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.410
I got to do the,
uh,
the comics come home event and uh,

186
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.870
this is a really special event for me because I got to do,

187
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.430
I did it 20 years ago was the first time I did it and think it was at the

188
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:39.930
Orpheum and I got to meet Cam Neely,
Chris and island was there.

189
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.440
I got to meet Dennis leary and I mean I was literally three and a half years in

190
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.630
my career and um,

191
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.160
it was such an unbelievable event to be a part of and I went out and thank God I

192
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.900
,
I,
I had a good set and I remember Larry called me and left a message.

193
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.660
I'm so bummed I wasn't home when he called me.
This is like 20 years ago.

194
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:01.790
So I didn't have a cell phone,
had an answering machine.
And I,
you know,
I,

195
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.330
I actually remember listening to the message like over and over again,

196
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.400
and he was like,
uh,
a bill.
It's a Dennis,
uh,
just want to say thank you,
uh,

197
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:10.780
you really fucking funny and,
uh,

198
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:14.080
you fucking killed this and thank you for [inaudible],
for doing it,
right,
guide,

199
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.600
fuck off.

200
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.340
And he just hung up and I listened to it like fucking 20 times in a row was so

201
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:22.960
fucking cool.
And,
um,
and I was also in a panic like,

202
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.000
oh fuck,
I didn't pick up the phone when he called.

203
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.140
Was that my big break we would have talked to,
would have became friends.

204
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.840
He would open all the doors for me.
You know,
those,

205
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.710
those over the top panic moments that you have when you're trying to make it in

206
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.740
this business that you think you every,
every little thing you think you blew it.

207
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.270
Um,
and you actually,
what she ended up realizing is this is not one thing.

208
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:47.740
It's a series of things all just building this fucking snowball that rolls down

209
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:51.550
the hill before you finally get there.
Um,
so anyways,
so I got to do it.

210
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.580
And,
uh,
it was Jay laughing.
It was his first one.
He did great.
Wendy Liebman,

211
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.090
uh,
Lenny clock with his fucking lime green pants.
Uh,

212
00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.350
probably going to forget some people,
Wanda Sykes,

213
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.580
Nick Depaulo than me than Bobby Kelly.
And uh,
that was cool cause we,

214
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:14.320
Bobby will close in and out and he's part of my standup graduation class.

215
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.100
And I remember when we both first got to do what we would,

216
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.230
we were in the Jay Larson spot,
the first guy out,
the new guy,

217
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.560
which is really hard because nobody knows who you are enough and you got to go

218
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:29.140
up.
And that was just the Orpheum in Larson went up at the fucking TD bank,

219
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:31.930
North Garden where the Bruins and Celtics play and he fucking killed,

220
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.840
look totally relaxed.
And I remember watching them going like,

221
00:13:34.841 --> 00:13:38.080
I wasn't that relaxed the first time I did it and was just in a,
in a theater.

222
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.460
And um,
you know,
it was cool.
I had some friends in there too though.

223
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:46.060
That was their first a comedy show they'd ever been to.
And let me,

224
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.440
let's just say they saw the gamut of everything that could possibly happen when

225
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.710
you go on stage.
Man,
it was a fucking a,
it was a fun night.

226
00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.640
It was a fun fucking night.
And uh,

227
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.350
you know,
and then afterwards everybody hung out and uh,

228
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.820
and I had these cigars that I brought and I was going,

229
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.780
I was saying to the people,
I say,
man,
we was there any place we can smoke these.

230
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.630
And one of the guys connected with the Bruins is like,
okay,

231
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.080
there's a room we can go to.
So we end up going to this like half locker room.

232
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.390
It wasn't a visitor locker room,
I don't know what the fuck it was.

233
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.420
And we went in there and we just let these things up and just told stories for

234
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:25.030
like fucking two hours.
The entire reason.

235
00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:29.260
I love smoking cigars and we were in there so long,
by the time we got out,

236
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.570
like uh,

237
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.990
they had broken down the stage and everything and they were setting it up I

238
00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:37.920
think for a Bruins game.
I couldn't tell if it was gonna be Bruins and Celtics.

239
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.250
It was sort of midway and just watching the bull gang or whatever they could,

240
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.480
they're called just set it up was so fucking cool,

241
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.560
are a little Uber fucking our little car service back to the hotel had left and

242
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.621
we were like,
yeah,
fuck it.

243
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.920
We were staying at the liberty so we just fucking walked around the corner and

244
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.820
uh,
it's fucking hilarious.
Just walking down the streets of Boston.

245
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.260
It fucking two in the morning on a Saturday night and every these fucking people

246
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:08.120
hammered almost a fight,
hear people screaming and yelling and shit.

247
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.050
And it's just like,
I dunno.
It's like God,
I remember this shit.

248
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.110
Fucking,
the energy of Boston is just,
it's so fucking unique.

249
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.690
It's really just like a,
I,

250
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:24.050
it took me a long time to pick up on it cause I was just in it.

251
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.913
You know what I mean?

252
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.250
It's kind of like if your car stinks when they see commercial where they say you

253
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:31.520
go nose blind,
you don't see it.
I kind of was like,
I dunno.

254
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.990
I couldn't see how fucking nuts Boston is,
but I've said it before.

255
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:40.370
Boston is like the sucker punch like capitol of the fucking world.

256
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:41.540
Like when you go into a Var,

257
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
you just add past a certain hour is this anger that settles it in the bar and

258
00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:50.580
you just feel it.
Somebody getting fucking,
something's going to happen,
right?

259
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.980
You always say that dog hair about ob.
Ah,

260
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.280
dod got fucking sack in a bio last night.
Um,

261
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.450
some kids suck at,
I mean,
he was wearing a fucking claddagh ring kit.

262
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.840
I'm not saying it's all like that,

263
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:09.710
but there's just as that at two in the morning,
that vibe exist.

264
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:12.440
I remember one time walking back from the Wilbur theater,

265
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.990
I can't remember where the fuck I was staying.
I was walking with Zeros.

266
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.570
I was like,
man,
I'm man.
I just want to walk,
you know,

267
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.330
just walk the city a little bit,
man.
I missed it.
All the memories,
you know,

268
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.471
back in the day,

269
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:24.710
going to Emerson College and commuting and taking the train in to go to fucking

270
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:28.970
Bruins,
Celtics red sox games and shit.
And uh,
I was walking in like,

271
00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:31.450
there was two of the angry fucking kids I've ever seen him in.

272
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.180
Like it was like these homeless people laying over the subway greats and they

273
00:16:35.181 --> 00:16:39.770
will fucking walking by him and they would just screaming,
wake up,

274
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.390
get a fucking job.
Like they were like so angry.

275
00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:48.320
They were like 30 yards in front of me and I was continuing to slow down cause I

276
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:53.120
was like,
if I'm even anywhere near this guy's orbit,
he's gonna want to fight me.

277
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.160
He was like that level of angry.

278
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.290
And of course his got his girlfriend who's trying to calm him down.
Oh my God,

279
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.640
stop it.
Just,
just go to the car.
What are you doing?

280
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.520
And he's fucking screaming and he's all fucking angry.

281
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.790
She's trying to fucking hold him and he's pulling away and shit.

282
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.320
So of course eventually he fucking sits down and he's just mean muggin everybody

283
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:19.760
coming by.
And I remember he yelled at me into Rosa and I'm just like,

284
00:17:19.761 --> 00:17:22.250
just keep walking.
Just keep fucking,
just fucking,

285
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.430
I don't know what it is.
I don't know if it's in the water.

286
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.300
I don't know what that is.
But we felt that vibe and uh,

287
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.410
and it was funny.
So we were actually walking back was me,

288
00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:41.411
Bobby and a couple of his buddies and I'm connected with the show,

289
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:45.740
right.
And we fucking walking back and uh,
we did that thing,
you know,

290
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.700
where it said don't walk.

291
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.260
And we were kind of standing in the street a little bit and these kids come

292
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:53.910
around the corner in this car,
the kid,
the jam packed with kids,
you know,

293
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.690
like everybody fucking pile did this kids fucking in the back seat.

294
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:02.280
He's got this awful fucking mustache.
It comes if you drive a bike,

295
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.050
yeah,
you're standing in this straight as he went by

296
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.330
and I could tell me and Bobby hadn't lived there in a long time and I just

297
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:13.430
looked at Bobby and I was just like,
you know,

298
00:18:13.431 --> 00:18:16.070
we were standing in the street and he's like,
yeah,
he was right

299
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.540
now back in the day that would've been,
fuck you,

300
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:23.430
you fucking mustachioed whatever.

301
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:26.580
And then they would have pulled over and then you want to go,
oh,

302
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:29.520
you weren't fucking go.
And everybody's taking their gold chains off.

303
00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:31.920
That was the eighties,
the eighties when he had gold chains.

304
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240
And right before the fight,

305
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:36.960
everybody's like taking their gold shade off and handed it to your girlfriend.

306
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.400
Keep your rings on,
take your chains off dude.
Um,

307
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.720
yeah,
so it was always great to be back there and uh,
I didn't get to,

308
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.100
I came up to it so quickly.

309
00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:53.320
I didn't get a chance to go to some of the old food haunts,

310
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.970
but my mother made some beef stew before I left,
so that was great.

311
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:58.690
I hung around for like a day,
like an asshole.

312
00:18:58.691 --> 00:19:01.200
I hung around until like six at night thinking that I didn't look that thought

313
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:04.390
the Patriots game was a,
uh,
was an afternoon game.
But I got,
uh,
like I said,

314
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:08.140
I got to watch it on the,
uh,
on the um,

315
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.470
on the fucking ah,
on the plane,
on the airplane.
Nam.
Um,

316
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.710
so anyways.
All right,
let's get into,
let's read a little bit of advertising here.

317
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.360
Um,
I have not watched the fucking Formula One race yet.

318
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.840
I know Lewis Hamilton won and he's closing the gap.

319
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:29.870
So you people who have not watched fucking Formula One all year.

320
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:32.840
I think the last one's in Abu Dhabi or some shit of Dubai.

321
00:19:32.841 --> 00:19:34.880
I don't know where the fuck it is.
All right,

322
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.240
but this one is going to determine

323
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.870
the fucking window.
I think a Nico,
all these guys do is,

324
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:47.070
is just come in third place.
If he just does that,

325
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:51.930
he's going to win it.
And uh,
Louis obviously needs to win the fucking race,

326
00:19:51.931 --> 00:19:55.860
but it's kind of cool that it's coming down to the last one.
Um,
anyways,

327
00:19:55.861 --> 00:20:00.350
let me get to the fucking advertise.
I have to hum my pipe,

328
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.570

or else I won't be able to talk and fucking,

329
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.050

330
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.650
<v 0>here we go.
All right,

Okay.
Back to the podcast.
So anyways,
um,

412
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.680
yes.
Why didn't get a chance to fucking race was in Brazil.

413
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.460
I got to taped at home.
I can't wait to see it cause it was raining.
And uh,

414
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:28.820
that's one of the coolest things I find about a formula one racing is that it's

415
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:32.030
like football.
They don't give a shit,
you know,
if it's raining or not,

416
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:35.270
they're going to keep that going to keep racing.
And uh,
I think that's cool.

417
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.890
Then adds all this extra elements to the race.
And um,
you know,

418
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:42.110
it's like when two teams like my team's favored by 14,

419
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:44.480
and all of a sudden it starts fucking rain and out.
Everybody started slip,

420
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:46.610
slide around.
You got yourself a good game.

421
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.150
I thought that this was going to be a landslide one way or the other.

422
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.500
Like Hillary Clinton.
I still can't believe Donald Trump won.

423
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.720
I still cannot fucking believe that.
Um,

424
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.090
a reality show TV star got fucking elected.

425
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.990
No Jj,
um,

426
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.660
to the worst fucking candidates ever to fucking face each others in my uncle

427
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:16.310
fucking opinion.
Boy,
what the fuck do I know?

428
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.420
Evidently I know a lot considering a lot of the fucking emails I got and all

429
00:26:20.421 --> 00:26:25.090
this shit on Twitter.
I've got a lot of shit from my parents on loan,
uh,
Conant,

430
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.610
which I gotta be honest with you guys,
was not a fucking easy one to do.

431
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.420
It was the day after the election.
Everyone was in shock,
I think,

432
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:35.990
including Trump supporters because I went back east and I talked to a couple of

433
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:37.970
friends of mine and they voted for Trump.
And I was like,
dude,

434
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.440
I can't believe that guy wanted.
And they were like,
yeah,

435
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:43.390
I can't fucking believe it either.
So I dunno.

436
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.410
Maybe this is like when the Patriots beat the rams,
I have no fucking idea.

437
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.250
But anyways,
that was not an easy,
uh,

438
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.250
an easy spot to be in,
you know,

439
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.570
and I stayed true to who I was and uninformed jackass who can't fucking read out

440
00:26:57.571 --> 00:26:59.670
loud,
who's in conspiracy theory.

441
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.140
I talked about Hillary dressing up like a Yak and fucking people under a

442
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:04.974
mountain.

443
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.290
I talked about Trump being a dope and that whole ridiculous shit about building

444
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:13.710
a fucking wall.
I trashed them both equally.

445
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:18.540
But you know people who vote for colors,
right?
You got a blue tie,

446
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:22.500
you can say nothing wrong.
You got a red tie.
You can't do anything wrong.
Right.

447
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.240
I got so much fucking shit.
It's so amazing how people hear things.

448
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.120
I actually might point in all of that was like,
you know,

449
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.650
it'd be kind of cool if we all just stop yelling at each other.
All right.

450
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.560
All right.
If you guys,
if you want to hear my fucking theories,
this is my theory.

451
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:41.481
Okay.

452
00:27:41.481 --> 00:27:46.481
I think Trump got in because of eight years of Obama and the progressive left

453
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:51.360
and I think they got in because of eight years of George Bush and I think and

454
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.070
Bush and Cheney and I think they got in because of eight years of Clinton and I

455
00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:59.900
think Clinton got in because of 12 years of Reagan and Bush.
It just,

456
00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:02.660
it just keeps,
it goes like way conservative.

457
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:07.220
And then it goes way fucking liberal and then it goes way conservative.

458
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.610
You know what I mean?
I mean,
think about where America was,
right?

459
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.230
Where when Bush and Cheney were there,
all right.

460
00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:20.290
And then six years later or so during Obama's presidency,

461
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.040
like Bruce Jenner transitioned,

462
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.870
got her own show and was named woman of the year k.

463
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.640
Now that is not something that you would think could happen in oh seven,

464
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.680
six years later,
boom.
That's where the fuck it's act.
And I don't know.
And what I,

465
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.870
that's my problem with both sides is the way they ran their ideology down your

466
00:28:45.221 --> 00:28:46.054
fucking throat.

467
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.920
And that if you have a difference of an opinion,

468
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.600
you know,
on the right,
it's usually,
it means you're against America.

469
00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.640
You don't support the troops.
And a,
you're a socialist.

470
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.620
And on the left,
if you don't agree with them,
you're a cave man.

471
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.740
You're a fucking sexist.
You're a racist,

472
00:29:08.741 --> 00:29:12.060
you're a homophobia or any of those fucking things.
Uh,

473
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.390
but both sides equally try to get you to lose your job.

474
00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:21.340
And they try to destroy your ability to earn a living because of your beliefs.

475
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.310
And for the life of me as confusing as the prevent defense is,

476
00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:32.311
can somebody please explain to me how if somebody says something politically or

477
00:29:32.681 --> 00:29:35.920
socially that you don't agree with,
um,

478
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.390
spawning a movement to get them to lose their fucking job.

479
00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.040
How that that person,

480
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.220
I'm more supportive of the troops.
America,
less of a socialist,

481
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:52.480
whatever the fuck it is you think they are or how that makes them less racist,

482
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:57.260
less homophobic.
Like,
um,

483
00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:01.730
I dunno,
I I that doesn't work.
Yelling at people taking away their jobs.

484
00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:02.901
You know what I mean?

485
00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:07.850
It's like a way back when the Dixie chicks criticized George Bush the fucking

486
00:30:07.851 --> 00:30:09.920
right.
All of a sudden they're there.

487
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.580
They pressured radio stations to not play their music.

488
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:18.581
They will do up fucking running over this cds with steam rollers and you know,

489
00:30:19.731 --> 00:30:22.160
people like,
dude,
what the fuck you going a little far?
It's like,
no,

490
00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:25.400
they had a right to say that we had a right to respond.
It's tit for tat.

491
00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:28.970
It's like,
that's not tit for tat.
You know,

492
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
tit for tat is they trashed George Bush.

493
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.500
You defend George Bush and you trash them.

494
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.910
Trying to systematically destroy their career and their ability to make a living

495
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.620
is not tit for tat.

496
00:30:40.621 --> 00:30:44.370
That's like somebody flicks you fucking ear and then you took out a fucking

497
00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:48.030
knife and cut.
They're trying to cut the juggler.
So,

498
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:54.030
and personally speaking,
I think both sides are,
uh,

499
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.350
are really guilty of that.

500
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.760
They're really guilty when you get really far left and you get really far left

501
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.271
right there,

502
00:31:00.271 --> 00:31:05.271
really guilty of just a bully people and they're so fucking wrapped up in that

503
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.310
they're so goddamn right about everything that they really become condescending

504
00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.700
in sufferable assholes.
And um,

505
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.880
I dunno.
So I try to,

506
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.030
I try to stay in the middle cause I would never tell you who the fuck to vote

507
00:31:21.031 --> 00:31:21.630
for,

508
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.630
nor did I ever on this thing unlike what most people saw.

509
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.530
Dude,
I got people on fucking Twitter.
It's hilarious.
Like they just sit in there.

510
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.431
First of all,

511
00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:34.610
they think they know me because they watched me on a talk show and then they

512
00:31:34.611 --> 00:31:37.280
think they know how I bought,
like the amount of people that dot.

513
00:31:37.281 --> 00:31:39.230
I voted for Trump.

514
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.660
And then the amount of people that thought I voted for Hillary,

515
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:45.380
all the Trump people think I voted for fucking Hillary.
And all the Trump,

516
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.170
all the Hillary people think I voted for Trump.

517
00:31:48.171 --> 00:31:50.720
I didn't vote for either one of them.
I told you guys right along,

518
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:56.150
Bernie Sanders was my fucking guy.
That was my fucking guy.

519
00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:02.740
And watching him getting boxed out by the media because they felt Hillary had

520
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:08.941
more of a chance and they didn't give a shit that they would just voting just

521
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:10.840
more of the same,
more of the same.

522
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.040
<v 2>MMM.</v>

523
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.780
<v 0>The only thing I will commend what the right is,</v>

524
00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:19.130
they got their Bernie Sanders in.
I mean,
the guy's a fucking shit show.

525
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:20.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

526
00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.320
<v 0>But at least,
you know,
at least they stuck by their rebel.</v>

527
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.530
I wish that they had done that with,

528
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.190
I would have loved to seen Bernie against fucking Donald Trump.

529
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.410
I think Bernie would have had a better shot.

530
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.890
I just think the Clintons had too much fucking baggage,
you know?

531
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.510
And even as a Clinton supporter,
you know,
that's fucking true.

532
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.620
How little did Bill Clinton talked during that whole fucking time?

533
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.720
He didn't talk at all.

534
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.290
This is a former fucking president who had a successful presidency.
Immediate.
No,

535
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:53.630
he got impeached for sticking us to go lying about,
you know,
Monica Lewinsky.

536
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.580
He didn't talk like Al Gore lost to George Bush.
You know,

537
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.580
he didn't use Bill Clinton.
He goes,
I gotta get the fuck away from you,
dude.

538
00:33:01.581 --> 00:33:05.330
You're a fucking nightmare.
You're a fucking nightmare.

539
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.190
You're a political fucking nightmare.

540
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:11.260
And the dude's on wife had to do the exact same fucking thing.

541
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.313
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

542
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.040
<v 0>They add a ton of fucking baggage,
you know,
and,</v>

543
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:21.150
and Hillary supporters won't fucking look at it objectively at the same way

544
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.220
Trump supporters won't look at that.
I mean,

545
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.330
<v 2>um,
I dunno.</v>

546
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.200
<v 0>It's just,
it's a fucked up time.
But I will tell you this though,</v>

547
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.880
at the time for screaming and yelling at each other is over.
I feel,

548
00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.910
and it would be nice is if those people who aren't crazy fucking left in crazy,

549
00:33:40.391 --> 00:33:45.250
right,
could kind of maybe a break bread a little bit,
um,

550
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.950
which I don't think it's going to happen because um,

551
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.060
of eight years of Obama in eight years of progressive,

552
00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.950
the progressive left becoming word police and uh,

553
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.870
and,
and,
um,

554
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.440
social police and idea police and all of this stuff telling you what the fuck

555
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:11.300
you supposed to think about everything and what you're supposed to say and what

556
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.351
we're just supposed to use.

557
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:16.610
And I really think it's overly simplifying saying that the right voted the way

558
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:21.410
they did because they want to say homophobic and racial slurs.

559
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.590
Just turning people into it.
That's like both of them.

560
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:26.240
They always turn each other into like a cartoon.

561
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:29.540
Like you have even noticed like whenever like a Democrat gets in the right,

562
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:32.300
totally overreacts and like it's going to be socialism.

563
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.960
It's going to be like cognitives Russia.

564
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.650
There's going to be terrorists running down the fucking street,
you know?

565
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.680
And then whenever anybody in the right gets in,
it's always like,

566
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.920
this is like Germany in 1935 every fucking time they say that every fucking

567
00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:57.710
time.
I'm not saying that one of those times it won't be fucking true,

568
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.830
but they say it every fucking time and they completely freak the fuck out.

569
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.560
And um,
I don't know.
And then when they get in,

570
00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:09.110
they ran their ideologies down the other person's throat.

571
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.790
They have zero empathy for somebody else.
They have zero empathy for how,

572
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.200
uh,
people want to raise their kids and they just,
both sides.

573
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.940
They just like were 100% right.

574
00:35:19.941 --> 00:35:23.970
And now you're going to fucking take this write down the throat and a,
I dunno,

575
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.060
they,
each election,
I think the pendulum keeps swinging father and father,

576
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.770
but even if you're not fucking Democrat,

577
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.220
you have to be proud of the last eight fucking years.
I mean,

578
00:35:34.221 --> 00:35:38.660
at least there was no cigars and policies.
There was no,
uh,

579
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.480
they have weapons of mass destruction.
Oops,
we can't find any.
Oh,

580
00:35:42.481 --> 00:35:46.350
now it's a liberation.
There was none of that shit.
Right.

581
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.930
Who knows who the fuck?
I don't know what's going to happen,
but uh,
you know,

582
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.850
I'm not comfortable with this result than anybody else,
but you,

583
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:59.550
you wouldn't know that from all these fucking things,
these emails,
these,

584
00:35:59.551 --> 00:36:02.760
I'll read you two.
I'll try to get through these next two emails that I got.

585
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:06.810
This is classic
like political shit.

586
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:10.110
How people like,
they just hear what they want to hear,
right?

587
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.020
So this guy writes me in.
This guy is basically,

588
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:18.021
I think a blaming me in a roundabout way for Donald Trump getting in because God

589
00:36:19.081 --> 00:36:22.620
knows that's the kind of power the Monday morning podcast has,
you know,

590
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.420
couple hundred thousand downloads.
I mean,
that's it,
dude.
That's it.

591
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.190
I can't believe I don't have secret service security right outside my door as I

592
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.024
do this.

593
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:37.230
I'm literally a podcast where I talk about fucking sports.

594
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:40.860
90% of the time I'll talk about conspiracy theory.
I say,
I'm an idiot.

595
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:43.800
I can't read out loud.
You know,

596
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.280
this guy for some reason is choosing to ignore all of this.
I'm going to say,

597
00:36:47.281 --> 00:36:51.000
because the person he wanted didn't get in.
So here we go.
Dear freckles.

598
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.690
I'm no rocket scientist.
All right.
Immediately going self deprecating.

599
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.880
Neither are you okay.
Uh,
great.

600
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.070
And I think it's assume it's safe to assume the large majority of your listeners

601
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.320
aren't either.
Um,
unlike you.
I would never speak for them.
I don't know.

602
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:11.220
I don't know who they are.
Okay.
About,
you know,

603
00:37:11.221 --> 00:37:15.150
if you want to assume that to continue on with your point,
I'll go along with it.

604
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.770
Most are like me,

605
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.880
average middle class person has not done one fucking ounce of research for this.

606
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:24.120
But this is,
this is,
this is how we build points.
This is how I build a point.

607
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.350
Most of like me,

608
00:37:25.351 --> 00:37:30.270
average middle class folk who laugh like a laugh twice a week from our favorite

609
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:35.220
comedian say this.
This is laying the groundwork.
I feel an overhand right coming.

610
00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.930
Uh,
you have swayed my opinion on several things over the years out.
Jesus,

611
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:40.920
most notably,

612
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.160
I went from a Patriot hater to someone who supports them and agrees they are

613
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:49.590
unfairly scrutinized by the league and other teams.

614
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.571
Isn't that amazing?

615
00:37:51.571 --> 00:37:55.920
So I guess if I could sway you on the amount of air that should be in a
football,

616
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:59.460
I could sway you on who you're going to pick for the leader of the free world.

617
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.590
Yeah,
I can see that's the same.
You know,
I,
I,
I totally see that point.

618
00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:08.280
I don't think there's any sort of giant body of water that you're leaping over

619
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:11.010
there.
I don't know.
Okay.
Here we go.
When I realized,

620
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.580
when I realized how much your opinions of influence me,

621
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:19.890
I realized how much they might influence others.
Okay,

622
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:23.130
here's,
here's the big failure here buddy.
Okay.

623
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:26.580
You didn't agree with me on the Patriots.
I brought you around.

624
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.630
You didn't agree with me with my,

625
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.960
my political opinion on Hillary Clinton.
You didn't change.

626
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.190
You know,

627
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.060
I think that I can bring your fucking opinion around about using those Savy Save

628
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.270
,
fuck you fuck cards and your everyday bullshit life.

629
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.860
But when I think it comes down to electing the leader of the free world,

630
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.660
I think you go a little bit beyond the Monday morning podcast

631
00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.460
or the Thursday afternoon just before Friday,

632
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.810
Monday morning podcast where I scream,

633
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:02.470
I'm just checking in on you like a fucking idiot for half a minute.

634
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.500
All right,
so here we,
here we goes with this dizzy,
he's laid.
See,
he came out,

635
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:13.120
I'm no rocket scientist.
Self deprecating,
okay.
Then he goes,

636
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.740
uh hey.
Now he just goes,
well,

637
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:19.150
I'm going to assume that this is what your listeners are without doing any sort

638
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:21.130
of research and then I'm going to go,
Oh,

639
00:39:21.131 --> 00:39:25.510
you swayed me on this fucking basic bullshit horseshit.

640
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.170
That means actually nothing.
Therefore you could sway me on something.

641
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.030
That means you know

642
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.780
Jesus Christ to you walk through the mall and there's somebody sitting there

643
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:38.590
going,
hey buddy,
can I talk to you for a second?
This is a self fan.
Look at this.

644
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:40.270
You can spray some spreads her in and blah,
blah blah,

645
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:45.010
and I'll send you buy some little impulse buy thing.
Then then with your theory,

646
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:48.480
that guy could also get you to vote for who the fuck he wants you to vote for.

647
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.320
Anyways,
continuing on,
when I realized how much your opinion influenced me,

648
00:39:53.321 --> 00:39:57.520
I realized how much they might influence others and how these influences might

649
00:39:57.521 --> 00:40:01.120
have much larger implications than the NFL.

650
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:06.280
Call me crazy.
But it seems like you're going into paranoia now.
Um,

651
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.450
after your polls said that your person was going to win and now you're sitting

652
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:14.550
there with your jaw on the ground and now you're looking for escape goat in the

653
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.250
air.
I am a 48 year old bald,

654
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.060
pasty fucking red head.
There's an easy target.
Let's go after him.

655
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.290
I love it buddy.
Let's do it.
Fucking tar and feather me.
Here we go.

656
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.300
You have consistently and foolishly best bashed Hillary so much more.

657
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:34.270
So much more than you have Trump.
Hilarious,
right?

658
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.310
So much more than Trump.

659
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:40.480
I have an entire chunk of material on Donald Trump and Trump was so fucking
easy.

660
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:42.520
I felt guilty when I was on stage.

661
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.030
I did it when I was on Conan about building the fucking wall.

662
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:50.440
How ridiculous an idea that is,
how much money that was going to be.

663
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.830
I did all of that.
I always called them a dope.

664
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.460
I always called him a reality TV show.

665
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:02.230
Star didn't even remotely respect him as a businessman.
I said,

666
00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:04.420
I didn't believe that he was a billionaire.
I said,

667
00:41:04.421 --> 00:41:07.990
I don't think that he could get your six grand in cash if he gave him six or

668
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:11.320
seven weeks.
I thought he was completely leveraged out.

669
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:17.440
I made fun of his hair.
I made fun how we didn't say anything to anybody.

670
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:21.490
He never said anything.
It was the most fascinating thing I've ever seen.

671
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.230
He would go like,
fucking a,
I'm gonna do this.
I'm going to do that.

672
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.560
Some would be like,
how are you going to do that?
And we'd be like,
oh,
you'll see.

673
00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.280
You'll see.
I was doing a bit in my ACO.
I want to use that with my wife.

674
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:38.420
Just make all these outrageous claims about what a great husband I'm going to
be.

675
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.190
And then when she gives me shit I,
well,

676
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:43.370
what are you going to do and improve yourself.
I'll,
you'll see.
You'll see,
no,

677
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:45.890
you need to tell me why I'm not going to give away my strategies,

678
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.780
then you'll steal them.
I did all of that.
Right.

679
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.870
And then Hillary,
I said that she was part of the Bilderberg group.

680
00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:57.020
I talked about the Hillary Foundation and how they fucking been living off of

681
00:41:57.021 --> 00:41:59.930
that shit.
They threw a $3 million wedding for their daughter.

682
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.950
All of that type of shit.
All over fucking felony charges and everything,

683
00:42:03.951 --> 00:42:06.590
which of course,
all Hillary supporters are like,
those were unfounded.

684
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:09.590
They were not proven yet with fucking Donald Trump.

685
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.260
Six or seven people say that he sexually assaulted them,

686
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:17.261
which I fucking believe I believe that to that girl when she went get real,

687
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.450
which I also said on the podcast and I was like,
dude,

688
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:24.080
he definitely did that shit.
You didn't hear all any of this shit,
did you sir?

689
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.790
You know why?
Because,

690
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:30.200
because you got fucking blue tie stuck in your fucking ears.

691
00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.470
All right,
let's go.
Continuing to blame me.
Alright.
Um,

692
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.650
I evidently got so much more,
I trashed Hillary,
uh,
the entire election.

693
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:44.810
You have unfairly focused hate on her.
And at the end of your tirade,
you tack on,

694
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.880
Oh,
and he's a cunt to uh,

695
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:50.780
you don't seem to realize the influence you have on people who listened to you

696
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:55.730
twice a week,
every week.
Sir,
you've done nothing to prove that I have influence.

697
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.080
This is,

698
00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.280
this is all something that you built in your head when you are hyperventilating

699
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.420
that this fucking monster got into the office.
All right?

700
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:11.190
And Hillary's a month's to two.
Okay.

701
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.890
And that right there was my all when she's a con too,

702
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:15.570
I didn't like either one of these people.

703
00:43:15.571 --> 00:43:18.210
And that was my message throughout all of this.
Okay.

704
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.660
And that's just my fucking opinion.
What's,
I'm allowed to have our night.

705
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.710
Alright.
You most likely,

706
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.120
you most likely influenced at least one voter to vote for Donald Trump.

707
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.490
And for that you should be fucking ashamed,
dude.

708
00:43:32.491 --> 00:43:34.170
This is all fucking conspiracy theory.

709
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.020
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

710
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.010
<v 0>because you chose,</v>

711
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.840
you got somebody to cast one vote for the person that I didn't vote for.

712
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:46.930
You should be fucking ashamed because I only see the faults of the guy with the

713
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:51.740
red tie and I don't see any faults with the person with the Blue Blouse.

714
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.080
Alright,
you are a,
you are so stupid.
Here we go.

715
00:43:57.081 --> 00:44:00.590
This is all be great to get somebody,
somebody to listen to your opinion.

716
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.970
Usually what she should do,
you usually should end with the insult.

717
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:09.560
Say your point and then you tag on your fucking ass hole because then they'll at

718
00:44:09.561 --> 00:44:13.490
least hear your point.
But if you start to see if you've front end load,

719
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.301
all right,

720
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:18.860
you are so stupid that in one sentence you go from saying how they never talk

721
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:22.310
about this issue or that issue.
Then conclude by saying,

722
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.540
but I haven't watched any of the debates are kept up on this at all.

723
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.680
You fucking idiot.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.

724
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:36.210
You don't think that Trump supporters didn't say the same thing they did buddy

725
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:39.810
cause I got the,
I have the exact same fucking email from the other side.

726
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.553
All right.

727
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:46.560
Which with my theory that I'll now use that also has no research behind it.

728
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:49.560
I would say that you guys all sort of canceled each other out.

729
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.580
So whatever influence I had,
I influenced somebody the other way too.

730
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.080
So I am completely exonerated here.
And if you look at the popular vote,

731
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:03.010
it was almost right down the fucking middle.
So there you go.
So you,

732
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.670
he calls me a fucking idiot.
All right.
Uh,

733
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:10.170
they never talk about climate change is something you've said on Monday.
Uh,

734
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.140
the day before the election,
you have no clue what you're talking about.
Well,

735
00:45:14.141 --> 00:45:18.360
first of all,
I said they never do.
I didn't say that one or the other.

736
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.240
So that was an even handed one,
right?
She goes,
click it.

737
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:25.260
Clinton has made it a major point and supports the Paris agreement.
Uh,

738
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.430
nothing I ever saw.
She made it a major point.
She's commented on it.

739
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.970
It goes to the Paris agreement.
Not that you even know what the fuck that is.

740
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.560
You freckled fuck.
Of course.
See this guy once again,
making assumptions.

741
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:40.410
I know what the Paris agreement is.
I've seen it on the daily show.

742
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.980
I saw when they all talked about it,
I saw when they went there in the right,

743
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:47.520
finally said,
and I actually talked about this on the podcast,

744
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.010
sir,
when the right went there,
then they finally said,

745
00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:53.873
okay,

746
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.320
after denying it they finally said global warming does exist but it's too late

747
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:01.650
to do anything about it now.
All right.

748
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.190
I believe I compared that to when Pete rose finally admitted that he been on

749
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:08.190
baseball and said,
now can you let me in the hall of fame.

750
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.490
I distinctly remember saying that,
not that you remember that sir,

751
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.390
cause you got your blue bonnets stuffed in your fucking ear.
Right.

752
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:21.770
I also actually looked up weeks ago like when did people first start talking

753
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:24.810
about climate change?

754
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.480
As I was driving down the street and I was listening and they was saying,

755
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:29.940
you know,
I would drove,
drove down the street that morning.

756
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:32.100
I heard that on NPR they say,

757
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.070
scientists say the Great Barrier Reef is now dead.

758
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.650
And then they went on to talk about the cubs,

759
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.630
which is course struck me as funny that the whole rest of the report should have

760
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:46.530
been about that or that swirl a trash in the Pacific Ocean and all that shit,

761
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.160
which none of these guys really talk about.
They do a little bit of lip service,

762
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.030
that's about it.
But they're not going to fucking do anything about it.

763
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:58.410
And even if they try to,
they can't because these corporations own them,

764
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.870
which is why I like the fucking,
the lunatic guys.

765
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.000
I never vote for the fucking main people.
I don't know.
Whatever,
whatever.

766
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.330
Let's just plow ahead.
So anyways,
yeah,

767
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:13.710
I actually looked it up and the first time climate change is brought up,

768
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:18.711
somebody had like a theory before it was even happening was projecting that the

769
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.390
population kept growing,
that it was,

770
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.020
the theory was that we would heat up the plant and they did that in the early 18

771
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:29.110
hundreds I couldn't believe it.
And then there was a few more things about it.

772
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.250
I can't remember,
this was weeks ago,

773
00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:34.360
but like in the late fifties was the first definitive papers saying since the

774
00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:35.410
1950s,

775
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:39.550
scientists had been telling people that the pollutions and shit that we've been

776
00:47:39.551 --> 00:47:42.310
putting in the air or whatever.
Like I'm not a scientist,
okay.

777
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.140
I am just a regular guy,
but I read,

778
00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:49.310
they have known about it or had the attention called to it since the late 1950s.

779
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:55.000
Okay.
So I'm not as,
I am a moron,
but I'm not as dumb

780
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.700
as you think I am,
sir.

781
00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.510
And one of the reasons why I underplay myself is because I don't want to be

782
00:48:02.511 --> 00:48:06.880
another fucking jerk off
who's just fucking,
you know,

783
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.860
getting in your fucking ear like some people in my business.

784
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:15.030
Okay.
So anyways,
he goes,
uh,

785
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:19.710
Trump has said repeatedly that climate change is a hoax that was created by the

786
00:48:19.711 --> 00:48:23.670
Chinese.
He said,
he said it repeatedly.
Um,
I'm going to look up the Internet,

787
00:48:23.671 --> 00:48:26.230
see how many times he repeatedly said that.
Um,

788
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.900
usually when people say repeatedly,

789
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:32.640
it means it's a quote that somebody said like seven years ago.
Um,
one time.

790
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:37.380
All right.
And yet you blindly,
ignorantly spew your unfounded bullshit.
Dude,

791
00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:39.180
you just define this podcast.

792
00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.680
Why are you acting like this is meet the press?
He goes,
I'm not a genius.

793
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:47.270
Always back to being humble again.

794
00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.240
I'm not a genius as you call me a fucking idiot.
All right.

795
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.520
I'm not a political scientist now.
He's doing humble pie.
He's got his hands up,

796
00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.320
but I took just a few hours out of my life to research both of their positions

797
00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:04.430
on crucial issues and get an understanding of them.
Oh yeah,
I never did that.

798
00:49:04.431 --> 00:49:09.431
I didn't do that at all and I'm not the one speaking to thousands of people

799
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.570
twice a week.

800
00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:16.190
You should truly be horrified at the thought you had anything to do with this

801
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:18.980
fucking train wreck.
I love how you your,
do you,

802
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.620
do you think that Hillary has any responsibility

803
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:28.030
for the campaign that she ran?
I mean from day one,

804
00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.890
her campaign could not use an unbelievable asset,

805
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.850
which was former president,
Bill Clinton,

806
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:43.420
because of all of the shit show that that guy was both professionally and in his

807
00:49:44.511 --> 00:49:46.850
personal life,
her husband,

808
00:49:46.851 --> 00:49:51.500
it was a former president that was wildly popular.
She couldn't even use the guy.

809
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.970
Okay.
Because of all the fucking skeletons in his fucking closet,

810
00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:59.780
you know,
and together they both had skeletons.
You know,

811
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.670
it's a very polarizing candidate that should pick.

812
00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:07.850
And I thought in key moments,
you know,

813
00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.930
where she really couldn't come up with something clever to say she didn't have

814
00:50:11.931 --> 00:50:16.850
it.
Look,
sir,
be honest with me.
What really gets you into office,

815
00:50:16.851 --> 00:50:21.350
your policy or playing the saxophone on fucking Arsenio Hall

816
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:27.500
are not sticking your head out of a tank and looking like a fucking dope or too

817
00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:30.290
excited and going.
Yeah,
I mean,

818
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:33.810
that's the kind of shit that brings people down more so than anything else in to

819
00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:36.500
,
that's not my fault.
If you want to fucking blame me for that,

820
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.470
but that is the truth.
So you can actually win an election.
Like,

821
00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:43.010
he just saw that fucking dope Trump do without saying a fucking thing,

822
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.250
but being good at trash in somebody fucking shirt,

823
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:50.720
which is basically how he got in promising a bunch of shit,

824
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.780
not saying what he was going to do and then go look at that guy down there and

825
00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:55.850
he's fucking clueless and everybody's just laughing.

826
00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:59.920
Hillary didn't have any of that.
She had no fucking swagger.

827
00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:04.090
She just do remember when she did that hot sauce moment on that fucking radio

828
00:51:04.091 --> 00:51:07.540
show and uh,
the host was going,

829
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:11.560
everybody that was African American and she goes,
what's your favorite?
You know,

830
00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.690
once you go to thing,
what are you always carry around with you?

831
00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.220
And she said hot sauce,
which evidently was true.
Okay.

832
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.250
But immediately looked like she was pandering and the guy said,

833
00:51:21.251 --> 00:51:22.570
are you just trying to pander?

834
00:51:23.530 --> 00:51:27.400
Sounds to me like you just trying to pander to black people and rather than just

835
00:51:27.401 --> 00:51:30.520
saying like,
Nah man,
I like it.
I've been blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
She goes,

836
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.290
is it working?

837
00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:34.523
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.600
<v 0>Well that right did the,
why the fuck would you say that?</v>

839
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.200
Why would you say it?

840
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.070
And when I saw her say that I immediately as soon as that she's,

841
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.260
she is pandering and then people will go in like,
well actually it's true.

842
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.880
And then I looked it up and I go,
oh it is fucking true.
But still,

843
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:52.163
this is the thing,

844
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:56.220
if I was really in the fucking hot sauce and I was fucking running and I was on

845
00:51:56.221 --> 00:51:57.240
an all black radio station,

846
00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.990
I wouldn't have brought it up cause it would've looked like pandering.

847
00:52:00.991 --> 00:52:02.880
And then if I did bring it up,
sorry about my voice,

848
00:52:02.881 --> 00:52:04.020
I sound like rode through puberty here.

849
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.320
Even if I did brought it up then I would have been honest about it.
But like,
no,

850
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:10.980
I know it sounds like a pandering,
but there are some crossover things.

851
00:52:10.981 --> 00:52:12.480
I actually really enjoy it.

852
00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.753
<v 2>So</v>

853
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.450
<v 0>you mean you got,
you got,
she has to take some sort of the responsibility that,</v>

854
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.660
you know,
she couldn't beat this fucking nitwit.
Um,
all right.

855
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:28.580
Over 300 of the top economists.
I'm not saying that she's not an evil to

856
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:35.330
over 300 of the top economists,
including eight Nobel laureates,

857
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.400
came together to say,
I didn't know if I said that right,

858
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.540
that a Trump presidency would mean turmoil in the American.

859
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.030
And as a result,
the world's economy,

860
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.980
over 350 of the best scientists in the world came together to say his presidency

861
00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:52.250
would be a disaster for the entire planet because of his dangerous stance on

862
00:52:52.251 --> 00:52:53.084
climate change.

863
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.860
Not to mention Russia literally threw a party in the polymer building as soon as

864
00:52:57.861 --> 00:53:00.470
Trump was elected.
That actually I'm happy.

865
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.160
I like when Russia in the United States are unfriendly fucking terms.

866
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:08.510
It would be nice that we're not going in a direction to fucking keep pointing

867
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:09.470
missiles at one another.

868
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.063
<v 2>MMM.</v>

869
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.480
<v 0>And you know,
for as much as,
uh,
Al Gore,
Al Gore,</v>

870
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:21.650
I loved his stance on climate change.
He wasn't able to get a fucking thing done.

871
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.040
He wasn't able to stop it.
He wanted to fucking,
uh,

872
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.570
you get a few policies in there,
they just ignore it.

873
00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:30.450
And these guys are only in there for 48 years.
They just wait him out.

874
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:33.420
I remember when Al Gore want to have a car that got a hundred miles to a gallon.

875
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.050
I was excited.
I was in my twenties I wanted to buy the car.

876
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.600
They just kept delaying it and delaying and delaying it.

877
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:40.710
And then they got on office.

878
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.490
Al Didn't beat Bush and then they just scrapped it and it was fucking over.

879
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:47.790
And that's what they do because they don't give a shit.
They don't give a shit.

880
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:52.020
You honestly think Hillary Clinton would have stopped global warming if he

881
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:55.320
taught out of those 350 scientists that are all experts.

882
00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.990
You know what else I've said?
They said it's too late.

883
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.700
It was too late by the 1980s it was [inaudible] or something on the 90s.

884
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.320
It's been too late.
It's fuck.

885
00:54:05.321 --> 00:54:09.960
And it's almost like not even a fucking issue anymore.
Um,
I mean it is an issue,

886
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:11.340
but the only way to do it,
it was we would,

887
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:15.150
we would all have to fucking go back to live in like cavemen and on 90% of us

888
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:19.290
would have to die and just kind of sit there and not do jumping jacks to add to

889
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:23.040
the fucking heat and hope this think could heal itself.
Other than that,

890
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:23.371
I don't know.

891
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:27.930
What the fuck you going to do is everybody's running around just having to get a

892
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:30.870
flat screen TV and every fucking room.
You know,

893
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.020
I love how it's like the political candidates are responsible for,

894
00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:37.890
it's like we're just as responsible as anybody else aren't we?
I don't know.

895
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:40.090
Jesus Christ.
This is like meet the press here anyway.

896
00:54:40.091 --> 00:54:44.010
So the next time you open that stupid fucking freckled crusted mouth,

897
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.620
this guy is like more enlightened than me by the way.

898
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.840
Remember your words have power.

899
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:52.620
You are an influential person whether you want to believe it or not.

900
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.500
I don't expect you to read this tide rate on the podcast,

901
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.950
but I hope you read it and realize what a fool you've been.
Why?

902
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:03.930
Cause I don't agree with you because you have all of this.
Admittedly,

903
00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.380
that is,
none of this was researched.

904
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.420
If he just did 45 minutes of research.
Oh,
earlier you told me a couple hours,

905
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.840
you could see that.
Yes.
Hillary made mistakes with the email and been chassis.

906
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:22.530
Yeah,
she made mistakes.
Okay,
but nothing she ever did was criminal.

907
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.790
Exactly.
All right.
Well,
Trump,
he made some mistakes with women,

908
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.900
but none of it was ever criminal.
Or he would have been fucking in jail.
Right?

909
00:55:30.901 --> 00:55:35.310
He would have been brought up on charges.
Right.
The charges would have stuck.

910
00:55:35.311 --> 00:55:36.510
You can do the same thing.

911
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:40.590
You're going to completely and I how you don't bring up the fucking Hillary

912
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:43.560
Foundation or anything,
that type of shit either or any of the other fucking,

913
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.920
all that other,
whatever,
the fucking Whitewater,
all of that fucking crap.

914
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.320
You don't bring up any of that shit.
You know,

915
00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:52.110
bring up the fact that they're both worth hundreds of millions of fucking

916
00:55:52.111 --> 00:55:54.510
dollars,
and that's not a red flag to you.

917
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:59.340
These down to Earth Democrats too.
What were men of the people?

918
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.590
They're worth a couple hundred million dollars.

919
00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.990
The president's seat pays 500 grand a year.

920
00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:06.630
How do they do it and don't give me that horse shit about,

921
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.580
they give political speeches,

922
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.130
fucking political speeches that they give.
Okay,

923
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:17.040
can you at least agree with me on this,
sir?
That is just,

924
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.530
that's just those people washing their bribe money.

925
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.650
Those are the people that put them in office and then they go back and they give

926
00:56:22.651 --> 00:56:26.770
a speech and they give them 300 grand,
250 grand to fucking speak there for it.

927
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.480
Give me a fucking break.
All right.
All right,
so there,

928
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:32.440
that's his fucking thing.

929
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:36.430
So he thinks I'm a moron and I got Trump to be fucking elected.
Okay enough.

930
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.280
Now here's somebody's exact opposite a bill.

931
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:41.880
You really are uneducated on Trump built.

932
00:56:41.881 --> 00:56:43.750
You need to run away from the progressive's.

933
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:47.890
This person thinks I'm a progressive liberal.
Listen to the exact same podcast,

934
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:52.810
sir.
Move the fuck out of California or whatever liberal spot you're living in.

935
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.231
Now,

936
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:56.770
this is what I can tell you immediately is the last person who wrote this email

937
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.620
is not listening to this at all.
It's just,

938
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:03.130
it's already yelling at his fucking windshield about what a dope disguise.

939
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:07.660
He goes.
I just heard your podcast about your the tearful Democrats.
Yeah,

940
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:12.280
he listened to my podcast and he thinks that I'm a progressive liberal and for

941
00:57:12.281 --> 00:57:16.690
instance,
you had no clue who is going to pay for the wall.
Dude,

942
00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.550
I've said all along,
I have no clue.

943
00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.170
I don't know shit about football.
I watch fucking patriots,
Seattle.

944
00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:28.940
I can't name half the fucking people.
All right,
here we go.
Uh,
you have no true,

945
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.550
this is the funniest thing I've ever,
one of the funny things I've read,

946
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:33.530
you have no clue who's going to pay for the wall.

947
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:37.460
Trump had a hundred rallies where he,
he asked the audience,

948
00:57:37.461 --> 00:57:40.580
who's going to pay for the wall and everyone would shout Mexico.

949
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.650
Do you realize,
sir,

950
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.200
that all you were doing was just repeating what he said was going to happen,

951
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:56.350
but he never said how we would get Mexico.
Sir.

952
00:57:56.351 --> 00:58:00.150
Just imagine you didn't like your next door neighbor.

953
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:01.921
Okay?

954
00:58:01.921 --> 00:58:05.670
And you were sick of him cutting across your lawn or whatever the fuck he was

955
00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:06.960
doing.
You know,

956
00:58:06.961 --> 00:58:10.530
cutting across the corner your lawn and making the grass go flat and you were

957
00:58:10.531 --> 00:58:12.450
fucking sick of it.
Now let me ask you this.

958
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:18.390
Let's say you decided to build a wall and you decided that he was going to pay

959
00:58:18.391 --> 00:58:20.850
for it.
How would you go about doing that?

960
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.180
Exactly?

961
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.800
Now let's move it up to a fucking country level.

962
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:33.280
So we're going to build this wall and we're going to,
how will we,

963
00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:37.680
how is he going to make Mexico pay for it?
And if you tell me it's only a guest,

964
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.970
cause as far as I watched,
he never said how

965
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:47.230
economic sanctions,
you're going to pressure them into fucking doing it.

966
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:52.100
Okay.
Anyway,
so here we go.
How is it that those mobs mobs,

967
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.830
great word Dude are more educated than you.

968
00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.880
Who the fuck is saying that the benefit of the walls will be jobs?

969
00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:03.140
Who are you listening to and who said Trump doesn't want health care?

970
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.370
He's been really left on healthcare saying people with no insurance should be

971
00:59:07.371 --> 00:59:10.880
able to get treatment and care from way back when he was running in the

972
00:59:10.881 --> 00:59:15.470
primaries.
Seton to this guy thinks Trump is left on this seat.
This is why.

973
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:20.090
This is why sir,
the first person that you think I had influence,

974
00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.360
it's like people just hear the podcast.

975
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.530
You guys already have your fucking minds made up and then you listen to the

976
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.820
podcast,
okay?
And you,

977
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.770
it's like watching a football game and you're listening to Chris Collins worth,

978
00:59:33.771 --> 00:59:37.280
I met him one time when I did inside the NFL.
Chris Collins worth goes,

979
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:42.310
everybody thinks I hate their fucking team and like the other team better and

980
00:59:42.771 --> 00:59:45.350
this will,
that's what you guys are doing with this podcast.
All right?

981
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.620
You guys are listening to this shit.
You lean left or you lean right?

982
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:51.830
And when I trashed your guy,
you think I'm only trashing your,

983
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.460
your man or woman and I'm,
and I'm trashing it more than the other people.

984
00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:00.800
And then if and when you're a person loses you then blame my podcast.

985
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:03.043
All right?

986
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.590
You guys went out and you voted for who the fuck you wanted to vote for,

987
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:10.250
and you listen to the information that you wanted to listen to and you listen to

988
01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:13.280
whatever the fuck you were receptive to that vibe in your life,

989
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.540
which is the exact reason why when I,

990
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.680
I was still in this band on stage talking about Trump's support is going,

991
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:21.920
how can you support this guy?
He's got people openly yelling the n word

992
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.390
at his rallies.
There's video of that.
Doesn't that bother you?

993
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.540
And this is what they would say.
Well,
you know,
I'm not,
I've said this on Conan.

994
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:32.990
There'll be agree.
No,
I'm not.
I'm,
no,
I'm not into that.
I'm not doing that.

995
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.660
But Hillary,
and what it is,

996
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.670
is what tracks for people is what's going to affect their fucking life.

997
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.660
And unfortunately,
when it comes to fucking racism,

998
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.830
it doesn't track with white people because it's not a factor in their life.

999
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.580
Why people are not victims of racism,
despite the fact they say that they are,

1000
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.770
when they talk about like affirmative action,

1001
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:01.310
that that's racist because they don't understand that the reason why affirmative

1002
01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:05.210
action came about was because racist white people would not hire people who are

1003
01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:06.044
not white.

1004
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:10.400
So they literally had to come up with the law to force white people to give

1005
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:11.690
other people a chance.

1006
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.410
And then what people do is they just look at that moment.

1007
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:18.950
They don't look at the history of it.
They just look right then and there.

1008
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:24.950
So I dunno,
I think that,
look,
I understand that right now.

1009
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:25.460
Believe me,

1010
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.700
do I understand going to comedy shows and seeing the way the fucking crowd is

1011
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:32.900
reacting,
that this is a very volatile fucking time.
Um,

1012
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.260
this guy goes on to talk about how fucking,
uh,

1013
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.070
people thought Republicans were being dramatic when they said no to world war

1014
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.880
three vote Trump,
but the democratic national,
the DNC,

1015
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.810
I don't know what the fucking stands for force Russia to,
uh,

1016
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:53.720
why is it a DNP Democratic National Party,
uh,
make my life easier.

1017
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.440
Force.
Russia didn't dump tons of money into hypersonic nuclear missiles.

1018
01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.460
They have these fucking hypersonic characters that can hold 16 nuclear warheads

1019
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:05.270
that they can penetrate our missile shields,
uh,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1020
01:02:05.271 --> 01:02:09.800
and all this type of shit.
A reputable scholars were saying that moving towards,

1021
01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:12.800
we're moving towards world war three.
If you elect Hillary now,

1022
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:15.560
they're all changing their tune,
thanks to president Trump,

1023
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.920
former host of the apprentice.
Get on board with Trump.
You're annoying.

1024
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:23.310
Voice should be on our side,
so he doesn't think I'm fucking on his side.

1025
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.570
You don't think I'm on your side?

1026
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:29.250
Both of you have scholars and scientists that say your point of view was right

1027
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:33.030
because what you guys do is you go to [inaudible] dot com and you memorize a

1028
01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:37.560
bunch of horse shit and then when your person doesn't win you then fucking blame

1029
01:02:37.561 --> 01:02:40.950
a podcast.
So there you go.
I don't know what to tell you guys.

1030
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.060
I respect both of your opinions.
I don't agree on either one of them.

1031
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.300
I usually don't say who I vote for because I think it's a private matter.

1032
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:52.320
But I did not vote for either one of them.
I voted for,
I voted for somebody else.

1033
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:53.490
Bernie wasn't on the ballot.

1034
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:57.180
I voted for somebody else that I thought was the best candidate,

1035
01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.520
not who the fuck I thought was gonna win.

1036
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:02.880
And I think that's a major problem is that people don't want what's right.

1037
01:03:02.881 --> 01:03:04.620
They want to win,
you know,

1038
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.860
so they will go with a candidate that is a warmonger or a fucking racist or a,

1039
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:12.120
or a corrupt piece of shit.

1040
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:16.950
And they don't give a fuck as long as they're wearing the right fucking color

1041
01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.240
tie.
All right.
And I want it done.
Um,
all right,
let's do some advertising.

1042
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:24.930
Everybody.
Um,
but I do have to say this is,

1043
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.440
let's just say whatever Trump is gonna do.
Um,

1044
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.790
all it's doing for me,
you know,

1045
01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:35.990
he appoints this guy and he's got this fucking past where he allegedly said

1046
01:03:35.991 --> 01:03:38.750
something about Jews,
you know,

1047
01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:43.460
wasn't proven or whatever,
but he's got this fucking background.

1048
01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:44.690
Like all that does for me.

1049
01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.160
It's just inspires me to become more of a fucking understanding person and try

1050
01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:52.850
to listen to people.
And as long as you just take that,
like,

1051
01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.830
that attitude,
you know,
I,

1052
01:03:56.831 --> 01:04:00.260
I don't really don't think a president should,
um,

1053
01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:03.500
make up your mind on who you should be afraid of

1054
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.860
in what we need to do and what these people are going to do to us and what

1055
01:04:08.861 --> 01:04:11.860
they're not going to do to us.
Just cause they fucking said it.
I don't,

1056
01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:15.590
I don't listen to that.
What I like to do is I listened to the,

1057
01:04:15.591 --> 01:04:16.660
what the president says,

1058
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:21.100
and then I go to the country and I go to the fucking thing and I try to find

1059
01:04:21.101 --> 01:04:23.530
some English story about what the fuck they're saying about us.

1060
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:28.150
And then I try to,
to figure out what the middle is.
All right.

1061
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:33.300
I don't know.
I don't give a shit.
What color you fucking tires.
All right?

1062
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.270
So white people,
if you're nervous,
okay.

1063
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.690
Liberal whites,
if you're really a fucking good liberal white,

1064
01:04:43.691 --> 01:04:48.460
you'll become even more fucking understanding of people that aren't white and,

1065
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.430
and,
and debt are gonna,
you know?

1066
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.753
<v 1>Hmm</v>

1067
01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:55.390
<v 0>bear the brunt of what this guy might fucking do.</v>

1068
01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:00.070
I think it's your responsibility to become even more understanding.

1069
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.930
You know what I mean?

1070
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:06.930
And stop making everything about yourself in your fucking world because the

1071
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:11.650
mainstream is already about that.
All right.
There you go.

1072
01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.220
I'm off my game.
Take a ticket or don't you know it's up to fucking you.

1073
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:20.050
All right,
but I don't want you to,
I don't to hear you crying about fumbling.

1074
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.840
Somebody taking your fucking,
I can't stand.
Listen to white people talking about,

1075
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:24.190
oh,
they're taking the country away from us.

1076
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:27.080
It's like if you looked at a fucking census,
you idiot.
You know?

1077
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:31.060
If you find all the waterparks they're made for you don't want gives us a second

1078
01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:33.940
look when you show up like what's,
what's his element doing here?

1079
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.140
They're excited you there and within two seconds to someone in a mascot outfit,

1080
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:42.310
fucking hugging you.
There you go.
All right,
you're going to be fine.

Uh,

1096
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:40.510
this watch has a really clean design.
I always hate this part.

1097
01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:42.700
It's like you already sold them.
How are you going to come back around again?

1098
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:47.020
This watch as a really clean design seriously.
Um,

1099
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.190
evidently had been kind of been getting compliments ever since I put it on.

1100
01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.130
I not only am I not wearing it,
I actually lost my other watch.

1101
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.700
It's a nice fucking watch.
Okay.
I didn't wear it because I have other watches,

1102
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.110
you know,
because I'm in my forties and I can afford a nice watch.

1103
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:06.390
So I bought that one off.
I was on my twenties.
I'd fucking by this one.
All right,

1104
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:11.050
go to MVT.
MVMT watches.com/bar joined the movement,

1106
01:07:12.781 --> 01:07:15.910
I do not understand buying a super expensive fucking watch.
I just don't get it.

1107
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:20.200
All right.
I don't understand it.
They'll just end up telling the time,
right?

1108
01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.760
I mean,
this is the Kinda guy drove a Prius for nine years,

Watch.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.680
I know somebody that voted for Trump and was like,
I think it's exciting.

1130
01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:39.230
I think it's exciting that he's going to be president.

1131
01:08:39.231 --> 01:08:41.300
Obviously he's a white dude.
He's excited,
right?

1132
01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.470
And this is the same guy.
He said,
Obama is a fucking idiot.

1133
01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:51.980
All right.
Which you're free to say that you think he's a fucking idiot,

1134
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:56.420
but you can watch the fucking Donald Trump.
I'm going to do it.
It just,

1135
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.360
it just,
I don't know.
That's what I learned traveling this country.

1136
01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:03.770
It's just people here.
What the fuck they want to hear.
Um,
alright.
Lingerie.
Let's,

1137
01:09:03.771 --> 01:09:07.580
let's get off politics.
I'll give you guys a breather here.
All right.
But,
uh,

1138
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.730
please guys,
just stop fucking yelling at each other.
All right?

1139
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:15.170
It's just stop blaming everybody and just fucking human beings here.
All right.

1140
01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:16.011
Let's be honest with you.

1141
01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:19.430
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are not out for you or for me.

1142
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:23.210
They're out there for themselves and that's why they're worth hundreds of

1143
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.370
billions of dollars.
Make no mistake.
All right?

1144
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.620
Fucking show up in a radio station with the hot sauce for fun just during the

1145
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:33.320
campaign and where the fuck you going to be the rest of the time you're going to

1146
01:09:33.321 --> 01:09:37.400
be in the White House buying up fucking land on aquifers.
All right.
Hey,

1147
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:38.450
Billy nipple slip.

1148
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:42.350
I recently started dating this girl and we've been messing around for a few

1149
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.250
months now.
Congratulations.

1150
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.670
She's pretty cool and a really sweet girl and sex is great with them.
Alright,

1151
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.051
Trifecta,
however,

1152
01:09:48.051 --> 01:09:52.670
she's been doing a lot of lingerie shopping and wants me to go with her one day

1153
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:55.580
so we can shop for her lingerie together.
Uh,

1154
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.450
personally I never got the point of lingerie nor I am am I a big fan of it?

1155
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:05.830
I'm really you just like when they just show up with like your fucking old

1156
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:09.830
basketball shorts on one of those guys.
As long as there's a pussy underneath it,

1157
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:13.790
I don't give a fuck.
All right.
Personally,
I never got the pocket.

1158
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:17.120
Didn't see the point of buying something that was meant for you to take off

1159
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:21.410
almost immediately after you put it on.
All right sir.

1160
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.740
This is the thing about,
all right,
so you're a,
you're a,

1161
01:10:24.741 --> 01:10:28.240
you're one of those no foreplay guys.
All right.

1162
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:31.920
If you really want to take it to the next level too,
like you have,

1163
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:36.970
you ever make a meal for somebody and you set it down and you turn your back to

1164
01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:40.070
the stove to set the pan back down.
And when you look back,

1165
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.870
they were already halfway done with it and you're like,

1166
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:46.280
what the fuck did I do all that work for?
Um,
I would let her buy that.

1167
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:50.960
It makes her feel sexy,
right?
And then,
you know,
gets,

1168
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.850
get all,
even into the,
you know,
the mood a little bit more telling you do it.

1169
01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.440
Yeah.
You're striking me as somebody who never takes the downtown six,

1170
01:10:57.441 --> 01:10:58.274
if you know what I mean.

1171
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:05.060
It's fucking rips the clothes off,
puts her on her back,

1172
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:10.190
fucking rolls off Ben in it,
then it turns on the fucking TV.
All right?
Also,

1173
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:15.191
I'm not that great at faking my reaction when her or a girls have broke out

1174
01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:19.920
those sexy lingerie and I'm unenthused by it.

1175
01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:25.020
You know what,
dude?
Uh,
you're an asshole.

1176
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.550
You really are an asshole.
Um,
and that can be a good thing.
You can,

1177
01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.200
you're going to get what you want in life,
but a,

1178
01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:35.310
you're going to miss out on a lot in life.
Um,
it's even given,

1179
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:39.390
got me in a great,
got me in trouble a couple times.

1180
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.210
The girls I've been dating for the most part have been pretty sexy,

1181
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:45.510
but when it comes to lingerie,
I just think it makes things awkward.

1182
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.420
That is the most overused word on the planet.

1183
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:53.220
It's the default emotion of these,
this entire fucking world.

1184
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.650
Now,
I don't even know what the word means anymore.

1185
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.960
It's been applied to everything.
Everything's awkward.

1186
01:11:57.961 --> 01:12:02.420
I don't know what that means.
Same goes for things like sexting,
roleplaying,

1187
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:08.750
Vage and tit pics and anything else that's kind of puts you on the spot for

1188
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:13.020
things involving sex.
Is it weird that that stuff does nothing for me?
No,

1189
01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:17.820
it isn't,
but it shouldn't make the other person feel like an asshole.
Uh,

1190
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.750
should I try to do my best to I,
you know what I preempt?

1191
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:24.150
I shouldn't have called you an asshole this early cause now you're asking

1192
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:27.270
questions.
All right.
I apologize.
I'm wrong.
All right.
I should,

1193
01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.260
should I try my best to continue pretending that my wiener isn't shriveling up

1194
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:35.070
like a sock when you pull the strings up,

1195
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.810
the strings out of it.
Oh,
the lingerie.

1196
01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:44.430
Huge fan of the podcast.
I haven't,
if you haven't yet,
please come out.

1197
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:46.890
I'm not going to say where he's from just in case his fucking girlfriend

1198
01:12:46.891 --> 01:12:49.560
recognizes this.
Um,

1199
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.500
you know,
do,
you could just kind of go along with it a little bit.
Like,
look,

1200
01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.930
I think like just saying you're not into sexting and in,
in,

1201
01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:04.230
in role playing and shit.
That's like next level shit.
If you're not into that,

1202
01:13:04.231 --> 01:13:07.530
that's fine.
Okay.
Um,

1203
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.060
lingerie I think is a simple thing you could put a happy face on.
I mean,

1204
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.920
as much as guys think the lingerie's for them and for the most part,

1205
01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:21.390
the way women dress,
like guys,
old little girl,
she's odd.
She wants it.

1206
01:13:21.391 --> 01:13:26.280
I mean that dress it for themselves.
They like to look pretty.
All right.

1207
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.670
That makes them feel good.
So I think the Lang Nia,
can you come in for a second?

1208
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:33.450
She's given me a look here.
Come here.
Oh Jesus.

1209
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.320
She literally walked by,
stopped and look at me.
All right,
so this guy,

1210
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.260
this guy is a,
Oh my God,
it's 10 36 I've got to get off my fucking day.

1211
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:47.070
So this guy,
could you look less enthused?

1212
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.670
Yeah,
you shot me a look.
I thought that meant you wanted to come in.

1213
01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:56.010
I'm just listening,
but go on.
What do you Henry Hill.
I'm just listening.

1214
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.890
Do you want me to say then my wife?
Two Times.
Me.
All right,

1215
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:06.150
so this guy,
he's got this great girl.
She's fucking cool.
She's sexy,
sexist,
great,

1216
01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:09.420
but she's into wearing sexy lingerie.
It does nothing for him.

1217
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:14.320
She wants to fucking him to go along on it and like he thinks it's just stupid.

1218
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:19.570
So she puts it on and she fucking pulls the strings like Badadada.

1219
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.120
Bu when he said,
I'm supposed to sit there and act like my Dick.

1220
01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.880
Dick is not shriveling up like a sock.
What's,
what should I do?
He don't think,

1221
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:29.800
he doesn't think lingerie is sexy.
He's just done it.
He goes,

1222
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:31.680
I don't understand the point of just buying that and on.

1223
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.540
I'm just going to take it off like two seconds later.
Okay.

1224
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.910
It makes her feel good.
Just go along with it.
It's not going to kill you.

1225
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:44.950
That's my advice.
Yeah,
it's,
it's just,
just go along with it.
It's now he said,

1226
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:47.710
what about like sexting Vage and titty pics?
He goes,

1227
01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:50.950
I'm not into any of that or role playing.
You are so boring.

1228
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:52.060
Whoever wrote this in,

1229
01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.610
I use really just,
it's like a job fucking prude and you're so boring.

1230
01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:05.140
Like loosen up a little bit.
Send a dick pic to your girlfriends.
No,

1231
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:08.190
that's a bad idea.
Yeah.
I mean you probably shouldn't.
Yeah,
you never,
you don't,

1232
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.170
you never sent any of that shit because it exists forever.
Yeah.

1233
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:14.320
He'd be the one person.
It would come back to haunt him somehow.

1234
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:17.560
So maybe don't do that,
but just open your mind a little bit.

1235
01:15:17.561 --> 01:15:21.250
It sounds like you're in a little sexual box and maybe you need to,

1236
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.340
no pun intended,
no pun intended,
you need to break out of this box.

1237
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:28.510
But here's the thing,
explore something different.
And you know,

1238
01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:32.020
here's the thing on the Dick Pic,
Nia.
Okay.
People think,
okay,

1239
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:35.140
I'm going to send a dick pic to you from my phone to your phone.

1240
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:37.660
[inaudible] just think of the journey that thing takes.

1241
01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.660
My Dick goes to outer space.
Yep.
Goes off a satellite and it comes back down.

1242
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.870
God knows how much shit is between that and that.
I mean,

1243
01:15:46.871 --> 01:15:51.190
how many miles that thing just travel and to think that that's just going to go

1244
01:15:51.191 --> 01:15:54.580
there.
And then if you're on like Twitter or do they say like,

1245
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.050
can we want permission to have access to your photos?
And I,
I never say yes.

1246
01:15:59.051 --> 01:16:01.000
It's like you can have access to this photo.

1247
01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:03.970
<v 3>[inaudible] you know?
Yeah.</v>

1248
01:16:04.050 --> 01:16:06.960
<v 0>I mean all of a sudden somebody,
you know,
you have to see your avatars,</v>

1249
01:16:06.961 --> 01:16:10.160
your dick pic on set into somebody else's Avatars,
your Dick Pictures,

1250
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:11.470
<v 3>deck peg,</v>

1251
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:15.730
delete the deck pack and then ask that person to delete the dick pic to,
no,

1252
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.390
you'd never sent pics.
I gets down.
Send Ben.
Period.
What you do is say,

1253
01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:20.290
where are you?

1254
01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:25.620
I'll show it to you live like in the old days in color,
you know,

1255
01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:30.580
like the old days,
the satellite Dick Pics.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,
in terms of this guy,

1256
01:16:30.581 --> 01:16:33.730
I think he should just kind of open his mind a little bit.
Like I said,

1257
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.630
it seems a little loop brutish and that's fine.

1258
01:16:36.631 --> 01:16:39.190
You don't have to like lingerie and all that,
but I mean,

1259
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.490
if your girls into it and you like her and she likes lingerie,

1260
01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:46.070
like what's the problem?
You know,
just,
I guess it's not,

1261
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.170
I don't see any problem with how do you know,
like lingerie?
I don't know.

1262
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.880
That's what I'm saying is boring as fuck.

1263
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:56.480
<v 0>He's saying he wants to show up wearing his basketball shorts.
He's just like,</v>

1264
01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:59.870
just be naked.
That's what I was saying.
You know,
I was comparing it to like,

1265
01:16:59.871 --> 01:17:02.350
you know,
when you're cooked somebody a meal,
then they eat it in two seconds.

1266
01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:03.590
You just like,
dude,
what the fuck?

1267
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:08.960
<v 3>Like you do?
Huh?
But not in the bedroom.
Oh,</v>

1268
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.450
I do wolf down food Edm.
Huh.

1269
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:17.260
But that's not the only thing you will forget.

1270
01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:21.520
<v 0>Ah,
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.
Nia,</v>

1271
01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.900
why would you say that?
No,
that's disgusting.
You take your time,

1272
01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.420
a woman in New York and your condition,
my condition.

1273
01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.880
Then your conditioned speaking this way.
That's terrible.

1274
01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.880
What if other people were to hear it?
I know.
Um,
what would they think?

1275
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:40.960
All right.
That's the podcast here.
That's it.
That's it.
Oh,

1276
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.490
oh no.
Well you got me here now.
Well,

1277
01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:47.890
I got to go edit my special.
I got to see how my,

1278
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:53.030
especially at [inaudible] where I trashed both Hillary and Trump and still get

1279
01:17:53.141 --> 01:17:57.490
shit for it.
Yeah,
no and then Trump can't win.
You can't win.

1280
01:17:57.491 --> 01:18:00.020
And that's why I never,
I don't tell people who to vote for and I,
I,

1281
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.760
I mean it is like,
you know,
it's going on,

1282
01:18:03.761 --> 01:18:07.300
so I'm going to fucking talk about it because it's fun.
It's fun to shit on them.

1283
01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:10.330
Yeah.
But like I think this one,
people are so upset that they,

1284
01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:13.510
that their person didn't get in that now they're looking to blame.

1285
01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:18.370
So evidently the Monday morning podcast has the ability to sway a presidential

1286
01:18:18.371 --> 01:18:19.110
election.

1287
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.400
<v 3>Right.
Well,
you know,</v>

1288
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:24.450
you do have a platform and you have to use it responsibly.

1289
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:28.690
<v 0>I'm going to start using this platform.
I think it's time.</v>

1290
01:18:28.691 --> 01:18:30.910
Everybody buys me a new car.

1291
01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:36.100
<v 3>This will be good for America.
Yeah,
that's,</v>

1292
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:39.670
it's completely ridiculous.
People know who the fuck they're going to vote for.

1293
01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:43.030
Yeah.
And then it just needs,

1294
01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:46.660
just needs some time to,
I dunno.

1295
01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:51.310
I don't know if anyone's ever going to be fully okay with what just happened,

1296
01:18:51.311 --> 01:18:54.580
but oh,
Trump supporters are totally over there.
Great.

1297
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:59.290
That totally okay with it.
Good right now.
Yeah,
but oh well

1298
01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:03.080
<v 0>I'm glad she's fucking gone,
but I'm not happy that he's here.
There was an,</v>

1299
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:04.490
there was a lose lose

1300
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.990
<v 3>situations.
Definitely depressing.
No matter how you slice it,</v>

1301
01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:13.520
it's fucking depressing.
But life goes on.
It has to.
Yeah,

1302
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.770
and you know something.
I don't think people should just fucking,

1303
01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:21.510
like it says it doesn't change who you are going to be as a person.
Yeah.

1304
01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:24.570
I think if anything,
you just do what people are saying.

1305
01:19:24.571 --> 01:19:28.890
You stay here and you'd pay attention to what's going on and you support the

1306
01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:32.880
causes that mean a lot to you and just put all your effort behind that.

1307
01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:35.280
I feel like that's the way to like really make change.

1308
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:38.670
Should you not move to Canada and no,
they don't want us.

1309
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:41.060
<v 0>I,</v>

1310
01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.830
that was another funny thing too where they all acted like that they were going

1311
01:19:43.831 --> 01:19:44.720
to be so accepting.
Yeah.

1312
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.620
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1313
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.770
That doesn't fucking want us like an Elec how I feel like it's really arrogant

1314
01:19:49.771 --> 01:19:52.530
to just be like,
oh,
I'm just going to move to Canada.
Canada's like,
okay,

1315
01:19:52.531 --> 01:19:53.910
do I have any say in this?

1316
01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:57.940
Like why do I become the place that you come to after your country made a horror

1317
01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:58.070
?

1318
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:59.450
<v 0>I know,
but these are,</v>

1319
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:04.451
these are some of the great artistic minds on the planet would be gracing their

1320
01:20:04.641 --> 01:20:08.760
country with their songs and their standup.
They should be happy.

1321
01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.940
They should welcome them with open arms.
Well,

1322
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:16.590
you know the ones I like the celebrities we'd like.
Today my heart is tonight,

1323
01:20:16.591 --> 01:20:17.730
my heart cries,

1324
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.230
but tomorrow I fight and they get the little fucking muscle thing there.

1325
01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.750
It's like you'd probably go to your personal trainer first.
I would think.

1326
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:26.980
Maybe have your personal chef make you

1327
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.530
<v 3>guilty of that.
I put on Twitter that I cried,</v>

1328
01:20:30.650 --> 01:20:32.960
but I felt hopeful because I did.

1329
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:36.860
I've never cried after an election before and I did,
but I'm done crying.

1330
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:41.370
I'm over crying and uh,
I'm ready to move forward.
And you go,

1331
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:43.813
<v 0>you can,</v>

1332
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.650
I'm just picturing somebody crying with their fucking downtown to ocean views.

1333
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:52.140
What's going to happen to me?

1334
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:58.590
Um,
yeah.
Isn't it like mid term elections?

1335
01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.630
If some come up like a year and a half or something like that,

1336
01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:05.160
then it's going to go the other way.
We'll see what happens in four years.

1337
01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:08.130
If he gets reelected or somebody else comes up.
I don't even know how,

1338
01:21:08.190 --> 01:21:10.050
I didn't even understand how the process works.
Honestly.

1339
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.530
Keeps throwing that out there cause I didn't know.

1340
01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:16.200
He said fucking Clinton support.
Bernie ran again and four years.
Do you think?

1341
01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:17.641
No,

1342
01:21:17.641 --> 01:21:22.641
Bernie cannot win because he's not owned by the same seven corporations that you

1343
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:25.940
need to be owned by.
I'm just throwing seven out.

1344
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.560
Then he comes back and he runs in four years against Trump.

1345
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.090
I would say the media will,
the left media,
we'll fucking take them out again.

1346
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.380
They'll take,
but can he win?
Can you really win?
That's what they did.

1347
01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:38.340
They fucked him over.

1348
01:21:38.370 --> 01:21:42.600
They fucked him over and they left us with this polarizing person and then she

1349
01:21:42.601 --> 01:21:46.830
fucking lost.
And now people are all going,
what the fuck happened?

1350
01:21:46.831 --> 01:21:51.750
And they're blaming podcasts.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.

1351
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:55.670
Trump got in also.
It's also my flat.
Have you done this?

1352
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.780
This fucking Trump supporter guy goes like,

1353
01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.730
you sitting there talking about the cost of wall.

1354
01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:02.670
How can you be so ignorant about the costs of the wall?

1355
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:06.420
He goes to mobs of people that show you that must have been I,

1356
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:09.150
it's so fucking dumb.
I actually think somebody,
uh,

1357
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.250
democratic supporters sent it and he said,
every time he said,

1358
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:17.910
who's going to pay for the wall,
the whole mob would yell Mexico.
Like,

1359
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:19.680
how can you be so dumb that you didn't realize that?

1360
01:22:19.681 --> 01:22:21.150
Now that I'm saying that again,
I think that that,

1361
01:22:21.151 --> 01:22:23.550
I think someone was trolling me there.
I can't believe someone was that done

1362
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.230
<v 3>well,
but Trump said that he was like,</v>

1363
01:22:27.231 --> 01:22:30.220
we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for it.
I know.
I know.

1364
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:33.230
<v 0>Who would be dumb enough to think that you can make another country pay for your</v>

1365
01:22:33.231 --> 01:22:36.910
shit.
We're going to build a wall to keep you out and a,

1366
01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:39.770
you're going to pay for it.
I would say that would be like if you're negative,

1367
01:22:39.771 --> 01:22:41.650
you didn't like your next door neighbor and you built a wall.

1368
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:44.390
Then you sent them a bill.
Maybe you'd be like,
ah,

1369
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.640
make a paper airplane and just throw it back over.

1370
01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.050
I have no idea how he plans on enforcing that.
I guess we'll see.

1371
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:55.280
You know what I do love is the f the first lady has fake tits.

1372
01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:01.220
I thought they worked.
It were just to round.
How would we,

1373
01:23:01.221 --> 01:23:03.880
how would you possibly know that?
I don't know that and yeah,

1374
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:08.380
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.
I mean,

1375
01:23:08.381 --> 01:23:11.200
I've said that for fucking years.
Yeah,
that's true.

1376
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.940
He has put it out there that he's got,
he's got the president as a trophy wife.

1377
01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:20.440
Fucking hilarious.
He's on his third one.

1378
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:23.470
Hey,
if you fucking act up,
don't even think you're going to be,

1379
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.830
you're going to be sitting here picking out plates during my second term lady.

1380
01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:30.970
His wife like doesn't even,
I don't know,
she doesn't even like register for me.

1381
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.440
I mean,
yeah,
she's beautiful and all that,
but I don't really care.

1382
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:38.320
I liked that she plagiarized Michelle Obama's speech,

1383
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:43.180
which I think is really related to the millennials,
the way they curate,
you know,

1384
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:47.620
Shit that they didn't do onto their Facebook pages and youtube pages and fucking

1385
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:50.920
make all this money off of stuff that they didn't really do.
Oh,

1386
01:23:50.921 --> 01:23:53.200
you mean like sharing of memes and things,

1387
01:23:53.290 --> 01:23:57.160
sharing of standup specials and music and videos.

1388
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:59.650
Shit that they didn't do and they just take it.
Oh,

1389
01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:02.290
I thought that was very millennial.
Her grandpa.

1390
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:07.390
Was that what the young people do?
Yeah,
that is what they do.
Oh,

1391
01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:10.780
I fucking hate her.
You just exonerated all of them from stealing all that shit.

1392
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:14.450
Those specials cost me a bunch of fucking money and everybody just takes them

1393
01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:18.130
steal your special and or downloaded illegally.
Of course,

1394
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:19.330
I don't believe that they should do.

1395
01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.520
Then you have to understand that you have a platform on this podcast and all of

1396
01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.510
those people that were already doing it anyways,

1397
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.240
there's now a bunch of others that are now going to do it.

1398
01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:35.470
Cause you said it was okay.
Hey,
you know what's weird is the windscreen is red.

1399
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:37.450
Maybe I am a Trump supporter.
Oh,

1400
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:40.810
maybe so maybe that was a subconscious decision on your part.

1401
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:44.620
I liked the orange one,
but cleo aided double minded me.

1402
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.470
A fucking ABC's wide world of sports with Jim Mckay.

1403
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:52.720
Who knew you were an elephant.
You seem like a jackass to me.
Nothing.

1404
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.820
Oh,
I didn't get it.
Oh,
I didn't get all that.
Those are the animals,
right?

1405
01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.740
Jesus Democrats are really donkeys.
Why would they pick that?
I don't know.

1406
01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.370
There's a reason behind it.
We just haven't Wikipedia it,
googled it,
whatever.

1407
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.640
Well,
I'm sure someone will tell me why.
Preempting it.
Hey,
you fucking moron.

1408
01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:18.010
I'm all right.
That's the podcast.
Uh,
I'm sorry for Donald Trump.
Um,

1409
01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.100
next time I will try to,
uh,

1410
01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:26.110
I haven't made up my mind who I want to be president yet.
Uh,

1411
01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:30.780
the next time I think I'm already over Trump and,
uh,
I'll,

1412
01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:35.410
I'll figure it out.
Yeah,
I hope so.
So this doesn't happen again.

1413
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:40.510
You fucking election and rigor.
You regular.
You all right?

1414
01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:43.690
That's it.
I gotta I gotta fucking upload this shit.
I gotta go edit.

1415
01:25:43.691 --> 01:25:46.630
My goddamn specialist is going to be the worst fucking thing ever.
All right.

1416
01:25:46.631 --> 01:25:48.280
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
