00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.970
ALEX WHEATLEY: I love the game.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.390
I love the sound of the ball
when it goes through the net.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.020
I love a perfect pass or when
you get a stop on defense,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.130
like a block, or a
steal, or anything--

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.730
any sort of good play.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.780
I love the rhythm of the game.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.830
I'm Alex Wheatley.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.570
I'm a junior from Upper
Holland, Pennsylvania

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.690
and I'm majoring in ecology
and evolutionary biology

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.130
with a certificate in global
health and health policy.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.580
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.580
The lessons I've learned
on the basketball court

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.220
translate really
well off the court

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.070
as well, in service and
just in life in general.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.390
This summer, I spent eight
weeks in Kenya working

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.200
for the Conservation Clubs,
which is a really, really

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.540
awesome program
that teaches kids

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.160
fifth through eighth grade
about conservation and biology

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.700
and just the
environment around them.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.510
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.670
After graduation, I will enter
the Woodrow Wilson School

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.250
as a SINSI student, which stands
for Scholar In The Nation's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.190
Service Initiative.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.500
It is a four-year program
that covers a master's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800
in public affairs at
the Woodrow Wilson School

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.550
and a 2-year fellowship
in the government.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.710
 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.200
In the classroom, I think hard
work, especially at Princeton,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.210
pays dividends.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.900
It's not easy here.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.420
And the challenge is good.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060
And I'm challenged
in the classroom

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.370
and on the basketball court.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.080
And I think that
just common theme

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.070
helps me work harder and do
better on the basketball court.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.330
I think as far as
service goes, working

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.250
for something
bigger than yourself

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.870
is present in service
and on the team.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.990
I'm not playing for myself.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.870
I'm playing for the team.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.740
I'm playing for the program.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.950
I'm playing for Princeton.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.020
So I think that's another
common thread between the two.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
