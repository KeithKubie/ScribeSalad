00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:35.180
them and so we took we essentially took
 

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.400
them and so we took we essentially took
72,000 of them and stacked them one on

72,000 of them and stacked them one on
 

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.710
72,000 of them and stacked them one on
top of the other and built a house for

around the top of the wall and tightened
it down and then attached the roof to

didn't expect that the wall would
 

00:39:53.759 --> 00:39:56.569
didn't expect that the wall would
support the roof but there's sort of a

00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579
support the roof but there's sort of a
 

00:39:56.579 --> 00:39:59.749
support the roof but there's sort of a
safety issue for the half of course and

00:39:59.749 --> 00:39:59.759
safety issue for the half of course and

that you you give them you work with

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:50.329
that you you give them you work with
 

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:53.349
that you you give them you work with
them on this house right and then what

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359
them on this house right and then what
 

00:40:53.359 --> 00:40:55.689
them on this house right and then what
do they do they run off and they go to

00:40:55.689 --> 00:40:55.699
do they do they run off and they go to
 

00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:58.299
do they do they run off and they go to
the furniture guy the local furniture

00:40:58.299 --> 00:40:58.309
the furniture guy the local furniture
 

00:40:58.309 --> 00:41:01.029
the furniture guy the local furniture
guy who allows them to take this

fill the house with the most

00:41:05.259 --> 00:41:05.269
fill the house with the most
 

00:41:05.269 --> 00:41:07.269
fill the house with the most
ridiculously expensive furniture because

00:41:07.269 --> 00:41:07.279
ridiculously expensive furniture because
 

00:41:07.279 --> 00:41:08.829
ridiculously expensive furniture because
this is what though they're all sitting

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839
this is what though they're all sitting
 

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:10.809

so so they put themselves in debt after

00:41:14.499 --> 00:41:14.509
so so they put themselves in debt after
 

00:41:14.509 --> 00:41:17.650
so so they put themselves in debt after
you tried to help them out of it so so

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:17.660
you tried to help them out of it so so
 

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.689
you tried to help them out of it so so
and of course it allows it allowed us to

00:41:19.689 --> 00:41:19.699
and of course it allows it allowed us to
 

00:41:19.699 --> 00:41:21.459
and of course it allows it allowed us to
kind of access to those kinds of

00:41:21.459 --> 00:41:21.469
kind of access to those kinds of
 

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:25.539

building and in this case we came and
 

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.490
building and in this case we came and
looked at this building and we owned a

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:12.500
looked at this building and we owned a
 

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.500
looked at this building and we owned a
nard about it and ultimately we tore it

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:14.510
nard about it and ultimately we tore it
 

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.450

down and said what we'll do with this

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:16.460
down and said what we'll do with this
 

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.280

one is we'll take this down we'll take

one is we'll take this down we'll take
 

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.840
one is we'll take this down we'll take
it down piece by piece and we ended up

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:19.850
it down piece by piece and we ended up
 

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.660
it down piece by piece and we ended up
using 75% of it in the new building so

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:22.670
using 75% of it in the new building so
 

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.480
using 75% of it in the new building so
we took the time and the care we even

into place and then put a roof over the
 

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.220
into place and then put a roof over the
top of it well there you go there it

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:55.230
top of it well there you go there it
 

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:59.299

sits and that takes you to the tower

00:58:59.299 --> 00:58:59.309
sits and that takes you to the tower
 

00:58:59.309 --> 00:59:04.730
sits and that takes you to the tower
which you know they had wanted a birding

00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:04.740
which you know they had wanted a birding
 

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.809
which you know they had wanted a birding
tower and some smart ass said to us why

00:59:08.809 --> 00:59:08.819
tower and some smart ass said to us why

don't you go and get one of those fire

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:10.260
don't you go and get one of those fire
 

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.349
don't you go and get one of those fire
towers because the DP commissioning all

00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359
towers because the DP commissioning all
 

00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:14.660

those fire towers was one of those

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:14.670
those fire towers was one of those
 

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.700
those fire towers was one of those
moments and so the kids ran off and got

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:16.710
moments and so the kids ran off and got
 

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:19.130

this donated for I think like ten
 

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:22.400
this donated for I think like ten
dollars but that was the crux of the

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:22.410
dollars but that was the crux of the
 

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:24.740
dollars but that was the crux of the
problem was and that was my oh

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:24.750
problem was and that was my oh
 

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.160
problem was and that was my oh
moment because I suddenly realized that

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:28.170
moment because I suddenly realized that
 

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:29.900

we started looking much you know more

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:40.630
we started looking much you know more
 

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:43.180
we started looking much you know more
where the word is we looked at it in

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:43.190
where the word is we looked at it in
 

01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:46.689
where the word is we looked at it in
another way and and you know you cut

01:10:46.689 --> 01:10:46.699
another way and and you know you cut
 

01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:49.030
another way and and you know you cut
this tree down and you bend it and it's

01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040
this tree down and you bend it and it's
 

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.130
this tree down and you bend it and it's
it's because it's new and wet and it's

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:51.140
it's because it's new and wet and it's
 

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.930
it's because it's new and wet and it's
just been cut down it bends more easily

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:52.940
just been cut down it bends more easily
 

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:56.200
just been cut down it bends more easily
so you tie it and make a beam and so

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:56.210
so you tie it and make a beam and so
 

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.080
so you tie it and make a beam and so
suddenly you've got a beam that used to

01:10:59.080 --> 01:10:59.090
suddenly you've got a beam that used to
 

01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:01.540
suddenly you've got a beam that used to
be three or four inches and now it

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:01.550
be three or four inches and now it
 

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.280
be three or four inches and now it
actually has a structural capability of

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:03.290
actually has a structural capability of
 

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.650
actually has a structural capability of
that and so this is sort of conceptual

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:05.660
that and so this is sort of conceptual
 

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.950
that and so this is sort of conceptual

another of a writ of full section that
would be a 60 feet long so it's three

01:11:59.740 --> 01:11:59.750
would be a 60 feet long so it's three
 

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:02.920
would be a 60 feet long so it's three
