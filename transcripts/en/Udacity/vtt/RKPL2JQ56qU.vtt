00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.590
Okay. Now before we jump into the next

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.780
topic, I just want to take a very quick and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.630
simple quiz just to make sure that you

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.236
guys paid attention to what I just discussed. So

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:10.820
I want to ask you what are the traditional

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.200
software phases. Requirements engineering,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.079
design, abstraction, implementation, verification and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.020
validation. Or maybe design,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.830
optimization, implementation verification and validation

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.448
and maintenance. Or requirements

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:24.892
engineering, design, implementation, verification and

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.290
validation, and maintenance.
