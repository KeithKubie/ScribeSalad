00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:07.030
- Good morning,
and welcome back.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.610
My name is Dan Carpenter.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.680
I'm the Allie S. Freed
Professor of Government

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.500
in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.480
and I also direct
the social sciences

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.450
in the academic ventures
here at Radcliffe.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.470
We're about to start our
second panel entitled Borders,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.820
Boundaries, and Belonging, and
we have our three panelists

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.320
here today.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
We actually have four panelists
listed on the program.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.350
Very sorry to say that,
for personal reasons,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
Greisa Martinez cannot
be with us today.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.760
And we're all very
saddened about that.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.690
Let me introduce the moderator
of our panel, Ambassador

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.640
Samantha Power.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.400
Ambassador Power is the
Anna Lindh Professor

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.860
of the Practice of
Global Leadership

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.120
and Public Policy at
Harvard's Kennedy School,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.970
and is also a professor of
practice at Harvard Law School.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.269
She is a former United States
permanent representative

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.000
to the United Nations,
and was a member

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.430
of President Obama's cabinet.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.900
Before joining
the US government,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.700
she was the founding executive
of the Carr Center for Human

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.610
Rights Policy, again
at the Kennedy School,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.100
and among her many
writings, many of you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.790
will recognize her famous
Pulitzer Prize winning

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.760
book, A Problem
From Hell, America

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.170
and the Age of Genocide.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.620
We're very honored to have
her and our other panelists

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.317
with us.

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:34.150
Thank you very much.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.578
- Thank you.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.159
Hi, everybody.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950
I was supposed to have
the easiest job here

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.130
today, which was just to
introduce our panelists

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.740
and moderate the discussion.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.085
But because, as you'll hear, the
emphasis of the other panelists

00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:54.040
is on other parts
of the world, I've

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.570
been asked, at the last minute--

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.530
given the unfortunate
absence of the person

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.050
who was to be our
third panelist,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.920
who's a tremendous immigration
rights activist and organizer

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.097
here in this country--

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:10.430
I've been asked to speak a
little bit at the last minute

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.630
to some of the immigration
and citizenship issues

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.419
as they relate to
the United States.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.960
So I'm going to do
that very briefly,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.200
but before I do that, it
gives me great pleasure

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.490
to give you a preview of the
more substantive presentations

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.640
that we'll be getting from
two extraordinary panelists.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.790
Sarah Leah Whitson is
the Executive Director,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.330
as you know from your program,
of Human Rights Watch, Middle

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.030
East and North
Africa's Division,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.190
and she is going to
speak about the changing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.090
landscape for women's
rights in the Middle East.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.000
She will focus, I
think, very specifically

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.210
on a country that's been
a lot in the news of late,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.700
in terms of the steps that
it has taken regarding women.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.150
I will leave that
country nameless,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.120
and leave you in suspense,
but many of us have,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.480
as we have read news reports
out of this very large

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.650
oil-producing country in the
Middle East, we have wondered,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.580
is this real, and what does
it actually mean for the women

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.420
on the ground who have
been denied their rights,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.610
and continue to be
denied their rights,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.140
and have been for so long?

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.230
She's also, excitingly,
going to use film,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.870
I think, to bring home the
human stakes of the issues

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.050
that she's describing here.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.140
After Sarah, we will hear
from Nilufer Gole who's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.950
a Professor of
Sociology, and she's

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.750
going to discuss,
as I understand it,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.330
Muslim women in Europe,
focusing on the ideas

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330
very much at the heart
of this conference, ideas

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.700
about crossing
borders, challenging

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.880
concepts of belonging amid
vast demographic shifts.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.030
And I think she's going to focus
on the issue of veiling, asking

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.040
whether belonging to a country
requires one to embrace

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.040
the shared norms that have
existed in that country,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.970
and, I think, is intrigued,
it sounds like from her work,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.360
at looking at how various
identities are negotiated,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.950
identities related to
faith, related to gender,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.720
related to politics, how one
negotiates all those in one

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.649
being and in one society.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.490
So I just, before handing
off to our two speakers,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.480
will make four very brief
points about the United States,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.400
and issues related
to immigration

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.240
and the themes of this panel.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.692
And this is not an area on
which I'm an expert, but just

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.150
some food for thought, and I
know that within the audience,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.340
we have vast amounts
of expertise.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.150
And I really hope that we
can move relatively briskly

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.210
to the discussion, which
will be very, very rich.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.330
So the first point
I wanted to make

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.930
is to state the obvious,
which is that currently,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.470
the concept of citizenship
in the United States

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.780
is a more and more
contested one.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.420
I think some of the
reflexive understandings

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.820
of what it meant to
be American, what

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.550
the identity of
this country was,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.220
the standing of the
Statue of Liberty

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.920
as a relatively uncontroversial
icon, speaking to that,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.980
those elements of American
identity, all of that

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.880
feels much more up for
grabs than it has certainly

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.730
in my lifetime.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.021
And I should say that I'm an
immigrant to this country.

00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.820
I came when I was nine from
the country of Ireland.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.290
So we have people in
very important offices

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.880
in this land including,
arguably, the most important

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.890
office, creating more
exclusionary identities,

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.490
narrower identities,
shrinking the conception

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.620
of American-ness, and
elevating very specific groups

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.160
of Americans to a privileged,
almost normative, status,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.510
it feels like.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.500
And to me, that's, of
course, very, very worrying.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.200
This is happening not only
through tweets and, again,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.060
people contesting, rhetorically,
conceptions of citizenship

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.030
and American-ness, but also
in the capillaries of the US

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.770
government.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.860
And the most vivid example of
this, I think, at least lately,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.310
came just a couple of months
ago when the federal agency that

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.180
issues green cards and
grants citizenship to people

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.300
from foreign countries in
this great country, the United

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.580
States, the United States
Citizenship and Immigration

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.190
Services, who many of us
who come to this country

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.260
have had to process our
applications through--

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.440
Until very recently, the
USCIS mission statement

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.020
said that its aim
was to secure, quote,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.420
America's promise as a nation
of immigrants, end quote.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.570
Like again, a very
uncontroversial statement,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.370
but several months ago, it
dropped that characterization,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.160
and so now it turns out, at
least according to the mission

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.744
statement of this agency,
which has such a vital role,

00:07:11.744 --> 00:07:13.910
the mission statement, or
the mission of the agency,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.060
is no longer to cultivate
the United States

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.177
as a, quote, nation of
immigrants, end quote.

00:07:21.177 --> 00:07:22.760
The second point I
want to make, which

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.980
might seem a little
off topic, but I think

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.630
is extremely
important as we think

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.530
about the future
of this country,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.760
and the future, I think, of
democracy, and inclusion,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.700
and pluralism
around the world, is

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.570
that political party
identification in the United

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.210
States is at its most vehement,
and you might even say,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.380
virulent pitch at present.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.380
And why is this
relevant for discussions

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.940
of citizenship
and American-ness,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.320
and boundaries and belonging?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.170
Because right now,
the biggest predictor

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.550
of where one is likely to fall
on some of the key identity

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.190
issues and policy
issues is, simply,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.640
what is your political party?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.070
And I just want to
throw out a few,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.240
I think, very
disturbing statistics

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.820
that will feel familiar to you.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.140
In 1960, only 5%
of Americans said

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.010
that they would be upset if
their child married someone

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.380
in the other political party.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.280
That was 5%.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.740
In 2010, 49% of Republicans
and 33% of Democrats

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.900
said that they would be mad.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.620
That was eight years ago, and
for reasons I don't really

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.810
understand, but
it may have to do

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.750
with not wanting
to know the answer,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.960
that question has not
been polled since 2010.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.940
And so all we have
now I can offer

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.990
you to try to capture the
zeitgeist of the moment is,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:04.070
according to Pew, last
year, only 9% of Republicans

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.070
and 8% of Democrats say
their spouse is a member

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.250
of the other political party.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.370
But to put this salience
of political identity

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.880
in some broader
context, arguably,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.860
to offer some good
news, 88% of Republicans

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.430
and 94% of Democrats
today have no problem

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.970
with interracial marriage.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.650
So inter-party marriage,
like forget about it,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.280
but interracial marriage, we've
made at least some strides,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.440
significant strides.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.764
And on same-sex marriage, while
it's true 74% of Democrats

00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:45.805
favor same-sex marriage--

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:48.320
I would have thought that
was even higher, but--

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.580
and it's true that only
slightly half of Republicans

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.340
favor same-sex
marriage, the support

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.620
for same-sex marriage
in the GOP has

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.597
tripled over the last decade.

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:01.180
And I think we can expect those
numbers to continue to cascade

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.930
in the right direction.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.310
So we're now in this
weird world where

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.730
the salience of our
political identities

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.410
feels more important than
our shared status, let's say,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.780
as parents or as
siblings, or as citizens,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.700
and what does that
mean for the discussion

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.930
that we'll be having, and
for issues of identity?

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.650
Third point, because I was
asked very specifically to speak

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.840
to this, because it's so in
the news and so heartbreaking,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.630
but in part I think because
of this more virulent forms

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.960
of what Cass Sunstein,
professor at the law school

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.390
who happens to be my
husband, has introduced

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.710
this term, party-ism,
which I think

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.720
speaks to the
ideology of party-ism.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.240
But with party-ism, and
the widening divisions

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.630
between the two
mainstream parties here,

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.870
it's even harder to get
agreement on key immigration

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.530
policy issues.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.160
And so Exhibit A
of that right now

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.910
is what you all know
as the DACA program.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.050
So the DACA program--

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.710
DACA stands for Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.210
I'm no expert on DACA.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.770
We we're going to have a great
expert on DACA on the panel.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.311
Maybe there are people in the
audience who want to speak more

00:11:24.311 --> 00:11:26.650
to this when we open it up.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.470
But what a
heartbreaking situation

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.530
we find ourselves
in here, not only

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.620
because there are 800,000
people who came to this country

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.700
before they were 16 years old,
and received this protected

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.230
status, and now are living
in terror, associated

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.600
with living in limbo.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.680
It is true that, for now, the
Department of Homeland Security

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.990
is saying that these people
will not be deported.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.240
But it is also the
case that their status,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.870
their protected
status, is expiring.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.920
Every month, some new batch
in the 800,000, their status

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.740
expires, and what happens
when your status expires?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.012
Your ability to get a work
permit dramatically diminishes.

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.470
And to give you a sense, again,
and all this is in the news

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.011
and most of you are
familiar with it,

00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:17.860
but this is a
population, those who

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.080
had been DACA recipients, that
are 90% of whom are employed

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.520
or in school, so very
embedded, I mean,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.770
completely embedded, given
when many of them came.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.240
The average age in which this
population came to the United

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.810
States, according to the
recipients who were surveyed,

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.150
was six and a half years old.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.480
And we've all seen the
stories about three-month-olds

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.490
and two-year-olds,
and so forth, who've

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.620
never even been to the
country that they're at risk

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.350
of getting deported to.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.770
Now why is this Exhibit A
of the political challenges

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.420
associated with these debates?

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.180
Because this is
actually something

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.900
that polls well,
across party lines.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.850
Now unfortunately, each month
that we go without accord,

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.000
the polling gets slightly worse.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.630
But as of January of this
year, 87% of Americans

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:18.790
supported giving protected
status, maintaining, basically,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.005
this program, to the
Dreamers, as they're called.

00:13:22.005 --> 00:13:23.880
And there's another
million people apparently

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.750
who are eligible for this
program who are not actually

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.790
in the program, also
at risk of deportation

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.600
right now, as we speak.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.620
But of that 87%, that
was as of January--

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.360
79% Republicans and 92% of
Democrats, and those polls

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.670
are going up on the Democratic
side, and a little bit

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.880
down on the Republican side,
but still well within reach.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.470
And yet, even on this relatively
non-controversial issue

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.750
of immigration-- never mind
a big comprehensive package

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.360
of reforms that are actually
needed in this country to give

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.570
people the ability to live
in security and in dignity,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.000
and to get the balance right
in terms of open borders,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.680
but also being a
nation of immigrants,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.650
and caring for vulnerable
people around the world--

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:11.500
getting that balance
right requires

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.530
functional institutions that
can actually cooperate on issues

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.810
around which,
especially, you have what

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.470
passes for a domestic
political consensus.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.260
And yet, Trump announced
the end of the program

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.440
on September 5th last year,
gave a deadline until March 5th.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.740
There have been now six
bipartisan proposals

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.010
that have come to him, and
he has rejected all of them,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.000
including one that would
have given him $25 billion

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.320
for his wall.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.990
So go figure.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:47.250
But if we can't reach agreement
on an issue like that, where

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.310
there's still relative
consensus in the main,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:56.010
it's going to be extremely
challenging to reaffirm,

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.990
at least, even the
notion of American-ness,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.860
even if it was always something
observed in the breach,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.320
and not consistently
applied across time.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.497
But now, we even
have divisions again

00:15:06.497 --> 00:15:07.830
on what it means to be American.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.780
My last point, before
opening it up to our experts,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:17.040
is just to make the, again,
very, very obvious point

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.400
about the importance of
politics in all of this.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.270
And it's challenging
because, as you see even

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.040
in the controversy
now associated

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.880
with the census, when you
live in fear, when you are not

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.770
made to feel fully American or a
welcomed member of our society,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.400
the instinct is to lay
low, and to stay out

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.300
of politics, and to not be
somebody who puts your head up.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.820
And yet what we, of
course, all need to do

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.570
is mobilize on behalf of
our brothers and sisters.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.670
And here, for all
of the bad news,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.880
some of which I have spoken to
in terms of our polarization,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:59.010
in terms of our inability to get
things done in order to improve

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.200
the lives of people who
are living in our midst

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.340
and are integral to our
country, and our communities,

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.140
the activation, that the
denial of these rights

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.210
and the stripping of the
dignity of so many individuals--

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.720
the activation that is
happening in response to that

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.370
is a sight to behold.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.450
And I think I want to
close just these opening

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.200
comments by bringing us
back to Louis Brandeis'

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.780
great line, which
is that the most

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.820
important office
in any democracy

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.370
is not that of president,
but that of citizen.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.290
And those of us who
have the privilege

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:42.700
of being able to live as
citizens, not in the shadows,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.180
we also have a
responsibility to look out

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.470
for those who are living
in very, very difficult

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.090
dark circumstances right now.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.630
It is our responsibility
to exercise

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.870
the privilege of citizenship
on behalf of those who

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.490
need support and solidarity.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.910
So with that, touching
on America as best

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.520
I can, despite being a
foreign policy person,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.562
I will now turn the
floor over to Sarah,

00:17:08.562 --> 00:17:10.020
and we're very much
looking forward

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.790
to hearing about
that unnamed country

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.781
where a few things have
been happening lately.

00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:14.280
Thank you.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.970
- Hi, everyone.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.010
Thanks.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.079
Thanks for coming.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.430
It's interesting
that here in 2018,

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.350
the topic of women
in the Middle East

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.320
is actually one of the few
sources of good news coming

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.366
from the region.

00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:36.740
Although women in
the Middle East

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.140
face some of the worst systemic
discrimination in the world,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.180
we've seen so many advances
with respect to women's rights,

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.590
not just since the
2011 uprisings,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.360
but really in the
past two decades.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.730
And indeed, despite the
chaos and catastrophe

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:58.010
of so many wars in the region,
where countries are not in war,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.900
we've seen so much
progress, primarily

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.380
in the role of legislation
designed to end discrimination

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.810
against women, or create
protections for them

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.300
from violence and labor abuse.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.940
Most recently, Lebanon,
Jordan, and Tunisia

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.570
abolished the infamous
'marry your rapist' laws

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.700
which allows a rapist to avoid
jail if he marries his victim.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.850
Tunisia allowed women to pass
nationality to their children,

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.560
becoming the eighth
country in the region

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.020
to allow women to do this.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.300
Qatar approved a law
that allows children

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.730
born to Qatari women
and non-Qatari fathers

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.660
to at least obtain residency
rights and identification.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.040
Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria
passed domestic violence laws,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.950
and Kuwait, Qatar,
the UAE, and Morocco

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.407
passed domestic worker laws.

00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:46.740
These were just the most recent.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.780
There are many more examples.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.410
There are ongoing campaigns
across the region on these

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.240
and other discriminatory
laws, and I

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.360
expect we'll see further
advances as women

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.440
redefine their status as
citizens, not subjects, who

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.040
have and demand the same rights
as women across the world.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.370
The cultural exceptionalism,
religious exceptionalism,

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.070
arguments are just
not persuasive

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:16.080
to the female or male youth
bulge in these countries.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.410
First, before I get to the
main topic of the country that

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.150
hasn't been named,
I want to focus

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.216
on two areas of very
positive development, which

00:19:24.216 --> 00:19:25.590
I think really
touch on the theme

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.890
today of borders and nationality
as they affect gender issues.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.420
As I mentioned, the
nationality laws

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.030
are a topic of renewed
interest, particularly

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.160
with Tunisia's recent
law allowing women

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.980
to pass nationality
to their children,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.040
as well as to end
the decree that

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.450
banned or prohibited
Muslim women from marrying

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.160
non-Muslim men.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.500
Most recently, in
February, the Arab League,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.600
for the first time,
passed a resolution

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.390
that calls on member
states to, and I'm quoting,

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.120
"End all forms of
discrimination in nationality,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.720
and to take concrete steps
to amend laws and legislation

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.940
relating to
nationality, in order

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.670
to grant women and men
equal rights in conferring

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.160
nationality to their
children and spouses,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.310
and to acquire change
or retain nationality."

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.010
This is a very big deal
because, as I mentioned,

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.440
only seven, now eight,
of 20 Arab states

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.650
allow women to pass nationality
on to their children.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.950
Algeria, Egypt, Morocco,
Tunisia, and Yemen,

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.760
which have always been among the
most progressive with respect

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.480
to women's rights, all provide
equal rights to women and men

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.940
to confer citizenship
to their children.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.730
Iraq, a remnant from
the Ba'athist era--

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.520
secular laws in
Mauritania, also allow

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.040
women with foreign husbands
to confer nationality

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.140
to their children, if
they're born in the country.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.860
But for the rest, what this
means is that children,

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.180
and there are millions of them,
born to women, born to citizen

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.040
women married to non-nationals,
do not obtain citizenship

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.890
or nationality,
and in many cases,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.440
don't have even residency
or rights in the state

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.170
where they live.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.360
So they can't work.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.430
They can't study.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.100
They can't travel, and so forth.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.340
In Israel, this is enforced
through a so-called family

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.490
reunification law, which is
actually a family division

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:20.420
law, that prevents spouses
from the occupied territories,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.770
or states identified as
enemies, like Lebanon and Syria,

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.870
from living in Israel.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.870
In contrast, Jewish
foreign spouses

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.090
get automatic citizenship.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.760
Now one justification for
this is a security one,

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.150
because naturally, spouses
from the occupied Palestinian

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.720
territories are potential
terrorists and threats,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.670
but the real excuse
for these nationality

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.790
laws throughout the
region are, in fact,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.340
demographic and
political in nature,

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.800
to prevent, for example,
an increase in the number

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.170
of Palestinians in
Jordan or Lebanon

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.990
or Israel, because
that would disrupt

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.980
the demographic balance.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.580
Because if all the children
of national Jordanian

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.270
or Lebanese or Israeli women
married to Palestinian men

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.000
had nationality, that
would bring a spike

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.330
in the population of this
undesirable nationality.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.490
Particularly in
Jordan, the argument

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.560
is really not
persuasive at all, given

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.070
that the law permits a
Jordanian man to marry

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.750
as many as four women.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.470
So a Jordanian national can
marry four Palestinian women,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.400
have all their children,
including foreign nationals,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.750
and pass on citizenship to
all of the wives and children.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.340
But the Jordanian
woman can't do that.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.620
The discriminatory
system really just ties

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.770
into a very entrenched
patriarchal culture,

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.010
mostly about social control,
and controlling women,

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.290
and controlling who
women can marry,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.500
preventing them,
discouraging them,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.020
from marrying foreign husbands.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.830
And so really it's about
family, tribal, local, community

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.280
control over women.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.380
The Gulf countries are
a particular problem

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.600
because not only do they
not grant nationality

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.730
to these children, they
also don't allow them

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.620
to have dual nationalities.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.690
So the result is
that children born

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.200
to GCC mothers and
non-GCC fathers,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.570
or not from that state,
are effectively stateless.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.950
Some countries, like
Jordan, have put in laws

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.900
to grant at least
certain benefits

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.030
to non-citizen children
instead of allowing

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.640
them to gain nationality
through their mothers.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.290
As I mentioned,
most recently, Qatar

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.120
approved a law that
allows children

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.300
born to Qatari women
and non-Qatari fathers

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.910
to at least obtain residency
rights and identification

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:40.960
cards.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.090
But these half-baked
measures don't work,

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.700
and they continue to relegate
children in such situations

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.170
to second-class status.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:50.840
This month, in a couple
of weeks actually,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.360
we'll launch a new
report in Jordan,

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.020
documenting how the
355,000 stateless children

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.380
of Jordanian mothers
married to non-Jordanians,

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.910
mostly Palestinian, but also
Egyptian, Iraqi, and so forth,

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:09.630
don't even benefit from the
proposed minimal protections.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.090
Jordanian authorities restrict
the rights of these children

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.630
to work, own property,
travel to and from Jordan,

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.480
enroll in higher education,
and get government health

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.170
care and other services.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.920
The 2014 decision that
was purported to ease

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.610
these restrictions
has completely

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.190
fallen short of
expectations, and people

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:33.250
who are even supposed to be able
to get ID cards can't get them.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.470
We're working very closely
with women's rights

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.530
activists in Jordan to a joint
campaign to lobby on these laws

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.990
because we think Jordan is
the next best place to get

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.670
these laws overturned.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.270
But we know it will
be a tough slog.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.880
I should note that Qatar's
recent change of granting

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.720
residency to children
born to non-Qatari fathers

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.540
was very much precipitated
by the crisis in the country

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.750
due to the siege imposed
by neighboring GCC states.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.060
So in this case, it
was a security crisis

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.280
that actually created a
motivation and impetus

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.230
for the government
to allow women

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.350
to have their children
get at least residency,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.360
because stateless
children born in Qatar

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.020
were required, under the laws
of Saudi, and UAE, and Bahrain,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.600
to return to their
father's national country,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.660
and had no residency
rights in Qatar.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.480
We're very hopeful that we will
persuade Qatari authorities

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.000
in this moment of
crisis to actually solve

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.180
this problem by allowing Qatari
women to pass nationality

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.910
on to their children.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.210
A second area of
women's rights issues

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.310
that touches on the
intersection of borders

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.370
and national identity,
quite interestingly,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.520
is the status of migrant
domestic workers.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.010
The biggest population of
migrant workers in the Middle

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.750
East are not
construction workers,

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.870
but actually migrant
domestic workers, housemaids,

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.590
three to four million of
them, almost entirely women,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.990
almost entirely in
the Gulf, but also

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:58.320
prevalent in Lebanon and Jordan.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.790
Ten years ago, these workers
had no protection, virtually

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.310
no protection, and
we made exposing

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.230
abuses against migrant
domestic workers

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:11.610
a major priority of our
work, including, for example,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.620
the confiscation of
their passports, the fact

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.240
that they owed
$1,000 in recruiting

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.774
fees, the fact that they
couldn't leave their employers,

00:26:17.774 --> 00:26:19.690
the fact that they were
locked in their homes,

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.830
not allowed to leave,
couldn't make phone calls,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.100
and lived as virtual slaves
in their owners' homes.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.580
And I didn't use that
term accidentally.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.470
That is how they were
perceived by the law,

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.380
so that a domestic worker
who fled her employer

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.840
was considered
absconding, running away,

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.720
because she was
owned by her sponsor,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.580
and her legal presence
in the country

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.165
is bound completely by her
sponsor, who is the employer.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.950
These are primarily
South Asian women,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.950
now increasingly East African
women in Arab countries,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:57.070
who speak little to no
Arabic, and so, in fact,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.650
for many years, it
was very difficult

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.470
for us to get women's rights
organizations in the Middle

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.140
East to see the problem of
migrant domestic workers

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.390
as a woman's problem.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.300
One of the ways we
took on the issue

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.400
was, for example,
making videos that

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.110
showed Kuwaiti women or Lebanese
women dressed in maid costumes

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.540
so that they could
try to identify

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.300
with the situation of these
migrant domestic workers,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.130
and literally stand
in their shoes.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.300
It was also a challenge because
most of the actual abuse,

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.160
in many cases even
physical abuse,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.070
was happening at the hands
of, essentially, women

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.670
bosses in the household.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.790
But rights for migrant workers,
migrant domestic workers,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:45.590
as workers, as employees, as
laborers, not as property,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.780
was also very much seen
as a security issue

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.940
by the governments
in that granting them

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.130
rights as workers
suggested granting them

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.650
rights as residents,
and could make

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.700
their migrant status permanent.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.580
We did continue to work to
chip away at these perceptions,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.302
and slowly, the laws
have started to change,

00:28:03.302 --> 00:28:04.510
and really started to change.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:08.380
First, the government started
passing model contracts that

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.930
regulated the number of hours
a migrant worker could work

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.510
a day, that allowed
for time off and breaks

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.760
during the day,
that paid overtime.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.330
These were completely
foreign concepts, the notion

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.760
that a migrant domestic
worker could have a day off.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.770
Employers would say they didn't
want her to have a day off

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.420
because that would mean
she would leave the house,

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.800
and get a boyfriend,
and have sex,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.633
and that's why she
shouldn't have a day off.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.770
But as these
evolved, soon we were

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.320
able to persuade
governments to actually pass

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.230
migrant domestic worker
laws that, again, regulated

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.000
the status of these workers, the
hours, the pay, and so forth,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.080
leading up to the best law of
all which was Jordan's, which

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.750
actually just put migrant
domestic workers to be covered

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.840
by the regular normal labor
law, which, by the way, even

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.520
US and UK law don't do.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.610
Migrant domestic workers are not
covered by the labor law that

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.800
applies to all other workers.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.930
So this was soon
followed, as I said-- now

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.970
Bahrain passed a migrant
domestic worker law.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.320
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Morocco, Qatar, and the UAE

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.860
didn't do it voluntarily.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.350
They were pushed, and now
Lebanon and Oman, surprisingly,

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.760
disappointingly Lebanon, are
the only two remaining outliers,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.830
with large migrant worker
populations that have

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.250
no domestic worker regulations.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.970
So it is an area
of interesting--

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.130
I hate to use the word,
but I will-- intersection

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.987
between women and their
nationality and their gender

00:29:33.987 --> 00:29:35.570
identity, and how
that determines what

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.940
they see as women's issues.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.820
But what I really want
to focus my remarks

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:47.020
on today is how we, I, Human
Rights Watch, as a western,

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.790
albeit international, as
we keep telling people,

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.880
human rights organization
has pursued women's rights

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.840
advocacy in partnership
across the borders

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.760
with women activists
and women's rights

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.360
organizations in the
region, as a model for,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.970
I hope, how we can overcome
some of the challenges

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.730
that any advocacy on women's
rights in the Muslim world

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.960
or Arab world often faces,
that this sort of advocacy,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.660
that this notion of rights
are western in position,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.260
that they're colonial,
that they're imperialist.

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.970
And I want to delve into
our work on Saudi Arabia--

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.310
surprise-- where we've invested
over a decade of research

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.650
and advocacy to tackle
the so-called guardianship

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.620
system in the country, as well
as a host of other measures

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.260
in the country that
segregate and exclude women

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:37.160
from normal life experiences
and opportunities.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.500
So yes, Saudi Arabia has
attracted a great deal

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.100
of attention following dramatic
announcements from the new king

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.800
and the now-famous
young crown prince--

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.830
this week, it's on the cover
of Time Magazine-- promising

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.340
significant reforms for
women's rights and inclusion.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.200
The government's promised
to reform aspects

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.900
of its guardianship system,
allow women to drive,

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.600
open up job sectors
previously excluded to women,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.190
allow women to attend
sporting events,

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.460
implement sports
education for girls,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.950
and further limit the
power of religious police

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.320
who have, for decades,
harassed, attacked,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.380
and beaten women for
perceived morality crimes,

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.640
like a bad hijab.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.060
We have yet to see these
promised reforms materialize,

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.790
but the circumstances that led
to the government prioritizing

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.770
these reforms didn't
happen overnight.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.236
As I think every woman
activist here knows,

00:31:27.236 --> 00:31:29.110
the governments take
credit for these things,

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.140
but it's a long hard
slog of women's work

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.170
for many, many years
that produces change.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:38.020
And Saudi women activists have
been fighting for many years

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.890
to challenge what is undoubtedly
the most regressive regime

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:46.090
of the region, and face terrible
repression and persecution,

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:50.050
including long jail
sentences as a result.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.830
So this also follows, as I
said, a decade of research

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.500
and advocacy from Human
Rights Watch on every aspect

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.320
of the newly promised reforms.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.720
In 2008, we produced
our first report

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.480
on the guardianship system
which, in case you don't know,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.120
requires every woman to have
a male guardian, a father,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.820
a brother, a
husband, even a son,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.120
no matter how old she
is, who has the authority

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.400
to make a range of critical
decisions on her behalf,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.580
including whether she
can apply for a passport,

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.950
travel outside the
country, study abroad

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.270
on government scholarship,
get married, or leave prison.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.030
Saudi women regularly
face difficulty, if not

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.360
the impossibility, of conducting
a range of transactions

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.300
from renting an apartment
to filing a legal claim,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.790
even to obtaining
medical treatment

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.450
without a male relative's
consent or presence.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.900
So our first report on
this subject in 2008

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.430
was pathbreaking, at
least for us, I think,

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.050
and people who work in this,
because it was the first time

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.530
to document the voices and
testimonies of Saudi women,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.860
Saudi children, Saudi
families, in Arabic,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.450
on how the guardianship system
was affecting their lives.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.330
So this wasn't us
telling everybody

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.030
in Saudi Arabia what's wrong
with the guardianship system.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:07.170
It was Saudi women talking about
how this system was ruining

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:09.670
their lives,
including, for example,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.940
a woman who was unable to
get a hysterectomy, which

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.430
she urgently needed, because
her male guardian would not

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.560
consent.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.380
In part in response
to this, and that sort

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.810
of international attention
it brought, the government

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.880
made promises at the
Human Rights Council,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.260
first in 2009, then in 2013,
to abolish the guardianship

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.405
system.

00:33:29.405 --> 00:33:30.780
At the same time,
of course, they

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.090
were saying that they didn't
have a guardianship system,

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.298
and that what they had was
a system where women could

00:33:35.298 --> 00:33:38.160
do a lot of things, except
when they needed protection

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.160
from a male guardian who was
only trying to protect her.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.220
But they eased and soon
abolished most of the labor law

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.340
restrictions that required
male permission to work,

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.770
but they did little to
nothing to sanction employers

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.500
that continued to require it.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.330
In education,
various universities

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.780
started to abolish the guardian
permission requirement.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.630
In 2014, divorced women
were allowed to register

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.010
their children in schools--
before they couldn't.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.390
In 2016, divorced
or widowed women,

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.300
women without a guardian,
could obtain their own identity

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:13.730
cards which was necessary to
access any social service.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.215
We turned to sports
next, because we

00:34:16.215 --> 00:34:17.840
thought the moment
was ripe, with Saudi

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.350
joining the five-member
Olympic commission for the 2012

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.340
Olympics.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.080
And we focused on the
exclusion of women

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.330
from the Saudi
Olympic delegation,

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.540
and pressured them to
finally include Saudi women

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.150
in their team in
the 2012 Olympics,

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.060
as well as to promise to
allow girls sports education

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.020
in schools, previously not
allowed in public schools

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.980
because it might, in the
words of one Saudi cleric,

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.370
damage their virginity.

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:49.130
But Saudi women watching
Saudi athletes on television

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.770
at the London Olympics,
waving the Saudi flag,

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.139
said it was the happiest
day in their lives

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:58.550
to see themselves represented
in an international scale.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.700
So in 2016, we decided
to launch an update

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.460
to highlight these
reforms, but also wanted

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.710
to really push to
eliminate this guardianship

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.200
system in its entirety.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.030
We launched an 80-page
report, and three short videos

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.830
which you'll see
later, that aimed

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.960
at highlighting the
continued application

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.390
of this discriminatory system.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.270
But this time, more
than any prior time,

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.790
we decided to partner
very, very closely

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.560
with a number of
incredible Saudi women

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.530
activists and
influential commentators,

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.390
because we wanted
to be persuasive,

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.060
we wanted to be effective, we
wanted people in Saudi Arabia

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:39.170
to actually hear us and not just
hear voices that we scripted,

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:45.170
but hear issues in a narrative
that was persuasive, locally.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.780
And so we consulted with these
activists and commentators

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.430
on every aspect of our
research and advocacy,

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.790
the videos, the
recommendations in the report,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.560
and the strategy we
we're going to use

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.230
to ensure that the report
got traction in Saudi Arabia

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.800
itself.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.425
So for example, we originally
demanded, as a recommendation

00:36:04.425 --> 00:36:08.170
in our report, a complete
end to sex segregation,

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.990
particularly in the workplace
where this is a huge problem.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:14.180
But our Saudi partners
advised against it.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.390
So instead, we asked
the Ministry of Labor

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.210
to abolish registries
of companies

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.800
that don't sex segregate.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.830
It was a more modest
ask, but it was one

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.600
that they felt would effectively
address much of their problem.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.060
It would end the
stigmatization of employers

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.280
that did not segregate.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.400
Saudi activists spent hours
working with us on the videos,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.650
and went back and forth
on specific details

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.830
about what would make it seem
authentic to a Saudi audience,

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.920
what the hashtags should be,
what the tag lines should be,

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.070
and we agreed it
would be Together

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.600
To End Male Guardianship.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.270
We interviewed Saudi
business women, artists,

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.610
and commentators, to see
what narrative they thought

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.460
would be most effective
in the videos,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.690
and we spent months teeing
up the report and the videos

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.430
with prominent commentators.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.170
Saudi Arabia has
the deepest Twitter

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:09.730
saturation rate pro capite
in the world, large groups

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.790
on Telegram and
Facebook, asking them

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.880
to put their own spin on
the issue, on the report,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.680
on the commentary.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.470
So I want to play these
very short videos for you

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.230
now, so you get a
flavor of how we tried

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:27.400
to communicate on this issue.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:43.030
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.660
- Look.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.035
The best thing you can do is
reconcile with your husband.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.900
- She brought shame upon us.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.525
There's no way I can
let her come home.

00:39:43.169 --> 00:39:51.630
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.770
- So together, the video has
garnered 2 and 1/2 million

00:39:55.770 --> 00:40:00.150
views on Facebook, and
270,000 more on YouTube

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:03.330
within the first 72
hours of their release.

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:09.110
Our hashtag campaign, Together
To End Male Guardianship--

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:12.550
a little help in the slide.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.220
Got it?

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:19.850
Yeah-- inspired Saudi activists
to launch their own grassroots

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:23.710
campaign two weeks after
our report launched.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.540
And that was Saudi women--

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.670
sorry, clicking here--

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:35.130
Saudi women to demand
an end to guardianship.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.740
Every day, they would add
a number, one, two, three,

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.970
to track each day as
their campaign went on.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.900
It was trending for three
months in a number of videos

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.540
and social campaigns.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.940
In a number of the videos,
our report's recommendations

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.220
were copy pasted as the
campaign's demands, which

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.930
was pretty incredible.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.390
Activists had a sense of
ownership over the campaign

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:59.880
and tweeted it, and
shared it, as I mentioned.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.120
The hashtag is still
circulating, apparently even

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.710
graffitied on walls
in Saudi Arabia.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.900
They posted personal
testimonials online,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.750
made their own videos,
including a music video,

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.690
which I wish I
could play with you,

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.710
which had 20 million views,
created and distributed

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.430
their own 'I Am My Own
Guardian' bracelets,

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:30.480
organized the sending of 2,500
messages and a 15,000-signature

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:34.800
petition to the king, asking him
to dismantle the guardianship

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.495
system, and the petition
was only in Arabic.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.190
They wrote articles creating
the system, and created art.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.440
This is Ms. Suffau,
a Saudi artist

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.360
who made t-shirts,
murals and images

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.120
that became the unofficial
symbol of the campaign,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.880
and which she released
to the public domain.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.575
The stickers then stuck around.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.630
Saudi activists,
writers, and academics

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.470
came out, saying women deserve
more independence from men.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.200
Even though the Grand Mufti
critiqued the campaign,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.800
other religious officials soon
said that, actually, women

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.120
should be equal.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.264
Run out of time here,
so maybe in the Q&amp;A,

00:42:15.264 --> 00:42:17.430
I can tell you a little bit
about the current status

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.710
of the promised reforms.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.420
They're still mostly
promises, but the risks

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.270
for women activists
remain heightened,

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.180
and the campaign has
not been cost free.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.220
Just one example,
women activists

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.040
received phone calls before
the announcement about women

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.740
driving, telling them
not to speak publicly

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.690
about the end of
the driving ban,

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.970
because the narrative is
that this is a government

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.860
initiative, and that
only the government can

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.900
be an agent of change.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.890
That's completely false.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:48.390
Thank you.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.515
- Thank you so much, Sarah.

00:42:52.614 --> 00:42:53.580
That's excellent.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.546
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:54.546 --> 00:42:55.269
- I know.

00:42:55.269 --> 00:42:56.310
There was 25 minutes, so.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.859
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:59.859 --> 00:43:01.100
- Nilufer.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.010
- I jump.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:02.510
OK.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.870
- Thank you.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.440
- Thank you.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.460
Thank you very much
for letting me also

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.820
to join the conversation.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.630
Now the word conversation is
loaded since the last panel.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.490
So I was wondering if
I have the courage.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.380
Is this majority?

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:18.920
What is it?

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.650
It's every time for a
person, or for a woman,

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:26.330
it's hard to join the
conversation to synchronize

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.130
our words and perspectives.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:33.470
So I will be speaking
about Muslim women,

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.380
but in European contexts,
which is different

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.460
because where there's freedom,
where state doesn't control,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.070
doesn't take control
over the public life,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.990
I think this is the difference,
maybe, that I pursue with you,

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.780
how the public sphere
is free, and it becomes

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.190
a very important place of
encounter between Muslim women

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.980
and others.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.110
This will be the kind of--

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:04.760
I mean, the realm in which
I'm going to situate my talk.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.980
And the question that
will lead my talk will be,

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.640
do we have to share the
same norms to belong?

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.300
I think this is just a
simple question, but quite

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.980
complicated, that I'm trying to,
not answer, but at least raise,

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.520
because I think that's what is
going on in European context,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.910
the question of difference,
this time, difference,

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.680
religious and
cultural, because it's

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.840
hard to make the definition
of Islamic presence in Europe.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.950
Is it about religion?

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.000
Is it about culture?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.600
It's both.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.900
I would say it is not
properly addressed

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.940
since the last 20 years.

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.290
We can see the
controversies around Islam

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:58.520
are debated in a way that
has not provided societies

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.370
with frames of thinking
this difference.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.010
That will be maybe
the end result,

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.650
which changes or endangers the
pluralistic democracies itself.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:15.840
So this is the frame of my talk.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:23.300
So the Islamic presence is
basically framed as a problem,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.670
and we put together many
different problems together.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.000
That is refugee crisis.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.090
It became a crisis
situation, refugee crisis,

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:36.050
jihadist terrorism,
and Muslim migrants

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.290
living in European
countries, already

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.580
second, third
generation, as citizens.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:48.080
So the question of citizenship
are not related in the same way

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.080
to these three groups,
and very often, we

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.980
make this amalgam, as
the French would say,

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.980
the identification between
these three problems

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.160
that are quite
distinct, that also

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.600
overshadows the ordinary Muslims
living in these countries.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.810
The word ordinary is
also quite a paradox,

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:12.980
because you cannot be ordinary
if you become visibly Muslim,

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.470
and that is the
real issue today.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.620
How do you become a citizen,
ordinary citizen, but when

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.960
you are visibly
Muslim, that creates

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.990
some problems, tensions,
conflicts, and even laws

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.290
at the end of the day.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:33.370
So basically, I am
thinking about Muslim faith

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.960
in post-migratory faith.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:39.100
I say post migratory
because they themselves,

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.590
the youth living
in European cities,

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:47.620
doesn't want to be identified
as people of migrant origin.

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.990
It is important because
we identify them

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.860
as coming from migrant origins.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.040
They do not want to be
identified as in relation

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.710
to their parents'
origins, national origins.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.590
So they do feel belonging
to French society,

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.420
to Germany, to Italy.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.820
That's something very
important, and we still

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.100
send them to the origins
of their parents.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.790
So this is their own way
of becoming citizens,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:21.100
so this citizenship, but without
giving up Muslim difference.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.480
Indeed, the way they also
recover or reappropriate

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.360
Muslim religious
markers are quite

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.830
different from their parents.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.330
So it's something new, because
the conditions of migration

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.836
create a rupture,
a discontinuity,

00:47:37.836 --> 00:47:40.750
in terms of learning
religion, in terms

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.390
of transmission of religion.

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.590
So the ways these Muslim, third,
second, generation of Muslims

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.600
are living their faith
is quite different.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.170
They are innovating on the
basis of everyday life,

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:58.570
the way of becoming, the way
how to live their religion

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.270
in a European secular context.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.150
So it's not a linear
process of integration,

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.350
but we are at the stage
of a certain integration--

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.660
that's why I called it
post-migratory phase--

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:16.160
that the problems arise,
not because it's a problem.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.130
But on the contrary,
those Muslims

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:22.090
who are already successful
in their integration

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:26.140
create these series
of controversies.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.640
Why?

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.890
Because the first generation
was very discreet in the ways

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:35.460
they expressed their
religious difference.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.440
They kept it at home.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.600
They didn't show it publicly.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.380
So the second, third generation
post-migratory phase,

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.620
they have enough confidence
as being citizens

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:51.810
of those countries to manifest
their religious difference,

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:56.140
markers of their
identity, publicly.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.330
And this is an [INAUDIBLE] term.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:03.910
Citizenship is your capacity,
also not having ID cards,

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:07.630
but also having the
courage in everyday life

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.780
to show your
difference, not being

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:15.070
scared, of keeping it at home.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.040
So this public life,
that's why this publicness

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.970
is very important,
publicly visible.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.390
I'm not speaking of
Muslim minorities

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:27.760
as visible minorities,
like category

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.180
of race, although they are
also visible minorities,

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.360
but they are actively
visible minorities.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.750
They are active minorities.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.740
This is Serge Moscovici,
a social psychologist

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:41.530
in the '80s, who have
coined this term for women

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.740
feminist movement,
how women became

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.430
actively active minorities,
that is, they are transforming

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:52.390
their conditions of life,
their subjectivities,

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:54.970
actively into a
group of minorities.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:59.470
It's not only a way of
living it as a number,

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.700
but it is a kind of active
appropriation of the situation

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:10.090
which is neither in conformity
with Islamic patriarchal norms,

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:14.530
nor in conformity with
feminist secular norms.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.490
That becomes a problem.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:22.450
So this assertive religious
difference, I would say,

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:25.830
makes Muslims to be
more publicly visible.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.630
This assertiveness,
that's not being discreet,

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:33.310
is perceived sometimes as
being aggressive, political,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.970
ideological, and not
just an issue of faith.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:43.900
So we can ask first
the question, when

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.380
a religious symbol
becomes visible,

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.600
visibility is a
relation of power.

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.470
When it becomes visible to
us, it becomes visible when

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.470
we ask questions, when
it is foreign to us,

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:00.170
when we think it's alien,
we are not familiar with.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.720
There is a spatial
transgression.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.030
Boundaries are transgressed.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.370
When it is working
class covering,

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:13.910
it wasn't a debate, neither
in France nor in Germany.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.895
Nobody has seen or noticed
the working class head

00:51:18.895 --> 00:51:21.440
scarf the head scarf of
working class people,

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.600
or the grandmothers.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.780
It becomes visible when
it is the young students

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.810
in high schools who are
covering themselves,

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.960
or the teachers in German
schools, with the heads scarf.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.510
Then it becomes visible.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.720
So there is a transgression
of boundaries,

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.620
but that transgression
is also indicating

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.920
a social upward social mobility.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.100
They are succeeding
in public schools.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:53.250
They are succeeding in
their professional careers.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:57.150
But it becomes a problem
for the public perception.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.940
So there's subjectivity,
on the one hand,

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:04.290
agency of these women, but
also public perception,

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.640
on the other hand.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.910
So we need a
readjustment of that,

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:13.060
and that readjustment is
not easy, because normally,

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:19.500
in the European countries,
the secular belief,

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.120
secularization, meant, in
spite of the differences

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.180
among countries.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.420
We always speak of
French exceptionalism,

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:30.900
but I don't think it's so
exceptional in these terms.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:34.055
We believe that religion
should be in the private.

00:52:34.055 --> 00:52:35.515
It should be regulated.

00:52:35.515 --> 00:52:36.390
It should be private.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.990
It as if something
very abstract.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:43.190
It's in your minds, or at
home, but religion is also

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.570
something very public.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.090
And it is also embodied.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:52.030
It is related with
bodily practices.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.930
You cover yourself.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.980
It's something very personal.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.420
It is corporeal.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.330
It's same with dietary habits.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.580
It's same with praying.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.995
Saba Mahmood, who we
lost very recently,

00:53:03.995 --> 00:53:09.670
a very well known
anthropologist on Islam,

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:13.060
she has shown how
much religious rituals

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.350
is important to understand
as the embodiment of faith.

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:20.790
Faith is not something
a belief, but it's also

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:21.870
embodied practice.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.550
You survey.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:25.480
You control your faith.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.890
It's not something you have
it once for all on your paper.

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:34.360
So these embodied practices,
like dietary habits,

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.800
praying, covering, bring
forth all the controversies

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.870
in European societies.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:45.070
And as I said, this
requires a readjustment

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:48.070
between Muslim
subjectivities, what

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:50.930
they think about
their own faith,

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:53.710
and how the public
perceives them.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.200
You can say, in a
simple way, well,

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.480
this would mean recognition.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.450
We need to recognize
the difference,

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:07.100
religious difference, religious
practices, of another religion.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:14.460
But this creates a
destructive effect

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.120
in the established norms
of a given society, that

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.480
is, Muslim presence
is not something only

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.720
to be recognized,
but also requires

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.100
a two-way transformation.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:31.060
Somebody has asked, for the
first panel, have mentioned,

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:35.300
we cannot take norms as
given, but norms are changing.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.890
So the fact that Muslim women
are covering themselves,

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:44.440
and yet following emancipatory
trajectories of life,

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:50.360
in terms of education,
going out of the house,

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.160
nevertheless, questions
the secular feminist way

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.200
of emancipation.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.950
So if we think in
that terms, so it's

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:05.150
not only passive recognition,
but two-way change, which

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:08.960
makes it very difficult. So
the recognition of these women

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.630
failed.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.740
I go fast.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:16.850
Recognition of Muslim
women's covering,

00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:20.330
I would say, failed, because
now we have everywhere laws

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.700
and things, and
especially it failed

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:29.120
not only by state politics,
but also by spokespersons

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:38.430
of one kind of feminism, who
denied agency of Muslim women.

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:42.660
They didn't recognize
the agency that is

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.720
embedded in covering yourself.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:53.370
So now, after 20 years
of debate on head scarf,

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.720
still the name is problematic.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.180
When we don't know how to relate
ourselves with a difference,

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.920
we try to invent names.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.810
We go back to the sources.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:09.630
Burka, hijab, as if Arabic
origins or other origins

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:10.680
would give us the key.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.940
Or it's nearby,
which is in Europe.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.400
Burkini, in that matter,
is a very good example.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.710
I love burkini, because burkini
is something now you cannot go

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:24.070
back to Arab origins.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:31.710
It is a beach culture,
and it's an accommodation,

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:35.490
quite creative by a
form, and still maybe

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.050
some of you have seen it.

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:39.390
Last summer there
was a big scandal

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:44.370
over burkini, and how
a woman with a burkini

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.080
can go to a beach.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.000
So beach, do they belong to a
beach, Muslim woman, or beach

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.280
belongs to a Muslim woman?

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:58.680
Now we don't have the guardians,
but we have policemen.

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.240
So this is the
question I'm asking.

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.670
Do we have to share the
same norms to belong?

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:07.310
Is the condition of
citizenship means

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:11.380
conformity with
established norms?

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.670
And today, the
secularity or secularism

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:20.480
plays the role of
redefining these norms,

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.800
including feminist sexual
minorities becoming

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.600
like a norm, as compulsory,
as something that people

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.250
has to pass a test in
order to be citizen,

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.420
not only within the
country, but also before--

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.710
I think it was in Netherlands.

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:41.390
You will help me in
the next, maybe, panel.

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:47.980
There was a film showing some
kind of manners in sexual ways,

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.340
quite free, to see
if the people who

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.870
are asking to come to be migrant
can accept, can be tolerant,

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.470
with these values.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:00.730
So our democracies are becoming
very sexual democracies

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:02.470
in a way.

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:10.360
And so the question of if
you are in conformity or not

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.070
with the norms are becoming
a very important element

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:18.240
of the political culture, public
culture, of European countries,

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.960
in the last 20 years, with
the ways in which they have

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.730
framed the question of Islam.

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:27.730
It became a question of
norm, hierarchy of norms.

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:29.730
I can say it in different ways.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.070
I can, say the way
we have thought

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:34.620
in the western
countries of difference

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.130
is either in terms
of religious minority

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:42.420
rights, basically more
right-wing people,

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.650
or multiculturalism.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:48.150
So two ways of thinking,
two frames of thinking,

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:52.530
both multiculturalism
and religious rights,

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:56.140
religious minority rights,
do not apply today.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.170
So they fall short.

00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.580
They have been criticized.

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:03.460
So we do not know how
to address this issue.

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.100
Second example I
would like to give,

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.560
and then I'll go
quick to finish,

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.480
is an example that is more
incongruous because it

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.550
is circumcision, of
male, young male,

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:20.640
not women, young
male in the family.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.130
It is an interesting
example because again, this

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:28.800
was raised in the first panel,
not gender only straight women,

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.320
more straight than
Muslim woman--

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.670
cannot be-- and so
circumcision of male,

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.100
that was another
controversy, which happened.

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.750
It's a religious marker.

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:44.100
It can't be publicly visible,
but it can be a public issue.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:50.220
When there was a medical
problem in a case in Cologne,

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:56.800
in Germany now,
and it was in 2010,

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.540
and it became a very
important debate,

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.820
and the court,
regional court, decided

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:07.890
to forbid the circumcision
of young boys,

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:12.090
with the argument that it is the
violation of physical integrity

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:13.950
of the young boys.

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:16.210
Of course, well, this
is the irony of history.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.900
It's quite sad, but
Germany, who has

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.940
done so important work
in relation to the past,

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:26.470
that we haven't done in
other parts of the world,

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:32.390
like in Turkey, so although they
have done this work of memory

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.160
in relation to
Holocaust, they have just

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.640
forgotten that circumcision
was a religious ritual that

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.160
concerned Jewish
community as well.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.130
Of course, that triggered
a terrible anxiety

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.470
within the Jewish community
because it was also

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:50.240
framed as the most archaic
tradition that doesn't have

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.550
its place in German society.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.540
And forbidding circumcision for
targeting Muslim population,

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:00.320
mental, so, it brought in
the Jewish circumcision

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.670
in the picture.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:06.650
So Jewish society, Jewish
community, reacted.

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:10.970
They have transformed, with
the help of Merkel, the law.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.670
I don't go into details.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.460
But what is interesting
in that example,

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:21.390
it's also belonging, because
is it a religious ritual?

01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:25.950
It is also a belonging
between a father and the son,

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:29.910
because it's a way
of identification,

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:34.620
both in Judaism and in Islam,
although there are differences,

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.900
because it's not a Quranic
principle in the case of Islam,

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.510
but it's an Abrahamic tradition.

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:45.180
And it is a prophetic
tradition, so it

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.750
became a custom, very
important custom,

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:52.590
and it's a rite of
passage, rite of passage.

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:54.600
So you belong to a
Muslim community,

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.140
both for Muslim and Jewish male.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.910
It is a distinctive
trait of Muslim men.

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.130
Of course, I know,
in the states,

01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.110
it has no such
distinctive trait.

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:10.280
But in the past, and still,
it is an ongoing debate,

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.930
circumcision as a kind of sense
of belonging within the family,

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:17.000
but also it concerns women.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.830
Can women be married with
a non-circumcised man?

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:24.890
So again, the
question of belonging

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:30.250
can come up in ways that
we don't think about it,

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:36.150
and bring not only how Muslim
population is acknowledged

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:38.740
by laws and
regulations, but also it

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:43.690
brings in the relationship
to Judeo Islamic traditions.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:48.880
So whether Europe will be
more Judeo Christian or Judeo

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.060
Islamic, because there
are many familiarities.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.740
Maybe I would leave it
here because I'm seeing

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.910
Samantha preparing her notes.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.970
I can just leave it
on the circumcision

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.480
issue and Judeo Islamic,
which creates more tension.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.386
Thank you.

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:09.378
- Beautiful.

01:03:09.378 --> 01:03:10.370
Thank you.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.332
Thank you so much.

01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:21.540
We were supposed to have a
discussion back and forth.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.590
But I think there are so
many amazing people out

01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:29.160
in the audience with, I'm sure,
a very diverse set of views.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.510
And I urge you to step
up to the microphone

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:36.800
and either ask questions,
or offer feedback.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.650
While you're moving
in that direction,

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:44.940
and we have about 21
minutes for the discussion,

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:50.540
I was struck, in listening
to both presentations,

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.930
while each are on
very, in a sense,

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:58.020
sort of nationally specific
or community specific issues,

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.230
but the universality
of the dilemmas.

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:05.390
So as you're speaking about
activists, even just imagining,

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.100
every day, the
choices that activists

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.130
have to make in terms
of how maximalist to be,

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:15.890
given all of the gaps
in terms of their rights

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:18.225
and their rights enjoyment.

01:04:18.225 --> 01:04:19.850
Those dilemmas, I
think, are universal,

01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:23.000
and ones people here and
elsewhere have grappled with.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.040
And then the questions
on social norms.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.100
Before I came over, because
I was cramming on immigration

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.950
for the purposes of
suddenly having to present,

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.120
but I watched--

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.650
I don't recommend
this to anybody--

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:37.370
but I watched the
two-minute welcome video

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.950
that President Trump
recorded not that long

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.899
ago to people who were
being naturalized,

01:04:42.899 --> 01:04:44.190
at the naturalization ceremony.

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.280
I do not recommend this
viewing for anybody,

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.567
but there was like a long
time where it wasn't up,

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:52.400
and this is something,
since George W. Bush,

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.316
American presidents have,
at these ceremonies,

01:04:54.316 --> 01:04:57.590
which are very, very moving,
where you take the oath

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.300
and so forth.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.670
But a couple of the lines
I actually wrote down,

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:06.590
they just remind me
of your presentation.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.670
He says, nicely, no
matter where you come from

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:14.372
or what faith you practice, this
country is now your country.

01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:15.080
So that was good.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.460
Go team.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.170
Team America.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:27.470
But then, to your point, he
calls on naturalized citizens

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:29.930
or newcomers to,
quote, assimilate

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:36.170
to our way of life, end quote,
in just a very directive way.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.290
And I can't imagine--

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:40.490
because this dilemma exists.

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:44.420
The dilemma is real
about assimilation,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.730
and what did the
melting pot mean?

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:51.710
How much melting was required,
or is it E Pluribus Unum?

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:54.210
But I was very
struck by how direct,

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:58.619
and then who defines the
'our' in our way of life?

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.410
I'm stalling and
filibustering in the hopes

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.180
that people are going to
step up to the microphone.

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.096
I'm going to cold call
people, because we have

01:06:04.096 --> 01:06:06.290
such experts in the audience.

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:08.750
If you're not careful, the old
Socratic method will come--

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:09.380
OK, great.

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.890
Thank you, sir.

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:12.452
- My name is Ryan.

01:06:12.452 --> 01:06:13.910
I'm a member of
the public, and I'm

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:15.868
really grateful that
you're open to the public.

01:06:15.868 --> 01:06:17.180
It's really great.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.342
I have so many questions.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.550
My father is a Muslim
immigrant from the Middle East.

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:24.560
So I'm really interested
in a lot of these subjects.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.435
When you talked about
nationality citizenship

01:06:26.435 --> 01:06:28.018
in the Middle East,
and how that's not

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:30.757
passed on from women, and even
the last panel, in America,

01:06:30.757 --> 01:06:31.590
it's very different.

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:33.256
I had never really
even thought of that,

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:35.030
so it was awesome
to think about.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.155
But when I think of those
issues in the Middle East

01:06:37.155 --> 01:06:40.380
specifically, I think of
nationality, oppression,

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.630
citizenship, things like that.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:44.435
I go to the Israeli
Palestinian issue,

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:48.410
and the occupied territories,
where the Palestinians,

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:51.200
in many ways, are already
second-class citizens,

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.405
and to go a further
layer into that,

01:06:53.405 --> 01:06:54.697
the women in those territories.

01:06:54.697 --> 01:06:56.780
I was wondering, because
you had so much knowledge

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.220
about the whole
area, the region,

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.110
with Human Rights
Watch, I was wondering

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:01.610
if you could speak
a little bit more

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.240
specifically about those
areas where most people aren't

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.886
represented by the Israeli
government, who kind of watches

01:07:07.886 --> 01:07:09.260
over them, and if
you could speak

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.968
to those specific
people in those regions

01:07:10.968 --> 01:07:13.088
a little bit more.

01:07:13.088 --> 01:07:13.830
- Thank you.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:14.500
Go ahead, Sarah.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.125
Well, I was going to
take a few, but we

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:18.340
don't have a very long
line, so why don't you--

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.694
and please, I encourage
people to don't be shy.

01:07:22.694 --> 01:07:23.360
Go ahead, ma'am.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:23.860
- Hi.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.940
My name is Debali,
and I'm a grad student

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.550
in gender and migration
at the Fletcher

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.500
School of Law and Diplomacy.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.360
And I was just wondering
if either of you

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.960
could talk a little
bit about how, one, you

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.010
advocate for LGBTQ
communities in the Middle

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:44.330
East and North Africa, and
as well as what you think,

01:07:44.330 --> 01:07:48.170
how identity changes or how
you practice identity changes

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:50.640
in terms of migrating to Europe.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.140
Thank you.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.830
- Excellent.

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:54.890
- On the first
question, are you asking

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:56.720
about the status of
Palestinian women

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.640
in the occupied Palestinian
territory, specifically?

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.674
Yeah, well, the law
that governs them

01:08:02.674 --> 01:08:04.340
depends on whether
they live in the West

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.540
Bank in East Jerusalem, or
Gaza, because if they live--

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.890
then they have
either British law

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:13.700
that was in place
at the time, or they

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.770
have Ottoman law that
was in place at the time,

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:17.510
prior to the occupation.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:23.220
And these systems of
law, mostly penal code,

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.250
but also family
law, have actually

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.840
not been amended or updated.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.700
So they're actually
much more outdated

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.669
than the laws in
Egypt or Morocco

01:08:30.669 --> 01:08:32.210
or other places
where there have been

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:35.270
more regular updatings
of the family laws,

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.380
and the penal
codes, and so forth.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.830
And so in many ways,
they retain many

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.810
of the most regressive
features, one of which,

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.700
for example, is the
'marry your rapist'

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.800
provision that allows rapists
to marry their victims.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.439
And I should say that
most of these cases

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.569
that we've seen of
marry your rapists, just

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:57.470
to not terrify people,
are statutory rape cases,

01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:59.420
often boyfriend/girlfriend
cases,

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.319
where technically it's rape,
and now the teenage daughter

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.330
typically has been defiled.

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:10.430
Then they want to marry
her off, and the boy

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:13.160
can be prosecuted as a rapist.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.899
And so rather than
go to jail, they

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.140
marry them off and so forth.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:19.609
But in other cases, it
actually is a 14-year-old girl

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:21.560
forced to marry her
rapist because now, she's

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.500
damaged goods and unwanted.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.170
And in fact, I remember
interviewing a young girl

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.830
in Libya many years ago
who was in jail because she

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.899
refused to marry her rapist.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:35.870
So there you have it.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:41.840
In other ways, there's a big
domestic violence problem,

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.810
without a domestic violence law.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:47.330
And women do need
consent to marry,

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.479
various other provisions
that are relics of these very

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.124
outdated penal code systems.

01:09:52.124 --> 01:09:53.790
But one of the things
that's interesting

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.670
and, whenever we've
taken on women's issues

01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:57.750
in the occupied
Palestinian territories,

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.750
has taken a lot of
pushback, and sometimes it's

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.320
very real, is that local
activists don't want

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.420
to prioritize women's
issues because they say

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.820
the occupation is the
number one issue in all

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.604
of the ills of society--

01:10:09.604 --> 01:10:11.270
it's sort of a 'kick
your dog' syndrome.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:12.853
You're oppressed,
so you kick your dog

01:10:12.853 --> 01:10:14.440
or you kick your wife--

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.340
are a result of the
occupation, and having

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.150
to grapple with that.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:21.420
And in fact, there were
times when we actually

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.420
had prepared a report on
domestic violence and spousal

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.347
abuse, and so forth, and
we had to continually delay

01:10:27.347 --> 01:10:29.430
releasing the report because
there was another war

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:30.390
and another conflict.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:33.520
And you can't drop a report
on domestic violence,

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.810
whether in Egypt
or in Palestine,

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.300
when people are being
slaughtered in the streets.

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:41.850
And the dilemma that we always
have in the Middle East,

01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:46.980
now sadly in so many countries,
is that women's rights issues

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.292
become de-prioritized.

01:10:48.292 --> 01:10:50.250
We had a major campaign
we were going to launch

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:51.537
on child marriage in Yemen.

01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:53.620
There used to be a law
prohibiting child marriage.

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.900
It was overturned.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.774
Mass epidemic of child
marriage in Yemen.

01:10:57.774 --> 01:10:59.940
And we just had to put it
on the cold burner because

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:01.980
of this horrible war there.

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.390
Nobody has the attention
span for these issues,

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:07.206
or the capability
to address them.

01:11:07.206 --> 01:11:08.690
- And the LGBT issue?

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:09.740
- Yeah, the LGBT issue.

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.930
I'm glad you raised that.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:14.897
I mean, it's, in
ways, a women's issue.

01:11:14.897 --> 01:11:16.980
When I started at Human
Rights Watch 15 years ago,

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.440
the unwritten rule
was, we don't talk

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.290
about LGBT issues
in the Middle East

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:23.290
unless it's through the
lens of another problem.

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:25.500
So we wouldn't talk
about persecution

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.180
of gays or lesbians.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:28.800
We would talk about torture.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.780
Oh, and by the
way, in this case,

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:33.030
it's gay people who
are being tortured.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:35.820
Or police abuse,
oh, and by the way,

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.060
it's transgender
women in Kuwait who

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.990
are being burned and
assaulted by police.

01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:44.280
That's changed.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.470
That's changed a lot,
and we've taken our cues

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:49.110
from the local LGBT
movements that have emerged,

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:51.540
local LGBT activists
that have emerged,

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:54.830
in many places across
the Middle East.

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:58.140
Few, not many, most of them
are individual activists,

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.750
such that this year,
for the first time,

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:05.550
this month, we're launching a
report, and a series of videos,

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:10.290
that will target the
LGBT youth community,

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:12.810
from interviews,
over 80 interviews,

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:17.010
with LGBT activists,
celebrities, artists, singers,

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:19.110
musicians, from across
the Middle East,

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:22.080
speaking in Arabic, speaking
in their country's dialect,

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.590
addressing some of the
problems of LGBT communities.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:28.020
But basic things
like, you're not sick.

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.910
Actually, it's not
a disease to be

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.650
LGBT, which is what
people have heard,

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.740
or you can be a Muslim and LGBT.

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.590
Or you have rights,
under human rights law.

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:40.270
Your government may not
know that yet, but you do.

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:43.200
So we are very directly
frontally taking

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.100
on the rights of the LGBT
community in the Middle East,

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.040
because we think, also,
the time is right for it.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.660
Society's right for it.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:53.150
The youth bulge
in the Middle East

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:56.250
is real; 70% of the
population of the Middle East

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.080
is under the age of 18 or 25--

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.660
I'm getting the number
wrong-- but things

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.785
are, and will continue to
rapidly change on these fronts.

01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:06.160
- We have now a wonderful line.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:11.130
I wanted to just share one
little anecdote from my time

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:12.690
as UN ambassador.

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:16.060
We strove, over the course of
the eight years of the Obama

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:19.450
administration, to promote
LGBT rights internationally,

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:23.250
including in areas that
were quite legendarily

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:27.840
hostile on the ground to these
rights and these individuals.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.272
And one of my ambitions
was to somehow find

01:13:31.272 --> 01:13:33.730
a way to get LGBT rights onto
the agenda of the UN Security

01:13:33.730 --> 01:13:37.440
Council, which is the premier
decision-making body at the UN.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:43.380
And when ISIS struck, and
began to take territory,

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.650
one of the many forms
of terror that inflicted

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:48.990
was on the subset
of LGBT people,

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:53.580
forcing gay men,
depicted on video,

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:56.790
basically pushing
them off buildings

01:13:56.790 --> 01:14:00.300
and killing them, or forcing
them to jump themselves.

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.530
And it was so horrific.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.990
And I went to my Security
Council partners,

01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:07.750
both in the Middle East and
well beyond, and said, look,

01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:10.440
we should do a Security
Council meeting on this.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.137
We've done everything
to do with ISIS.

01:14:12.137 --> 01:14:13.470
We've done ISIS and the Yazidis.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.020
We've done ISIS and sexual
violence against women,

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.580
and sexual trafficking.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:21.060
We've done ISIS and
cultural artifacts.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.700
You're telling me we can do
things, which are very, very

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.880
important, and not do like
this subset of people,

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.140
and basically everybody
said, yes, in fact.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:30.880
But we did it.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.902
And we did it in part because
this is, within the UN,

01:14:34.902 --> 01:14:36.360
a very different
setting than doing

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:39.120
the real work that Sarah's
doing on the ground.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.550
But we did it because
we were able to partner

01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:46.740
with the Chilean government,
so it wasn't a US-led effort,

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:49.385
and we didn't do it in the
formal chamber of the Security

01:14:49.385 --> 01:14:51.510
Council, but we did what's
called an Arria meeting.

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:54.150
It was the first meeting in 70
years of the Security Council

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:58.580
on the fate of any
LGBT population.

01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:01.859
But the Trojan
horse we needed was

01:15:01.859 --> 01:15:03.900
ISIS, which is the one
thing everyone could agree

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.420
was completely terrible, to
your point about torture,

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.620
and so forth.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.870
Let's just take the string
of comments or questions,

01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.482
and then the panel-- thank you.

01:15:11.482 --> 01:15:12.673
- Hi.

01:15:12.673 --> 01:15:14.800
My name's Natalie Hamilton.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.310
I'm from Franklin
Pierce University,

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:18.230
and this question is for Sarah.

01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:20.960
So you spoke a little bit
about the promising reforms

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.574
coming from your activists.

01:15:22.574 --> 01:15:24.740
And I wanted to know if you
could speak a little bit

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:27.260
about the risks
your activists face,

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.030
and if you see a
difference of the risks

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.040
faced between the women
in your organization

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.570
and the Saudi women, strictly.

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:36.440
- Thank you so much.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.940
We're going to just
take all of you,

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.050
because we don't
have a ton of time.

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:40.130
We want to hear all the voices.

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:40.670
- Thank you.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:41.711
My name is Lamil Bobodon.

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.250
I'm a post doc.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.430
And I study human trafficking,
and to a large degree,

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:48.770
I deal with victims
of human trafficking.

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:51.410
And many anti-trafficking
campaigns

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.660
are very similar
to the one we saw,

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.540
the Human Rights Watch,
if I'm not mistaken,

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.490
and I don't know
if everyone else,

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:00.710
but there was a
striking difference

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:03.560
between what Human
Rights Watch did

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.340
with this campaign, as
opposed to the campaigns who

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.870
came from the region.

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:13.820
The first one was where you
see bruised women, beaten,

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.960
immobile.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.910
And then the second
one, the one that

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.500
came from within
the region, I think,

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.630
was more empowering,
the one that said,

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:22.790
like I'm my own guardian.

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:27.130
So I'm wondering if your
organization is actually

01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:30.760
thinking more in doing some
campaigns to empower women,

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.430
because from my own
research, dealing

01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.430
with [INAUDIBLE]
trafficking, that backfires.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:38.530
Many people don't want
to identify themselves

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:42.760
as victims, because they don't
like the images that we see.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.190
So I'm just would like to
have your comments on these.

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:45.490
Thank you.

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:47.490
- Thank you so much, and
thank you for your work

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:48.400
on trafficking.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.490
Yes?

01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:51.370
- Hello.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.270
My name's Madeleine.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.644
I'm a general women's studies
student from the University

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:55.480
of Rhode Island.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.340
And my question is for Sarah.

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.990
At the beginning
of your remarks,

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:02.830
you listed a bunch
of new legislation

01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:05.980
in place to protect women
who come forward about sex

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:07.390
crimes and domestic violence.

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:09.280
And I'm just
wondering if you know

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.739
how likely law enforcement
is to actually act on that,

01:17:12.739 --> 01:17:14.530
and to protect the
victims who come forward

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:18.160
about it, because I know in
a lot of African countries,

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.130
there are laws against rape
and against domestic violence,

01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:24.955
but those who come forward
about it, law enforcement

01:17:24.955 --> 01:17:28.190
is super unlikely to
investigate it, let alone

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:29.225
lead to a prosecution.

01:17:29.225 --> 01:17:30.310
So I'm just wondering.

01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:32.180
- And maybe just
along with that,

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.710
because that was one of the
questions I was going ask too,

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:39.130
but that the tactic of going
through the legal changes,

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:41.740
is that because everything
else is so amorphous,

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.890
or is that just a notion that
law, it may not correlate,

01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:47.860
or it may not be
causal, initially?

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.290
Like, what's your
empirical basis

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:52.570
for taking that approach
versus some others, as it's

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.010
sort of all you have?

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:55.130
Yes.

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:58.210
- My name's Anita
Berenda, and I was really

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:02.410
struck by what you had to say
about second generation Muslims

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:04.267
transforming their
subjectivities,

01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:05.350
and becoming more visible.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:07.360
And it seemed like
you attributed that

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.450
to their success.

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.090
And as a second
generation Latina,

01:18:10.090 --> 01:18:13.590
I think about the universality
of that, and how here,

01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:16.520
I do see a certain
visibility among us too.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.330
But I have attributed it
not so much to our success,

01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.760
and maybe that is
the case, but also

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.560
to a reaching for identity.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.300
So my question is a
little bit abstract,

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.470
but I'm wondering the extent to
which you see that visibility

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:31.810
as even just a
reaching or struggling

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.880
with identity among
second generation Muslims.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.290
- Excellent.

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:37.452
Thank you.

01:18:37.452 --> 01:18:38.290
- Hello.

01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:39.580
I'm Rosaria Pisa.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.530
I'm the Director of
Gender Women's Studies

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:43.840
at the University
of Rhode Island.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.220
I want to thank
all the panelists

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:50.560
for a wonderful dialogue.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.220
The construct of multicultural
citizenship model

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.140
is very compelling in a
post-global, post-neoliberal

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:01.720
contemporary mass
migration context.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.370
How can multicultural
citizenship

01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:14.970
be achieved if the people who
embody cultures of opposition

01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:21.360
to dominant national
cultures, or culture,

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.410
are typically
disenfranchised as a result

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:31.990
of their denial of citizenship
rights and belonging?

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:33.960
So how can we
achieve such a model,

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.180
if the people most
affected are not

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:40.620
participating in
the process, as I

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.930
believe is the case in France?

01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:43.665
Thank you.

01:19:43.665 --> 01:19:46.960
- Thank you.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.460
OK.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:47.880
Great.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.380
OK.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:53.130
So we have six
minutes left to tackle

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:54.980
very broad important
questions, but maybe,

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:55.860
Sarah, do you want to start--

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:56.580
- Yeah.

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.620
I guess very quickly--

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.710
I'm sorry I won't give full
answers to the good questions.

01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:03.380
In terms of
activists and risk, I

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.590
mean, yes, definitely,
activists who

01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:10.410
are on the ground and
subject to the sovereignty

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:14.610
of repressive states are the
ones who face the most risk.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.670
Activists who have
nationalities from elsewhere

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:20.520
and can leave a
country face less risk.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.750
That's the reality.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.510
So Saudi activists,
who a decade ago

01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:28.110
tried to challenge the
driving ban by driving,

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:30.900
spent years in jail.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.050
Activists who were
demanding the right

01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.140
to marry whom they wanted,
even despite their guardian's

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:40.950
opposition, spent years in jail.

01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:43.710
In fact, there
were cases of women

01:20:43.710 --> 01:20:46.800
who were forcibly divorced
from husbands they had managed

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.130
to somehow secretly marry,
because their father didn't

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:52.390
approve, and they
spent years in jail.

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:56.040
So the reality is, not just
for women's rights activists,

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.340
but any activists in regressive
states and repressive states

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:04.920
like Saudi Arabia face
jail, if not worse,

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.710
and that's actually one
thing I did want to mention,

01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:10.600
and I would caution everyone
to be very alert to,

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.530
is the extent to which the
Saudi government is now--

01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:16.260
I want to appropriate the term
'pink washing' to also apply

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.190
to--

01:21:17.190 --> 01:21:19.260
pretending to be women's
rights reformers,

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:23.400
as a way to wash an otherwise
brutal repressive record

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.920
against your own citizens,
not to mention the slaughter

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.440
of Yemenis across the border.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.322
And that's why I was
trying to emphasize

01:21:30.322 --> 01:21:32.280
the extent to which the
reforms in Saudi Arabia

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:37.850
started well before the current
crown prince's administration,

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:40.530
and have been the product
of the toil of women

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.120
in Saudi Arabia over
many, many years.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.960
And finally, by the way,
none of the promised reforms

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.610
in Saudi Arabia,
specifically women

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:49.650
driving, which I hope
we'll see in June,

01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:52.440
but lifting of the guardianship,
at least parts of it

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.420
that the government has
promised-- none of that

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.710
has actually happened yet.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.140
So please don't give them
credit yet until they actually

01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:00.180
do what they promised

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.397
In terms of the
empowerment, and the videos,

01:22:02.397 --> 01:22:04.230
and so forth, I just
want to emphasize again

01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:06.330
that these videos are
a product of our work

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:09.960
with Saudi activists who played
a tremendous role in deciding

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.750
what the themes of the video
should be, how the women should

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.760
appear, the fact that
they were animated

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.560
videos, the dialect
in the videos,

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.790
the language of the videos.

01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:20.352
This was crafted by Saudi
women and activists.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.560
So this was not our creation
and that was pretty much

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.440
the point of my presentation.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.860
Enforcement of laws,
when people say,

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.650
what's wrong with the Middle
East, and I see corporations

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:33.780
like my former
employer, Goldman Sachs,

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.180
spending tons of money
on women's empowerment

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:39.030
to help women get jobs,
and fix their resumes,

01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:41.400
and so forth, that's
all great and good,

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.830
but you can only get so far
when the laws of the country

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:44.840
are against you.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.440
They are actually designed to
disempower you and to harm you,

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.890
and because states have actually
agreed to certain human rights

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:55.240
obligations, we have
something to actually pin them

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.090
on and hold them to.

01:22:57.090 --> 01:23:01.110
And while social and cultural
norms and changes, for example,

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:04.830
seeing a housemaid in my
house as an employee, and not

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:08.550
my slave, or my
semi-daughter-slave,

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:11.310
or my son-my child slave, which
are ways that they've often

01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:14.160
perceived, is a long cultural
project, and we undertake it.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.200
But the fixes that
can be immediate

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.590
are the changes in law that
say, every domestic worker

01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:21.840
has to have a day
off, or a woman

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.880
can get married to
whomever she wants

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.860
without anyone's permission.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.770
And so the problem is the laws.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.590
Whether the new laws are
enforced, that's the next step,

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.490
but first, let's actually get
rid of the laws that restrict,

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:38.550
and discriminate, and harm,
and destroy the lives of women

01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:39.505
in the region.

01:23:39.505 --> 01:23:41.010
- Great.

01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:43.135
And, I think, two
questions for you, Nilufer.

01:23:43.135 --> 01:23:43.635
- Yeah.

01:23:43.635 --> 01:23:46.830
Thank you for the
identity question.

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:47.840
That's very true.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.730
It's not only the success
which leads to that,

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:54.480
but the identity search
only can be possible

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.650
if these people already are
mastering the languages,

01:23:58.650 --> 01:24:00.630
the communication codes.

01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:02.730
They're already
integrated into the system

01:24:02.730 --> 01:24:05.220
because otherwise,
it's not possible just

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.330
to build up your identity.

01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:11.070
And identities in question
are always, not binary,

01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:15.430
but being hyphenated
identities, as we say,

01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:17.910
Latin-American or
Muslim-European.

01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:20.882
But this hyphen is
very complicated.

01:24:20.882 --> 01:24:21.840
That's what I'm saying.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.020
It's becoming more
and more complicated

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.880
in the actual
political situation.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.910
Now that is related
with the second question

01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:30.140
I would like to go.

01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.330
It is not the
multicultural citizenship

01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:37.580
as a project that
really influences

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.670
the political cultures of
the western democracies.

01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:44.390
On the contrary, we
shifted everywhere

01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:46.050
from the celebration
of minorities,

01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:50.000
of hyphenated
identities, to a kind

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.700
of culture of majority making.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.130
And we were speaking
about cultural relativism,

01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:58.010
multiculturalism,
sometimes in critique

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.180
of cultural relativism.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.240
Today, we speak of the
hierarchical values,

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.450
so assimilation to an
American way of life,

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:09.560
but the same even in very
liberal Great Britain,

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.850
and the same in France.

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:14.720
So identity issue is becoming
more and more, unfortunately,

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.880
not the minorities,
but the majority

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.630
making kind of instruments.

01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:25.670
So when French started to
discuss who are we as French,

01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:28.470
I started to be scared.

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:30.030
And this is the kind of thing.

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:31.760
And now we see,
although in France they

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.070
didn't move into that
illiberal democracy.

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:38.630
But in many places of Europe,
we see how illiberal democracies

01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:42.830
are growing, and I just
wanted to turn the gaze to us,

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:49.340
and not to have always this
certitude, this, the certainty,

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:50.870
in relation to women's rights.

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:52.550
When we speak about
the Middle East,

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:57.170
we always know what to do, but
when we look at the free women,

01:25:57.170 --> 01:25:59.300
and living in
Europe, and there it

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.010
becomes much more
problematic when

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:02.520
we turn the gaze to ourselves.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:05.060
So that's also what
I wanted to question.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:08.030
And in the case of maybe
international organizations,

01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.850
we need also
vernacular languages,

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:14.660
rather than having one language
spreading from the west

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:16.530
to the other parts of the world.

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:20.030
I think it's inevitable,
maybe, but even LGBTI.

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:25.891
Even knowing how to pronounce
it gives you some kind of power.

01:26:25.891 --> 01:26:26.390
OK.

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.890
Thank you.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.440
- Thank you so much.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.910
This was fantastic.

01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:31.440
Thank you both.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.940
I do think end on
a more upbeat note.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.350
No more than we can
look simply to women,

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:43.970
whether in our democracies
or around the world,

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.920
to promote women's
rights, there's

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.080
a big part of the equation
lies, of course, in the hands

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.060
and the will of men.

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:57.540
So too, I think, on the question
of multicultural citizenship,

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:02.420
it would be unfair
and unwise to rely

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.320
on the multiplicity of
cultures, and those people who

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.640
are being denied or
subjected to injustice

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.650
to look out for their
rights on their own.

01:27:12.650 --> 01:27:15.080
And fundamentally, I think
that's the point you just made.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.320
It's going to be incumbent on
the majority, and on people,

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.670
again, who don't face the
same struggle to bring

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:27.170
the kind of solidarity that true
citizenship, I think, entails.

01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:28.580
So thank you all.

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:31.130
It's a pleasure,
and I urge everybody

01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:33.220
to come to this
unbelievable keynote

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:35.000
reading and
conversation where we

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.510
have two of my favorite
writers on planet Earth,

01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:41.570
here at 2:00 PM, and then
the panel in the afternoon,

01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:44.256
The Gendered Politics
Of New Nationalism.

01:27:44.256 --> 01:27:45.880
So great afternoon
ahead for Radcliffe.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.730
Thank you.
