We can already tell that the function graphed here behaves in an interesting

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:08.277
way. It's always increasing, but the curve gets steeper the further to the

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:13.955
right we move. What kind of curve is this, though? Well, to see that, we need

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:17.528
to zoom out a bit. Here's what the graph would look like if we got rid of the

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:22.780
domain restrictions from the story. What kind of function do you think this is?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.615
Here are your choices. Constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, piecewise, absolute

00:00:28.615 --> 00:00:32.880
value, square root, or something else?
