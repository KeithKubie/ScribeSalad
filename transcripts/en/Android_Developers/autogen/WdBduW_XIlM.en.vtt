all right so you know as we saw from
Daniel you know thinking about how you

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:04.250
Daniel you know thinking about how you
 

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.710
Daniel you know thinking about how you
can optimize your game on this new form

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720
can optimize your game on this new form
 

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.290
can optimize your game on this new form
factor is really a huge benefit and

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:08.300
factor is really a huge benefit and
 

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.120
factor is really a huge benefit and
there's a lot of possibility there so

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.130
there's a lot of possibility there so
 

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.810
there's a lot of possibility there so
we're gonna go over some of the

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:10.820
we're gonna go over some of the
 

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.870
we're gonna go over some of the
technical aspects you should consider

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880
technical aspects you should consider
 

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.890
technical aspects you should consider
when optimizing your game for

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:14.900
when optimizing your game for
 

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.080
when optimizing your game for
Chromebooks so first off it's the real

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.090
Chromebooks so first off it's the real
 

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.160
Chromebooks so first off it's the real
Android so it is Android running side by

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:21.170
Android so it is Android running side by
 

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.780
Android so it is Android running side by
side with Chrome OS and Chromebooks so

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:22.790
side with Chrome OS and Chromebooks so
 

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.270
side with Chrome OS and Chromebooks so
you've got access to all the things you

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:25.280
you've got access to all the things you
 

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.690
you've got access to all the things you
would expect in Android and as Dan

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:28.700
would expect in Android and as Dan
 

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.100
would expect in Android and as Dan
mentioned you know the first step is

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.110
mentioned you know the first step is
 

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.930
mentioned you know the first step is
kind of already done for you so if your

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:31.940
kind of already done for you so if your
 

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.610
kind of already done for you so if your
app is published on the place so right

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:33.620
app is published on the place so right
 

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.290
app is published on the place so right
now it's already running on Chromebooks

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:35.300
now it's already running on Chromebooks
 

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.690
now it's already running on Chromebooks
that might freak some of you out but

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:37.700
that might freak some of you out but
 

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.840
that might freak some of you out but
don't worry you know I would say you're

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:40.850
don't worry you know I would say you're
 

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.170
don't worry you know I would say you're
probably 80 to 90% of the way there

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.180
probably 80 to 90% of the way there
 

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.340
probably 80 to 90% of the way there
you're using the same apk for both

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.350
you're using the same apk for both
 

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.570
you're using the same apk for both
mobile devices and Chromebooks so let's

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:49.580
mobile devices and Chromebooks so let's
 

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.430
mobile devices and Chromebooks so let's
go over some common issues some best

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440
go over some common issues some best
 

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.680
go over some common issues some best
practices and some of the testing and

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:53.690
practices and some of the testing and
 

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.160
practices and some of the testing and
tools that you have available when

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.170
tools that you have available when
 

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.850
tools that you have available when
optimizing for Chrome OS so the first

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:00.860
optimizing for Chrome OS so the first
 

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.670
optimizing for Chrome OS so the first
thing we're going to talk about is

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680
thing we're going to talk about is
 

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.020
thing we're going to talk about is
target SDK version and six four bit

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.030
target SDK version and six four bit
 

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.260
target SDK version and six four bit
supports so this Chrome OS is currently

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.270
supports so this Chrome OS is currently
 

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.410
supports so this Chrome OS is currently
running Android and P is coming later

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.420
running Android and P is coming later
 

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.120
running Android and P is coming later
this summer which is awesome because

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.130
this summer which is awesome because
 

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.250
this summer which is awesome because
there's some cool mouse capture api's we

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:15.260
there's some cool mouse capture api's we
 

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.110
there's some cool mouse capture api's we
have there but you have to target at

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120
have there but you have to target at
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.560
have there but you have to target at
least API level 24 yeah in order to get

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:20.570
least API level 24 yeah in order to get
 

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.520
least API level 24 yeah in order to get
all the preform resizing functionality

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.530
all the preform resizing functionality
 

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.860
all the preform resizing functionality
in your game if you don't do that your

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:26.870
in your game if you don't do that your
 

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.390
in your game if you don't do that your
game will restart whenever you get a

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:28.400
game will restart whenever you get a
 

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.830
game will restart whenever you get a
configuration change so it's important

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:29.840
configuration change so it's important
 

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.410
configuration change so it's important
to target at least 24 but as mentioned

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:32.420
to target at least 24 but as mentioned
 

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.420
to target at least 24 but as mentioned
earlier this fall we're going to require

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:34.430
earlier this fall we're going to require
 

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.330
earlier this fall we're going to require
you to target Android Oh so it's good

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:37.340
you to target Android Oh so it's good
 

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.740
you to target Android Oh so it's good
idea to start working on this now rather

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:38.750
idea to start working on this now rather
 

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.440
idea to start working on this now rather
than later your minimum API level

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.450
than later your minimum API level
 

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.180
than later your minimum API level
doesn't need to change and some things

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.190
doesn't need to change and some things
 

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.980
doesn't need to change and some things
you might run into our permission

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:44.990
you might run into our permission
 

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.650
you might run into our permission
updates we've talked about earlier and

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.660
updates we've talked about earlier and
 

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.900
updates we've talked about earlier and
some background execution changes as

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:49.910
some background execution changes as
 

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.940
some background execution changes as
well so first thing you should you start

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:51.950
well so first thing you should you start
 

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.120
well so first thing you should you start
looking at your target SDK version so

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.130
looking at your target SDK version so
 

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.700
looking at your target SDK version so
some features and sensors are actually

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:57.710
some features and sensors are actually
 

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.980
some features and sensors are actually
incompatible with Chromebooks so if

00:16:59.980 --> 00:16:59.990
incompatible with Chromebooks so if
 

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.940
incompatible with Chromebooks so if
you're for example if your game is

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:03.950
you're for example if your game is
 

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.840
you're for example if your game is
asking for using GPS or NFC or stuff

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:07.850
asking for using GPS or NFC or stuff
 

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.939
asking for using GPS or NFC or stuff
like that those are not supported on

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:09.949

so it's gonna show up as not compatible

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:12.390
so it's gonna show up as not compatible
 

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.480
so it's gonna show up as not compatible
with your device on the Playstore so you

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.490
with your device on the Playstore so you
 

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.910
with your device on the Playstore so you
want to make sure that you remove those

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:16.920
want to make sure that you remove those
 

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.470

if you do that however just make sure to

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.030
if you do that however just make sure to
 

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.940
if you do that however just make sure to
dynamically check in your code these

that's never fun and some permissions
also implied feature requirements so if

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.060
also implied feature requirements so if
 

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.940
also implied feature requirements so if
your it's kind of a small list it's on

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:40.950

target is greater than 24 so in a lot of
 

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.570
target is greater than 24 so in a lot of
cases this can call cause flickering or

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580
cases this can call cause flickering or
 

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.190

texture stretching and especially with a
 

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.480
texture stretching and especially with a
lot of game engines you know it doesn't

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.490
lot of game engines you know it doesn't
 

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.890
lot of game engines you know it doesn't
handle it very well because in the

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:24.900
handle it very well because in the
 

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.930
handle it very well because in the
gaming world you know PC we kind of

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940
gaming world you know PC we kind of
 

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.060
gaming world you know PC we kind of
expect things to be at a set resolution

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:29.070
expect things to be at a set resolution
 

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.700

and ass lock aspect ratio so what we

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:31.710
and ass lock aspect ratio so what we
 

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.170
and ass lock aspect ratio so what we
kind of recommend is that if you can't

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:33.180
kind of recommend is that if you can't
 

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.060
kind of recommend is that if you can't
support dynamic resizing which we

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.070
support dynamic resizing which we
 

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.800
support dynamic resizing which we
encourage you to take a look at you can

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.290
on the route activity so I've seen some
 

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.200
on the route activity so I've seen some
cases where if you happen to use a

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.210
cases where if you happen to use a
 

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.450

different launch mode or something it
 

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.190
different launch mode or something it
will ignore this setting so you have to

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200
will ignore this setting so you have to
 

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.810
will ignore this setting so you have to
make sure that that is set on your route

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:56.820
make sure that that is set on your route
 

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.800

activity another thing to take into

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:00.810
activity another thing to take into
 

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.300
activity another thing to take into
account is that Chromebooks are

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.310
account is that Chromebooks are
 

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.710
account is that Chromebooks are
convertibles you know you can put them

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720
convertibles you know you can put them
 

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.220

upside-down apps are bad so how do we

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600
upside-down apps are bad so how do we
 

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.450
upside-down apps are bad so how do we
prevent this so basically what you want

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460
prevent this so basically what you want
 

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.660
prevent this so basically what you want
to do is if you are checking in your

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.670
to do is if you are checking in your
 

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:22.130
to do is if you are checking in your
code for and determining the orientation

based on that you want

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:24.029
based on that you want
 

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:25.310
based on that you want
sure that you're using display get

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320
sure that you're using display get
 

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.820
sure that you're using display get
rotation and you're taking account that

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:27.830
rotation and you're taking account that
 

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.019
rotation and you're taking account that
portrait mode might not always be in

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:30.029
portrait mode might not always be in
 

00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:32.479
portrait mode might not always be in
rotation zero so you want to swap your

00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:32.489
rotation zero so you want to swap your
 

00:19:32.489 --> 00:19:34.249
rotation zero so you want to swap your
axis accordingly if you are doing this

however easiest way to get to handle

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:42.869
however easiest way to get to handle
 

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:44.330
however easiest way to get to handle
this is to just specify a sensor

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340
this is to just specify a sensor
 

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.940
this is to just specify a sensor
orientations in your manifest so you can

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:46.950
orientations in your manifest so you can
 

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.159
orientations in your manifest so you can
specify portrait or landscape and then

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:49.169
specify portrait or landscape and then
 

00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:50.450
specify portrait or landscape and then
if you do that just make sure that you

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460
if you do that just make sure that you
 

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.430
if you do that just make sure that you
don't specify one thing in the manifest

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440
don't specify one thing in the manifest
 

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.869
don't specify one thing in the manifest
and then try to do something different

00:19:53.869 --> 00:19:53.879
and then try to do something different
 

00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:56.389
and then try to do something different
in the code later on you'll make chrome

00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:56.399
in the code later on you'll make chrome
 

00:19:56.399 --> 00:20:00.499
in the code later on you'll make chrome
OS go crazy another thing to take into

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:00.509
OS go crazy another thing to take into
 

00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:02.389
OS go crazy another thing to take into
account is that if you have a portrait

00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:02.399
account is that if you have a portrait
 

00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:04.820
account is that if you have a portrait
mode game and you play it in a

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:04.830
mode game and you play it in a
 

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.369
mode game and you play it in a
full-screen landscape setting you might

00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:07.379
full-screen landscape setting you might
 

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:09.049
full-screen landscape setting you might
want to add some flowers or other cool

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059
want to add some flowers or other cool
 

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:10.609
want to add some flowers or other cool
stuff on the sides there to prevent the

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:10.619
stuff on the sides there to prevent the
 

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:13.999
stuff on the sides there to prevent the
ugly black bars so it's just something

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:14.009
ugly black bars so it's just something
 

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:16.389
ugly black bars so it's just something
to think about

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:16.399
 
 

00:20:16.399 --> 00:20:19.190
 
so another thing that's on Chrome OS is

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200
so another thing that's on Chrome OS is
 

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.310
so another thing that's on Chrome OS is
input compatibility mode so what this

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320
input compatibility mode so what this
 

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.879
input compatibility mode so what this
aims to do is it basically tries to just

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:25.889
aims to do is it basically tries to just
 

00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:26.959
aims to do is it basically tries to just
make touch-based

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:26.969
make touch-based
 

00:20:26.969 --> 00:20:30.200
make touch-based
games and apps just work which makes

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.210
games and apps just work which makes
 

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:31.579
games and apps just work which makes
sense because most of the gaps and games

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:31.589
sense because most of the gaps and games
 

00:20:31.589 --> 00:20:33.320
sense because most of the gaps and games

devices only expect touch inputs so it

00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:37.619
devices only expect touch inputs so it
 

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:39.259
devices only expect touch inputs so it
basically translates Mouse and trackpad

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:39.269
basically translates Mouse and trackpad
 

00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:41.299
basically translates Mouse and trackpad
events to touch events under the hood

00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:41.309
events to touch events under the hood
 

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:44.119
events to touch events under the hood
this might not be the best if you're

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:44.129
this might not be the best if you're
 

00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:46.249
this might not be the best if you're
trying to actually you know optimize

00:20:46.249 --> 00:20:46.259
trying to actually you know optimize
 

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:47.749
trying to actually you know optimize
your game and take advantage of Mouse

00:20:47.749 --> 00:20:47.759
your game and take advantage of Mouse
 

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:49.820
your game and take advantage of Mouse
and trackpad events so what you can do

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:49.830
and trackpad events so what you can do
 

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.440
and trackpad events so what you can do
is you can tell Andrew or you can tell

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:51.450
is you can tell Andrew or you can tell
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.599
is you can tell Andrew or you can tell
Chrome OS you're targeting PC type

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:53.609

Hardware by specifying the following on

00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919
Hardware by specifying the following on
 

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.829
Hardware by specifying the following on
in your manifest and then you can check

00:20:57.829 --> 00:20:57.839
in your manifest and then you can check
 

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:00.469
in your manifest and then you can check
the source of your motion events to

00:21:00.469 --> 00:21:00.479
the source of your motion events to
 

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:01.999
the source of your motion events to
actually determine where this is coming

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:02.009
actually determine where this is coming
 

00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:04.070
actually determine where this is coming
from so once you do that you can do

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080
from so once you do that you can do
 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.859
from so once you do that you can do
things like listen for Mouse you know

00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:05.869
things like listen for Mouse you know
 

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:08.719
things like listen for Mouse you know
hovering scrolling stuff like that all

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:08.729

00:21:08.729 --> 00:21:10.310
hovering scrolling stuff like that all
these nice things that users would

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320
these nice things that users would
 

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.690
these nice things that users would
expect when playing with the mouse so a

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700
expect when playing with the mouse so a
 

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.619
expect when playing with the mouse so a
really good example of this is minecraft

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:18.629
really good example of this is minecraft
 

00:21:18.629 --> 00:21:21.769

each X to see if the user is playing
 

00:21:23.999 --> 00:21:25.339
each X to see if the user is playing
with the keyboard and mouse and if they

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:25.349
with the keyboard and mouse and if they
 

00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:28.789
with the keyboard and mouse and if they
are they change the input mode to

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799
are they change the input mode to
 

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.759
are they change the input mode to
basically support from their touch touch

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:31.769
basically support from their touch touch
 

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:34.849
basically support from their touch touch
based control scheme to their desktop PC

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:34.859
based control scheme to their desktop PC
 

00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:37.370
based control scheme to their desktop PC
and mouse to type control scheme so

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380
and mouse to type control scheme so
 

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.870
and mouse to type control scheme so
it really works really well and it's

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880
it really works really well and it's
 

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.220
it really works really well and it's
seamlessly and so if you're looking for

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:40.230
seamlessly and so if you're looking for
 

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.600
seamlessly and so if you're looking for
a great example I recommend that you

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:41.610
a great example I recommend that you
 

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:45.830
a great example I recommend that you
check that out so let's talk about some

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840
check that out so let's talk about some

Chromebooks
 

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.980
Chromebooks
so not all Chromebooks are going to

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:51.990
so not all Chromebooks are going to
 

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.300
so not all Chromebooks are going to
support touch or I even have

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:53.310
support touch or I even have
 

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.490
support touch or I even have
touchscreens a lot on the new right now

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500
touchscreens a lot on the new right now
 

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.780
touchscreens a lot on the new right now
but it's not something you should rely

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:56.790
but it's not something you should rely
 

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.060
but it's not something you should rely
on in the future so you should make sure

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.070
on in the future so you should make sure
 

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.580
on in the future so you should make sure
that you specify that you don't require

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:01.590
that you specify that you don't require
 

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.630
that you specify that you don't require

one of the biggest best practices we can
 

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.000
one of the biggest best practices we can
suggest it's a support mouse and
