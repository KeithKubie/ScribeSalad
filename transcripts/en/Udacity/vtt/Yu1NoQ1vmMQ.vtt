00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.170
Now that we've finished
building the UI for our app,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.080
it's time to think about
how it should operate

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.060
when it's not in the foreground.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.612
One of the most powerful
features of Android,

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:11.633
is the ability for any app
to run in the background.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.456
But with great power
comes great responsibility.

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:18.190
So you need to be very conscious
of how it's consuming resources.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.613
In this lesson, you'll learn more about
how the Android framework

00:00:21.613 --> 00:00:23.172
manages background apps.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:25.011
And you'll be introduced
to the service class

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:26.440
to help make that happen.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.920
You'll also learn techniques
for efficient data transfers

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.290
using sync adapters
and Google Cloud messaging.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.550
And be introduced to the 
notification framework

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.230
to send messages to your users 
when your app isn't in the foreground.
