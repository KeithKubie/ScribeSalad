[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:08.802
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.610
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Thank you.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.460
SPEAKER 2: So it's been a few
years since we had you in,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.120
and the last time
you were here you

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.880
were speaking about
"NOPI: The Cookbook."

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.850
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.900
SPEAKER 2: And it seems
like quite a change

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.230
or a shift in terms of
a restaurant cookbook

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.037
to this being--

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:29.245
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: This, yeah.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:30.360
SPEAKER 2: --a home cookbook.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.620
Tell us a little
bit about the shift.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.300
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It's like
the two ends of the spectrum

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.300
of Ottolenghi cookbooks.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.140
So on the one hand you have
"NOPI," and on the other hand,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.890
you have "Simple."

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.270
And it's a little bit the
story of my personal journey.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.705
So the books really
don't come in any--

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:48.360
they're a bit random
in the way they

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.040
come out, because they are--

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.490
the reasons why a certain book
comes out at a certain time

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.430
has a lot to do with
the people that I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.140
collaborate with on the books
and what we feel like doing.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
And with "NOPI" that
was out two years ago,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.970
it was Scully, who's
the head chef there, was

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.900
really eager to put
all that creative stuff

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.140
that has gone into the making
of that restaurant into a book.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.102
And we were starting
writing down recipes.

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:19.560
And I said to the
publishers, look,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.020
we've got to do this now,
because this is happening.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.390
And so that came out.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.680
And then "Simple,"
which is, like I said,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.060
the other end of the spectrum,
which is really geared towards

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.750
home cooks and also a much more
comfortable way of cooking with

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.300
ease and simplicity-- and
we can talk more about that

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.130
in a minute--

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.747
came about after I've had
a couple of supplements

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:46.580
with "The Guardian."

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.140
So "The Guardian" called me.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.300
I publish recipes in "The
Guardian" every weekend,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.240
but a few years ago my
editor called me and said,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.870
I'd like 20 easy recipes for
the spring for a supplement.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.640
And I went like,
I don't do simple.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.180
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520
And I don't do easy either.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.170
Because it just seems
so weird to even

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.729
start thinking like that.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.850
Because I've never
had to convince anyone

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.140
that it's not worth your
while spending all this time

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.540
in the kitchen to get something
as good as what I thought

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.380
I put there.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.300
But I said, OK,
we'll think about it.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.500
And I sat down with
my two collaborators

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.770
on the book, Tara
and Esme, who have

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
been part of this process
for quite a while.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.290
And we just started
talking about what

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.440
might be our 20 simple or
easy recipes for the spring.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.990
There were also
ingredient-- number

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.420
of ingredients was
limited, et cetera.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.930
And we just had so much fun.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.940
So we all brought our
little tricks from home--

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.620
things from cans and frozen.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.930
And Esme, who has been cooking
for many years on boats--

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.360
she was cooking on yachts
for about 10 years,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.169
she had all these
nifty tricks about--

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.710
obviously, you can't spend a
lot of time and everything needs

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.970
to be very solid,
and well-grounded,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.480
as you can imagine, on boats--

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.760
had her set of
ideas on what to do.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.680
And within 20 minutes, we had
20 ideas but really cool things

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.460
that we were very proud
of doing, and it was fun.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.350
And sometimes, I'm sure
it's applicable to almost

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.440
every field of human
creation, when you've

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.980
got this set of
limitations, it actually

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.310
makes you more creative.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.000
So it was like, OK, we need
to make it simple in some way.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.550
And that's how the
supplements came about,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.280
and that's how the book
came about as a result

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.270
of those "Guardian" supplements.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.610
But the other
thing that had also

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.560
happened that led to
this book, or the way

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.070
the book has shaped
up to be this thing,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.040
was that last year another
cookery writer, Diana Henry,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.090
came up with a book
called "Simple."

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.510
And I saw that,
and I go, oh, gosh.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.010
No.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.760
What do we do now?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.325
Because she's just
stolen my title.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:09.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.710
And it happened to us already
before, really weirdly

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.269
and bizarrely, when
"Plenty" came out, which

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.880
is six years ago, I think, now.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.350
I published that book and
I got a really angry--

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.720
not really angry but frustrated
email from her, saying,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.430
"My next book was
going to be 'Plenty--'"

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.980
--which is-- it's funny.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.530
So she had to find a
derivative title with the word

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.840
"plenty" in it, and now I
call this book "Ottolenghi

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.460
Simple" rather than "Simple."

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.020
And I was really
happy to do that,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.270
because what it made us think
is we sat down and thought,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.260
what makes "Ottolenghi
Simple" simple?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.865
So obviously we had
to complicate things.

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:52.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:52.365 --> 00:04:54.030
And so we said--

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.260
SPEAKER 2: So tell us about
the philosophy behind "Simple."

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.593
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah, so
I'll tell you about the extra

00:04:57.593 --> 00:04:59.880
complication that we added
to the simple notion,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.180
and that's the coding
system with the S-I-M-P-L-E.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.640
And essentially what we tried
to do is we started talking

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.470
to people around
us and asked them,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.960
what is simple cooking for you?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.379
And we got really
different answers.

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:16.920
So some would say,
oh, you know, it's

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.150
about coming home and putting
a dish on the table within 20

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.150
minutes or half an hour.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.670
And some other people said,
I don't want to go shopping.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.100
I just want to cook it
from things that I really

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.710
have lurking around-- a packet
of rice, a couple of lemons,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.670
and some garlic, things that
you make from what you've got.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.800
Others said, I really
want to cook everything

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.244
in advance, so either
for weekend cooking,

00:05:42.244 --> 00:05:44.160
or for weekday cooking
or for weekend cooking.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.993
I just want to make
sure everything is ready

00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:50.340
and then I just put it
out or put it together

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.370
at the very last minute.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.100
So there were very
different notions

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.280
of what simple cooking is.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.410
And, hence, the S-I-M-P-L-E,
and each one is a different

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.740
category of recipes in the book.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.160
S stands for short--

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.114
short on time, so anything that
would take 20 minutes, half

00:06:12.114 --> 00:06:12.780
an hour to cook.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.570
The I stands for ingredients--

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.650
10 or less, which, in
my world, 10 or less

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.940
is really the bare minimum.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.940
This is not Jamie
Oliver's "5 Ingredients."

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.481
The M stands for make ahead.

00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:30.980
SPEAKER 2: Make
ahead of time, yeah.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.440
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: The P stands
for pantry, so we cover that--

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.720
rice, pasta, couscous,
everything that is frozen--

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.047
frozen peas, frozen
corn and things.

00:06:44.047 --> 00:06:45.630
It sounds terrible,
but actually those

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.020
are some of my favorite
dishes in the book.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.220
The L stands for lazy,
and lazy is those--

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.130
and it's not you being lazy.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.320
It's just the attitude of
being lazy when you want to be.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.490
And those are recipes that cook
themselves-- stews and roasts.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.640
And so you put it there.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.450
You go read a book.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.820
You come back and
you've got a meal.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.880
And the E is an extra
category that we

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.140
added which is called
"Easier Than you Think."

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.580
And that is more about a state
of mind than anything else.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.420
So for me, one of
the reasons why

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.250
people are a little
bit intimidated

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.680
by certain ways of
cooking is because they've

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.320
gotten into their heads that
they can't cook this thing,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.210
or they're not bakers, or they--

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.670
those notions.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:35.840
And cooking, like many other
things, is 90% psychology.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.710
And the E is like an ice cream.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.300
You never thought you were going
to make ice cream if you don't

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.820
have an ice cream maker
sitting on-- churn ice cream,

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.210
or it's a quick bread that
you can do even if you're not

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.230
a baker, or certain desserts.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.420
It's also things that have
like a complicated French name,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.107
like a confit or
something like that.

00:07:53.107 --> 00:07:54.690
You think that's
just for restaurants,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.606
but that's not for me.

00:07:55.606 --> 00:07:57.100
But actually it could be.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.970
So yeah, that's the system.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.570
So every recipe in the book
would have at least one

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.290
of those marks but
could have more of them.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.540
Some recipes are
all six of them.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.870
SPEAKER 2: So if I
wanted to make something

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.349
in under 30 minutes, I
would look for everything

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:16.140
with the S symbol--

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.130
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: With
the S on it, yeah.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:17.400
SPEAKER 2: --and attempt.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.820
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.470
So that would be--
that's the way.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:24.820
It's really about-- and so
we were talking just now.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.450
I'm doing a podcast
at the moment

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.890
called "Simple Pleasures."

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.130
And the podcast came
about from the same series

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.289
of conversations that we were
having about simple cooking.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.429
And I wanted to just
expand that a little bit

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.734
into other conversations with
people that either they're

00:08:41.734 --> 00:08:43.150
from food or they're
not from food

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.960
but can say
something about, what

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.760
does it mean to cook or live
simply, or with more ease?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.930
And so I expanded
this from kitchens

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.010
to other areas of life.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.760
And I've got people coming on
the podcast and talking to me

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.610
about what they do--
what makes them at ease,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.470
or what other
aspects of their life

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.530
apart from what
they're famous for.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.110
They've pared down or
loosened up a little bit.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.860
And I think it's just
really refreshing

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.050
sometimes to talk about this.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.040
Because for me, I meet a lot
of cooks, and many of them

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.770
talked about anxiety
when it comes to food.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.310
And for me, the idea of
mixing cooking with anxiety

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.160
is really counterintuitive,
because cooking

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.740
should be the one thing
that de-stresses, right?

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.250
That's why I got into the
kitchen-- to de-stress.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.235
And I think this should
be the whole story.

00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:39.360
There shouldn't be anything
beyond the de-stressing

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.290
in the kitchen.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.600
But because cooking is
also used to impress,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.320
and people put a lot of pressure
on themselves to impress,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.290
often it's about reinventing
yourself every time

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.660
you walk into the kitchen,
and that is really stressful.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.700
I couldn't do it, to create
a meal from a cuisine

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.800
that you haven't even tasted.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.410
And you want to
do that sometimes,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.800
but essentially, it really
isn't the way forward.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.290
The way forward, if you want
to use the kitchen and a tool

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:13.060
to inject some more
ease, as I said,

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:21.144
or simplicity, or a sense
of, yeah, simplicity,

00:10:21.144 --> 00:10:22.810
then you actually
want to cook something

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.518
that you have cooked
before, or something

00:10:24.518 --> 00:10:26.290
that is very familiar,
or something that

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.800
is just a second nature to you.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.560
Nigella, who was on my
podcast, called it competence.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.810
And she says
competence doesn't seem

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.312
like a-- it's not a sexy word.

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:41.270
Although when she says
it, of course it's sexy.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.690
But it's not a sexy word.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.760
But it means that you just do
something over and over again

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.600
and become really good at it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.410
And then you get
over all those issues

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.720
that stand in the way of putting
a good meal on the table.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.000
And I think I personally
prefer to go to someone's house

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.360
knowing that I might have
something at that friend's

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.210
house that I've had before,
but it's really good, right?

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.385
I don't care that I've
had it maybe last year.

00:11:10.385 --> 00:11:11.260
It's absolutely fine.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.410
SPEAKER 2: But I certainly
suffer from that anxiety

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.490
where I don't cook that much.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.209
So it's a matter
of-- you're right.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:19.000
I need to practice.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.220
How many times do
you think I'd need

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.992
to cook a dish 'til I put my
own twist to yours, for example?

00:11:25.992 --> 00:11:26.950
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.490
So essentially, it depends
on what you choose to cook.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.880
So for instance,
I've got two recipes

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.970
in the book for baked rice.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.010
Baked rice is a really
cool way to cook rice.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.370
You know many people
don't have a rice cooker

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.290
and haven't come from
an Asian culture are

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.430
a little bit intimidated by
cooking rice, because it's

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.050
quite easy to overcook or
to not have enough liquid.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.810
So you don't want your
rice to be al dente.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.520
So baked rice is
a really good way.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.590
You throw a lot of things in a
roasting tray or baking tray,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.810
and you seal it with foil
and stick it in the oven,

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.580
and you can leave it there
for longer than you think.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.990
It isn't strictly
necessary and it

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.920
won't really spoil or anything.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.667
And it's really a good
way to infuse rice

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.000
with lots of flavor, because
you've got a lot of surface

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.190
there, so you can put--

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.310
I add mint leaves, or
cinnamon, or garlic,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.500
and it just spreads
through the rice.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.750
Essentially, the
cooking liquids turn

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.290
into really aromatic, beautiful
aromatic stock that just

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.880
makes the rice so delicious.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.160
And then what you choose
to do with that rice

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.036
is really up to you.

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.410
So once you've
mastered this kind

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.730
of very simple technique of
cooking rice by baking it,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.240
you--

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.480
SPEAKER 2: I add my own--

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.970
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It's
easy to improvise.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:47.650
There is one recipe
here for rice

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.560
that I just cook all
the time at the moment.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.530
It's the one with the tomatoes,
that actually the version

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.450
of which is served today here.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.360
But I don't know if they
followed it strictly.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.746
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:03.580
But essentially-- because
when you cook for a big crowd,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.760
you don't really do that.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.789
But you take cherry
tomatoes and garlic cloves

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.330
and some shallots,
and you throw them

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.170
in with cinnamon and olive oil,
and you put it in the oven.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.711
That's one of the lazy
recipes, because you just

00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:19.210
leave it there for 20 minutes
and then those vegetables just

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.800
cook and flavor the oil.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.090
And then you throw a packet
of rice in and some water

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.200
and you put foil and let
it do its thing again

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.670
for another 25 minutes.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.340
So it takes time but
essentially very little effort.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.557
And you get a whole beautiful,
fragrant meal for rice.

00:13:35.557 --> 00:13:36.640
It's got everything there.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.670
It's got the vegetables.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.620
It's got the rice.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.930
You can add something else,
but it's super delicious.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.630
And I do it every
weekend because I

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.310
know people love it and
it is very, very easy.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:50.560
I can go and play with the kids
while this is doing its thing.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.310
SPEAKER 2: I wanted us to talk
a little bit about the pantry.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:54.268
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:57.310
SPEAKER 2: The P. Your
pantry is likely to be

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.450
very different from mine.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.408
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:00.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.730
SPEAKER 2: So--

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.438
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Most
people's, I guess.

00:14:02.438 --> 00:14:03.881
Yeah.

00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:06.320
SPEAKER 2: What's the
philosophy behind the pantry?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.520
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: So the pantry
is-- at the back of the book,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.470
we listed a list.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.170
There's a list of
about 10 ingred--

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.340
not about, exactly 10
ingredients-- that are--

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.507
this is the contract you
sign when you buy the book.

00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:22.131
You've got to get
these 10 ingredients.

00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:22.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.690
And believe me, narrowing
it down to 10 from 100

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.660
was quite hard.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.300
But actually, the
idea is often people--

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.550
the number one complaint at the
bottom of my "Guardian" column

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.540
comments, which I don't
look at but people tell me--

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.000
--is those ingredients.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.550
My god, where do you
get the ingredients?

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.992
So I address this in this
book as well by saying, OK,

00:14:49.992 --> 00:14:50.950
there's 10 ingredients.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.949
That's not a lot to buy.

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.380
It's not even expensive.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.020
You buy them and they take you
quite a long way in the book,

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.710
so they will reappear
in different recipes.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.580
So some of them would
be familiar to people

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.930
who have been cooking my
recipes, like sumac and za'atar

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.510
that you mentioned,
preserved lemon.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.070
There's also black
garlic, which is

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.500
a slightly more recent edition.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.347
Tahini, of course, but it
has to be a good tahini.

00:15:11.347 --> 00:15:11.930
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.960
Well, so what's good tahini?

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.710
What gets the Ottolenghi
tick of approval?

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.260
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
Good tahini is--

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.700
well, I always get into
trouble because there's

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.550
a bit of a chauvinism about
my appreciation of tahini

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.300
that comes from my
part of the Middle East

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.060
rather than other
parts of the world.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.410
So I would say here now, and all
the Greeks and Cypriots, close

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:32.910
your ears.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.750
Greek tahini is not good.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.580
It's grainy and it's not--

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.310
SPEAKER 2: I see a
future where Greek tahini

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.210
sales are plummeting.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:45.550
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: No.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.250
The thing is there
is a brand that you

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.380
find in many supermarkets
called Cypressa.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.960
And it's just not-- sorry.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.400
I don't want to get anyone--

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.150
I should probably shut
my mouth now, but--

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.980
SPEAKER 2: Well, what's good?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.240
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Maybe--

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.180
SPEAKER 2: Let's
shift to what's good.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.596
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
Yeah, maybe it's

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:03.620
the tahini from Lebanon or
Palestinian or Israeli tahinis.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.710
They're just better.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.780
The sesame seeds are
toasted properly,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.280
so it's nice and
brown and luscious.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.250
And also there's no grain
in it, so all the husks

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:15.540
are properly removed, so
it's really, really smooth.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.290
And for me, the sesame
being really good

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.780
and tahini being really smooth
are what makes a good tahini

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.660
a really good tahini.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.650
And once you've tried a proper
one or a really good tahini,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.377
you realize how good it is.

00:16:30.377 --> 00:16:31.460
It's a bit like olive oil.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.927
There's a whole range from
very good to not that great.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.010
And I'm not going to mention
countries that have--

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.880
--bad olive oil.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.930
But actually, it isn't
about the country.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.410
It's about how it's being done.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.410
So that's a good tahini.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.050
So going back to
the 10 ingredients,

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.360
we narrowed it down to 10.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.480
And those 10 ingredients,
for this particular book,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.280
the building blocks
of the pantry

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.370
that I'd like people to have.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.890
They're not necessary, and you'd
find recipes that are literally

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.400
cauliflower and that's about
it, and butter and oil,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.230
and you don't need to
get a fancy pantry.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.089
But those 10 ingredients are
really cool to have, and, yeah.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:18.990
That is it.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.700
And the other
elements in the pantry

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.280
are things that I think
normal pantries will have.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.000
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.456
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Rice,
pasta, frozen peas, you know,

00:17:27.456 --> 00:17:28.330
those kind of things.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.570
SPEAKER 2: So the
Ottolenghi 10 ingredients

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:35.910
still retain the Ottolenghi-ness
despite perhaps the title being

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.765
a bit of an oxymoron,
for some people at least.

00:17:38.765 --> 00:17:40.806
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah,
the oxymoron in the title

00:17:40.806 --> 00:17:43.080
is the one thing I'm trying
to combat by doing that.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.590
And, yeah, I mean, I do
think that we managed

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.390
to find ways to make the
recipes enough Ottolenghi

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.290
without disappointing anyone,
so keeping the surprise

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.790
element, the idea that something
is a little bit challenging

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.000
but, at the same
time, also comforting,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.200
which has always been
at the top of my agenda.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.399
So to make an Ottolenghi
recipe, which is funny

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:08.940
that I say that--
that's my surname--

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.590
but I get that there is
something beyond that.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.151
It's got a life of its own now.

00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:16.150
SPEAKER 2: It's a brand.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.108
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:18.810
And it means that
it can't just be--

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.910
I'm not saying it in
any prerogative way,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.550
but it's not a
Nigel Slater recipe.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.940
No, those are like a
really good pea soup.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.520
It's just it won't
cut the mustard,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.250
so it needs to have some
kind of twist or something

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.480
a bit unpredictable or, like I
said, a surprise to make it fit

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.210
or stand up to the
expectations of what people

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.845
have from cooking my food.

00:18:45.845 --> 00:18:47.970
SPEAKER 2: So I know we
spoke about 10 ingredients,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.534
but let's say you
could only have one.

00:18:50.534 --> 00:18:51.450
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: One.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.474
SPEAKER 2: One, one
ingredient that defines--

00:18:54.474 --> 00:18:55.890
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
I think it needs

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.960
to be that lemon on the
cover and on my T-shirt.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.310
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.510
Love the T-shirt.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.468
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.350
Because you can do
so much with a lemon.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.414
And I think people who
have been cooking recipes

00:19:06.414 --> 00:19:07.830
that I've published
over the years

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.080
would know that there
is a lot of things

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.570
that I do with lemons that are--

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.210
so there's the juicing and
the zesting and the grating

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.150
and infusing it.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.820
But there's also various ways
to roast it and add it to salads

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.280
and to preserve it, so there's
preserved lemons there.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.414
And so I still
think there's ways

00:19:26.414 --> 00:19:28.080
with lemon that I
haven't discovered yet

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.630
that I'm waiting to
discover, because it's just

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.980
such a great ingredient.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.610
And it does encompass
quite a lot of my cooking,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.280
if it has to be one ingredient.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.610
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.240
I want to talk a bit
more about the cookbook.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.170
So I find that this may be
the cookbook that I cook most

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.960
from out of all of the ones.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.360
Do you have any
favorite recipes?

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.240
Because as I said, I love the--

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.500
there's a dish called
Hot Charred Tomatoes

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.470
with Cold Yogurt, which is
so delicious and really easy

00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.970
to make.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.980
And the first time
where I think I've

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.322
only had to run to the
shops and buy the tomatoes.

00:20:04.322 --> 00:20:05.280
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.590
SPEAKER 2: I had everything
else in the kitchen.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.080
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Did you?

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.705
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:09.830
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:17.370
Yeah, this set of ingredients
is quite common, I'd say.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.870
Recipes that I love
from the book--

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.070
so it's the things that
I cook quite often,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.710
is there is a pasta dish
with harissa, olive, capers.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:37.520
And it's a North African
inspired set of ingredients.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.530
And so I took the liberty
to add some yogurt when

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.330
I serve it, which
is not very Italian,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.450
and pasta is considered
to be an Italian thing.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.210
But the connections between
North Africa and Southern Italy

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.950
are really very,
very evident when

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.370
you go to places like Sicily
or Sardinia or southern Italy.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.260
So it is a recipe that is
a hybrid of those two food

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.440
cultures.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.070
And I make it.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:07.029
There's a really good brand
of rose harissa from Belazu.

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:09.570
That's a really good brand, and
you find them in supermarkets

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.560
now.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.380
And it really doesn't
entail much more

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.320
than getting that and some
tomatoes and, like I said,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.580
capers, olives.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.430
And it just creates the
most incredible pasta.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:23.550
And you could put
it on the table

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.560
within the time it
takes to cook the pasta,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.360
or just a little bit
longer than that.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.962
So that's a favorite.

00:21:28.962 --> 00:21:30.420
There's also a
recipe that I really

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.480
love which is a little
bit more personal.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.930
It's Gnocchi alla Romana.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:34.652
SPEAKER 2: Mm.

00:21:34.652 --> 00:21:36.360
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It's
Semollina gnocchi.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.120
It's not gnocchi from potato
that most people might know,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.740
but it's made with semolina.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.720
And my grandmother, who was
Italian, used to make that.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.140
And again, some people who
grew up in this country

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.650
have a really negative
association with semolina

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.320
because it's been served
in some schools, I hear.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.670
It was part of the
not-so-loved repertoire

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.260
of school canteens
in this country,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.970
but luckily I was spared that.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.970
I arrived late enough to
not have to go through this.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.550
But semolina is a
great ingredient.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.560
It absorbs flavors.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.240
It's really very
smooth and beautiful.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.190
In Indian cooking, you find
great ways with semolina.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.930
And so, essentially,
the semolina

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.260
is cooked with Parmesan,
and butter, and some nutmeg,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.200
and then made into
little circles.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.610
And those are put under the
grill with some more cheese.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.680
You don't really
have to say much more

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.230
than that to make you--

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:37.920
SPEAKER 2: Yes, I'm
getting very hungry.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.550
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: So that's
another favorite recipe.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.160
But there's also desserts.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.160
There's a blueberry
and lemon loaf

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.455
cake, which really could
be anyone's, really.

00:22:50.455 --> 00:22:52.080
I just think it's a
really good recipe.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.180
And I put that together
really quickly.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.740
And it's nice to have a
cake with very little effort

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.060
in the house.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.680
SPEAKER 2: Great.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.865
Let's shift gears and talk a
little bit about other things.

00:23:04.865 --> 00:23:07.215
So I follow your
social media accounts,

00:23:07.215 --> 00:23:10.802
and you post lots of pictures
from your test kitchen.

00:23:10.802 --> 00:23:11.760
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.770
SPEAKER 2: So at
Google, obviously, we're

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.360
all about the innovation.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.290
I want to understand how you
go about developing recipes,

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.512
because you basically do
it as a full-time job.

00:23:21.512 --> 00:23:22.470
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.969
I am.

00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:26.850
Really, I develop recipes
as a full-time job.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.790
Well, that's how I feel
most of my time now.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.530
I go to the restaurants a
lot, too, and try the recipes.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.290
But I don't cook
in the restaurants.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.720
My way of developing recipes
has really evolved over time.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.530
So when I started
testing recipes,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.640
I used to do it all
from my kitchen at home.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.690
I used to live in West London,
and I had a small kitchen.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.710
Up until the book, "Plenty," I
tested every recipe by myself

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.536
at home.

00:23:56.536 --> 00:23:58.410
I used to take my car,
go to the supermarket,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.830
buy the ingredients, cook, write
the recipe, do the washing up.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:06.450
And it was a very inefficient
way of producing recipes.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.720
But since I only needed to
come up with one recipe a week,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.570
it was kind of doable.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.860
But also, the other
problem was that I

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.270
found it really difficult
to get inspired in this way.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.170
So I would sit with things
and have conversations.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:27.630
But really, it was kind of
a lonesome way of working.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.590
And about 10 years ago, we
started the test kitchen,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.530
which you're talking about,
which it's not a very--

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.020
if you come there, it's not
a very glamorous environment.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.980
It's not a Google
head office, but we

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.780
made it really look like
anyone's kitchen in the sense

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.270
that it's a very
low tech kitchen.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.970
The philosophy behind
that is because I

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.720
don't want to create
something that people

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.890
won't recreate at home.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:54.120
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.620
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
So the ingredients

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.710
come from just
ordinary supermarkets.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.407
And the equipment
is basic equipment.

00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:04.365
And I know a lot of people
have fancy equipment

00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:05.490
at home, but not everybody.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.610
And I want to know what is
the basic result that people

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.050
would get when I try something.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.420
That was the idea
behind the test kitchen.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.140
And I've got a team now
of about three people

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.110
and sometimes more, because
chefs come from the restaurants

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.150
to try their recipes there, too.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.870
And it's become a great,
creative hub, because people--

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.380
so I've got my team that
develop recipes for books

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.172
and other publications.

00:25:30.172 --> 00:25:32.130
I've got the chefs coming
from the restaurants.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.410
And the conversations are just
really, really interesting.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.090
So if something comes
up in one environment,

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.770
it's completely
relevant immediately

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.186
to the other
environment but needs

00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:44.880
to be changed and evolved.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.820
Like, for instance,
Rovi is a restaurant

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.550
that I opened a few
months ago in Fitzrovia,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.800
actually not that far from here.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.840
SPEAKER 2: Which is
great, by the way.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.020
We'll get onto that.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.520
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: And we did a
lot of pickling and preserving

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.130
for that.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.630
Because we were working on
recipes for the restaurant way

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.570
before it opened.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.250
And the notion of seasonality
was not so clear at that point,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.750
because we didn't know whether
we were going to open in June

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.950
or whether it was
going to be September,

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.060
and things really change.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.625
So we pickled quite a lot
of stuff and fermented

00:26:14.625 --> 00:26:16.590
and made sure that we--

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.890
the restaurant is focused on a
grill on which we grill mostly

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.680
vegetables but also
some meat and fish.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.580
And we wanted to get
those really enticing,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.490
strong flavors.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.966
But like I said,
we didn't really

00:26:29.966 --> 00:26:31.590
know exactly when it
was going to open,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.750
so we had to
preserve and ferment.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.620
For home cooks, that's quite a
big investment for the future,

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.900
because it takes days
and weeks for things

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.170
to kind of come to their own.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.340
And so we tested
little shortcuts.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.020
We've got a Chilean
tomato ferment, which

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.465
is one of my favorite,
and we served it

00:26:54.465 --> 00:26:58.710
with mint as a condiment to
many of the dishes in Rovi.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.900
We took certain shortcuts.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.390
Often, we would use--

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.030
you add a little bit of vinegar
and a little bit of sugar, not

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.286
a lot, but just a tiny
bit to get it started.

00:27:08.286 --> 00:27:09.660
And then you leave
it for one day

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.210
or not as long as
that, et cetera.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.880
So those are conversations
that we constantly have.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.740
So everybody tries
recipes, and we all

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:21.330
get together when it's time to
taste and taste and comment.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.000
Very meticulous notes
are being taken down.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.220
Because for me, recipes,
they have to work.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.980
I know it sounds really
like it's common sense,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.290
but I know it's not, because
some recipes don't work.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.470
We test it a lot.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.890
Once that's done, there is
a woman who lives in Wales

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:52.500
and has got a few kids, and a
husband, and extended family.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.000
And she tests the
recipes on her family.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.170
Only once that comes back
to me with a completely set

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:06.335
of comments that are
satisfying, the recipe

00:28:06.335 --> 00:28:07.380
is released to the world.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.060
So it's a very long process
with various stages.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.010
SPEAKER 2: Sounds like the
Google hiring process almost.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.200
How many make the cut?

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.790
2 out of 10 recipes
that make the cut?

00:28:22.282 --> 00:28:24.740
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: When they
get to her, most of them make--

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.290
I would never send something
that I'm not really

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.154
100% happy with.

00:28:31.154 --> 00:28:31.820
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.903
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: And I
learned from my experience

00:28:33.903 --> 00:28:38.500
that normally, if I have some
doubts, then she confirms them.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.530
Claudine, who is my
recipe tester in Wales,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.280
she cooked every dish
I've ever published.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.910
It's 1,000 recipes now.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:50.030
She really knows what the
level is and the expectations.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:55.730
And she has very honest
people around her also

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.290
confirming what she thinks.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.250
So normally they come fine.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.870
But I have a way of
reading what she says.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.750
I do want the truth, you know?

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.764
When it's excellent, I loved
it, there's no problem.

00:29:08.764 --> 00:29:10.055
But sometimes she writes, nice.

00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:11.774
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.200
SPEAKER 2: And she's
English, so nice is--

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.500
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: She's
half French, half English.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.083
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:20.600
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
But nice is kind of--

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.750
so if I had a tiny bit of
doubt about that recipe when

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.840
it went to her and it
came back with a nice,

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.070
then we take it back, and try
it again, and put a big question

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.284
mark around it and ask,
do we really love it?

00:29:33.284 --> 00:29:33.950
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.850
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
Because you really

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.641
need to love the recipes
that go out there,

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.690
because people cook them.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.840
They go buy the ingredients,
feed their friends and family.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.270
You really want them to
be pretty spectacular,

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.547
because otherwise, why?

00:29:46.547 --> 00:29:48.380
SPEAKER 2: Well, I'll
ask one more question,

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.620
but I would ask Googlers to
have your questions ready.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.980
There's a microphone
waiting there.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.770
My last question is going
to be about food trends.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:02.212
So it feels like veganism is
a really big thing right now.

00:30:02.212 --> 00:30:03.170
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:07.640
SPEAKER 2: You've been an early
supporter, I would say, I mean,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.320
with "Plenty", "Plenty More."

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.930
You've been flying the plant
flag for a very long time now.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.410
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.410
SPEAKER 2: So do you
think it's going to last?

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.912
And what are your thoughts
about trends in general?

00:30:16.912 --> 00:30:17.870
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:23.270
So for me, the interest in
vegetarian and vegan food

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.650
has always been a result of
not so much of an agenda,

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.330
but just because I think there
is just so much there that

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.140
could be enjoyed.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.800
And so the idea of turning
a non-vegan recipe vegan

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.320
is not something
that I enjoy doing.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.130
So vegan meat, or vegan
risotto, or anything

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.089
that even just feels like
you're adapting something

00:30:49.089 --> 00:30:50.630
is not something
that I do naturally.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.500
Because the culture
that I come from,

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.540
or the general Middle
Eastern food culture,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.330
has a lot of recipes that
are just naturally vegan.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.010
And in other parts of the
world, that's also the case.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.500
So I think those are
the good vegan dishes.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.142
I didn't really
love tofu until I

00:31:08.142 --> 00:31:10.100
went traveling in Southeast
Asia and understood

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.830
what to do with tofu.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.280
It took a while for
me to warm up to tofu

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.410
and see how well it
should be prepared.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.420
Once I've seen it, I
realized that tofu is not

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.280
a substitute to meat by any
stretch of the imagination.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.550
It's a real, proper foodstuff
in China, and Malaysia,

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:32.240
and Singapore, and other
places in Southeast Asia.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.430
And it's fantastic,
but you really

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.180
need to know what
you're doing with it.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.970
So I think veganism is great.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.230
I think there will be more
people having a vegan diet.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:45.830
But I think the
strict vegan diet

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:52.115
and the strict kind
of vegan way of life,

00:31:52.115 --> 00:31:56.030
that I didn't really enjoy in
its earliest incarnation, which

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.450
was kind of about, like
I said, translating

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.840
other foods into
the vegan language,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.017
is not something that I think
will stay for a very long time.

00:32:05.017 --> 00:32:07.100
But I think what will
become more and more evident

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.350
is that people want to eat
more and more vegan dishes

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.430
but not strictly vegan.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.130
And that's what you see
people say quite a lot.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.520
I've talked quite a lot
about flexitarianism.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.870
It's a word that people use.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:26.010
It sounds a bit like something
you'd put as a headline,

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.830
but it stands for something
much deeper than that.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.220
It's an understanding
that you need

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.560
to change your way
of eating, but you

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.030
need to be also
practical about it,

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.920
that there's human
nature, that we're humans,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.380
that we have certain
inclinations, that we

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.000
make certain sacrifices.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.865
So I think that would be the
way we see veganism transforming

00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:52.384
itself, reinventing itself
going into the future.

00:32:52.384 --> 00:32:54.050
SPEAKER 2: And also
of plants just being

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:58.715
celebrated, like in Rovi, the
things that you do with corn,

00:32:58.715 --> 00:32:59.580
for example.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.080
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah,
with corn, or with celeriac,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.170
or with cauliflower,
or with courgettes.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.820
Like what I said about lemon--

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.850
that I'm just feeling like
I'm scraping the surface--

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.750
is true about other vegetables.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.720
And I think vegetables
also have more potential

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.175
to do interesting things
with them than meat and fish,

00:33:17.175 --> 00:33:19.300
because meat and fish are
really great as they are.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.400
You put a bit of oil and
salt and you grill it,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.858
and you've got
something delicious.

00:33:22.858 --> 00:33:25.540
But vegetables, it
takes a little bit more.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.330
But once you start, you
get way more flavor.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.060
And the techniques
of cooking are

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.692
much more diverse in "Plenty
More" which is an older book

00:33:35.692 --> 00:33:36.400
that I published.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.370
It was all about how
cooking techniques really

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:44.740
create very different results
with the same vegetables.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.020
SPEAKER 2: With that, let's
take some audience questions.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.220
Don't be shy.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.140
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Google
people cannot be shy.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.280
SPEAKER 2: Yes, come on.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.196
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: That
is not possible, is it?

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.460
Thanks for joining us today.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.750
My question is, what is
your take on sustainability.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.080
Specifically, does things
like locally sourced, produced

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.920
or organic materials--

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.889
how much does that factor into
the recipes you come up with?

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.540
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: It has become
increasingly more relevant

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.110
to me over the years.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.889
I think it's definitely
not been high on my agenda

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:25.400
when I started writing cookbooks
and cooking in general.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.750
But like many other
people, I've come

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:31.469
to realize how important
it is to keep this in mind.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.260
And again, the way I
spoke about veganism,

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.469
I feel a little bit the
same about sustainability.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.710
You need to be careful
how you apply it,

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:45.690
because there is a tendency
to look at things at extremes

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.280
and black and white.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.980
So trading in spices
has been something

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.590
that has been going on for a
very long time, for millennia,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.409
and we'll keep on doing.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.480
And I think it's a good thing.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.012
Importing water
from Fiji has not

00:35:00.012 --> 00:35:01.470
happened for a very
long time and I

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.890
think is not a good thing.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.410
And I think, in
between those two,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.170
there's a whole
range of behaviors

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.670
that we need to kind of look at.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.620
And it's becoming
more and more evident

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:18.510
that we need to do much less
on the non-sustainable level

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.240
than we do.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.790
But I'm being very
pragmatic about it.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.520
One of the things that we're
doing a lot at Rovi, but also

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.650
in the other restaurants,
is working with farmers

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:32.790
from the area
southeast of England.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.260
And the partnerships
are really incredible.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.820
So things like shiso
leaves, which are really

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.620
kind of Japanese,
are grown in Dorset,

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.300
and we get them
within a few hours.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.850
And so it's just really
beneficial, and useful,

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.080
and good to think that way.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.830
Because you constantly discover
things that are possible that

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.550
you haven't.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.250
But as far as I can tell,
coffee will never come from UK.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.600
SPEAKER 2: I hope not.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.350
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
But we will still

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.030
carry on enjoying coffees, but
hopefully not in paper cups

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:12.220
but in glass cups that we can
bring with us to the coffee

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.559
shop.

00:36:14.559 --> 00:36:15.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.650
Can I become a recipe tester?

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.250
Number two, you
mentioned a family.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:27.980
How do you create a sense of
fun, creativity, curiosity

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.500
at home when it comes
to food and cooking?

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.290
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah,
it's really difficult.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.270
I've got two boys
that are young.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.130
They're three years
old and five years old.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.810
Had you asked me this question
before I had children,

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.840
I had this kind of ideal notion
that I'd just put everything

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.550
on the table and
let them experience.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.340
And they'll eat what you
eat and all the rest.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.810
It doesn't really
work like that.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:03.200
So the new version of this
theory, the slightly more

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.030
realistic version of
this theory is that, yes,

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.850
I do adapt things
for my children.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.290
Like any other
child that I know,

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.520
their first [INAUDIBLE]
these ages, I mean,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.600
is a bowl of pasta, pasta
with tomato sauce and cheese.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.700
And I'd give them
that all the time.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.860
I put other things around,
and we eat other things,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.510
and we get them excited.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.800
But I think showing
them what's going on

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.000
is really, really useful.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.010
Because children are
just naturally curious,

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.670
I mean, way more
curious than adults.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.692
If you're going to
pickle something,

00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:42.150
they will just ask
lots of question

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.020
before they even think it's
something that they will eat.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:51.320
So just opening a kind of
window to the way things are

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.379
is really useful.

00:37:52.379 --> 00:37:54.170
And it doesn't mean
you need to cook a lot.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.930
It just means that when you
cook, you just expose it.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.860
Or even just talking about
this or being interested,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.230
I think that is the
first step to get

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.080
kids involved in this world.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.130
It shows how middle
class we are,

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.560
but Max, my oldest son came
back from school last year

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.770
and said to me, oh, I
know how to make sushi.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.390
So they were rolling
sushi at school.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.172
I said, really?

00:38:21.172 --> 00:38:22.500
That's interesting.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.320
I don't know how to make sushi.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.640
And I think he was really
proud of being able to be there

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.410
at that moment.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.480
You can do all sorts
of things like that.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.450
Give them a little job.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:37.220
Let them do it.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.350
You might not even cook
that thing that they did.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.420
But it's just getting
them involved, I think,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.040
is really, really important.

00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:49.200
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
experience the chef version

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.520
of writer's block?

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.740
And how do you overcome it?

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.770
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Yeah.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.770
So I do and I did.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.300
I did more, but now--

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.460
so this goes back
to the test kitchen,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.590
which is I don't
think I actually

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:05.010
finished developing
this idea about how

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.110
the creative process happens.

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:09.720
I stopped at how strict
we are at testing recipes,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.240
but I didn't really talk
about the creative process.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.780
And this is really interesting,
because, like I said,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.670
when I stopped
working singularly

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.750
and I started
working in a group,

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.390
I found that it's really
helpful for everybody.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.280
It's very helpful for
me, that's for sure.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.280
Because every person brings
their own story, history,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.100
palette to the conversation,
which is great.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.530
But it's also what
happens when you

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.680
talk about an idea in a
group and how it evolves.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.700
So often we go, oh, no,
it's asparagus season again.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.400
It's the dreaded thing,
because in Britain, we

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.250
don't have a lot of things
that are really seasonal

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.310
and really off the plate,
and asparagus is one of them.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.990
And gooseberries is another one.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.500
But there's like, how many
columns about asparagus

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.690
can you write?

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:00.660
But actually, when you sit
down with three or four people

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.890
and you talk about
columns, it's incredible

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:09.810
how much comes through those
particular conversations,

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.810
much more than you'd think would
come out of you if you haven't

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.830
had those people around.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.385
So one person's idea
sparks an idea in your mind

00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:17.760
that you didn't
really even have.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.190
And you develop it into
something completely different.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.410
Jeremy Lee, who is a
chef that I really like,

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.370
rolls his asparagus in
phyllo and just sprinkles it

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.260
with Parmesan and
fries it or bakes it.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.790
It's a really great dish.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.850
And I just had that
in my mind when

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.400
we had the latest asparagus
discussion, which was probably

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.070
in January or something.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.550
And that idea of rolling
the asparagus in something

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:48.070
could completely take you to a
completely different direction.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.340
It's an image more
than anything else.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.160
But it's something that
you can just use or take.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.470
You can coat it
with something which

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.420
isn't a pastry or anything.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.030
So those conversations
are really, really useful

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.930
in the group--

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.510
starting with one
thought and then kind

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.190
of just rolling
into something else.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:10.260
And so that's how the recipes
evolve from those conversations

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.940
and from tasting.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.790
SPEAKER 2: We'll take
two more questions.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.469
Yes, go on.

00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:19.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:23.750
I'm not exactly the best cook,
maybe not even very good.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.800
Have you got any
kitchen cheats or hacks

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.730
that could help my skill level?

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.730
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: First
of all, I want to say,

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:35.400
before I give you
a bit of advice,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.490
it's funny how it goes
back to the discussion

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.790
that we had about
cooking at ease.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.990
There is a real pressure
to be good at everything.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:49.010
And cooking is not something
you need to be good at.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.560
There's so many
good places to eat--

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.856
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.690
--all around, everywhere.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.427
I feel that there's this
pressure for everybody to cook.

00:42:01.427 --> 00:42:03.260
And I know a lot of
people that don't really

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.860
love cooking that much, and
it's really not a problem.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.716
So you're in a safe space.

00:42:08.716 --> 00:42:09.590
It's absolutely fine.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.926
My sister, when I came
up with this book,

00:42:11.926 --> 00:42:14.300
she said to me, oh, my God,
finally I can cook your food.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:21.710
I don't think it's her
number one leisure activity.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.620
She's got three kids.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.300
She's got a busy job, a busy
life, and she just didn't cook.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.790
This book is full
of tricks for you.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.710
And I think one of those
things I can only say

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.830
is that if you see a
recipe that says to you,

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:39.650
I want to eat that,
that's step one.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.650
That's really important.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.920
And the next step is just
read carefully through

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.920
and see there's nothing
challenging or too

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.300
overcomplicated and try it.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.450
I think that is the
best way around it.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.240
There is a dish here,
another pasta dish.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.950
I think that's a very
good place to start.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:03.590
It's got tinned chickpeas,
za'atar, and olive oil.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.312
And those are all
cupboard ingredients,

00:43:05.312 --> 00:43:07.520
and it's something you can
put together very quickly.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.250
And you can be really
proud of your achievement

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.170
and not feel that you've cheated
in a very substantial way.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.830
Because again, it
doesn't matter.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.920
Because when people taste
it and say it's amazing,

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.753
you don't need to tell
them how easy it was.

00:43:20.753 --> 00:43:21.905
[LAUGHS]

00:43:21.905 --> 00:43:24.274
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:24.274 --> 00:43:24.815
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:24.815 --> 00:43:25.790
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: Hey.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.370
AUDIENCE: So what's next
for you for the next one-

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.254
to five-year plan?

00:43:31.254 --> 00:43:32.014
[LAUGHS]

00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:33.680
SPEAKER 2: Googlers
really like actions.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.830
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI: That is
kind of a long trajectory.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.530
Well, I don't really know.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.460
And that's a very
genuine answer,

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.610
because I have never had a plan.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.540
So there is definitely going
to be a book coming out,

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.070
not next year because
I'm taking a year off,

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.914
because it's been too much.

00:43:53.914 --> 00:43:55.330
But the year after
that, I'm going

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.496
to have another book coming.

00:43:56.496 --> 00:44:02.220
And that book will explore
the notion of flexitarianism

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.870
that I talked about.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:07.490
So I don't want to
reveal too much of it.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.350
But I think a little
bit that you can be--

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.730
and don't quote me on that--

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.120
a vegetarian and you can
still use fish sauce.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.940
No, probably not.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.910
But the notion that
you could choose

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.110
that kind of line of
eating and cooking

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.550
is the way I'm exploring now.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.920
So it's kind of flavor
ideas of flavor bombs

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.480
that could really enhance
your vegetable-focused meal

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.620
and turn them into something
super delicious is what I'm

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.842
thinking about for that book.

00:44:40.842 --> 00:44:42.300
But it's really
just the beginning,

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.716
because I've got
a couple of years

00:44:43.716 --> 00:44:45.390
to work on that-- or
a year and a half.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:51.350
And then I don't really
know, I have to be honest.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.540
I don't think we're going
to open another restaurant

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.550
for at least another
two or three years,

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:58.890
because restaurants
are a nightmare.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.340
Even successful restaurants,
behind the scenes,

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.970
are a nightmare, because
it's just really difficult

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:05.930
to run a restaurant.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.180
And with Brexit, we
also have less people

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:12.200
coming through the door to
take the jobs that we need.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.712
So it's become increasingly
more difficult.

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:16.170
But the restaurants
are doing well,

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.336
so there probably will be
another one at some point.

00:45:18.336 --> 00:45:21.110
But there isn't one
planned for any time

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:22.370
in the very near future.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.320
SPEAKER 2: Will you
expand internationally?

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.960
YOTAM OTTOLENGHI:
Expand internationally?

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.260
This is a conversation that
we've had a lot in the past.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.760
And the difficulty with
that is that, first of all,

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.790
it's a lifestyle choice.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.430
So that means
someone needs to be

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.960
going from one
country to the other

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.780
all the time to make
sure it's done properly.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.232
The other is the
quality control.

00:45:43.232 --> 00:45:44.690
So you need to
partner with someone

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.580
that really understands
the ethos and how it works.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.010
And I know there's a lot
of chefs that do that.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.120
Some do it really well.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.170
Others failed.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.480
So there's all sorts
of examples of how

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.690
that international
expansion plays out.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:03.895
But it's a possibility.

00:46:03.895 --> 00:46:06.620
And like I say, I can't
tell how many conversations

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.630
I've been in when we
discussed that option

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.300
and then dismissed it
on all sorts of grounds.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.990
So I don't know yet.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.316
We'll see.

00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:14.975
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:46:14.975 --> 00:46:16.700
Well, I think we may
have to wrap it up.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.440
A few closing comments from me--

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.470
Cafe Royal is
celebrating the book,

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:27.380
and they've cooked at least
a dozen dishes for you

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.290
to try out, which is great.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.470
Yotam has a podcast, which
is actually really excellent.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.620
You can find it on Spotify.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.690
Features guests such
as Lin-Manuel Miranda,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:42.080
Nigella Lawson, Nadia Hussain.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.978
Great to listen to.

00:46:44.978 --> 00:46:50.730
And last but not least,
already a bestselling book,

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.020
so hopefully you
will enjoy the dishes

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.340
and go out and buy the book.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.880
But can you please
join me in thanking

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.630
Yotam for coming in today?

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.230
Thank you.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.980
[APPLAUSE]
