00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In most problem databases, however,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
it is real people who enter and classify problem reports.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's take a look at a real problem database

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to get an idea what these look like.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Fortunately, for many open source projects

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
there are problem databases, which are readily available.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For instance, let's take a look at Bugzilla,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the bug database for all Mozilla products,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in particular the Firefox browser.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This problem database contains more than 700,000 problems.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Of course, most of them have been fixed at this point.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's assume I have a problem with a blinking cursor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I enter the search terms for the bug, click on quick search,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and here I see all the issues that occur currently,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or at least that have been reported by users,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with respect to the text cursor and blinking.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For instance, here we have blinking cursor does not move

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
when space is entered.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We can get details on this bug.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is the original bug report filed ten years ago.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's go for a more recent one.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here's add key bindings to CSS value adjustment.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You see the bug report--you see the product it applies to,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in this case Firefox.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You see when it was reported.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Here's the original bug report, and now you see

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the developers talking about the problem.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You can also follow back the history as developers suggest patches

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for the bug.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In the end, they discuss possible alternatives

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
on how to address that bug.
