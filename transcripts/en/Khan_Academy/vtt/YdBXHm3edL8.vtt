00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.811
Voiceover: Everything
we've discussed so far

00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:04.564
involved recognizing and tagging

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:07.532
or engulfing shady things that were found

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:13.284
outside of cells.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:17.490
We've seen things like a B cell.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:28.285
A B cell has its membrane
bound antibodies.

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:33.059
Maybe one of these might
recognize something shady

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.085
out in the outside of the cell

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:37.975
and of course this part over here

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.986
as we know they all
have a variable portion

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:41.580
right over here.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.466
This is specific to this shady thing

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:49.658
then this will be engulfed
and then parts of it

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:53.500
will be attached to an MHC two complex.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.741
Let me do that in a different color.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.577
An MHC two complex and then
that will go to the surface,

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:05.105
that will go to the membrane of the cell

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.797
to present itself.

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:11.781
That's an MHC two complex.

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:15.454
It has little bit of the little piece

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:18.512
of this shady thing out here

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:20.156
we call this little shady piece,

00:01:20.156 --> 00:01:23.784
this is an antigen presenting cell here.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.466
We've seen as especially
if this is a B cell

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:30.701
then a helper T cell that it
also has a variable portion

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.579
that corresponds to this specific antigen.

00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:39.345
This would be helper T
cell right over here.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.557
This is a helper, T helper cell.

00:01:44.557 --> 00:01:47.246
When it recognizes then
it will start dividing

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.008
into memory helper T cells

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.440
and effector helper T cells.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.842
The effector helper T cells

00:01:51.842 --> 00:01:53.786
essentially ring the alarm bells

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:57.807
and start kind of accelerating
the B cell replication

00:01:57.807 --> 00:01:59.958
or I guess you could say
that the B cell activation.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.651
The theory is that this is kind of a

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.145
double handshake process.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:06.098
Once again this is what's
occurring outside of cells.

00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:07.918
When we found stuff outside of cells,

00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:09.660
we engulf them and then we presented them

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.114
on MHC two complexes.

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:18.778
Now you're probably thinking well,

00:02:18.778 --> 00:02:20.676
I mean that's the outside of cells

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:24.033
but there's MHC two,
there's this helper T cells

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:27.759
but we've also referred
to cytotoxic T cells.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.793
What do those do?

00:02:28.793 --> 00:02:30.529
We've also, if there's MHC two,

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.740
there's probably an MHC one complex.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.867
What does the MHC one complex do?

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:37.768
We can recognize shady things

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:38.882
that are happening outside of cells

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:41.324
but don't shady things
sometimes happen inside cells

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:44.899
and how does our immune
system respond to that?

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.175
Actually as you can
imagine all of those things

00:02:48.175 --> 00:02:50.128
will be answered in
the rest of this video.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:54.984
Let's think about what
happens when shady things

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:57.001
start to happen inside the cell.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.925
For example it might not
even be due to a virus

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:05.310
or due to some type of bacteria

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.579
could be the cell itself is gone awry.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.398
Let's say that this right
over here is a cancer cell.

00:03:12.398 --> 00:03:14.431
It's had some mutations.

00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:18.355
It's starting to multiply like crazy.

00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:20.317
This is a cancer cell and a cancer cell

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.182
because it had mutations
are going to produce,

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:27.185
it's going to produce some weird proteins.

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.750
These cancer cells are going to produce

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.901
some weird proteins.

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:35.087
Every cell with a nucleus in your body

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:36.310
and that's pretty much every cell

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.626
except for red blood cells
has MHC one complexes.

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:46.629
The whole point of the MHC one complex

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.778
is to bind two shady
things that are produced

00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:56.084
inside of the cell,

00:03:56.084 --> 00:03:58.055
and then present them to the membrane.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:00.370
Even a malfunctioning cancer cell

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.324
should be doing this.

00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:09.598
This MHC one complex is bound
to this strange proteins

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:12.541
that are produced by the
mutations inside of the nucleus

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:17.814
and then it can present them.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.133
You could imagine what the appropriate

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:22.654
immune response should be.

00:04:22.654 --> 00:04:29.574
These cancer cells should be killed

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.149
and actually let me label this properly.

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:32.534
That was MHC two,

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:34.775
you're presenting an
antigen that was found,

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.856
those initially found outside of the cells

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:38.051
engulfing and taken out.

00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:43.362
MHC one, it's binding to shady things

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:46.124
inside the cell and
then presenting it out.

00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:48.600
This thing should be killed.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.091
Now as you can imagine,
what's going to kill it?

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.846
Well that's where the cytotoxic T cell

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:55.025
comes into the picture.

00:04:55.025 --> 00:04:58.687
The cytotoxic T cell is going to have,

00:04:58.687 --> 00:05:01.216
that's a receptor right there.

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:03.769
It will have a variable
portion that's specific

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:07.963
to this type of an antigen
and so it will bind there.

00:05:07.963 --> 00:05:10.286
Once it does that, it says, oh boy,

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.105
there's all this shady stuff here,

00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:13.956
this shady proteins
that are being produce.

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.444
This cell and all the other ones like it

00:05:16.444 --> 00:05:17.758
need to be killed.

00:05:17.758 --> 00:05:21.681
The cytotoxic T cell
will begin to replicate

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:24.957
once again like other
types of immune cells

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.385
is going to replicate
into the memory cells

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.747
just in case this type of thing shows up

00:05:30.747 --> 00:05:32.038
10 years in the future

00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:33.855
and also the effector themselves.

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:41.595
This is memory and also effector cells,

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:44.725
effector cytotoxic T cells.

00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:48.696
As we always know the
effector version is the thing

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:49.928
that actual does something,

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:51.671
it starts to actually affect things.

00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:53.114
What it is going to affect,

00:05:53.114 --> 00:05:56.029
it is going to start binding two things

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:58.426
that are presenting the same antigen

00:05:58.426 --> 00:06:01.963
as part of their MR on top
of their MHC one complex.

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:04.294
This character right over here,

00:06:04.294 --> 00:06:09.394
so it's presenting that same antigen

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.151
on this MHC one complex.

00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.941
Remember, the variable
portions need to match up.

00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:21.710
Let's say that this is an
effector cytotoxic T cell

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.790
and actually let me draw
in a little bit different.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.182
Let me draw it like this.

00:06:26.182 --> 00:06:29.916
This is effector cytotoxic T cell.

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:32.192
Its receptor, its variable portion

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:35.422
is the one that's
compatible with this antigen

00:06:35.422 --> 00:06:37.022
that's being presented right over here.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.373
Let me just label this again.

00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:41.793
This is the MHC one complex.

00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:47.192
This is an effector cytotoxic T cell.

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:49.854
We'll put the C there for cytotoxic

00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:52.374
and what it does is
essentially kind of latches on

00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:55.308
to the cell that needs to die

00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:58.056
and it does it, not
only have this receptor

00:06:58.056 --> 00:07:00.144
interfacing with the MHC one complex

00:07:00.144 --> 00:07:02.686
but actually has a
whole series of proteins

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.879
and I'm not drawing this to scale really.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.167
This would be much smaller or
relative to the scale cell.

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:09.272
It essentially latches on between the two

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:10.705
and I'm not going to go in detail

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:13.518
but essentially forms what
you can call an immuno synapse

00:07:13.518 --> 00:07:15.239
which is kind of where the two things

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:16.569
are interacting with each other.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.827
When it identifies this, it says,

00:07:18.827 --> 00:07:20.189
okay, I need to kill this thing

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:22.306
or essentially I need to
make this thing kill itself.

00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:24.974
It starts releasing
all of these molecules.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:27.615
It can release molecules like perforins

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:29.853
so to release this preference

00:07:29.853 --> 00:07:32.903
which will essentially cause gaps or holes

00:07:32.903 --> 00:07:38.448
to form in the membrane of
the cell that needs to die

00:07:38.448 --> 00:07:40.808
and it could release other
things like granzymes

00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:45.368
that can go in and
essentially cause this thing

00:07:45.368 --> 00:07:47.151
to kill itself.

00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.245
The whole point of this
video is to appreciate

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:51.848
I guess what we haven't talked about yet.

00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:53.665
We had already talked about what happens

00:07:53.665 --> 00:07:55.896
when you identify shady
things outside of the cells

00:07:55.896 --> 00:07:58.138
and then how you can kind of bring them in

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:01.422
and then present them and then
use that to further activate

00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:03.086
the immune response.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.407
Now we're talking about
identifying shady things

00:08:05.407 --> 00:08:06.588
inside the cells.

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:09.574
Those get presented by MHC one complexes

00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:12.478
and then the cytotoxic
T cells recognize them

00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:14.704
and then force the cell
to kill themselves.

00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:16.152
This wouldn't just be cancer cells,

00:08:16.152 --> 00:08:18.761
this could also apply to a cell

00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:20.885
that has already been affected by a virus.

00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:24.196
For example a cell like this all ready,

00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:25.512
so that's its nucleus.

00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:31.169
It's already been infected by some virus

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:36.066
so the virus has hijacked the
cell's replication machinery

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:37.519
in order to replicate itself.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.516
The proper immune response is hey look,

00:08:39.516 --> 00:08:42.359
I'm a virus making machine.

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:44.834
I should kill myself.

00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:48.165
It will wreck some of the antigens

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:52.580
that are being produced
inside by the viruses.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.530
They're going to bind
to MHC one complexes.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.379
Pieces of the virus are going
to bind to MHC one complexes

00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:03.097
and then they're going to be presented

00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:05.059
on the surface.

00:09:06.805 --> 00:09:11.102
Let me do it this way,
presented on the surface.

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:14.150
This exact process can happen again.
