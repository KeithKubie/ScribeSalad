00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jessica is
an entrepreneur and investor

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.820
focused on financial
inclusion, the sharing

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.260
economy, and social justice.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.840
She's best known as
a co-founder of Kiva,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.680
the world's people-the-people
microlending website.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.470
In her new book,
"Clay Water Brick"

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.460
that she's going to
share about today,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.510
she shares her personal
story of co-creating

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.310
a tool for social change and
the evolution of this nonprofit

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.250
that started in a modest
off-campus Stanford apartment,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.660
and went on to be
a global movement.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.190
Jessica highlights
the life lessons

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.900
she's learned firsthand from
the entrepreneurs themselves,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.220
many of them in the
world's poorest countries.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.680
So I'm going to leave
no further introduction,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.597
and have Jessica share
her story with us.

00:00:43.597 --> 00:00:46.579
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.880
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Thank you very much

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.360
for the very kind introduction.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.220
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.292
I'm touched, and I don't
take the time that you're

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:58.500
spending hear me for granted.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.397
So we dive right
in, and by the way,

00:01:00.397 --> 00:01:02.730
there's a little squeaky baby
in the back and he's mine,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.142
and I'm happy he's here.

00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:08.080
He probably will want to
chime in a little bit.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.080
I'm going to first talk
to you about a gentleman

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.760
that I met 10 years
ago named Patrick.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.545
I met him in Uganda, in a
little village on the border

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:16.470
of Kenya and Uganda.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.497
He had fled the northern
area of the country years

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:21.830
earlier, because a rebel group
had attacked his village,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.910
and he fled only with his
brother and nothing else.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.750
No shoes on his feet, just
the clothes on his back.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.790
He was young,
uneducated, orphaned,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.957
and really didn't have much.

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.331
And I think a lot
of people would

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.110
have looked at Patrick's
life and thought,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.970
the situation is hopeless,
this person is hopeless.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.050
But Patrick didn't believe that.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.560
He knew that he had
within themselves

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.200
what it took to improve his
life and to lift himself up out

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.700
of poverty.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.460
And so one day, as he
described the story to me,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.290
he was sitting, kind of leaning
against the mud structure

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.505
where he and his
brother slept, and he

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.110
was thinking, as he did every
day, about what his plan was

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350
going to be to feed
himself and his brother.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.450
And he sort of had
this aha moment.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.900
He kind of looked down where
his hand was touching the earth

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.620
and he began to dig.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.300
And at first, when he dug,
he didn't discover too much,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810
but he got a piece of
wood and a scrap of metal,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.760
and started to kind
of use these homemade

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.190
implements to dig deeper,
and he found clay deposits.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.920
And he learned, as
he dug, that if he

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.650
mixed a little bit of water with
that clay, it could be shaped.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.729
And so he created these bricks,
just with his own two hands.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.770
The first bricks were
really rough and misshapen,

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.150
and kind of crumbled
easily, but he kept at it.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.710
He got better and
better, and soon he

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.179
made bricks that were good
enough, high quality enough,

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.970
to be able to sell.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.428
Just for fractions
of a penny each,

00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:41.280
but it was enough
to get started.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.570
So he did that.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.924
Sold those bricks and saved up.

00:02:45.924 --> 00:02:47.340
And eventually,
he was able to buy

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.661
a brick mould, which instantly
doubled his production.

00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:52.160
He was able to make
bricks that were

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
more smoothly and
consistently shaped and sized.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.530
And he dried those
bricks in the sun,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.790
because that's what was free.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.040
That's what he knew how to do.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.540
And those bricks sold
for a little bit more

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.414
than the other ones that
he had just made by hand.

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:06.580
You can see where this goes.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.030
He continued to save up money.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.080
He knew that if he baked
the bricks in a kiln,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.120
they would sell for even more.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.870
So of course, he saved
up to be able to go

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.425
to a neighboring village and to
learn, and kind of apprentice

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.050
for a little while,
with the brickmaker

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.470
there and learn how to
make a self-contained kiln.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.550
So he did that, baked the
bricks, and of course,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.547
those sold for more.

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:25.130
And eventually, he
was able to replace

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.580
those homemade implements
with a shovel, and a trowel,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
and other things to be much more
of an official business person,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.477
as a brickmaker.

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:35.060
He was able to hire his brother,
and then a neighbor, and then

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.010
another, and by the
time I met Patrick,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.710
he had this booming business,
was doing quite well,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.440
and was a real leader
in his community.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.060
And perhaps, at least
to me, most notably,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.010
he showed me were sort of
this epiphany had happened,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.594
and also showed me
the home next to it

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:49.885
that he had built the new home.

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:51.550
Not just the old
packed mud home,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.160
but the new one with
baked mud bricks

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.740
that he had pulled from the
earth with his own two hands.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.110
If that's not entrepreneurial,
I'm not sure what it is.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.990
That's Patrick.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.330
The second story I'll
tell you is of Fatuma.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.590
Now Fatuma, I met
about 700 miles-ish

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.920
due south of where
I met Patrick.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.540
Fatuma lived in a village
outside of Dodoma, Tanzania,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.410
and she was also
an entrepreneur.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.660
But her story ended a little bit
differently than Patrick's had.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.997
So to kind of tell you why I
was there in the first place,

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:25.580
I was working for several months
with a nonprofit organization

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.050
called Village Enterprise, a
great bay area nonprofit that

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.930
provided, at the time,
microgrants of $100

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.400
to entrepreneurs so
they could start or grow

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.046
their simple businesses.

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:38.170
Patrick and Fatuma were
two of these entrepreneurs,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.100
and I was there sort of
surveying them, interviewing

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.880
them, asking them, did
you receive the money?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.046
If you did, how did it work?

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:45.279
Did it change the trajectory
of your business at all?

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.320
Did it improve your life?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.820
How so?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.157
And I was doing this sort
of standard of living survey

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.365
and had a questionnaire that
I would ask entrepreneur

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:52.170
after entrepreneur.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.215
So these are just two of
the 150-ish entrepreneurs

00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:58.780
I met during that period
of time, 10 years ago.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780
Fatuma kind of pulled
me into her home,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.831
and who here has been
inside of a mud hut before?

00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:04.830
I'm going to guess some.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.371
There you go.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:07.730
So I think they're
totally fascinating.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.220
I am sure that I could
never build one myself,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.684
but I kind of really love
looking at the structures.

00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:15.100
So this is not
actually-- I didn't

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.650
get pictures of her and
her home at the time,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.970
but this is not
actually her home.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.136
And it looked a little bit
like this on the outside,

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:23.352
and on the inside, some of
the nicest homes like this

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:24.810
that I've been in
looked like this.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.300
With actual furniture,
different implements,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.490
quite a nice
brightly lit inside.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.780
But Fatuma's looked
a lot more like this

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.540
So imagine, she pulls
me in, sits me down

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.060
in one of the few pieces
of furniture in her home.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.450
There was two folding chairs
and a little table, and then

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.540
the mattress where she's slept,
and that was pretty much it.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.082
So she pulled me
in, sat down, and we

00:05:45.082 --> 00:05:47.415
started to talk about her
business, which was a charcoal

00:05:47.415 --> 00:05:48.182
selling business.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.140
And she showed me the
records that she had kept

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.420
in these little blue books.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.530
Now, does anyone have a visceral
memory when I talk about this?

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.890
Blue books.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.800
Right?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.300
Like the things, that least I
used to write my middle school

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.133
essays in and stuff.

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:01.280
So she had blue books.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.410
Kind of funny.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.280
And kept her records in there,
and as we went through them,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.460
I got really excited,
because her business was

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.510
doing much better than a lot
of the businesses I had seen,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.210
even those that were
quite successful.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.209
And I thought I had
discovered this sort of rags

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.900
to riches story.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.164
I got really excited, I
double-checked her numbers,

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:21.580
looked, not only at that little
blue book full of records,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.204
but other ones.

00:06:22.204 --> 00:06:26.090
And in fact, her numbers
panned out, they were correct.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.355
But I was baffled
because as I asked her

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.980
the kind of questions that I had
been asking many entrepreneurs

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.384
up until that point, like,
how have you reinvested

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:35.550
the profits of your business
back into the business,

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.258
or how have you improved
your life thanks

00:06:37.258 --> 00:06:39.460
to these new profits?

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.975
I didn't see
anything that told me

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:43.350
that she was
actually reinvesting

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.430
in herself or in her family.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.960
Her clothes were
tattered, her shoes

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.390
were kind of falling apart.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.930
She was very gaunt, barely
ate three meals a day.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.034
And basically, there was
nothing that I could see,

00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:55.700
no signs of newfound
wealth in her home.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.050
So I asked her directly
and she said things like,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.090
oh, it's fine, you
know, my days will pass.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.780
I am OK.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.260
She was very, content is
not quite the right word,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.540
but she had no dreams to
do anything with her money.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.580
And I pushed her on it
and I said, OK, fine,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.069
but where actually did
you put all this money,

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.860
because you should have
kind of a nice pile

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.980
somewhere if what you're
telling me is correct?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.860
And she was kind of a joker.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.450
She kind of looked around
as if anyone else was there,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.800
and like tiptoed over to
the far side of her hut

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.890
and patted the ground, and she
said, it's in the world bank.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.925
Which was kind of funny.

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:34.670
I mean, you don't
get a lot of jokes

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.430
when you're looking
at, you know,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.075
very impoverished situations.

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:39.950
There's not a lot of
poverty jokes out there.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.900
But she thought
that was so funny.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.964
I laughed, it was funny.

00:07:42.964 --> 00:07:44.380
She had literally
buried her money

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.569
in the grounds, in the earth
floor next to where she slept.

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:49.860
That's what made her feel safe.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.520
That's what made her feel good.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.440
She didn't have real
dreams for the future

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.270
and she certainly
hadn't reinvested

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.090
much at all back into her
life to make things better.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.770
Every other
entrepreneur that I met

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.900
did have that,
almost all of them.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.010
They had these amazing
dreams for the future

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.251
and I have a long list of
things that I heard about

00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:11.750
as I asked individuals, not
only what they had done already.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.458
You know, send their
daughters to school,

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.450
afford three meals a
day, buy a mosquito net,

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.580
all sorts of things.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.370
They had many other
dreams for the future.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.140
You know, travels to faraway
places, new clothing,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.610
shiny electronics, education
for all of their children,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:26.390
and on and on.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.200
But Fatima did not.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.560
And since that day, I've sort
of been fascinated by a number

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.240
things, but especially,
I've been fascinated

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.620
by this question, what makes
some people dig, and find

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.346
opportunity literally in the
ground beneath their feet,

00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:42.720
and what makes some people
bury the gifts that they have,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.800
the treasures that they do that?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.620
I don't think that
the answer to that

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.000
is unrelated to
entrepreneurship.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.960
I do believe Fatuma
was an entrepreneur,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.750
but I think the main
difference between her

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.730
and Patrick and the
many, many others

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.600
like Patrick who had really
just big dreams what was next.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.490
I think the main
difference between them

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.960
was that Patrick was able to
imagine a different future.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.300
He had a very strong vision
for what was out there for him.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.204
What could make his life
better and the lives

00:09:08.204 --> 00:09:09.370
of people around him better.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.430
He had this vision and
he wasn't afraid to keep

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.390
pursuing that vision,
along the path,

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.320
even when it got difficult.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.860
I think this has to do with
entrepreneurship, at least

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.940
in some way, because
it speaks to,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.460
at least my favorite
definition of entrepreneurship,

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.612
my favorite academic definition,
which is Howard Stevenson's

00:09:26.612 --> 00:09:27.820
from Harvard Business School.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.240
He says that entrepreneurship
is the pursuit of opportunity,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.920
without regard to resources
currently controlled.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.920
And maybe I'm reading
into it too much,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.770
but I think it's
quite a romantic idea.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.790
That the pursuit of
the thing that you

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.040
vision in the future, the
pursuit of this opportunity

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.130
that you see to
make things better,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.530
without regard to what
you might currently

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.530
have in your possession.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.350
So it's about this
movement forward.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.570
Not what you own, not your
education or your pedigree,

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.710
not a pile of resources
you might have at hand,

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.640
at your network.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.052
Just going after this
thing and knowing

00:09:59.052 --> 00:10:01.010
that as you do that,
you'll find what you need,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.560
you'll make your way
over, around, and through.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.660
And I think the best
entrepreneurs that I've met

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.300
are able to do that, because
they have this strong vision

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.200
and they know that it's worth
it to keep moving forward.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.990
OK, so I want to now
digress a little bit.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.630
You might ask, then, at
least I do, OK, great.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.997
So if the thing that made
Patrick and others so great

00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:22.830
is that they had this
vision for the future,

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.329
they were be able
to tell themselves

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:27.360
a story for what could be
different in the future,

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.860
why don't some people do that?

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.920
Why did Fatima get stuck?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.810
And others like her?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.010
And why do we?

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.637
With everything
we need around us,

00:10:34.637 --> 00:10:36.220
why do we get stuck
sometimes and feel

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.740
like we can't move forward?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.837
I think it's because we end up
believing in the wrong stories.

00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:43.920
And so I think it's really
important to figure out

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.170
what we're hearing and
believe the right ones,

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.360
champion the right ones, retell,
perpetuate the better stories

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.450
in the world that really
focus on potential,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.400
and not get stuck in
the wrong stories.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.210
Now, I know that that's what
I've had to do in my own life,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.610
and to briefly tell
you my own story,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.130
we're going to go way back.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.930
When I was five, I
was in Sunday school,

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.220
and I'm not trying
to make fun, I just

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.510
think this is how I saw
the world at five, right?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.340
This is Jesus, my buddy.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.130
I'm there on the
left, just kidding.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.560
But I just, you know, I had
a very simple world view,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.415
as I think a lot of
us do at five and six.

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:21.040
And I remember the
first time I learned

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.831
about poverty was in
a Sunday school class,

00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.700
sitting on the floor, hearing
my lovely Sunday school

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.910
teacher, who I know had great
intentions, sort of haphazardly

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.930
throw out different
things that were

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.270
in the Bible about poverty.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.729
One thing she threw
out to us was this idea

00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:37.020
that Jesus told us, what you
do for the least of these,

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.400
you do for me.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.780
And I remember hearing that, and
as a kid it might sound silly,

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.560
but as kid, it was
deeply motivating

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.060
and it was kind of
the closest thing

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.000
that I had ever
felt to a calling.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.180
I thought, wait
a minute, so if I

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.760
help people that are in
need, if I helped the poor,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.230
then I'm doing
something for God?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.990
This is amazing.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.240
This is like the world's
greatest homework assignment.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.005
I'm going to go do that.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:11:58.560
Let's go.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.360
I was super motivated by this
idea that my life could matter.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.680
That I could do
something important--

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.090
of cosmic importance, right?

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.320
In the lives of other people.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.770
At the same time, she also
threw things out like this,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.366
and the second thing
that she threw out

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:17.240
did not give me that
same sort of motivation.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.202
In fact, it scared
the pants off me.

00:12:19.202 --> 00:12:21.660
She also told us that Jesus
said that the poor would always

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.140
be with us.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.910
I pictured in my head, as a
little kid, this long line

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.720
of people that would always
be following me around, always

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.629
with me, asking me for my
stuff and asking me to share.

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:34.920
And while I wouldn't have
used language like, you know,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.836
this is unsustainable.

00:12:35.836 --> 00:12:38.140
I knew that, like, I
would run out of stuff.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.410
I only had so many crayons
that I could give out.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.030
I knew that this
wasn't going to work,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.810
and so I felt frustrated,
and in fact, angry, at god.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.429
At the world, for if
this was the reality.

00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:51.470
I felt like I'd been given
this great assignment,

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.680
this great charge, this
great mission for my life.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.080
But I was being told in
advance I would totally fail,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.650
and I was angry.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.570
Unfortunately, a lot of the
stories I heard over the years

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.290
after that little glimpse
when I was five-years-old

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.830
felt and sounded and
looked a lot like this.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.240
They were stories focused
on sadness, and suffering,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.640
and desperation,
and hopelessness,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.111
often carefully crafted.

00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:16.610
These stories were
carefully crafted

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.960
by well intentioned
nonprofits and NGOs that

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.300
wanted me to feel something.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.630
I mean, the feelings that I felt
were panic, I felt overwhelmed,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.850
I felt quite guilty,
and I felt even

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.930
shameful about my own relative
middle class American wealth.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.180
But I felt bad enough that
I whipped out my own money

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.721
and gave whenever I could,
even as a kid and a teenager,

00:13:36.721 --> 00:13:37.220
whatever.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.410
And I called the 1-800
number and sponsored kids,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.127
and I hear that there
is a Christina Aguilera

00:13:43.127 --> 00:13:44.210
version of this right now.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.760
I should totally probably
update this, but in my day,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.320
this was Sally
Struthers all the way.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.710
I saw a lot of Sally growing up.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.670
So I responded, but mostly, if
I'm really honest with myself,

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.360
I did so in a very
transactional way.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.920
I did so because
I was feeling bad,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.930
I was feeling like crap
about my own lack of ability

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.290
to ever solve these problems,
no matter how much I did.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.290
And this yearning that I had
had a little kid to really

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.920
be meaningful to
someone else had

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.972
turned into this transaction,
not an interaction.

00:14:12.972 --> 00:14:14.430
A meaningful,
beautiful connection.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.340
It turned in to sort of
throw my change in the jar,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.100
temporarily feel a little
bit better about myself,

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.750
and then go on with
the rest of my life.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.590
Until the next sad
story came along.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.730
And unfortunately,
what this did was

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.890
lead to a sort of invisible
barrier being erected

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.670
between myself
and these stories,

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.440
and really, these
other people that I

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.930
had very much
otherized and very much

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:40.260
put in this category of not me.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.492
So don't worry.

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.950
This is the saddest moment,
there's a lot of serious faces.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.250
Now it gets happier, ready?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.070
So here we go.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.930
So this was at its worst, how
I interacted with the poor.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.630
Lot of air quotes today.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.730
And then, and I'm really glad
I'm not talking to a college

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.410
audience right now, because
I have to do a lot of caveats

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.460
with them and say,
hey, look, I'm

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.626
not prescribing you do this.

00:15:00.626 --> 00:15:02.600
Like, don't blame
me if you do this,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.940
but I studied philosophy and
poetry and then I, on a whim,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.995
moved out to California.

00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:09.120
I told my parents-- it was
right after graduation--

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.953
and I told them I'd be
here for a few weeks.

00:15:10.953 --> 00:15:12.440
That was 15 years ago.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.980
So I moved out and I got a temp
job at the Stanford Business

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.940
School, which it
first, by the way,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.010
I was kind of a hater
about business early on.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.380
I thought, no, I want
to be a part of things

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.580
that help people.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.120
Nonprofits seemed to be helping
people, just go with me.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.104
For-profits must be bad,
so they are the enemies

00:15:29.104 --> 00:15:30.520
and here I was,
right in the heart

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.595
of, like, enemy territory.

00:15:32.595 --> 00:15:34.220
This heart of
entrepreneurial activity,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.761
because I thought entrepreneurs
are the gang leaders of this,

00:15:36.761 --> 00:15:37.490
this is terrible.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.177
But I needed the money,
so I took this temp job

00:15:40.177 --> 00:15:42.510
at the Stanford Business
School, and it just so happened

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.301
that I had landed, not
just in the business

00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:47.960
school, god forbid, but in the
Center for Social Innovation.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.530
This amazing place
where every day,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.071
people are coming
through those doors

00:15:51.071 --> 00:15:53.282
and thinking about how
to use business skills

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:55.240
and business thinking to
solve social problems.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.310
So I realized very quickly
I was in a good place,

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.120
I had kind of found my
people, and I learned so much

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.330
over the next few years.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.460
I sat in on classes
and crashed lectures,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.600
I even, I kid you not,
went to office hours

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.620
sometimes and told professors
I was not a student.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.810
I would be later and I would
pay a pretty penny for that.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.270
At the time, I was
just a staffer,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.770
but I would go and say look,
if you have no one else to talk

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.325
to, can you, like, help me
understand the difference

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:21.450
between profit and revenue?

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.700
Which I actually never
got a hang of until later,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.120
but I get now.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.360
But I tried to be a
sponge and absorbed,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.060
sort of for free, an MBA,
and learn all that I could.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.740
Anyway, three years in to this
job, which changed and evolved.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.690
I mean, I clearly liked
it and I stuck around.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.360
There's this guy
named Doctor Muhammad

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.660
Yunus, who came to campus.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.155
And so I stayed late after
work, it was in the fall

00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:46.940
of '03, three years before he
and his Grameen Bank would win

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.580
the Nobel Peace Prize for
their work pioneering modern

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.280
microfinance.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.461
And so I stayed after
work to hear him speak,

00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:55.960
sat in the back in case it was
lame and I could leave early.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.960
And in fact, it was my
little moment of epiphany.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.460
I learned about
microfinance, right?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.569
Financial services and products
for the entrepreneurial poor.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.440
Particularly microcredit,
loans, I learned about that,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.274
and it almost seemed magical.

00:17:10.274 --> 00:17:11.940
The idea that this
little bit of capital

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.210
at the right time
in the right hands

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.210
could change somebody's
trajectory, and help

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.574
lift them and their
family out of property.

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:20.690
It sounded amazing and I had
never heard about that before.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.696
So that was one thing.

00:17:21.696 --> 00:17:23.154
Secondly, he talked
about his story

00:17:23.154 --> 00:17:24.900
in a very accessible,
approachable way.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.630
So here I was, this
legit liberal arts major,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.440
but I had no idea what
to put on my resume.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.030
I didn't know what my skills
were, I couldn't code.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.020
I've since tried,
that's another story.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.420
It's pretty hard.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.150
I don't know if that's what
I'm meant to do in the world.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.974
But so I learned
about microfinance

00:17:42.974 --> 00:17:44.640
and I learned about
this amazing man who

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.340
got his start by
basically, and I'm

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.940
paraphrasing, leaving
the halls of academia

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.640
where he had been a professor
at the University of Chittagong

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.670
in Bangladesh.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.302
He one day goes and sits with a
group of women, basket weavers,

00:17:56.302 --> 00:17:58.010
and asks them directly
why they are poor.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.720
Asks them why they think they're
stuck in a cycle of poverty.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.750
And they tell their
stories to him.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.479
And he listens and he respond
in a very common sense way.

00:18:05.479 --> 00:18:07.770
Because they tell him that
every morning, they wake up,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.860
they have nothing,
they have to go

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.735
to a local moneylender
who charges, you know,

00:18:10.735 --> 00:18:12.464
300 plus percent interest.

00:18:12.464 --> 00:18:14.130
They borrow a little
bit of money, often

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.707
just a few dollars,
buy materials

00:18:15.707 --> 00:18:17.290
that they need to
weave their baskets,

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.250
make a beautiful product,
sell it at a profit,

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.480
but they owe everything back, if
not more, to the moneylenders.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.535
It's a very easy to
understand cycle of poverty

00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:27.000
that they were trapped in.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.450
At least when I heard
that from his story.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.420
And as it goes, he
reaches into his pocket,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.200
lends a little over $20 to
that village full of women,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.150
and indeed, they're
able to repay.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.710
Not with 300% interest,
and slowly change

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.610
their lives for the better.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.080
That's what he did in
response to their stories.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.400
It seemed so common sense
and it seemed like something

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.560
maybe even a philosophy
major could do.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.760
Go, sit, be a really
good listener,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.100
and maybe, maybe, maybe
hear something new,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.570
and respond in a common
sense way to help somebody.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.780
So one, microfinance.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.650
Two, maybe I could go listen to
people and do something good.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.500
And three, he talked
about the poor in a way

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.110
that I hadn't heard, at
least in recent memory.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.250
He talked about people
who are smart, and strong,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.130
and hardworking, and very
intelligent, even if they might

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.670
be unschooled, and
who just needed access

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.220
to this little
thing, a small loan,

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.530
to be able to do great things.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.890
It totally changed my paradigm.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.110
I mean, having spent a few
years in Silicon Valley

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.000
by that point, I
mean, I figured out

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.240
that an entrepreneur was a
pretty great thing to be.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.025
So suddenly, to tell me that
the poor could be entrepreneurs

00:19:30.025 --> 00:19:31.530
flipped everything on it's head.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.062
And I was so inspired,
in fact, this

00:19:33.062 --> 00:19:35.020
is another place where
I tell college students,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.853
like, don't do this or
don't blame it on me.

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:39.470
But I quit my job at Stanford
and I moved to East Africa,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.570
and begged my way into a
basically unpaid internship,

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.320
as I described, with
Village Enterprise.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.570
And they allowed me to have
this amazing opportunity

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.040
for three months
to go, by myself,

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.540
trump around Uganda,
and Kenya, and Tanzania

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.080
and interview entrepreneurs and
ask them about their stories.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.970
And ask them how this $100
had changed their lives.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.840
So that's what it did,
And it was the best.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.670
It was so fun.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.750
Not only did I learn
a lot about business,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.100
I did finally, thanks to
goat herders, et cetera,

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.350
learn about the difference
between profit and revenue.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.490
That's a lot of why I wrote the
book, because I feel like they

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.609
really taught me business.

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:15.650
Business school did, too.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.850
I mean, Standford
GSB is a great place.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.400
I recommend it, et cetera.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.780
But in all seriousness,
I mean, I so frequently

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.620
thought back to my
conversations with entrepreneurs

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.570
when I would learn a big,
fancy theory in class

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.720
and say, oh, right.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.042
That was that thing that
fishmonger did, or oh,

00:20:33.042 --> 00:20:33.750
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.030
I remember, this is the way
the farmer did whatever.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.760
Those are my real life examples.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.970
Those were businesses
that I could understand.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.770
That are started with $100.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.840
It was a really nice
place to start for me.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.790
Anyway, so not only did
I learn a little bit

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.630
about entrepreneurship
and business,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.760
but I had this new experience
that really changed

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.060
the way I felt and
the way I thought

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.940
and it opened my heart up
to different possibilities.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.426
I heard a new narrative
about poverty and potential.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.800
And I met people
who were smiling

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.022
and actually happy with
their lives and the work

00:21:05.022 --> 00:21:06.980
that they were doing,
even though it was tough.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.080
I met people who already
had made great progress.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.829
Maybe had started with
a needle and thread

00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:13.420
under the shade of a tree,
and now had capital equipment

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.800
and an office.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.220
I met people who
just, I happened

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.540
to encounter in a scene of
abundance versus carefully

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.410
crafted picture on a, you
know, marketing brochure

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.484
for a nonprofit, of scarcity.

00:21:23.484 --> 00:21:24.650
And that changed how I fell.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.870
I met people who had full hands
with something to offer me,

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.500
not empty ones
asking for a handout,

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.240
as I had sort of maybe expected,
given all I'd heard before.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.340
It changed how I felt.
It change how I thought.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.912
And along with my
co-founder Matt,

00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:39.495
he was back in San Francisco and
I would call him and tell him

00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:41.203
all about the awesome
goatherder that I'd

00:21:41.203 --> 00:21:43.140
met, or the seamstress,
or whoever it was.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.410
And we thought two things.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.200
One, wouldn't it be fun
to tell this new story

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.720
about these individuals
living in sub-Saharan Africa

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.140
that I hadn't heard
before, and we

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.348
didn't think a lot of other
people had heard, either.

00:21:53.348 --> 00:21:55.020
Stories of entrepreneurship.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.389
And two, instead of
just holding out the jar

00:21:57.389 --> 00:21:58.930
and having people
throw change in it,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:01.230
wouldn't it be great to engage
individuals in a new way

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.080
and allow them to
respond differently, too.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.580
Maybe with a lone,
since, for the record,

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.580
nobody had asked me for
a donation or a handout.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.500
Nobody.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.790
People had asked for loans.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.860
They wanted to build
something on their own,

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.710
repay, and have
ownership and autonomy.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:17.110
So with those two
what-if questions.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.862
In the spring of '05, we put
seven entrepreneur's pictures,

00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:22.570
much like Sophia.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.540
Although she came later, but
here's Sophia there and here.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.320
We put seven
entrepreneurs from Uganda

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.650
on to this little, basic,
scrappy website. thekiva.org.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.925
They needed about a total
of $3,000 in loan needs.

00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:36.800
We still don't know for
sure if it was legal.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.075
We had cold called the SCC and
hadn't gotten totally clear

00:22:39.075 --> 00:22:40.020
answers at that time.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.500
But we thought, surely
they won't come to our door

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.140
and arrest us, we'll just try.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.407
So we spammed friends
and family, said

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.240
our seven friends in
Uganda need some money,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.082
do you want to help?

00:22:50.082 --> 00:22:51.290
Overnight, the money came in.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.579
Now, to be very
clear, this was like,

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:55.870
cash from my grandma and a
check from my mom, and like,

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.536
we didn't have online
processing at all.

00:22:57.536 --> 00:22:59.670
It was just pictures
and stories.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.290
We had our personal
bank account.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.990
Wired it to another friend in
Uganda's personal bank account,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.690
and it was not an
illustrious, fancy beginning.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.110
It was very, very scrappy.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.590
But it was enough
to start, so we did.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.737
Over the next six months, by the
fall of '05, where I had just

00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:15.320
started business
school and was, like,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.840
drowning in accounting and
trying to pass my classes.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.370
The entrepreneurs were paid
and we said, look, we did it,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:21.870
we're real.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.245
Kiva is a real
thing, we're going

00:23:23.245 --> 00:23:25.852
to take the word beta off of
the site, and launch for real.

00:23:25.852 --> 00:23:28.060
Which meant nothing, except
our friend writing, like,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.510
a press release that we put
on our own site and that's it.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.809
That was a launch.

00:23:32.809 --> 00:23:35.100
We called our friend in
Uganda, put another dozen or so

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.320
businesses on the
website, and just

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.920
spammed our friends
and family again.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.390
And we told them they
could spread the word, too.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.585
So the first few weeks,
things were moving along,

00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:46.140
you know, rather quickly for us.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.210
I mean the loans got filled
and time was passing.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.190
But then, in November, a month
after we had taken that beta

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.719
off of the site,
300 blogs suddenly

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.260
wrote about Kiva, including two
of the three most widely read

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.890
at the time.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.131
Daily Kos and Boing
Boing wrote about it.

00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:02.130
And suddenly, the site
was slammed with traffic,

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.570
and it just kicked off this
crazy gear were somehow,

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.610
in that first year, October '05
to '06, we facilitated about

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.750
$500,000 in loans.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.110
The next year, the total
went up to $15 million,

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.359
the next year $40 million,
the next year $100 million.

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:15.220
Today, Kiva is about
to cross $750 million

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.730
in loans in these little
$25 bits for people

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:18.670
all over the planet.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.960
So it's been a crazy
thing to get to watch.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.510
And it's not just
loans in East Africa

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.820
and it's not just
individuals, although, here's

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.550
an example there, it's also
people in my own hometown.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.000
Any Pittsburghers in here?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.160
Just got to check.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.370
Go Steelers, right?

00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:37.050
So Kiva works
throughout the world.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.660
I'm happy to go more into
detail on Kiva if you'd like.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.260
Loans are not always just used
for business activities, too.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.360
They're used for other things.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.776
Sometimes housing, sometimes
it's their consumption loans,

00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:49.330
but investing, or lending money
to entrepreneurs on the site

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.934
is still what the core
of Kiva is all about,

00:24:51.934 --> 00:24:53.600
and it's been really
a wonderful and fun

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.014
experience to watch it grow.

00:24:55.014 --> 00:24:56.430
So that's just one
thing that I've

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.450
had the honor of
being involved with.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.334
I left Kiva, I started another
company a few years ago.

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.750
I worked for a venture fund
called the Collaborative Fund.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.520
Really fun that the fund
invests at the seed stage

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.350
in sharing economy
type companies.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.060
Could talk about that more
if you'd like, but here's

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.020
what I kind of want to end on.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.797
So my definition of poverty
has kind of changed over time.

00:25:17.797 --> 00:25:19.630
I still very much believe
that at its heart,

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.010
it's really about lack of access
to basic things, basic needs.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:28.710
Food, clothing, shelter, basic
health care, information.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.440
I think it's about
a lack of access

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.185
to opportunity and lack of basic
freedoms, lack of capability.

00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:36.820
But here's the thing.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.790
Day to day in my
life now, I encounter

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.510
a lot of other kinds of needs,
too, that are often invisible.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.070
And often, the things
that are the greatest

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.960
need in communities
like this where

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.490
we're all quite privileged
and quite blessed with all

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.640
that we have.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.650
And I find that just as sad.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.020
I meet people all the time
who might be very wealthy

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.630
materially, but are poor
creatively, or emotionally,

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.432
or spiritually, and
they feel stuck,

00:26:03.432 --> 00:26:05.890
even though they have everything
they need to move forward.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.800
They feel trapped even
though they're free

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.480
and I think that's tragic
in its own way I think

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.790
the main problem is that
they, like many others all

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.320
around the world, have
forgotten, just temporarily

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.120
hopefully, that they can
imagine and then pursue

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.190
a different future for
themselves, whatever

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.400
that looks like.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.330
So I would just like
to remind us today,

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.354
please don't believe
the wrong stories.

00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:29.770
The ones that are
incomplete, just

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.202
telling one side of things.

00:26:31.202 --> 00:26:33.785
Don't believe the wrong stories,
especially about other people

00:26:33.785 --> 00:26:35.840
and about what's possible
in the world for them.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.400
And don't believe the
stories that tell you,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.310
you can only respond
in one particular way.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.540
That you're only needed
for this one thing

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.790
you might have, whether
it's financial contributions

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:47.452
or something else.

00:26:47.452 --> 00:26:49.160
I want you to practice,
I hope we can all

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.360
practice imagining a
new and a better future.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.830
One that reminds us that
more is always possible.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.910
I ask this for very
selfish reasons.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.010
I want my kids, I know
it's totally cheating

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.010
to end on a kid picture.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.968
And one of them is here,
the other two are not,

00:27:03.968 --> 00:27:06.130
because that would have
been a little crazy.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.740
I wanted to stories that
my kids hear, and believe,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.390
and internalized to be ones that
convince them of the reality

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.170
that opportunity is
everywhere, sometimes

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.669
even in the ground
beneath our feet.

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:18.560
And that human
potential is everywhere

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.540
around the world, even,
and especially, inside

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.220
each one of us.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.830
So thank you very much.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.788
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:32.274 --> 00:27:33.690
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.090
JESSICA JACKLEY: Thank you.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.590
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That was amazing.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.970
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Thank you very much.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is probably
one of the only Tech Talks

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.010
I've been to where it was
stay in the room room only.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:39.350
So--

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.700
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Oh, that's so nice

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: --you
should be very honored

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.060
and I'm really thankful
for all the Googlers

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.302
that took their time
to come listen to you.

00:27:45.302 --> 00:27:46.760
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Thank you so much.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: So how long
did you work on the book?

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:48.690
How long--

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.080
JESSICA JACKLEY: Oh my God.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: --did it
take you to get through it?

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.910
What was sort of the hardest
part about putting all of this

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:53.450
into words?

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.930
JESSICA JACKLEY: Well,
so you might see him now,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.120
walking around with the baby,
but my husband is, like,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.760
the real author of the--
and I'm saying this,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.220
not him-- he is a legit author.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.727
He has like half
a dozen books out,

00:28:01.727 --> 00:28:03.560
and I am the entrepreneur
that wrote a book.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.410
So what was really
difficult was thinking

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.160
it would be easier
than it was, because he

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.640
makes it look very easy.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.356
It took me several
years, and I'm just

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:13.704
going to be super honest.

00:28:13.704 --> 00:28:15.620
This might not be good
for-- sorry about this,

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.860
I don't want to end up
coughing like-- excuse me.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.330
Don't quote me on this.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.200
Can I say that?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:31.740
But as much as I am, and I am
totally and completely, like,

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.740
women can do it
all, working moms.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.740
For me, I had moments where my
brain did not work quite right,

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.080
after the twins especially.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.220
And so I definitely had to
just be gentle on myself

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.440
and stop writing some
days, because I couldn't

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.170
think of the word for that thing
that you sit on, like chair.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.760
I mean, I literally
lost very basic words.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.100
And I tried to
Google why that was,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.529
and unfortunately I think
I'm very bad at searching.

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:57.320
If anyone can give me
give me some lessons,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.236
I'm not even joking, I
would be very grateful.

00:28:59.236 --> 00:29:02.110
Because all I found was that it
was, like, right after birth,

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.000
the mother's brain
grows, and I think

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.515
it grows, like, it's
like an animal brain

00:29:06.515 --> 00:29:10.140
though, not like the author
writing sentences brain.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.050
So anyway, it took me like
four years of back and forth,

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.925
and I turned in one
manuscript that was fine,

00:29:14.925 --> 00:29:16.970
but then I was like, can
I actually change that?

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.270
And then took another year.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.390
Took me a long time.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.370
That's my answer.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:23.109
Thank you for asking.

00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:25.400
AUDIENCE: What advice would
you give for someone that's

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.560
interested in social change?

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.640
JESSICA JACKLEY:
That's a nice question.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.714
I would say, get
specific and personal

00:29:34.714 --> 00:29:35.880
about who you want to serve.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.810
That's, for me, I think the
best question to start with.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.280
There are lots of objectively
good things to the world.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.370
There's a lot of needs.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.850
You can, I think, go crazy
if you try to just make it

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.020
about, where will I make the
most impact in a general way,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:49.520
right?

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.490
Like where will my
dollar do us good?

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.920
Definitely research that
stuff and figure it out,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.190
but go with your heart.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.731
Go with what you're
passionate about,

00:29:56.731 --> 00:30:00.320
and then get close to the
people you want to serve, ASAP.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.940
Right away.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.120
Early in your career if
you can, but at any time,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.320
just make a point to get
out of your comfort zone

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.486
and go spend time with the
people you want to serve.

00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:13.180
One of my favorite books is Paul
Polak's book, "Out of Poverty,"

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.140
and he basically says--
I'll just paraphrase him--

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.250
he basically says, like
in the first few chapters.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.250
Look, don't even try to go help
people far away if you haven't

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.940
spent major time with them,
because you'll probably

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.390
screw it up.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.800
He's not that harsh
about it, but it's

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.030
kind of what he's anything.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.500
And there are lots of,
probably as you know,

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.600
stories of people
with great big heart

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.940
and great intentions that just
missed the mark because they

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.144
think they have a great
idea of how to help,

00:30:36.144 --> 00:30:38.810
but it actually doesn't map with
what people need on the ground.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.570
So get there, get
close, get personal,

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.057
and be a really good listener.

00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:45.640
AUDIENCE: You talked about how
Kiva kind of was such a success

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.270
and grew, and grew,
and grew, but I'm

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.590
sure you faced some
challenges along the way.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.470
And I'd love to here kind of
what some of those challenges

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.970
were.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.761
JESSICA JACKLEY: How
much time do you have?

00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:55.750
Yes.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.130
AUDIENCE: But also, what
motivated you to keep going,

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.546
and, you know, how you were able
to overcome those challenges.

00:31:01.546 --> 00:31:03.170
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Really great question.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.170
So I'll start with
the easy stuff.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.380
The easy challenges
were more up here.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.720
Like people-- In the
very, very beginning, when

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.560
we had this idea, hey, wouldn't
it be fun to loan money

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.150
to our friends in
Uganda and beyond?

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.720
Traditional for-profit types and
socially responsible investment

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.800
folks, I mean experts.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.630
People who had
decades of experience,

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.030
push back and would say
things, like, well, why would

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.400
you think somebody would want
to do this weird 0% loan.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.680
There's no financial return.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.230
And on the other side,
nonprofit folks were like,

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.770
it's not a
tax-deductible donation.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.321
That's silly.

00:31:36.321 --> 00:31:38.820
But we thought maybe there was
going to be a market for that

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.590
anyway, and there is.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:42.124
But that was one
thing we got back,

00:31:42.124 --> 00:31:43.540
so that was one
piece of criticism

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.110
that, it's easy
to rattle off now,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.114
but it was a little
bit crazy making.

00:31:50.114 --> 00:31:52.280
I think a lot happened up
here in the very beginning

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.141
of ventures where a
lot of entrepreneurship

00:31:55.141 --> 00:31:56.140
feels like make believe.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.110
You have this vision for
the future and your kind

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.130
of imagining what
the world would

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.220
be like you can get there.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.250
And you're trying to
make make believe.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.810
You're trying to make the
thing that's in your head real.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.185
And when other people tell
you it's silly, or impossible,

00:32:07.185 --> 00:32:08.780
or won't work, it
can rattle you.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.830
So that's like the least of
the issues, of the challenges,

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.360
but it was something
to overcome.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.440
There were also other challenges
at the beginning around, which

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.940
we can all sort of giggle that
now, that around, you know,

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.730
will technology really
spread that fast?

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.900
Will you really be able to get
a picture of people in Africa?

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.350
It was kind of funny.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:32.010
And that was easier to fight and
to just prove to be incorrect.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:34.060
The harder stuff was
the emotional stuff.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.660
So that picture of me with
the turkey, 10 years ago.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.920
During that time, I lived with a
family, just for a short while,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.900
but became really close friends
with the family in Uganda,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.620
and this guy Moses was
one of our-- virtually

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.050
a co-founder with Matt
and me-- and became

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:53.930
a really good friend.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.050
And over the first year, because
we had this onslaught of demand

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.150
from would-be lenders,
I'm not to say

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.360
we created a monster because
he's a wonderful person,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.120
we definitely made
it difficult for him

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.540
and put a lot of
temptation in front of him.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.250
He was a pastor in
this small village

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.708
and it had only ever seen a
few thousand dollars at any one

00:33:11.708 --> 00:33:12.484
time, if that.

00:33:12.484 --> 00:33:14.900
And suddenly, we were, like,
pushing hundreds of thousands

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.110
at him to distribute.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.360
That's a lot of entrepreneurs.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.370
And so there was
a case of fraud,

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.460
and it was just kind
of heartbreaking to see

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.760
our friend make bad choices.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.550
But we were so green, and
so, I'll use the word naive,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.740
and had not build in the right
systems for accountability,

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.490
and transparency, and
that sort of thing.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.285
So the good part
of that was that we

00:33:37.285 --> 00:33:39.660
were able to respond with,
OK, what do we need to change?

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.785
What do we need to improve?

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.830
And over time, a lot
of great improvements,

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.710
I think, to the
product and to the site

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.350
in general have
been because we've

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:50.640
been pushed to get better, and
to refine, and to iterating.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.560
Sometimes, because something not
great happens, but other times,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.720
just because that's what you do.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.055
So I think the really important
part of your questions

00:33:59.055 --> 00:34:01.530
is, how do you get
through those times?

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.160
One, I don't think it's
ever really smart, at least

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.384
not for me, I'll speak
for me personally.

00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:08.050
I don't think it's
great to go in alone.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.133
I always had people around
me, whether it was just

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:12.000
friends or family,
or my co-founder,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.177
or the early team that
believed in the vision, too.

00:34:15.177 --> 00:34:16.010
And said no, no, no.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.300
Remember, it's real, this
is where we're going,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.310
we got to keep at it.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.050
It's just the encouragement
of people really helped.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.510
But also, I think at some
point, you just need to, like,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:27.340
make a choice to see
the good in people

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.886
and believe that it's still
there and believe that.

00:34:29.886 --> 00:34:30.469
It's so funny.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.739
I did-- it was really fun,
kind of a bucket list thing

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.850
for me-- it did a forum this
morning with Michael Krasny,

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.642
and it was an hour.

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.016
And in between
all the breaks, he

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:41.179
was like pushing me on
the goodness of people

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.100
and he thought it was
very Pollyanna about it,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.460
and we had a nice
healthy debate.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.830
I really think you look
at a lot of the sad stuff,

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.570
the bad things
that are happening

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.039
in the world and
the bad choices.

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:53.080
I'm such a parent, right?

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.827
I'm like, you made a bad choice.

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:57.759
Sorry, I'm suddenly,
like, I notice

00:34:57.759 --> 00:34:59.300
I'm using more and
more mom language.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.430
Oh my lord.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.200
Yeah.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.670
So when you see that, I really
see people who are hurting,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:08.460
who haven't been given even a
fraction of the opportunities

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.920
that I've been given.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.840
And I think their
reactions to the world

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.340
aren't always forgivable,
but are understandable.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.960
I can see where they come from.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.960
So I think you need to choose
to believe that we all start out

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.675
with great intentions and
the same common desires.

00:35:23.675 --> 00:35:26.714
And the more and more we can
provide opportunity to people,

00:35:26.714 --> 00:35:27.630
the better things get.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.660
And then the more
the good in all of us

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.935
can come out more easily.

00:35:31.935 --> 00:35:33.830
I think you just have
to make a choice.

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.538
AUDIENCE: So as you've
traveled the world

00:35:35.538 --> 00:35:37.740
and met a diverse
group of people,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.740
what is their perspective on us?

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.350
On America?

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.800
On people from America?

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.230
How does their world see us?

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.180
And a follow up
to that would be,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.030
regardless of color,
or country, village,

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.540
what is the common
theme that you've

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.582
heard from all of these folks.

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:53.082
That one thing that
you would break?

00:35:53.082 --> 00:35:56.690
JESSICA JACKLEY:
Yeah, so I guess

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.370
it's very hard to
measure a generalization.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.550
And it's probably
self-selected, but the people

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:06.800
that I have encountered have
been people that, in some way,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.716
have been connected to, I
think, good organizations

00:36:10.716 --> 00:36:11.840
that I have been a part of.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.256
So I've kind of encountered a
lot of really friendly, nice

00:36:14.256 --> 00:36:16.110
people who are very
happy, and thankful,

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.860
and excited to talk about
Americans and the US.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.100
I know that there is other
sentiment out there, too,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.970
but I've encountered
a lot of good will.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:30.104
What's, I think, also positive
and notable with the Kiva

00:36:30.104 --> 00:36:31.270
experience, in particularly.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.180
Even though a lot of lenders are
in North America, not all are.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.300
And so to be able
to talk to borrowers

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.822
about this global
community of supporters,

00:36:39.822 --> 00:36:41.280
I mean, almost all
over the planet.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.946
When you look at the
number of countries

00:36:42.946 --> 00:36:45.120
where borrowers and
lenders are, it's all over.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.300
So to be able to say there is
this global community of people

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.960
who have read your story, who
care, at least enough to chip

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.815
in $25, if not more,
who are cheering you on

00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:54.940
and think you're important.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.357
That's a really wonderful
message to be able to deliver.

00:36:57.357 --> 00:36:59.190
So I think all else
being equal, and maybe I

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.310
am being a little bit
too utopian about it,

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:05.010
but all else being
equal, to be able to have

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.810
a loan, versus a loan with
all these people behind it.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.990
I think that's a
really beautiful option

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.140
and I think that's well
received in most places.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.120
That's been my experience.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.780
What's the one sentiment
I've encountered

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.730
in all these entrepreneurs?

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:23.280
I have just been blown away
by the perseverance that

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.890
exists to make life just
a little bit better.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.640
Now sometimes it's
only relatively better.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.139
Sometimes it's in
this absolute way,

00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:32.922
but again and again, the drive
that I see in individuals

00:37:32.922 --> 00:37:34.380
to make life better
for themselves,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.070
and more often than
not, for their families,

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:42.540
it's so palpable, and it's
so powerful, it blows me way.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.000
And part of what
I'm really hopeful

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.390
comes across in the
book is that, hopefully,

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:51.680
I honor those and celebrate
those kinds of stories.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.450
People make it work, even
when it seems like it can't.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.809
And I feel so lucky that
I've gotten to see that.

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.850
AUDIENCE: I am really
interested, now that you've

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:04.760
scaled, how you vet
all of the people who

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.840
are asking for loans.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.324
And I've heard different
things about, in general,

00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:10.240
like, working with
partners in different ways.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.600
And I don't know that's
related or unrelated to this,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.730
but I'd love to understand,
kind of, that dynamic

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.320
and how it all works.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.610
JESSICA JACKLEY: Sure.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.870
So it is no longer just
me running around Uganda

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.040
with my camera, thank God.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.300
It would be super
fun, but it would not

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.440
be scalable, as they say.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:26.504
So classic Kiva, there's
two ways Kiva works today.

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:27.920
The way it's worked
traditionally,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.200
and still does for the majority
of loans, is this, as follows.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.640
So you have lenders
come to the website

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.320
that Kiva runs and there
are field partners that

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.609
actually are out there.

00:38:38.609 --> 00:38:39.650
These banks for the poor.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.820
Kind of the Grameen
Banks of the world,

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.160
but there are many
other types as well,

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.201
and a lot of kind of
nontraditional partners now,

00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:45.860
not just microfinance
institutions.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.094
Maybe NGOs that also happened
to get loans, in addition

00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:49.760
to other things.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.040
So you have lenders
that come to the site

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.522
that Kiva perpetuates,
you have field partners,

00:38:54.522 --> 00:38:55.480
and you have borrowers.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.890
There's sort of four parts.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.320
Lenders chip in their $25,
it goes through the site,

00:38:59.320 --> 00:38:59.930
Kiva doesn't touch it.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.540
It goes through the
microfinance institution,

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.180
they don't touch it.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.890
It goes into the
hands of the borrower.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.520
The borrower repays
with interest

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.820
that's fair and appropriate
and set by those by those field

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.340
partners, to make
it more general.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.209
Sometimes that could be 20%,
30%, but you have to remember,

00:39:13.209 --> 00:39:15.000
you have to compare it
to the right things,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.458
and you have to
understand what are

00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:18.090
the other alternatives, if any?

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.160
And often, it helps,
I think, to understand

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.680
the incredible amount of work
that is necessary, usually,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.610
to reach a borrower
in a very rural area.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.090
To get out there and do weeks
of training, if not months,

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.060
to collect repayment.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.457
Sometimes every week after
the loan has been dispersed.

00:39:33.457 --> 00:39:35.040
So interest rates
kind of makes sense,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.002
and Kiva only works
with ones that,

00:39:38.002 --> 00:39:39.460
at least the
organization believes,

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.920
are fair, and
appropriate, and OK.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.600
So anyway, loans are paid
with a little bit of interest,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.477
the interest is kept
by the field partner,

00:39:45.477 --> 00:39:47.810
the principal comes back
through Kiva and into the hands

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:48.518
of the borrowers.

00:39:48.518 --> 00:39:50.941
Kiva never takes
any out of that.

00:39:50.941 --> 00:39:52.690
The only thing that
can happen, so there's

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.180
a few things that can happen,
if this is interesting.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.960
So-- Oh, sorry.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.460
Lenders.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.926
I said borrowers, but
lenders, they're over here.

00:39:58.926 --> 00:40:01.550
Lenders take on default risk, as
well as currency exchange risk

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.720
in some cases, so they might
not receive all the money back,

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.261
or not at all, but
that's quite rare.

00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:07.820
Repayment rates are
almost 99% on average,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.160
so usually the money comes
back and everything's great.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.870
That's Kiva classic, OK?

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.360
So the way to answer
your first question.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.820
I think you asked two, but I'm
going to make it two anyway.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.010
And the way that the
borrowers are vetted,

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.730
it is all done on the ground
by these experts, these expert

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.010
organizations that
know their stuff,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.810
they're in the
community, they've

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.410
already existed
before Kiva usually.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.500
They have their own ways of
doing training and vetting

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.620
and all that stuff.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.770
So that's how that happens.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:36.510
Now, there's also, over
the last few years,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.690
a new way that Kiva has been
doing things called Kiva's If.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.330
And for the sake of
time, I'll explain

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.590
it super, super concisely.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:46.250
Instead of lender, Kiva,
field partner, borrower.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.860
It's lender, Kiva, trustee--
just an individual-- borrower.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.510
And it's much more direct and
it's kind of like Kiva-lite.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.530
And the trustee just vouches for
the reputation of the borrower.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.910
I think that's the way, at
least in the US, for sure,

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.590
but I think in other places, the
way things are going to move.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.232
And it's lighter, it's more
mobile, it's exciting stuff.

00:41:04.232 --> 00:41:06.190
AUDIENCE: If you're,
depending on how close you

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.210
are to the field partners,
like, how did they

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.220
vet someone to know if they
are right for a loan or not?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.992
JESSICA JACKLEY: Great, OK.

00:41:12.992 --> 00:41:14.700
You can totally
interrupt me and be like,

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.930
that's not what I asked.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:16.430
Reroute.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:17.410
AUDIENCE: Super
interesting, I promise.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.360
Thank you for saying all that.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.526
JESSICA JACKLEY: No problem.

00:41:19.526 --> 00:41:22.842
So field partners, they each
have their own set of criteria.

00:41:22.842 --> 00:41:24.300
So now, my answer
is not even going

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.340
to be satisfying,
because it's going

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.464
to be an it depends answer.

00:41:26.464 --> 00:41:28.320
But they all have their
own set of criteria.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.062
Some only serve
women, some require

00:41:31.062 --> 00:41:32.895
training before you can
even apply for loan.

00:41:32.895 --> 00:41:36.780
Some have quite long
application processes.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.790
It's all different,
but they, again, they

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.322
kind of know their communities
and know how to do that.

00:41:42.322 --> 00:41:43.280
We can talk more after.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:43.990
Is that OK?

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.350
I feel like that'll--

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:44.710
AUDIENCE: Yea, thank you.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.733
JESSICA JACKLEY: --That's
my best I can do.

00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:47.500
OK.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.510
AUDIENCE: So I just
have a question

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.750
about what sort of makes
a good story in your mind,

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.583
and how you go about
making sure that you're

00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:53.651
creating the right story.

00:41:53.651 --> 00:41:55.400
I can already see
challenges around things

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.110
like trying to make a
representative story

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.526
versus a really
inspirational one,

00:41:58.526 --> 00:42:01.051
or whose perspective
from a storyteller

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.050
is sort of being served.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:03.250
You or sort of the
actor involved.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:05.200
So I'm wondering how you
approach all those questions.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.470
JESSICA JACKLEY: Well,
so one of the things--

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.178
I want to be super
clear, because I'm not

00:42:08.178 --> 00:42:10.200
their day to day's, full
time, everyday staff.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.010
I feel like a grandma, like,
I get to be really proud

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.170
and show pictures, been I'm
doing hard work every day.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.586
So I don't want to speak for
exactly what's happening now,

00:42:16.586 --> 00:42:20.380
but I will say, at the
beginning, first early years,

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.035
we were really excited not
to have it be too polished.

00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:24.910
To just have whatever
people wanted to put up

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:26.760
there speaks for
itself, and have

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.740
kind of the opposite of this
very carefully crafted, kind

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.370
of manipulated story,
that we saw so much

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.001
from other organizations that
probably kind of gamified it,

00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:35.500
right?

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.749
Like they knew exactly what
keywords to put in to make

00:42:37.749 --> 00:42:40.310
it hit you in a particular way.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.960
So right now, what happens
is those field partners,

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.664
see your other question
there was a great setup,

00:42:45.664 --> 00:42:47.330
so now you know what
a field partner is.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.538
They have loan officers or
other representatives that

00:42:49.538 --> 00:42:51.730
are out there with
borrowers, and while they

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.210
are the ones that bring
the information back,

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:54.500
it's not like the
borrowers are typing up

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.985
their own stories at this
point, at least in Kiva classic.

00:43:00.546 --> 00:43:02.670
They might have basic
guidelines on, like, question

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.820
to ask and things like that,
but the intention, at least,

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.145
early on, was never for it
to be a super polished, hey,

00:43:08.145 --> 00:43:09.686
make sure to mention
how you're going

00:43:09.686 --> 00:43:11.510
to use the profits from
your business for education,

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:12.584
because people love that.

00:43:12.584 --> 00:43:14.500
And it's not like, oh,
that's a great picture,

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.556
but can you have
your kid in there,

00:43:15.556 --> 00:43:16.880
because people love kids?

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.340
Right?

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.820
I'm so guilty of it myself.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.830
So anyway, that's
sort of, I think,

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:27.120
the ethos-- that's the
spirit of how Kiva operates.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.340
In terms of what I personally
think makes a good story.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:36.040
I mean, I think transparency
and balancing-- I don't know,

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.330
I mean, I think
being as personal

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:46.087
and is honest about what you're
going through, as you can,

00:43:46.087 --> 00:43:47.170
is kind of all you can do.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.086
And that usually resonates
the most of people.

00:43:49.086 --> 00:43:50.730
I think people
want to be let in.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.202
In kind of the inner
circle, and to feel like

00:43:54.202 --> 00:43:56.410
they're really participating
and really a part of it.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.531
Some of the-- who asked the
challenges question back there,

00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:00.030
yeah.

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.655
So some of the more
challenging moments

00:44:01.655 --> 00:44:04.660
when we've had to talk about,
oh, sorry, your money is not

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.620
coming back, because this field
partner did something terrible.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.620
Which is few and far
between, but it's happened.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.320
I remember being
terrified, the first time,

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.820
to put that story out
there into the world,

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.670
and explain to people
what had happened.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.470
But the transparency
of it, I mean,

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.426
we didn't get an angry
email or note back.

00:44:18.426 --> 00:44:20.300
People were like, thanks
for being so honest,

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.315
this is really hard
work to do, we get it.

00:44:22.315 --> 00:44:23.940
We're going to re-lend
anyway, or we're

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:25.000
going to lend new
money, because we're not

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.310
getting our money back.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.810
But they were very supportive
and appreciated, I think,

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.510
being in the trenches with
us, and on the ground,

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.466
and hearing the honest stuff.

00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:36.438
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:36.438 --> 00:44:37.410
JESSICA JACKLEY: Yeah.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.230
Thank you all very much, and--

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.340
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.130
JESSICA JACKLEY: --I'm,
I'll stay for awhile, so.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.440
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.565
JESSICA JACKLEY: Thank you.

00:44:41.565 --> 00:44:44.100
