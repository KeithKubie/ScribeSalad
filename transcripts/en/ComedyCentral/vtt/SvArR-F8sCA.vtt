00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.671

since the last season,
isn't that crazy?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.175 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, it feels like
just yesterday,

I remember that show
like the back of my hand.

think he was gonna die

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:16.816

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.851

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.019
yeah, the weddings,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.788
- There was eggs right,
there was a dinosaur.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.256
- There was the um.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Can I be honest, I don't
remember what the ****

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.025
happened in this show.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:26.692 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't remember
anything, I've seen 'em all.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:27.961
- It's out.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.195
- And I want to catch
up but what do we do?

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.197
- Do we just start
from the beginning.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.031
- Right.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.965
- Refresh our memory.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.200
- Right it was seven seasons.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.101
- No commercials.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.935
- That's true.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.537
- It's 67 hours.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's easy.
- I've got that kind of time.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.774
- Oh yeah let's do it.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.010
(dramatic music)

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.478
- Is that Tywin or Tyrion?

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.445 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I don't ****ing know I
thought you were keeping track

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.947
of the Lannisters.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.481 align:start size:97% position:3%
How is this season one,
this is so much back story,

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:50.716 align:start size:88% position:13%
I don't even understand
what's going on.

00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:53.552 align:start size:84% position:16%
We should just treat
it like a test.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:54.554
- Right.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.388
Like we're in school.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.222
- Cram.

00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:00.293
Pop quiz, where
is the Iron Bank?

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.296
- Winterfell?

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.897
- Are you asking me?

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.066
Or are you telling
me? Seriously, I need
someone to tell me!

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.067
I don't ****ing know!

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.302
Goddamn it, what would
help is if we came up

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.670 align:start size:84% position:16%
with like a rhyme that
helped us remember

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.705
what each character
does, like Cersei.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.375
- Yes, yes, yes, like
Cersei shows no mercy.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.742
- Melisandre.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.746 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Melisandre, Melisandre,
has no dandruff.

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:22.815
I don't know why I said that.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.083
- What was that, none
of them have dandruff.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.552
- Right.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.586 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What if we did a shot
every time someone got naked.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.521
(snaps)

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.655
- Super smart.

00:01:29.655 --> 00:01:30.589
(claps)

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.658
(laughs)

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.095
- Oh ****, that's a ****.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.597
- I don't remember there
being this much nudity.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:39.432
- No.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.101
(dramatic music)

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.502
- I need a nap Paul.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.671
- Only 43 more episodes left.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.906
Alright you know what,

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.941
we need a little pick me up.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:49.776
- Okay.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.044
(clicks tongue)

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:51.911
- Check it out.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.446
(laughs)

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.548
- Man I've never done a drug
in my life I can't do coke.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.915
- Come on man

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.952 align:start size:88% position:13%
Don't you care about the

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.523
Everyone's gonna be
talking about it.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.124
There you go.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.359
Winter is coming.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.894
(snorts)

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.395
- I don't know Grandma,
maybe this time you have

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.564
to figure out how to find
your own insulin, huh?!

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:13.966
Whoa what's going on with you?

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.200
- Oh nothing my wife just
texted my kid just said

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.770

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.472
I told you this

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:23.109
You see all you have to do is
trust me, here have a drink.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:23.943
Drink up.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.249
(screams)

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.718
- Why did you say this
is your favorite episode?

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.387
- I don't know, the acting?

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.090
(yells)

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.792 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're trying to
poison me, aren't you.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.793
(shatters)

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:42.127
and what's this, hmm?

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:43.395 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's my great
grandfather's chair why?

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.630
- Maybe I want to sit in it.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.498
- You can't.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:46.999
- I will.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.401
- You won't, **** you, it's
my birthright, it's my claim!

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.103
- Wait a second wait,

00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:53.906
we only have a few hours
to go, we can do this.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.074
- You're right, so oh my god,
where did I go there, okay.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.108
- I'm sorry.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:58.577
- You know what, let's do this,

00:02:58.577 --> 00:02:59.746

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.415
(dramatic music)

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.702
(screeches)

00:03:24.102 --> 00:03:25.438
- We did it, we did it, (laughs)

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.039 align:start size:97% position:3%
I cannot believe we did it.
- I can't, wow.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.541

went by really quick.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.775
- It did actually, wow.

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:31.511 align:start size:84% position:16%

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:37.216

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.518
Binge it.
