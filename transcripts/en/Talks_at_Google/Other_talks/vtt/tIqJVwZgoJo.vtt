CHARLIE HARDING: All right,
thanks everyone for coming.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.583
I'm Charlie Harding.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:06.510
I'm a partnerships
manager at google.org.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.880
And it's my pleasure to
introduce Beverly Schwartz.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.920
Beverly is the
author of "Rippling:

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.940
How Social Entrepreneurs
Spread Innovation

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.270
Throughout the World."

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.420
And she is also
the vice president

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.200
of global marketing for
Ashoka, where she currently

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.980
leads a program and a
partnership with The MasterCard

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.340
Foundation to help fund
innovative solutions

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.650
to youth empowerment in Africa.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.274
It's really exciting to host
Bev and Ashoka at Google,

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:33.190
because we've had a
long-standing relationship

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.540
with Ashoka.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.230
Ashoka, if you don't
know, was founded in 1980,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.080
and they support about 3,000
leading social entrepreneurs

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.371
around the world and have
the mission to make everybody

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:44.840
a changemaker.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.650
Google supported Ashoka
in 2010 with a $1 million

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.380
grant to help support their
News &amp; Knowledge programs.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.815
And Googlers today can
continue to volunteer

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.175
on a part-time basis through
the GooglersGive program.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:57.300
So you can go to GooglersGive,
and you can actually

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.350
volunteer your time
to work with Ashoka.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.330
So I believe there's
a dozen programs

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.353
or so that we've helped work
on through GooglersGive.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:08.070
As a bit more background on
Bev, by discipline, Beverly

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.420
is an entrepreneurial
behavioral scientist

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.720
and has made her career in
the field of social change

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.220
marketing over
the past 30 years.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.600
She has a background in
advertising and communications

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.560
and has an extensive career
in marketing, especially

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.410
in the field of social change,
working in private, nonprofit,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.220
and public sectors on
issues from drug prevention

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.860
and smoking prevention to
gender equity and education.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.440
About the book, "Rippling"
is described as a blueprint

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.060
for visionary thinking about how
to tackle the world's biggest

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.110
social and environmental
challenges.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.310
She draws on examples
of empathy, innovation,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.630
creativity, passion,
and persistence

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.280
to make real change in the
world and pulls case studies

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.910
from Ashoka Fellows to
exemplify these characteristics.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.510
"Rippling" has won
two big awards,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.970
including the 2013 Nautilus
Award and the 2013 "Inc.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.767
Magazine"-sponsored Axiom
Business Book Award.

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.600
Thank you all for joining
us this afternoon.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.928
I would like to have you join me
in welcoming Bev to the stage.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.368
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:13.600
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: So I'll
hand-hold this right?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.804
OK, great.

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:15.470
Thanks, Charlie.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.570
I really appreciate it.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140
First, I really want to
thank you for coming,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.650
but also Kat Welch, who
is a Google volunteer that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.130
has chosen Ashoka as her
organization of choice.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.060
And she actually suggested
this and put this whole thing

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.820
together.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.560
And if anybody's
interested afterward,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.450
Radhika Shah is here.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.170
And she is starting an Ashoka
chapter in Silicon Valley

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.360
so that we sort of can
have people connected

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.179
to us right here where you live.

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.220
CHARLIE HARDING: Bev, I
forgot to plug your book.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.810
It's available outside.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.934
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:56.380
Thank you, Charlie.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.570
That was my hand.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.720
And if you're interested,
and if you are inspired,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.550
and you have one extra
second a week to read,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.740
because I know they work
you pretty hard here,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.130
the book is outside.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.510
Actually, I have to say,
I'm a little bit in awe

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.470
of being here, not because
it's a well-known place

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.710
but because you actually
live very close to the Ashoka

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.250
vision.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.080
And Charlie was kind enough
to take me on a tour today.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.750
And I realized as we
were walking around

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.770
that your culture is really
what needs to happen--

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.800
and I will expound on
that a little later--

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.870
in the rest of the world.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.600
But what I wanted
to do today was

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.350
talk about, not so much
innovation entrepreneurs,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.140
which I think you
live and breathe,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.920
but another type
of entrepreneur,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.150
which is a social entrepreneur.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.830
I also find it
interesting that, out

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.010
of all of the audiences
that I've spoken to,

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.250
you actually understand
what entrepreneurship is.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.050
And so that sort of makes
this a much easier talk.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.090
And so you actually
get it from the get go.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.660
So today I just wanted to talk
a bit about what the differences

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.984
are between a
business or, what I'm

00:04:21.984 --> 00:04:23.400
going to call
today, an innovation

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.110
entrepreneur, and a
social entrepreneur.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.630
And I want to give
you sort of the touch

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.420
and the feel and the essence.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.830
It sort of sounds like
that cotton advertisement

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.770
on TV, the touch
and feel of cotton.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.480
But I really want to give
you some concrete examples

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.720
of what they do in the
world and why what they do

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.900
is as important as it is.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.920
And then I want to
tell you a little bit

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.260
about why I wrote the book.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.400
And as Charlie said, I'm
a behavioral scientist

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.260
by discipline.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.790
And that means
that I investigate

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.220
human behavior and the
dynamics of groups.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.440
I'm rather fascinated by it.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.470
And I always want
to understand why

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.510
there are some people in this
world that can take what is

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.430
and what if and turn
it into what can be.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.090
And I try to see, well, how
do we replicate these people,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.405
how do we clone these people?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.290
You might have been able
to tell from my accent,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.930
I am from New York, born
and bred in New York City.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.760
And I'm slowing down
my speech on purpose.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.560
But remember, because
I'm from New York,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.200
I have extreme license to
mispronounce anything I want.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.060
So if I mispronounce
it, go with me.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.476
So many years ago, there was
a citizen protection group,

00:05:56.476 --> 00:06:02.540
unarmed, that started in 1978,
called the Guardian Angels.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.430
Does anybody remember what
a Guardian Angel-- Thanks,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.760
people around my age here.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.770
And I'm actually sad
that you don't know.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.410
It was a group.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.510
And they wore red
berets and red jackets.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.220
And they started to patrol the
New York City subway system,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.640
because they felt that
it was getting dangerous

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.510
and people were
unprotected there.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.660
There weren't enough police.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.800
And they decided as a citizens
group to do something about it.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.150
They have now spread to 15
countries and 144 cities

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.820
in the world.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.450
And they started in the
New York City subways.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.410
I was fascinated by
this as a young girl,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.162
because who were these people
that went out of the box?

00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:55.370
They stood out from the norm.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.950
They actually did something
about subway violence

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.280
that nobody else
was willing to do.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.710
And with that example, now you
sort of know what fascinates me

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.520
and what makes me tick.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.620
So that when I found out
about Ashoka, I thought,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.570
wow, here are people
that go out of the norm.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.580
Here are people that do
something for others.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.300
They totally change their
life from what they know,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.560
and they do something
completely different.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.670
Many times they give up a
profession, a fair amount

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.290
of money, because
there's something

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.400
that makes them
tick differently.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.420
And now you know
part of why I wrote

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.300
"Rippling" was because I
needed to analyze that.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.310
I needed to research it.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.970
I needed to understand that.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.170
So another thing about
Ashoka that you should know,

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.970
because it'll come up
later, is I describe Ashoka

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.910
as a mini MacArthur
grant to people.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.480
So we find the leading
people around the world

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.650
doing things in
social innovation.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.510
They're doing something
totally different

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.375
in a country that
ever was there before.

00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:15.875
Case in point and not in
the book, a woman in Egypt

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:18.440
who has started the home
health care business.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.390
Now, you know, no
big deal, right?

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.450
We have it here.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:26.450
But in Egypt, you don't
allow a non-related woman

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.340
into your house to
take care of you.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:36.090
So to change the whole system
of elderly care in Egypt

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.940
was a huge deal, and we felt
it was a big enough innovation

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.900
to elect her as
an Ashoka Fellow.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.630
And what we do with
an Ashoka Fellow is

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:51.310
we give them three years
of a living wage stipend

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.080
so that they can
say, wow, I don't

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.250
have to worry about
feeding my kids,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.420
I don't have to worry
about paying my house rent.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:04.410
I could actually turn my
attention to my innovation

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.590
and build my organization.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.920
So we have now 3,000,
maybe a little more,

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.660
of these people around
the world, all of which

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.970
have gone through this
three-year period of building

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.280
their organizations
and growing it.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.330
So by the time the
stipend is over,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.380
they're kind of on their
way into an established

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.110
and a sustainable
idea and organization.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.650
So what makes people tick?

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.480
Why do people stand
out from the norm?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.445
This is something that
I've looked at now--

00:09:40.445 --> 00:09:44.470
and I have interviewed
about 150 Fellows--

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.660
and came down to 18
of them in the book.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.750
And I'll explain some
of that and the criteria

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.300
for it a little bit later.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.870
But a picture like this may
not be abnormal to you--

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.900
which, by the way, you realize
that everybody in this room

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.390
is really not
normal, because you

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.660
live in a bit of an
abnormal world, not so much

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.090
as Google, not so much
in Silicon Valley,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.410
but-- because I lived here
in California for 10 years,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.470
I can say this-- you live in
one of the more progressive--

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.470
probably, let's face it,
the most progressive state

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.870
in the country.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.540
And you have a whole
different culture

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.940
and a whole different idea.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.410
I mean, even today
we were at lunch,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.370
and it took me
about five minutes

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.610
to figure out where
I put my food bowls,

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.710
in compost and here and there.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.960
I mean, it's very different.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.040
And so a picture like this
wouldn't be a big deal for you.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.190
But, do you know, I've
shown this picture before

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.260
at different speeches,
and it actually

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.240
makes people downright
uncomfortable

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.240
to be out of the norm.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.490
But that upside-down
person is exactly what

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.355
a social entrepreneur is.

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:03.390
Does anybody here
know who coined

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.270
the phrase "entrepreneur?"

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.960
OK, it was one of
our French neighbors,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.620
in 1800, Jean-Baptiste
Say, who was

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.465
a French businessmen
and economist, coined

00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:19.690
the phrase "entrepreneur."

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:27.060
And he said, it's someone who
shifts an economic resource

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:33.170
from an area of lower to higher
productivity with greater

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.650
yield.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.040
And the only difference between
an innovation entrepreneur

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.890
and a social entrepreneur is a
different resource being used

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.510
and a different
outcome on the yield.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:53.130
And 100 years later, another
economist, who, by the way,

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.875
was not French but an
Austrian-American, Joseph

00:11:55.875 --> 00:12:00.330
Schumpeter added something to
the definition which I think

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.960
is very important.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.330
He said, an entrepreneur
is the source

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.840
of creative destruction
essential to the economy.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.500
That one I like a lot, because
when you're an innovation

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.150
entrepreneur and a
social entrepreneur,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.080
you're a disrupter.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.430
And we are all disrupters.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.080
Somebody reminded me that a
lot of what you work in here

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.570
is around product
entrepreneurship

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.590
and around a service
surrounding a product.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.790
What you don't work in is
a change in human systems

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.730
development, right?

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.270
So that's the big deal
between these two ends.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.810
What we're disrupting is
human system development

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.210
for the betterment of society.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.750
But again, you've got
to disrupt in order

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.456
to recreate and rebuild.

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:00.800
So keep it in mind
that you're all

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.610
disrupters, right
here, right now.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.030
So let's have a little fun with
this and go into a brain scan.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.967
And this is a phrenology model.

00:13:08.967 --> 00:13:10.800
And I don't know if
you're familiar with it,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.390
but it shows personality
and characteristics--

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:21.440
and this is a mouthful--
of the proportion

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.350
of a person's propensities.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.550
In other words, it
looks at what proportion

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.480
do your character and
your personality have

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.560
and where they are in the brain.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.060
So I did not create this.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.770
Because frankly, I'm not good
enough to do this on a graphic

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.060
or on a PowerPoint.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.150
But I loved it when I saw it.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.717
And it has nine centers.

00:13:43.717 --> 00:13:44.550
And can you read it?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.984
Everybody can read this?

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:49.450
Look how small
the trust area is.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.534
Now this, again, is an
entrepreneur, an innovation

00:13:51.534 --> 00:13:53.325
entrepreneur and not
a social entrepreneur.

00:13:53.325 --> 00:13:55.440
There's going to be a
big difference coming up.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.495
The trust area is small, because
around product development

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:02.500
there is an issue
called competition.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.030
And you really don't want
to trust a lot of people

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.610
and tell them your idea, because
somebody will swoop right

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.710
in and create it before
you've got it on the market.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.780
Also be aware of this very
small area called patience.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.724
Does that remind you
of anybody you know?

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:19.158
AUDIENCE: Uh, huh.

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.241
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Uh, huh.

00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:22.890
And so an entrepreneur, an
innovation entrepreneur,

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.920
because of this whole
competitive bubble,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.630
also has very little patience.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.880
They need to get their idea out.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.000
They need to implement it.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.991
And there is really not a lot
of time that they want to waste,

00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:37.490
OK?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.960
But all of them, all of
the entrepreneurs I know,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.940
both social and innovation,
espouse to my favorite Marcel

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.550
Proust quote, another
Frenchman, who

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.790
said, "the real
voyage of discovery

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.020
is not in seeking
new landscapes,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.230
but it's in seeing
with new eyes."

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.140
So therefore, every
entrepreneur sees

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.090
something slightly different
that no one else has

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:14.390
seen before, and that's
called their innovation.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:19.010
But here's where we start to
diverge from an innovation

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.100
entrepreneur to a
social entrepreneur.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:27.120
Because the social entrepreneurs
come from all walks of life,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.080
really phenomenal.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.450
And they start out
someplace where they never

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.000
thought they'd end up.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.910
So in the book, I
have a truck driver.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:44.054
I have a veterinary surgeon who
now builds rickshaws in India--

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.470
here is where I
go from New York--

00:15:48.192 --> 00:15:49.066
AUDIENCE: Ergonomics.

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:51.750
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
--ergonomics, thank you,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.210
ergonomic rickshaws--
and has a whole system

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.270
around making a rickshaw
driver feel more

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.150
like a part of society,
have health insurance,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.740
have accident insurance.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.990
And if you ever have been
in a rickshaw in India,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.280
that's quite an accomplishment.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.060
But he was a veterinary surgeon.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.250
I've got a PhD
biomedical engineer.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.450
I've got another
engineer who grew up

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.240
in the jungles of the Amazon.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.370
I've got somebody so
self-labeled as a housewife.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.800
So they started here.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.915
And something happened
on their path.

00:16:30.915 --> 00:16:31.750
What happened?

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nothing.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:32.645
Just go on.

00:16:32.645 --> 00:16:33.690
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: I
didn't do it, right?

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:34.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: No.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.470
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: OK, thank you.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.460
Something happened on their
path that absolutely changed

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.480
the trajectory of their lives.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.190
OK, maybe it was this slide.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.195
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:48.280
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
So one of the things

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.920
that really separates a
social entrepreneur is

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.600
their proclivity
towards empathy,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.260
sharing and understanding
the feelings of others.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.060
And in every single person
I interviewed for the book,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.670
this was one of the
things that really hit me.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:12.099
They really felt the
pain of other people.

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.202
And I was pretty
shocked by that.

00:17:14.202 --> 00:17:16.760
That comes to play
a little bit later.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.310
So let's look about
the phrenology

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.950
of a social entrepreneur and
how it's a little different.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.589
And of course, this
one I added in.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:27.310
Look at the trust area.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.550
It grows all the way, because
social entrepreneurs actually

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.890
don't have competition in mind.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.870
And actually what they do
is they almost open source

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.680
their innovation
to actually have

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.720
it improved by other people.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.060
We do this all the time
with Ashoka Fellows.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.650
We put them together from
different disciplines

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.530
in a room to hash out ideas.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.190
And everybody loves
everybody else's ideas.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.690
And all they have to do
is try to improve them.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.080
And nobody seems to have
a problem with that.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.140
Then look at things like
the degree of empathy.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.340
And they dream about a
more equitable society.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.210
Not that innovation
entrepreneurs don't, but it's

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.670
not their primary motivation.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.400
In a social entrepreneur,
the primary motivation

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.720
comes first, the
innovation second.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.780
It's a little bit different
in an innovation entrepreneur.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.910
They think in systems change.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.610
And I'm going to demonstrate
that in a little bit.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.620
And they're willing to invest
in human capacity and value

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.490
because they do
believe that everyone

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:42.060
but everyone, no
exception, had the ability

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.590
to change their
lives for the better.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.230
So one of the
visions of Ashoka is

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.250
that everybody has the
power to be a changemaker

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.720
and that you have the
ability, with a little help,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.940
to change your lives.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.610
And if you are a
changemaker, you

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.830
are empowered to
change your life.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.910
So a little vignette
here about me.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.860
I don't think I ever
would have written

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.310
my book without having
worked at Ashoka.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.780
And at the time
I wrote the book,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.600
it was a little over six
years that I was there.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.920
Because we really walk the talk.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.172
As we talk about the rest
of the world changing,

00:19:25.172 --> 00:19:27.900
Ashoka doesn't hire
people that they

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.520
don't think are changemakers.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.230
And then you are
encouraged, in fact, it's

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.700
more than encouraged--
and I have

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.390
a feeling this is a bit like
Google-- you are expected

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.440
to make change within Ashoka.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.690
Now, this drives me a
little chaotic sometimes,

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.120
a little bazoo, because as
the global marketing director,

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.470
marketing does
have sort of rules

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.285
that we call branding and
other rules like that,

00:19:56.285 --> 00:20:00.990
that if you're an entrepreneur
at Ashoka, a changemaker,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.980
the rules don't mean
a whole lot there.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.375
You're always recreating a rule.

00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:07.170
You're always
recreating a system.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.120
But it is an actual fascinating
environment to work with.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.250
And then, I had a
publisher come to me,

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.480
had read something else
I wrote, and he said,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.040
would you like to write a book
about social entrepreneurship,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.364
because we really don't have
one in our category line?

00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:24.530
And this is a big publisher.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.260
This is Wiley, actually,
based in San Francisco.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.680
And I made up some--
I'm good at this--

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.726
I made up some
answer in my office

00:20:33.726 --> 00:20:35.350
because I didn't know
how to answer it,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.980
but I always wanted to
write a book, always.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.890
And it was in the
back of my mind.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.594
And so I said something.

00:20:42.594 --> 00:20:44.260
I said, you know, let
me think about it.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.640
I went home, and I
said, wait a second.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.020
The hardest part of publishing
a book is getting a publisher.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.400
And I just got a
publisher and a big one.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.950
So why do I not empower
myself to write a book?

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.530
And that's sort of
what a changemaker does

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.580
and the essence of it.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.460
You empower yourself
to make change.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.430
And once that happens,
change is inevitable.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.190
So I don't want to just
talk about changemakers.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.567
I want to show you a
three-minute clip about Albina

00:21:19.567 --> 00:21:25.160
Ruiz who is a Peruvian
engineer who grew up

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.940
in the jungles of the Amazon.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.740
And luckily for us, the Amazon
doesn't have a university.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:39.510
So she was forced to
move to Lima in order

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.440
to pursue her degree.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.990
And she wanted to be an
engineer really badly, really

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.650
wanted to be an engineer.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:51.520
So Albina moved to Lima
and was pretty poor,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.010
so she moved into a really
poor, dangerous area

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.216
in the slums of Lima.

00:21:56.216 --> 00:21:59.390
And she was so excited
about moving to Lima,

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.130
because it's a big city, and
she comes from the jungle,

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.840
and this is big time.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.100
And she gets there.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.070
And she is totally disappointed.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:13.290
Because all she can see
and all she could smell

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.450
is garbage, heaps
and piles of garbage

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.290
all around the slums of Lima.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.710
Because no one was
picking up the trash.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.930
Now there are reasons for this.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:27.080
But basically one of
the things that she

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.750
was told when she
asked about it was

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.560
that the poor don't
mind being dirty.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560
They don't care.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.820
But in fact, the poor
do mind being dirty,

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.120
and nobody likes to be dirty.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.160
And she decided to do
her master's thesis,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.060
her engineering degree,
around figuring out

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.490
a system of collecting
garbage in the slums.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.550
I'm making it sound
easy, but it's not.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.590
The slums are usually
the favelas in Brazil,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.340
the slums in any
country, they're normally

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.360
out of the central city,
and they're usually

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:07.950
located on hills and narrow
roads, not paved, gutted.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.360
Very hard to get
garbage trucks up there.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.960
Very hard to collect garbage.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.650
What do you do with the garbage?

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.460
At that time in Lima,
believe this or not, they

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.720
were dumping the
garbage in the rivers,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.560
because that was encouraged
and that was the only place

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.220
to dump the garbage.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.960
So she figured this out.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.650
And she started an organization
called Healthy City.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.420
And at the end of
her interview--

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.990
and by the way, this is
filmed by me on my Mac,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.950
so it's not professional-- the
videographer said, why don't we

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.480
put a little tag in this
that says filmed on location

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.160
so people will know I didn't do
it, which was the videographer,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.650
I didn't do this.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.840
But she gave me such
a fabulous answer

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.720
about what she has learned
along the way and her journey

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.080
with changemakers.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.590
If you indulge me, there's
a three-minute clip

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.830
I'd love to play for you.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.309
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:17.564
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:17.564 --> 00:24:26.710
-The big lesson for me is
we never finish to learning.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.605
I learning every day,
not in the academic

00:24:29.605 --> 00:24:33.990
only, not in the big meetings.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.000
It's incredible.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.820
I learning every
day in the landfill,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.950
in the streets, when I talk
with the waste pickers,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:50.150
when I talk with the public
worker, with the mayors

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.670
or in the market.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.610
When I met with the
women in the supermarket

00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:00.220
and I explained why she don't
need to use the plastic bag,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.515
I explain, please,
you use the basket

00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:07.860
or you use the healthy bag.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.655
Because you don't
pollution there,

00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:12.890
you don't pollution the world.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.080
And she say, oh my
goodness, I can.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.850
Yeah, but this is
your responsibility,

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.450
because we don't expecting
the mayors or the ministers

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.320
changing, you changing.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.240
Because if every time we
talk with the children,

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.990
with the women, with the men,
and say, you need changing.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:39.550
You change first and after that
you talking with other changes.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:45.580
In Ciudad Saludable,
we can use the slogan,

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:53.740
we learning from Ashoka,
everyone can change the world.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.736
This slogan we put in
our strategic plan,

00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:03.160
yeah, because it's
very important for us.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.330
We don't need to accumulate
the things, the money.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.140
We need have a good life.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.680
And I am happy with a children's
smile, with the women's smile,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:24.700
when they have a good job, when
they can improve the house,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.580
when the children go to school.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:31.270
This is the small
things is so important.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.870
This is very important.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.210
This is millions
of dollars for me,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:43.490
this smile, this good
house for the poor family.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:48.370
This is the best salary for me.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:27:01.037

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.320
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
So here is the thing

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.570
that I found that I didn't
see anywhere else-- putting

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.690
it all together--
empathy coupled

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.940
with a stickiness of the
past experience triggered

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.840
by an incident.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.120
So what do I mean by that?

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.650
So if you don't know who
the Guardian Angels were,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.520
you would not know who
Nikita Khrushchev was,

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.240
who is the premier
of Russia, would you?

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.640
OK, Willa, thank you.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.760
I happen to know Willa,
met her at a meeting

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.650
before she worked at
Google, so I know her name.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.722
So Willa knows.

00:27:35.722 --> 00:27:36.430
Thank you, Willa.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.200
I knew there was a reason
for you to be here.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.270
I had my Khrushchev moment, my
stickiness of past experience.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.540
So when I was a kid, I was
listening to the radio,

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.790
washing the dishes one night.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.695
Now, Nikita Khrushchev was
premier when John F. Kennedy

00:27:51.695 --> 00:27:54.340
was our president of
the United States.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.580
Because not everybody here
is from the United States.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.910
And there was something called
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.270
And it was really
heavy duty scary.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.350
And Nikita Khrushchev was
threatening a nuclear war.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.910
And I have to tell you,
it was a scary time.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.710
Some of us remember it,
like me, very scary.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.130
Little kid, young.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.500
And I was washing the dishes,
and I was daydreaming.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.090
And I was going to be
the American girl who

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.920
wrote a letter to
Nikita Khrushchev.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.650
And because of my
letter, he was going

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.530
to realize that nuclear war
was not going to happen,

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.840
and peace was going to
reign over the world.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.330
And that was my dream.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.160
I was a kid.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.190
I was like-- well, I'm
not going to tell you

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:44.780
how old I was-- but this
was, you know, a kid's dream.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.370
I was really empowered.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:47.190
I went to sleep.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.690
I got up the next morning.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:56.730
I did absolutely nothing about
this, absolutely nothing.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:02.440
And I think that has stayed in
my brain for a long, long time.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.010
That is a stickiness
of past experience,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.990
that when the publisher walked
into my office and asked,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.560
do you want to write a book
about social entrepreneurship,

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.000
it triggered my
incident and allowed

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.240
me to go back to my
past, to be thinking

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.900
about what was in front of
me, and to do a future action

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.750
that I don't really
think I would have done

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.460
without understanding
how sad it made me

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.620
not to have done
anything many years ago

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.350
around a social situation
that I believed deeply in.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.820
Again, a difference in
a social entrepreneur,

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.440
I'd say 90% of the
social entrepreneurs

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.290
I interviewed had a
stickiness of past experience

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:00.140
that, when something triggered
it, they couldn't turn away

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.510
and they actually turned
their entire life upside down

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:09.160
to figure out how to
solve the problem.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:15.100
So Isaac, Nigerian,
one of those people

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.760
who had a stickiness of past.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.124
And he was a security guard.

00:30:20.124 --> 00:30:21.540
I didn't even
mention that before.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.630
So he is a security guard,
college educated by the way,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.320
but a security guard, goes out
of Nigeria to go to college,

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.390
comes back to Nigeria and
becomes a security guard

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:38.040
and realizes that the whole
issue around toileting

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.220
was very different
in his country.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.850
So as a security guard
of high-end politicians

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.270
and wealthy people, he wore
a suit, drove in a suit,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.120
wore a suit, waited
outside the car in a suit.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:55.062
And he had to relieve
himself in the bushes.

00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:58.520
He is, by the way,
six foot seven.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.340
So as he said to me, it
was very upsetting to me

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.300
to have to go into the
bushes because there

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.300
was no tree or bush
big enough to hide me.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.839
And it's hard.

00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:13.630
I mean, if you have
traveled, a lot of you,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.930
to developing countries.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.400
And you know, people just
go wherever they can.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.250
There's not a lot of
running water in Lagos.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.120
In restaurants, they
don't do bathrooms.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.830
And so you go outside to relieve
yourself, and you come back in.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.010
It really bothered him.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.920
And then one day,
he was planning

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:39.750
a wedding for 10,000 people,
which I have come to know

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.540
is not unusual for a
rich person in Nigeria.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.180
Everybody is invited from
all over the country.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.239
And he said, oh my
god, what a security

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:50.280
risk this is going to be.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.090
Everybody is going
to go to the bushes

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:53.910
to relieve themselves
during the wedding.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.370
I can't control this.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.140
So he scours Nigeria
for portable toilets,

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:03.160
because he learned that when
he went outside Nigeria.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.270
15, that's all he can find, 15.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.580
This is a wedding
for 10,000 people.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.160
So it was right
then and there he

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.340
decided he was going to
bring the portable toilet

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.660
industry to Nigeria.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.150
But he didn't do it
in a normal fashion,

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.020
because then he wouldn't have
been a social entrepreneur.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.445
So he hires at-risk
youth and homeless

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:31.540
men to build the toilets.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.590
And he franchises
them to single,

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.380
head of household women.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.400
Stickiness point, his
mother was a single,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.790
head of household woman.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.030
So this whole project that
he came up with in his mind

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.890
was all about giving single,
head of household women

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.230
the ability to make a living.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:58.160
Eventually, it's 60/40 split,
60 to the women, 40 to Isaac.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.190
And he takes off 10% of every
payment on the franchise.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.510
And when he has enough
money, the woman

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.960
owns the actual toilet.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.480
And if he inculcates toileting
into the culture of Nigeria,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.980
this will be a
sustainable income

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.940
source for years and
years and years to come.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.810
So that's what I
mean by triggering

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.980
and what I call
a virtuous cycle.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.140
From inception,
all the way around,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.860
every single stage
of the innovation

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:35.840
benefits somebody's life in
a socially sustainable way.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.630
So very quickly, there are
five sections to the book.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.770
And every single
entrepreneur I've ever met,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.080
social entrepreneur,
falls into one

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.730
of these categories of work.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:52.610
And very quickly,
restructuring industry norms.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:57.640
Ursula Sladek, a German
woman-- I got really,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.000
really riled at the last time I
said she was just a housewife,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.730
and people said, how could
you do that-- labels herself

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.715
as just a housewife,
50 years old.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.520
When Chernobyl, the nuclear
power plant in Russia,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.179
exploded many years
ago, the radiation

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:27.650
wafted all through
Europe, and everybody

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.590
was told to stay indoors
for quite a while.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.250
And children shouldn't play.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.159
Because it did land on grass and
forests and trees, and people

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:39.309
were really worried about how
this affected their children.

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:42.810
Well, at 50 years old, she's
watching the kids play outside.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:47.000
And she said, I just can't
go through this again.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.650
And I am going to work towards
the end of nuclear power,

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.750
anything nuclear
power, in Germany.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:00.660
And by God, she started to
learn how to use a computer.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.530
She started an
organization which

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.780
is now the largest
supplier of solar, wind,

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.050
and water energy in Germany.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.620
She exports power to
other European countries.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.270
The people in her town-- she
comes from the Black Forest--

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.000
are all people who now
have bought into it.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.940
They're shareholders.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.580
They're owners of the company.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.080
They all have generators.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.670
The excess energy they
create gets fed back

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.210
into the large scheme of things.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.680
And she is now-- and
the news reports all

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.080
say it-- the primary
influence for Angela Merkel,

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.380
saying that by
2020, Germany will

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.400
be nondependent
on nuclear power.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.240
So that's making an
entire industry change.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.787
That is restructuring
an entire industry.

00:35:54.787 --> 00:35:56.370
Mary Gordon-- and I
think you're going

00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:00.230
to love this one-- Mary was
an educator who was really

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.200
tired of seeing kids
bullied in school.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.285
Now you know this is a huge
problem, not only in the United

00:36:06.285 --> 00:36:07.960
States but in a lot of places.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.530
And she didn't know
what to do about it.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.570
So she came up with
an amazing project.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:18.890
And basically it's around
making emotional literacy

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.670
a part of school curriculum.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.480
And what Mary does,
which is a blow away,

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.990
is she has a nine-month
program where

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:31.300
she brings a small child
and the mother into class.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.100
And through the
child, the kids start

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.850
understanding the
behavior of a child.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.120
So they thought, why
does the baby cry?

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.160
What do you think the baby's
feeling when it smiles?

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.010
What do you think
the baby wants?

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.430
And the kids start
talking about the feelings

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.320
of the baby, a very
neutral, safe space.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.880
And all of a sudden, it opens
up the whole discussion around,

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.040
and so how do you think
your neighbor feels

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.760
when you steal his hat?

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.330
How do you think Sarah feels
when you pull her hair?

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:14.030
And even the most sort of tough
kids, when they hold the baby,

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.170
they soften.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.540
And there's a whole another
part of them that comes out.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.510
And this is what she uses in
her emotional literacy class

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.980
to get kids to understand
the effects of bullying

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.230
and aggression.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.560
And by the way, this
has spread like wildfire

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.860
throughout schools in not
only the United States

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.480
but in quite a few
countries around the world.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.980
And very quickly, advancing
full citizenship, which

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.050
is a lot about taking
people who are differently

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.540
abled-- and notice, I am
not using the word disabled,

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.920
I am using the word differently
abled-- because everybody's

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.160
got a skill, and
everybody's got something

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.700
that they can do that makes
them special and unique.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.120
So Thorkil Sonne,
Danish, had a son,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.460
at three diagnosed with autism.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:10.900
And he said, what
will happen to my son

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.930
when my wife and I
are no longer here?

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.230
How will he take
care of himself?

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.210
How will he earn a living?

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.420
He was, very close to your
heart, a software engineer.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.970
And he realized that the
skills of an autistic child

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.380
are focus, persistence,
and actually,

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.110
in a lot of ways, patience.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:41.010
So he said, why can't I
trained people with autism

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.840
to be software checkers, right?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.555
It takes a lot of focus.

00:38:45.555 --> 00:38:48.040
It takes a lot of persistence.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.660
So he set up a program.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.430
And he uses LEGO, by the way,
to train them on how things work

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.470
and patience and
frustration and all of that.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:59.820
And IBM's probably one
of his biggest clients.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:05.930
And they set up a little bit
different sort of scenario.

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.300
Because what he said to
me is, people with autism

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.080
don't like open space.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.850
That's very threatening to them.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.550
So the client makes
some adjustments.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.710
He trains the
people with autism.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.900
And they go to work as
consultants, have a job.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.880
And one of the IBM
managers has actually

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.510
said that they actually
make better employees.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.250
They show up on time.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.930
They're always there.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.210
They never take breaks.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:33.950
They just keep on working.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.430
And they're wonderful employees.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.580
So he has developed an
employment agency for people

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.191
with autism.

00:39:41.191 --> 00:39:42.190
And it's pretty awesome.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:47.290
And he just opened his
first non-Danish office,

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.650
and it's in Delaware.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.220
So he's now come into
the United States.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:58.880
And the last one is using market
forces for social business.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.540
That's Albina.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.520
And by the way, as
an engineer, this

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.000
is the three-legged
trash pickup that

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.920
goes up the curvy, small,
narrow hills to the slums

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.440
and picks up the trash.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.880
It's a social enterprise.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.010
It's a business.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.780
It's fee for service.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.100
And now the
municipalities pay her

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.210
to recycle and pick up trash.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:25.040
So she creates millions of
jobs, helps the environment,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.860
helps the sanitation and health
of people who no longer have

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.450
to be trash pickers with their
kids, cleans up the smells,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.710
cleans up the bugs.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.710
It's an amazing
enterprise, and it

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:40.310
uses market forces to
change social business.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:46.260
And the last one on
this is Greg Van Kirk.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:52.920
And he takes a market which
is known as consignment.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.710
Everybody here knows
what consignment is.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.010
You know, people sell
things on consignment.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.940
You give them something,
and they sell it.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.280
Well, the way it goes
in the developing world

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.630
is that people buy a product,
and they go out and sell it.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.680
But what happens if they can't
afford to buy the first tranche

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.900
product, right?

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.400
Nothing.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.780
They can't do it.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:19.220
So he has an organization that
does micro reverse microcredit,

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.530
which means he buys the
first tranche product, which

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.580
are reading glasses, things
that are helpful, solar lights,

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.820
and he sends people--
changemakers-- up

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.530
to the rural communities--
started in Guatemala,

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.440
now it's all over Latin
America-- and they sell this.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.410
And when they make the
money on the products,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.020
they take a little
bit of amount.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.850
They pay him back-- and
then they have enough money

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.370
to buy another tranche--
until they pay him back

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.830
for the first tranche products.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.690
So by taking an industry
norm and twisting

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.000
it to make it
innovative and to make

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.080
it implementable in
the developing world,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:07.390
he creates a whole new market
based on a reverse model.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.480
So last one, and only
because he's local,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.170
he's in the East
Bay, it's Paul Rice.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.711
Now, has anybody here
heard of fair trade?

00:42:16.711 --> 00:42:17.210
I know.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.030
It's not Nikita
Khrushchev, guys.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.120
You're in California.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.830
Everybody has heard
of fair trade.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:26.290
Paul is the person who brought
fair trade to the United States

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.980
from Nicaragua,
where he was working

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.640
with the Nicaraguan farmers.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.830
So of interest is
his stickiness,

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.110
what I found out at the
end of the interview, was

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:40.210
he grew up on a
farm in the Midwest,

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.220
and his mother was a
single, head of household.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.810
And so he went, after
college, to work,

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.080
when there was a
rebellion in Nicaragua,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.180
and he was all liberal and
was going to help the farmers

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.030
and help the people
of Nicaragua,

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.730
and he ended up helping the
Nicaraguan coffee farmers.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.744
And he realized how to bring
that model to Nicaragua

00:43:02.744 --> 00:43:04.660
and then how to bring
it to the United States.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.040
So every time you walk into
Whole Foods or Trader Joe's

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.370
and you see fair trade.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.490
And even lately-- and
we helped him with this

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:18.290
a few years ago with
Starbucks-- he bucked Starbucks.

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.100
And he went
head-to-head with why

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.240
they weren't serving
fair trade coffee.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:27.690
And to this day, what do you
see when you go to Starbucks?

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.330
You see fair trade coffee now.

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:34.390
So these are the kind of people
that inspire me every day.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.050
And what does the
future look like

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.240
of social entrepreneurship?

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:43.730
Well, it's apparent that for
social disruption to continue,

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.600
social entrepreneurs need to
be able to attract and retain

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.460
changemakers, right?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:54.310
And we have to have a whole
different social architecture

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.840
in our minds that work towards
this vision of in everyone

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.100
a changemaker world.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.590
We really have to take a
lot of the stuff that's

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.600
happening at Google
and turn it outwards

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.000
and help other corporations.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.333
And this isn't only individuals.

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:09.920
There are changemaker
corporations, as well.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.770
So right now I'm
working with one

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.620
that is giving me
intense joy, because they

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.770
are looking at
every single system.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.560
And they are a big player
in the pharmaceutical field.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.040
They are looking at every
single internal system

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.570
and seeing how they could
dismantle it and rebuild

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:34.400
it to create employees who
think in innovative ways

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.540
and are creative enough.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.020
And their goal-- a couple
of them, one of which is I'm

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.750
working with them in Africa,
as well-- but one of them

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.420
is that this is going to be
their key to staying ahead

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.026
of the competition, right?

00:44:49.026 --> 00:44:52.960
So they are what we call
changemaker corporations.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:59.127
And I want to leave
you with a statement.

00:44:59.127 --> 00:45:01.460
Remember, I mentioned somebody
was a truck driver turned

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.600
social entrepreneur?

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.270
Well, he's French,
and he works in Calais

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:08.950
on the northern part of France.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.780
And I spent a day with him.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.440
And at the end of
the interview, he

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.120
said to me that really
made my heart beat faster.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.990
And I want to share it with you.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:26.950
And he said to me, when we
invest in human behavior,

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:33.110
in human value, in human
capacity, there are no taxes.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.020
We invest.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.920
We don't have to pay a tax.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.450
And we are always richer
no matter what happens.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:44.480
He said, when you
speak from your soul,

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:50.260
it's a universal language
that everyone can understand

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.310
and everybody could commit to.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:58.620
So my wish for today is that
when you read "Rippling"

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.840
and you close the
book, you're inspired

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.956
the way I am speaking
to Francois and to all

00:46:04.956 --> 00:46:06.650
of the other social
entrepreneurs.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.830
And this is the joy that I
get from working at Ashoka.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.120
Because I get surrounded
by these people every day.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.450
And they inspire me.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.740
So I hope you'll be
inspired, as well.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.296
So thank you.

00:46:18.296 --> 00:46:22.463
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:22.463 --> 00:46:26.790
AUDIENCE: So what's the
correlation with profitability?

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:32.711
You know, we have an
economy with basically very

00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:33.710
profit-driven companies.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.750
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Right.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:36.540
AUDIENCE: And I
think that the future

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.227
is where profit can be
aligned with social.

00:46:40.227 --> 00:46:42.060
And I'm just wondering,
for all the examples

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.010
that you gave, how competitive
are these solutions,

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:49.710
compared with other solutions
in the market that are really

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:54.660
focused on trying to make money
and to reduce costs, et cetera?

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.880
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
They're not going

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.090
to be competitive in
the respect of cornering

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:03.240
the market for a
certain service.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.430
But I have to tell you,
profit is not a dirty word

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:07.650
here at all.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:09.060
And there is correlation.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.940
Because what you
try to do is make

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.770
your innovation and your
organization sustainable.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.580
And part of the thing we always
know is that depending on donor

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:21.320
dollars isn't always the wisest
way to go, because donors

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.120
have trends that they fund.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:30.500
So Isaac, Albina, Greg,
they're all social enterprises.

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:34.030
And they have a fee for service.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.220
And they keep themselves
sustainable that way.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.730
But they'll never
be billionaires.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.670
And they won't have
the shareholders.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:47.100
And they're not working to
make money for shareholders.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.660
They're really
working to make money

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.480
for ordinary people, actually
poor people for the most part.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.180
So there's a
correlation for sure.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.070
But the correlation
is always going

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:59.180
to be a lot lower on
the profit than it

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.250
will be for a dot-com or a
profit-making organization.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.750
There's no doubt about that.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.780
You don't go into
this to be rich.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.970
You go into this for
emotional fulfillment.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.604
AUDIENCE: My question, you
mentioned that there was, like,

00:48:13.604 --> 00:48:15.770
a pattern between all of
the people you interviewed,

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:16.860
about a stickiness point.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.460
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Right.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.750
AUDIENCE: I'm curious if
you saw any patterns as sort

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.160
of like what pushed them
over the edge to take action?

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.360
Because I think probably a
lot of people in the room

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.160
share a similar empathy
and desire to do something.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.030
But what's that moment where
you really go out and do it?

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.090
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: You know,
I wish I could quantify that.

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.770
And I wish I had a
formula to tell you that.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:43.800
But what I can say is how strong
is the triggering incident,

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.140
and where our their minds?

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.520
And so Greg Van Kirk
was a corporate banker,

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.710
a really successful
corporate banker.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:51.800
And you know what he did?

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.490
He quit, and he went
to the Peace Corps.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:57.350
And that's kind of his pathway.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.100
And that's how he
understood what

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.310
was needed in the rural
communities in Guatemala.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:05.320
I can't quantify that.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.700
But I can say if the stickiness
is as strong as the triggering

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:15.300
incident, it flips a switch.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.540
And if I knew what
that switch was,

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.211
we'd be having a
very different talk.

00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:24.754
AUDIENCE: Can you tell
more about what are some

00:49:24.754 --> 00:49:26.170
of the efforts
that you have right

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:29.250
now to expand the
reach of Ashoka?

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.610
I mean, do you need more money?

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:32.910
I mean, how is the funding?

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:36.830
Because you do pay the stipends
to all of the entrepreneurs.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.830
So I was just wondering if
money is the question that

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:43.060
is going to help you reach
more of those entrepreneurs,

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:44.819
or what are some
of the alternatives

00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:45.860
that you're working with?

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.730
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
Well, obviously,

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.080
I cannot say no to money.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.830
But that's obvious.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:57.490
In fact, Google has been
generous in some ways.

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.840
It's very funny, a
lot of people that

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.600
really have an
affinity for Ashoka

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.500
are technology entrepreneurs.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.590
But that's part of it.

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:09.080
But it's something like
Radhika is doing now.

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:14.150
She has gotten totally
immersed in the Ashoka culture

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:15.540
and got excited about it.

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:19.240
And she said, can I start a
chapter in Silicon Valley?

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.340
And part of that is to
get people understanding

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.500
the changemaker
mentality set-- you know,

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.320
I have to be honest--
as well as funding.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.554
So yes, every use
social entrepreneur

00:50:31.554 --> 00:50:32.970
takes a certain
amount of funding.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.110
And it's funny.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:36.260
We're just opening
an office in Greece.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.380
In fact, as we speak, our
staff person is moving there.

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.390
And we only open an office when
we have three years of funding

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:48.500
in the bank, because we fund
three years of stipends.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.450
And we just got it.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.200
And Greece, of course, now
is very interesting to us,

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.070
what's going on
economically there.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:59.300
It's a hot bed to
look for innovations

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.330
that impact the economy
in a social way.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.020
So am I leaving
anything out, Radhika,

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.832
that you'd like to say on this?

00:51:06.832 --> 00:51:08.290
RADHIKA SHAH: Well,
that's perfect.

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.637
But we are also looking at
people actively engaging

00:51:10.637 --> 00:51:11.720
with social entrepreneurs.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.990
So many of us here,
including myself,

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:18.260
we like to also be engaged and
be more active for the causes.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.212
And so even if you're in
that category, come chat.

00:51:21.212 --> 00:51:23.420
And we are looking at the
ways of them getting deeply

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.460
with Ashoka Fellows
doing amazing stuff based

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.300
on whichever cause
you care about,

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:30.035
with also possibly funding and
also actively engaging them.

00:51:30.035 --> 00:51:34.020
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Yeah, so
it's not only funding for us.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.770
It's like getting
involved, understanding

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:37.520
what a social entrepreneur does.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.770
I cannot tell you how exciting
it is when we elect somebody

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:42.770
as an Ashoka Fellow.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.400
And you know what they say?

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.410
Oh my god, I'm not crazy.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:47.880
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.700
Like Albina, they thought she
was crazy, first in a class.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:54.360
Why was she dealing
with garbage?

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.470
Why was she caring
about these poor people?

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:57.521
Oh, I'm not crazy.

00:51:57.521 --> 00:51:59.395
There is a field called
social entrepreneurs.

00:51:59.395 --> 00:52:03.520
We're a social entrepreneur, and
you have given us credibility.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.335
That's sort of what we're
trying to do, as well.

00:52:06.335 --> 00:52:09.095
AUDIENCE: Do you go after
funding from governments,

00:52:09.095 --> 00:52:10.970
local governments, or,
like, philanthropists?

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:13.435
Because I just wanted
to understand more.

00:52:13.435 --> 00:52:14.810
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ:
Great question.

00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:17.430
We take no money from
the government, none.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:19.555
It's one of the reasons I
was attracted to Ashoka.

00:52:19.555 --> 00:52:21.680
Shh, don't say anything.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.720
And we also don't take any money
from quasi-governmental banks,

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.610
no World Bank money,
no IDB money, nothing.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:35.160
So we are solely funded by
mostly private individuals

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.820
and corporations
and foundations.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.540
Yep.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.250
So we don't have many
strings attached.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.472
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:41.472 --> 00:52:43.030
AUDIENCE: Apart from
finding funding,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.860
as you talked about
being a disrupter,

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.490
there is an intense interest.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.800
So obviously in the product
space, we have businesses.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.750
And a lot of these
stories you tell us,

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.220
the government, things
with corruption, the Mafia,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:59.070
you know, things that could even
provide a physical or financial

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:01.880
risk to a lot of the
people, and organizations

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.540
are associated
with those people.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.220
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Probably.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.803
AUDIENCE: So how do
you deal with that

00:53:05.803 --> 00:53:07.460
from both helping
them and providing

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.780
political and business
leverage to cover?

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.855
And how do you
protect Ashoka's brand

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.730
from maybe some of the
attacks you might get?

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.855
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Yeah,
that's a fabulous question.

00:53:15.855 --> 00:53:18.890
I have to say, when we open
a new office in a place,

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.610
we look very much at
the civil society there.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.570
So we've been encouraged
in China and Russia.

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:27.712
And it's too much risk for us.

00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:29.420
And there are certain
countries in Africa

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.240
we can't go to either.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:36.060
We have a Belgian funder who
wants us to go into the Congo.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.400
And we just won't do it yet.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.500
It's too unsafe.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.620
However, the countries
we're in, it happens.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.370
We have a security
program, and it's funded.

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:47.720
And we actually take
Fellows and their families

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.050
and fly them out.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.360
It's sort of like a
new life kind of thing.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:55.072
And we recently had
to do that in Nigeria.

00:53:55.072 --> 00:53:57.280
Just a few months ago, one
of our Fellows in Pakistan

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.590
was killed.

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:02.960
Because as a disrupter,
when you disrupt government

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.600
or the system, the
culture, you're a target.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.240
So we work really
carefully with our offices.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.830
When there's a threat, and
we think there's a threat,

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:19.740
we have a fund that gets
Fellows and their families out

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.940
of the country.

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.600
And they don't return
until it's safe.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.580
It's a very, very tough problem.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.330
We worry about it.

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.230
I'm doing a workshop in Africa,
in Nairobi, in February.

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.760
And a whole day is committed.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.500
It's a security workshop
for the African Fellows.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.852
So what do you do?

00:54:37.852 --> 00:54:38.560
How do you do it?

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.100
And what we do is we
have all the Fellows

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.080
act as support to each other.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.320
So we actually have
buddies they call

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.730
if they think
they're threatened.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:51.140
And it's almost like a chain,
sort of like an electric wire,

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.590
and they rally around the
Fellow and we figure out

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.195
what to do as a group.

00:54:55.195 --> 00:54:58.055
But it is a tough problem,
because when you disrupt,

00:54:58.055 --> 00:54:59.220
you're a target.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.060
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering if we

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.620
can do something else to
empower social entrepreneurs

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.840
with new technologies or
disruptive technologies,

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.650
more or less use of the internet
cloud and things like that?

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:15.200
I think this can be of
interest to Googlers like me.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.450
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: No, no,
no, you're absolutely right.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:18.325
You know, it's funny.

00:55:18.325 --> 00:55:20.190
I just did a webinar.

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.860
And we live streamed
it from a conference.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.890
And we were trying to live
stream three people from Africa

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:26.760
in.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.070
Two out of the three had
no connectivity that day.

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.370
And we had rehearsed.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.960
And we did a dry
run the day before.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.990
And on that day,
no connectivity.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.210
So part of it is, yes,
that would be great.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.270
And part of it is no,
because the infrastructure

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:43.610
in a lot of places isn't
even close to there.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.980
But absolutely willing
to listen to any ideas.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.450
Because our Fellows
eat up the technology.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:53.200
And if we can train them
to be more efficient,

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.130
that's part of the issue
that's really helpful.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.480
So if you can think of
anything, willing to listen.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.240
We love it.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.770
I was chatting
with Charlie who is

00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:04.160
doing a big project
in Africa, as well.

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.640
And he was talking
about wireless.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.270
And I said to him,
let's talk afterward.

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:11.620
You never know where there's a
sweet spot between technology

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.810
and social
entrepreneurship in Africa.

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.730
So yes, thank you.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.210
CHARLIE HARDING: Thank you
so much, Bev, for your talk.

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:16.750
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Thank you.

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.840
This is great.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.120
Thanks, everybody.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.900
CHARLIE HARDING: And books
are available outside.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.233
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Appreciate it.

00:56:19.233 --> 00:56:19.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:20.620
BEVERLY SCHWARTZ: Great.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.220
Thank you.

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.391
Thank you.
