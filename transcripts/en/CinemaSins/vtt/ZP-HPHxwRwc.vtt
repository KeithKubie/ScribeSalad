00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.760
You know what I didnít like about Django
Unchained?

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.760
What?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.160
The 4 or 500 uses of the n-word?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160
What?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
No.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.160
Wait a minute.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.670
Are we gonna hold this movie about the slave
era to our modern political correctness standards?

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.740
What were the white people in the movie supposed
to call black people?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.740
Disappointments?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.880
Are we gonna use something innocuous so that
we donít get any historical accuracy in our

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880
ears.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.230
Well thereís a difference between historical
accuracy and overkill man.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.880
They used that word, like, three times a sentence
in that movie,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
Thatís not an exaggeration at all.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.450
You wanna talk about historical accuracy,
letís talk about Jackie Brown, letís talk

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.559
about Pulp Fiction.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.770
Okay, letís talk about ëem.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.129
Those movies are both set in the 90ís and
shot in the 90ís, the single most PC era

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.130
thatís ever existed, and the n-wordís all
over both of those movies.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.479
I mean, in Pulp Fiction Tarantino says the
word like itís a stutter.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.359
And he says it to Samuel L. Jacksonís face.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.550
That guyís gotta have titanium balls.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.670
I think people are just too sensitive about
words these days.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.949
People are too sensitive about some words
these daysÖ but the n-word, theyíre not

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.949
being too sensitive.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.970
That word is f*ckiní toxic, man.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.130
Thereís only one word more controversial
than that.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.130
Which is?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
(CENSORED)

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.940
Dude Ióyou do know this is all on camera
right.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
Like, I cannot believe you just said that.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.370
If Tarantino can say the n-word to Samuel
L. Jackson, then why canít I say the naughty

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.370
words and flaunt it?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.370
That word isnít naughty, dude, that word
is apocalyptic.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.770
Besides, Iím sure that Sam Jackson had a
conversation with--

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.700
Yeah, ìSamî Jackson, like heís youíre
buddy.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.780
Okay, Samuel L. Motherf*cking Jackson.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.201
The point is, do you think he would have done
the movie if he was offended?

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.860
He certainly wasnít offended by the paycheck.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.600
Dude, everybody worked for scale on that movie.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.001
It was made for 8 million dollars and half
of that probably went to the gimp.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.050
Oh, a gimp doesnít cost anything.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
Come on.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.440
I can have a gimp here by 5 PM, with accessories.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.740
The point is, about Django Unchained I didnít
like the scene where they were taking Django

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.140
to the mine.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.330
What was wrong with that?

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.330
Well, everything.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.350
It feels tacked on, Tarantino indulges his
acting bug again playing an Australian slave

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.350
driver.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.840
The sceneís only there, so it can pay off
the horrible things Django did.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.769
Django was the hero...

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:12.769
Was he?

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.400
Was he really?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.720
Let's remember heís coming back to save his
wife.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.021
That's a noble thing...

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:19.021
Yeah, itís noble.

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.180
But think about what he has to do to save
his wife.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.110
He transforms into this method actor, becoming
a black bounty hunter so vile he makes Uncle

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.250
Tom look like Snow White.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.100
Yeah, he had to convince Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.980
Right, but then even after he had convinced
DiCaprio and everybody else, he still lets

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.160
that other black guy get lynched, without
stopping it, even though Christoph Waltz is

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.760
there and offers to pay good money to save
the guy.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.830
And the only way that pays off is if there's
something that happens in the story later

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.820
on where he can then be vouched for by slaves
who can say, you know, heís not with us,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.820
or heís not one of us.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.450
The scene where he's being led to the mines...

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.450
Yes.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.260
You just allowed all this suffering and let
a man die a horrible death just in the event

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.740
you were being led away into a remote mineÖ
just in the event other slaves were with you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.600
that could vouch for your storyÖ and just
in the event the white people believe your

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.550
story and let you goÖ then maybe it would
pay off and you could go see your wife again.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.950
I say in the end, Django was the thing he
was pretending to be.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.240
I say Iíd like to see you say that to a group
of black people.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.290
I donít really know any black people.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.290
Thatís racist.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.700
You donít really know any black people either.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.269
Yeah, but I don't go around telling everybody
about it.
