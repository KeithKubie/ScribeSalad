00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.360
To answer your question,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.800
the dog is real

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.440
What is up, all you beautiful people!

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.200
It's Ashley here

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.460
And today's little video is based on an article called,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.700
Reading Fiction Improves Empathy

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.600
Have you ever finished a book

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.540
and then felt like a better person?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.840
Have you ever finished a book

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.800
and then felt like a more understanding person?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.440
Has a book ever made you cry?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.660
Now reading is a great hobby of mine,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.340
and every single time I finish any kind of fiction book

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.580
I always feel like I gained a new perspective on life

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500
And that's because studies have shown

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.420
that reading fiction improves empathy

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.200
What exactly is empathy?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.640
"The ability to understand someone's feelings and problems."

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900
So studies were conducted to explore this

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.140
1,000 people were split up into four groups

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.160
And these groups were

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.300
Popular fiction,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.580
Literary fiction,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.880
Nonfiction,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.360
And no reading assignment

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.480
They read excerpts

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.140
Pertaining to their groups

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.920
And after that took a test

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300
And the test was to measure their ability

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600
To understand people's thoughtsand emotions

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.200
And the results are in!

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.880
Those who were assigned to read fiction, literary, and popular,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460
Did a lot more better than

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.580
Those who read nonfiction

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.840
And had no reading assignment whatsoever

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.660
But here's a twist

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
Between the two types of fiction; literary and popular,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.780
Those who read literary

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.280
Did a little bit more better than those who read popular

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.540
And why is that?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.680
Well it could be because of the fantastical element

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.020
That is present in popular fiction

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.320
But you can also find

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.940
Some levels of it in literary fiction too

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.980
So

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.560
Why is it that those who read literary fiction are

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.400
More empathetic?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.880
That is definitely something to think about

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.740
Comment below letting me know

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.000
What kind of fiction books you guys read

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.460
And every single time you finish reading one of those books

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.780
Do you feel like you're more empathetic?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.100
And that is my time

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.400
