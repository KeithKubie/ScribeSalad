00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.500
Angry people sound like gloomy types.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.500
We certainly don't usually think of them as

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.520
optimists, and yet beneath that gruff surface,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.820
they truly are much to their cost.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.420
Here is Fred. He is often furious. He's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.490
been married to his wife Jane for 15

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.769
years. He's often told her not to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.390
interrupt him when he's reading the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.980
newspaper. She finds this prohibition

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.240
annoying for some very good reasons. So

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240
tonight she's asked quite frankly

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.900
when he'll get around to cooking dinner.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.100
Now fred is shouting because he is deep

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.880
inside so hopeful. Fred often loses

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.980
small household items. Today he has lost

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.450
his car keys.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.820
He is furious. "Where the hell have they

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
gone!" He asks his family in fury. Fred is

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.139
shouting because he is deep inside so

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.760
hopeful.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.240
Fred arrives at the airport.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.860
His flight is delayed by four hours.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.380
It's an outrage especially as he's one

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.200
of the airline's premium passengers. He

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.670
goes up to a young woman at the check-in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.000
desk and tells her exactly what he thinks.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
Fred is shouting because he is deep

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.240
inside so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.340
hopeful.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.259
Despite all the evidence Fred keeps

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.119
encountering, he stubbornly and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.340
devotedly maintains a faith in a world

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.740
in which his partner understands him,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.220
small household items don't go astray,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.540
airline schedules are more than a

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.340
fiction. All his experience stretching

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.680
back many decades has not dampened the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.679
intensity of his crazed hopes and every

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.250
time they're dashed, he screams. Fred will

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.350
never be able to remove the frustrations

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.960
of his life, but he could perhaps if

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.119
he were wise with the help of philosophy

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.780
learn to change what they mean to him. He

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.850
might learn to accept reality for the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.000
sadder thing it truly is. He might take

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.039
on board a series of dark truths about

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.759
existence; that partners never understand

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.470
one another very well, that we're

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.390
constantly losing things that matter to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.269
us, and that travel is filled with delays.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.120
more broadly he might realize that life

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.370
is outside of the odd brief sunny patch

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.319
a sequence of disappointments,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.870
misunderstandings, sorrows, griefs, and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.290
eventually catastrophes. Fred could learn

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.930
to get a lot less angry if only he

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.600
learned to stamp on all his hopes more

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.959
effectively. Most of us are in many ways

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.900
a little bit like fred, but our agitation

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.269
isn't permanent or unbudgeable.

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.980
It's only the result of the sudden

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.400
defeat of our expectations. So in order

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.130
to grow reliably calmer, we need to get a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.470
lot less optimistic about how life

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.690
might go. Pessimism is the cure for anger.
