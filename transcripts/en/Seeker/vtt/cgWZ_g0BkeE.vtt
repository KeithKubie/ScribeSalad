Imagine if every tweet, snapchat, and YouTube
comment ever made was preserved for eternity?

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:13.559
Well, we might have the technology, for better
or worse.

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.600
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today talking
some incredibly mind-bending data storage

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
technology!

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.750
The new technology comes from scientists at
the University of Southampton’s Optoelectronics

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.210
Research Centre. They developed a five dimensional
recording and retrieval process on fused quartz

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.550
using femtosecond laser writing -- meaning
a laser pulse that lasts one quadrillionth

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.550
of a second.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.960
Yeah, you heard that right: a laser is recording
data on quartz in 5 dimensions!

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.250
To break this down, let’s compare this new
technology to a CD. When data is stored on

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.190
a conventional optical media like a CD, it’s
stored by burning tiny bumps on one or more

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.810
layers of a plastic disc. This means it’s
stored as bumps using three spatial dimensions:

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.380
height, length, and width. When the data on
a CD is read, a laser light is bounced off

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.200
the disc, registering a 1 when the light bounces
off a bump and a 0 when there’s no bump.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.100
With those 1s and 0s, it can store anything
from books to music to images.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.490
But this new technology of recording data
using a femtosecond laser on a fused quartz

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.640
disc, it’s not making a bump like a CD or
a pit like a vinyl record, instead it’s

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.049
creating self-assembled nanostructures, which
are basically layers of 3D dots called nanograting.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.229
And this nanograting produces birefringence
in the quartz, bringing out optical properties

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.740
rooted in its refractive index. And the scientists
have taken advantage of this birefringence

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.799
to access two “new” optical dimensions.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.420
When data is read from a five-dimensional
quartz, the light being bounced back and read

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.850
depending on the nanograting’s orientation
is the fourth dimension. The varied strength

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.630
of the laser’s light refracted by the structure
is the fifth dimension. Add these to the traditional

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.290
three-axes of height, length, and width, you
get five dimensions. By taking advantage of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.090
multiple dimensions, each spot in the glass
can store three different bits of information.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.840
One file is written in three layers of nanostructured
dots each separated by five micrometres (one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.729
millionth of a meter), which is less than
0.0002 inches, meaning it’s incredibly densely

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.729
packed.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.250
And with so much data stored in such a tiny
way, the implications are huge. This storage

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.480
method means 360 Terabytes of data can be
stored in one small crystal. This is a crystal

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.720
with the whole of the King James Bible stored
on it.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.599
And while the information on a CD is superficial
and can be scratched off, the data stored

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.390
in quartz is safe within the structure of
the extremely resilient material. It can withstand

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.760
temperatures as high as 1,832ºF (1,000°C
) and will last virtually forever stored at

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760
room temperature.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.640
This kind of technology could change the way
we store and read data. No more worrying about

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.740
degrading a video tape or scratching a disk.
The whole of human history could really be

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.020
saved in a format that could well outlive
the human race. But how does it stack up to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.240
the human brain? Trace looks into how much
our brains can store in this episode right

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.620
