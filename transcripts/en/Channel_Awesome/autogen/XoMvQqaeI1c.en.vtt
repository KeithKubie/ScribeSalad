00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.580
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.180
Look at that joker.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.080
You know, itâ€™s hard to believe that such a handsome man could become even hansonomer.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.040
Handsemener...handso...

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.540
prettier.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.400
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. And I remembered it for 100 episodes.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.660
Wow, 100 episodes. It's hard to believe that I've done that many.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.800
And that's not including contests, fights with the Nerd, and so forth, so...

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.620
actually, that means I've done more than 100 episodes.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.640
So, what do I have planned for this unbelievably big event? I'll tell you what.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.800
A crummy ass clip show.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.080
This is where I sit back and do nothing and you watch a bunch of clips of me being wonderful.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.900
You acknowledge how fantastic I am and I go in the back and smoke a joint.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
It's a cheap cop-out, I know, but then again, I'll be high.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.300
So, you watch this clip from...uh...Captain Planet review and I'll see you in roughly 20 minutes. Bye.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020
Ma-Ti: Well, I'll tell you how I feel about the whole situation! I'm fucking pissed off!

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.880
I mean-

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.820
Hey, wait a minute. What's he doing?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.540
He's not doing anything! He's just looking at a stupid clip show!

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.600
NC: Heh?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
Ma-Ti: What the hell?! We watch 100 episodes of your shit and you just throw this clip show at us?!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.240
I mean, that sucks ass!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.080
Past NC: Yeah, the Nostalgia Critic of the p ast wouldn't do something like that!

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.840
NC: But it's my hundredth episode!

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.480
Past NC: "But it's my hundredth episode!" God, what a cop-out!

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.540
Ma-Ti: What happened to you, man?! You used to have strong, plentiful balls!

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.440
NC: No, no, I do. My balls are still very strong and extremely plentiful!

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.460
Past NC: Prove it! Do something special for your hundredth episode, something that everybody's requested but you never had the plentiful balls to do!

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.400
NC: Well, what else is there?! I mean, I've done Batman and Robin, I've done Garbage Pail Kids! Those are some of the worst films out there!

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240
Ma-Ti: No, Critic. There is one movie that you have overlooked.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.680
A sci-fi film that is so terrible, it makes my nipples tingle with fear!

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.680
NC: [Gasp]

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.600
You don't mean?!

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.320
Ma-Ti: No, not that one.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.960
NC: Oh.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.440
[Gasp]

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.480
Ma-Ti: Nope, not that one either.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.000
NC: Oh.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.420
You mean?!

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.800
Ma-Ti: YES!

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.860
BATTLEFIELD EARTH!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.160
NC: AAAAAAAAAAH!

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.200
Yes, you asked for it. Now here it is.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.860
Battlefield Earth, said to be one of the worst sci-fi films ever made.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.660
It came out in 2000, so I sort of considered it on the cusp of being nostalgic,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.940
but for the hundredth episode, I'm gonna give in and review the movie I've gotten a ton of requests for.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.000
Ever since from the beginning, I've been asked to review this movie, and now I'm finally gonna do it.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.200
It's based on the book by L. Ron Hubbard, but don't worry, I won't make any Scientology jokes because apparently, this film has nothing to do with Scientology.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.580
It has as much to do with Scientology as Halloween III does with Halloween I and II.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.380
It's just dumb sci-fi action with a dumb sci-fi story. No more, no less.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.620
Well, actually, a lot less, but let's take a look at this fuckstorm anyway.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.960
So the film begins IN THE YEAR 3000!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.260
The human race is apparently enslaved by aliens from the planet Psychlo.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.940
Psychlo. Really?

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.760
C'mon, this is sounding like second grade fanfiction.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.340
They live on the planet Psychlo,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.280
where the Evil Meanasaurus and the Nasty Badamagoo eat up all the Oompa Loompas!

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.640
It turns out they enslaved all of humanity because we have gold.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.800
That's right, gold!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.700
Nuggets!

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.420
Bullion!

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.140
Carats!

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.940
Bars!

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.800
Yosemite Sam: Gold! Gold! GOOOOOOOOLD!

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.080
So we see mankind as the weak, animalistic creature that the future will make us

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.780
. We see our main character named Johnny, as he rejoins the tribe

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.560
Woman: "I'm sorry... The Gods took your father in the night..."

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.620
(Johnny throws Air)

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.680
Wow, I didn't think it would be this short amount of time for me not to give a shit, but...there you go!

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.240
The emotional turmoil about a character I don't know mourning a character I've never seen. I'm in for a treat!

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.120
Johnny: "Maybe there are other places we could live. Places where food is more plentiful."

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.000
Bloke: "All it will take is for one of the demons to follow you back from the forbidden land."

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.080
Johnny: "Has anyone here ever seen one? A demon, a monster, a beast! YAAAAAAH! "

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.340
(Mimicking Johnny) Have you ever heard of subtlety, underplay, a good actor? YAAAAAAH!

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.680
Oh, by the way, something you'll notice very quickly about this film is that every shot is at an angle.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.960
And no, I'm not talking about, like, a dozen shots or even a couple dozen, no.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.400
I mean, 95% of the shots are slanted. Why?! I feel like the fucking movie is sinking, there's no reason for it!

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.580
Perhaps we could venture forth and find a new world to explore- WAAAAH!

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.320
Oh, on top of that, every dissolve in this movie is a curtain wipe. Again, no purpose.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.760
(Moses what the Fuck are you doing here?? go back to bible where you belong)

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.160
Look at this, I feel like Moses is parting the dissolving scene!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.240
But I digress, there's much more stupidity to be analyzed.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.820
So Johnny gets on his horse to go hunting for rocks or something, as he comes across a pair of outsiders.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.780
Guy no.1: "You from the caves? We thought you've never seen a God. Would you like to see one?"

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.880
Johnny: "what do you know about Gods?!"

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.400
Guy no.2: "We have seen gods."

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.520
They show him a bunch of marketing statues that they confuse for Gods.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.960
guy no.1: "The Gods weren't allowed to fall in love with mortal women This one did. Frozen as punishment.......

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.200
.....Look at those poor bastards, now they really, really angered the Gods."

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.400
(imitating the guy no.1) Over here, you'll see the statue of the mouse God named Mickey!

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.500
(Shooty shooty mcbang)

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.300
(imitating Johnny again) Oh, no, it's a demon, a monster, a beast! YAAAAAAH!!!

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.780
So the alien life-forms known as Psychlos come in to shoot at our heroes.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.320
Look at these lame-ass gun effects. They're more like Industrial Light and Atari.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.400
So Johnny is captured as we finally see what this advanced alien race that enslaved humanity looks like...

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.740
Jamaican Klingon clowns. I gotta admit, movie, I gave you a LOT more credit than you deserved.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.940
????: "Who is responsible for allowing this man-animal to run around unsupervised?"

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.000
And our main villain of these alien Bob Marleys is John Travolta, playing the sinister Terl.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.300
I expect nothing but a subtle performance out of a character who looks like that.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.140
Terl: (shouting): "You're out of your skull-bone if you think I'm going to write on the report....

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.080
"shot by man-animal" as the cause of death, unless I see it! "

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.580
But that would be stupid.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.380
(BANG.. rip Psychlo)

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.220
Terl: "I'll be damned."

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.640
(Whats so funny you dumb-ass, he killed your warrior!!!!!!)

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.600
(dubbing over Terl) Oh, my God, the wipe is killing us, save me, save me, aaagh!

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.020
(Is he cumming?)

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.900
Terl is accompanied by Ker, played by Forest "What the fuck am I doing here" (Whitaker).

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.520
Their job is to help mine gold on Earth, as they show one of the high rulers around their mines.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.680
Ker: "Our spy satellites recorded those images."

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.960
High Ruler: "What is this species?"

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.720
Terl: The species is called "dog".

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.180
High Ruler: Obviously the superior race, having the man-animal chauffeur it around.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.520
Oh, yes, yeah, NEVER heard that joke before! Thinking the dogs are the rulers, how original.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.700
Psychlo's understanding of other species is the equivalent of a Jerry Seinfeld stand-up.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.380
High Ruler: "I must say, you've done a very straight job here as Interim Security Chief.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.380
(Applause)

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.020
Which is why we've decided to keep you on for another tour of service."

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.080
(You son of a bitch)

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.760
Terl: "But have you looked at my files, sir? It explicitly says that this is a temporary assignment."

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.280
High Ruler: "We decided to keep you here for another 50 CYCLES!........

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.660
(Awkward silence)

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.840
......WITH ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL!"(3 Times)

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.520
(imitating the High Ruler) Oh, I'm sorry! I have this bad habit of repeating myself, (three times)

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.140
repeating my- I'm an idiot.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.200
(U WOT M8?)

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.520
Okay, now we're entering a bad NyQuil dream. Is this the film's attempt to be artsy?

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.140
Because........

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.820
it works about as well as TILTING THE CAMERA ON EVERY FUCKING SHOT!

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.820
Terl: "Please...tell the Senator, that if I had even an inkling that that was his daughter..."

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.280
High ruler: "Watch your tong!!"

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.380
(mimicking Terl) The very idea that I would go after a woman!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.820
ME

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.320
John Travol- er, I mean, Terl the alien man, yes.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.840
So we discover that Terl's responsibilities extend to harvesting gold,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.920
abusing humans and chewing the scenery.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.360
Terl: "I can assure you that I was not groomed since birth to have some cushy job.....

00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.560
While you were still learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME, I was being trained to CONQUER GALAXIES!

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.800
To do anything less is a disgrace to my entire family line."

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.540
Good Lord, Jim Carrey, William Shatner and Jerry Lewis in a Kabuki class couldn't over-act this guy!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.880
I mean...what the hell is he doing? Does he really think is good acting? It's just so over-the-top goofy.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.280
i mean, did he even think before he went on cam-

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.640
What? What was that?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.800
???: How dare you, pathetic pile of man-animal!

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.840
Terl?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.700
Terl:was just combing my nose-hairs into this beautiful moustache, when I overheard that you were disturbed...

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.120
...By my Acting!!

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.880
Well, I'm sorry you don't like my opinion, it's just that I don't think it's very goo-

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.920
Terl:No, no, no, it's not the fact that you were angry that made me uncomfortable, it's how angry you were!

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.140
What do you mean?

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.080
Terl:Well, if you want to convey your anger properly, you have to really emote!

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.780
Well, like how?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.880
Terl: Hold your arm out like this!

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.840
Terl: and say "Im REAALY ANGRY"

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.540
Im really angry (Bored)

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.000
Terl: No, no, no, no, no. I'm REEEEEAALLY ANGRY!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm reeeaally angry?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.100
Terl:No, no. REEEEEEAALLY ANGRY!

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.100
Reeeeaaaaally angry?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.540
Terl and NC: REEEEE-

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.460
(Are They retarded?)

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.820
Enough of this shit!

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.780
Terl: I'll be back--!

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.260
Meanwhile we see Johnny is put in local zoo with the other humans

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.540
Here, they fight over the pecking order of who gets to eat first.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.280
Bloke:"I eat first, then my men eat. If there's anything left, you can share it with the rest of them. "

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.200
(ROUND ONE. FIGHT!!!!!)

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.380
(top 10 Anime battles)

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.580
(FINISH HIM!)

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.240
(FATALITY!)

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.740
Johnny: "We have enough problems without killing each other over food!"

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.220
(Imitating johnny):I know I'm saying this after nearly killing someone over food, but that's beside the point!

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.540
So I guess Johnny is the new leader of the pack, as Terl discusses a plan to train...

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.240
...the man-animals to harvest gold for them.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.240
Psychlo: "Nobody works for free."

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.240
Terl:"Man-animals do."

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.060
(Fat-ass and Psychlo are Laughing)

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.680
Fat Psychlo:"I will be the laughing stock of the universe!"

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.680
Is that guy's chin a toilet seat?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.020
But Terl and Ker work out a plan to train the humans in secret and keep the gold for themselves.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:24.420
Terl:"Man is a primitive species, so we'll need something primitive for leverage, like food."

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.820
Terl:"What do you think a man-animal would like to eat?"

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.740
Ker: "There's no way of knowing that, sir."

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.220
You know, how come this advanced alien race knows nothing about humans?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.040
they don't know how we live, they don't know our language...

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.520
Yeah, that language thing is a little confusing, isn't it? Sometimes, the Psychlos speak English,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.720
but then sometimes, they don't.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.960
I guess the idea is to make it so that we don't have to read subtitles the whole time, but half the time,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.860
they have them on the screen anyway! So what's the point?! Just keep the languages separate,

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.100
we can do a little reading

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.480
And like I said, it's obvious the human animal is intelligent,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.220
we at least bothered to study other fucking animals rather than just laugh at them

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.580
and have them mine gold.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.600
So why can't this advanced alien race see that?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.700
And for that matter, why don't they cut their fucking hair? And trim their fucking nails?

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.820
And look in a fucking mirror, you oh-so-advanced alien race!

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.320
At least in a movie like Planet of the Apes, the humans were dumb, so it made sense...

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.060
...why they would treat them like animals!

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.800
Here, there's no logic! it's like Planet of the Apes without the logic!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.560
You know? Like the remake of Planet of the Apes!

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.940
This is stupid, it makes no sense! Start making sense, movie! Start...making...sense!

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.940
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.940
So they're taken to this education room, where, with just the click of a button,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.000
the language of the Psychlos is instantly put into their heads.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.380
Terl:(In Gibberish)"Do you understand me?"

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.720
Wait a minute, so you could already teach them the language? Why didn't you do that before?! I...

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.940
I don't get this

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.880
Wouldn't learning their language make them much better slaves? Because....

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.520
You can fucking talk to them! Hello?! You can fucking talk to them!

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.080
Communication!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.480
I mean, hell, if I had a device that would allow me to talk to my dog,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:14.420
I would fucking do it, because that is fucking awesome! We could learn so much! The possibilities!

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.080
What is with these morons!?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.740
They took us over!? Bullshit!

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.500
This is the stupidest alien race I've ever heard in my life!

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.480
It makes no sense! IT MAKES...NO...SENSE!!

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.600
Im this close to Cracking

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.900
So while the machines are teaching them all of this stuff, we cut back to Johnny's village.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.740
"RIIICOLLAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.940
His girlfriend is worried about him, and so, she rides off to find him.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.240
Meanwhile, Terl shows the "intelligent man-animal" the remains of human history.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:49.900
Terl: "All your soldiers and all their advanced technology could only put up a measly 9-minute fight.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.480
Everything you humans knew is here, and you can look at anything you want..."

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.100
(Mimicking Terl): Lord knows we didn't.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.880
Terl:"Because there is nothing... that will help you"

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.620
So he takes him to an open field, where I think he makes the same speech...

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.640
....to the humans that he did to the cast and crew of this movie.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.040
Terl:" If any of you get any bright ideas about escaping, just keep in mind:

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.640
I graduated top marksman in my class, and I can kill anyone of you at over a thousand paces. "

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:16.900
(Terl Killed Cow no.1)

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.480
(Terl killed Cow no.2)

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.520
(Terl killed cow no.3)

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.140
(Terl killed Cow no.4)

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.320
(Domitating!!!)

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.880
Okay, you can shoot cows, that's wonderful, McDonald's must be very proud of you

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.500
Yeah, how about the people attacking you from behind? Can you shoot them?

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.700
For an expert marksman, you sure have a hard time hitting what's right goddamn next to you, don't you?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.080
(dubbing over Terl) Please, tell them I'm an expert marksman!

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.980
Bloke:"Lets give this demon what he deserves"

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.080
It turns out these humans dressed as foxes are from the caves,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.460
but Johnny stops them before they go any further.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.900
Bloke:"Kill it! And then we'll run! "

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.460
Johnny: "Then what? What kind of life is it to run!?

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.000
(Life of Forest Gump)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.500
Johnny:"Always living in fear of being hunted?"

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.040
Old guy:"You cant defeat them"

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.660
Johnny:"Yes we can, Yes we can!"

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.560
Barrack Obama:"YES....WE.... CAN...."

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.320
Johnny: "Let it be said that we took this one chance... and FOUGHT!"

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.140
(imitating Johnny) Or they could say that five really stupid humans went up...

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.220
against an empire and got totally slaughtered...

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.200
BUT FOUGHT!

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:19.520
So like a friggin' moron, he hands the gun back to Terl and doesn't kill him. Why? Because instead of escaping,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:26.940
he wants to hold out for destroying the entire race! Well, I'm glad you have your realistic priorities in place!

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.560
Terl:"Puny humans"

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.380
But to make sure he has leverage, it turns out that Terl has found his girlfriend,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.260
and threatens to blow her up with an exploding collar if he doesn't cooperate.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.860
Terl: "So if you choose to disobey me, let me show you what will happen."

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.700
Johnny: "You made your point!"

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.440
(RIP: Random guy 0:23:10-1:05:20)

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.740
(sarcastically) Yeah, aren't you glad you didn't kill him? Wasn't that just an unbelievably smart move?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.140
I'm glad to have you as our leader. The human race is looking so promising.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:52.820
(2 Movie minutes later)

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:58.520
Old guy: "You didn't kill Sammy. Johnny, this is not living."

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.220
Same guy who drowned in his food:"We'd be looking over our shoulders, waiting for

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.960
the Psychlos to hunt us down.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.260
I think that is not living either."

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.460
(Mimicking that guy) Yeah, you wanna know what IS living? Dying.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.300
(WAT)

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.060
Wait. Wait, no, that's not living.. that's... that's fucking dying.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.500
Lady: "What's going on?"

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.140
Man: Someone in that cage knows how to speak the Psychlos' language! He's gonna help us fight them!

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:25.160
(Do i need to say anything?)

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.780
Uh, this is really not that big a deal, guys. Unless knowing the Psychlos'

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.000
language can shoot lasers from your balls, it's not really guaranteeing you a sure way out.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.800
What IS a sure way out, though, is the stupidity of these goddamn morons.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.100
I mean, look at this. HE continues to educate the humans, shows them how to fly their spaceships,

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.840
and they've already proven that they can use their weapons!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.740
They really don't see this as a recipe for disaster?

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.780
But it's okay, as long as they keep a good close eye on them, I'm sure everything will be okay.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.480
So, how does this advanced alien race watch these humans while they mine?

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.360
A small camera flies over sometimes and takes a still picture.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.040
Terl: "Ill Be watching you!"

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.840
OH, MY GOD!! HOW FUCKING STUPID ARE THESE GUYS?!!

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.340
(Yes i agree!)

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.400
You know what? Let's get Terl back in here, I wanna ask him something.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:18.400
Terl: HA HA HA. Space invaders, Puny Humans. o yees?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.440
Terl, why would you educate these guys that clearly want to kill you and then..

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.240
only watch them by taking a picture every couple of hours?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.620
Terl:Ha! A puny man-animal such as yourself couldn't possibly understand!

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:35.900
We're far technologically superior! We've conquered dozens of species over hundreds of galaxies!.....

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.080
(Bullshit!!)

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.100
.....Or is that the other way around?

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.400
You couldn't conquer Rhode Island! You're completely useless!

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.560
Terl: Well, okay. Just because we've given them everything they could need to take us over...

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.500
doesn't necessarily mean they will take us over! We figure humans operate by the honor system!

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.700
But you don't even work on the honor system.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.280
Terl: I know, And thats why we always win (Laughs like hyena)

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.100
Oh. Go away its like talking to horse's vagina

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.540
Terl: Fool, while you were still learning to SPELL YOUR NA-

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:08.060
So what are the Psychlos doing instead of watching the humans slowly plan to take them over?

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:14.760
Gawk over Psychlo pussy, of course, as we see Travolta mingle with his real-life wife...a term I use very loosely.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.040
Terl: "She gets drunk with economical speed, and there's other advantages."

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.500
(Nice Tongue!)

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.420
(imitating the woman Psychlo) They call it the Gene Simmons transplant.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.220
(His tongue is more realistic than her)

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.680
So the humans call on that fox-tribe we saw earlier to make it look like they're mining for gold,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.700
as they set out to Washington.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.140
(But thats Kentucky)

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.600
No. They're not...

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.680
(Open sesame)

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.760
They're honestly not...

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.920
(I want to Loot Fort Knox)

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.860
SON OF A BIIIIIIIIITCH!!!

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.060
TERL!

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.500
Terl: Oh, it's you again.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:53.040
How can you idiots not know about Fort fucking Knox!? What, you never checked to see we harvested gold, too!?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.180
Terl: Listen, you're probably figuring out by now that we Psychlos are not very smart.....

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.100
In fact, the only reason we're able to take over any galaxy at all is that

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.600
we fart nuclear bombs out of our anuses!

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.040
Oh. So...none of this has to do with strategic planning or superior intellect?

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.180
Terl: Nope! It's just farting bombs! (laughs)

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.180
(sighs) You must be a very proud race.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:22.580
Terl: We are! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a play to rehearse for tomorrow evening! "To be, or not TO BE!"

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.160
So, yeah, in a matter of 2 weeks...I'm gonna repeat that, 2 weeks...

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:36.560
the humans learn how to find weapons, build bombs, arm guns and even learn how to fly fighter jets!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.940
Wow, these guys are making the Mensa people look like lobotomized retards!

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.980
Bloke:"Piece of Cake"

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.760
So Terl returns to get his gold and never questions how they were able to turn it into bricks,

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.080
as he loads it up in a secret compartment.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.460
(RIP some corpse)

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.700
Why is it I get the feeling this is how John Travolta wants to be buried?

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.560
But after that scene, the humans finally attack! Their plan?

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.360
To get to the teleporter so they can beam a bomb to the Psychlos' planet and blow it up.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:13.700
The explosion will be small, but since the atmosphere is entirely radioactive, it'll wipe out... the entire planet.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.780
UH!

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:25.120
so, this military force of a planet...that has an atmosphere made out of radiation...

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.040
has never had an explosion?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.340
This race is more gun-happy than

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.100
Charlton Heston's shooting gallery, and yet, there's never been an explosion on this planet!?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.600
(How did they made their weapons anyway?)

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.840
They could look at a kitten, and somehow, they'd make it blow up!

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.020
These guys are crazy!! There's never been an explo--?!

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:50.180
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT!?! THIS IS STUPID!!! THIS IS STUPID!!! STUPID, STUPID-

00:20:50.220 --> 00:21:08.900
(I BARELY BREATHED)

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.060
OK

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:23.560
The thought occurs to me that perhaps, I'm just not in the right mindset for this movie.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.400
So, to fix this problem, I'm going to make the proper alterations.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.940
(Intermition)

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.400
(slurred) Duhuhuh, I like spaceships. (giggles)

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.580
So, in a very confusing and extremely jumbled climax,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.400
the humans split up and try to attack different parts of the Psychlos' camp.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.900
Bloke:"The shooting's triggered the alarm!"

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.320
Bloke 2:"5 guards from the south, heavily armed and moving fast!

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.820
(These are fastest Psychlos ever)

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.120
THAT'S moving fast? What do you consider moving slow? Standing still?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.580
(Shooty shooty mcbang)

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.140
And we have our Commando moment where every friggin' alien fires at this guy,

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.180
but somehow, they just keep on missing.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.220
(Psychlos are less accurate shooters than Stormtroopers)

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.340
(imitating one of the aliens) D'oh! If only we weren't on a planet where everything was at an angle,

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.700
we could shoot straight!

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.720
The Psychlos send in the military to fight off those man-animals,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.440
but those handy fighter jets come in to save the day.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.000
Uh... So let me just clarify this. 6 fighter jets can take out these spaceships,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.640
and yet, an entire military in the past couldn't stop an alien takeover? How is that possible?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.500
Well, according to Conservative talk radio, because there's a Democrat at the White House.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:47.840
Terl:"Attention! This is Terl, your Chief of Security! Exterminate all man-animals at will,....

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.400
...And Happy hunting"

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.320
(mimicking Terl) I'm a Thespian Chief of Security!

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.360
So one of the ships that was set out to blow up the base on Earth gets stuck,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.100
and so he has no choice but to blow up the ship himself.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.320
Bloke:"I'm blowing it up!....

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.220
Piece of cake."

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.660
(dubbing over Bloke) I immediately regret this.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:10.900
(Directed by michael Bay)

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.940
So the dome comes crashing down, Johnny manages to fire Terl's arm off,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.220
and the teleporter gets the bomb to the planet Psychlo, where it's blown up forever.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.040
(PURGE THE XEENOS)

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.840
Daffy: "As I was sayin', buster, this planet ain't big enough for the two of us, so...

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.540
Off you go! "

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.580
So Psychlo is destroyed in probably the most idiotically simple of world destructions,

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.260
as Terl is put in a cage and used as leverage.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:52.820
They even get Ker to join their team, because frankly, the Psychlos are fucking morons and anyone with

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.660
half a brain wouldn't be on their side, including the damn Psychlos.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.180
(What a dumbass)

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.620
Terl: "Why don't you vaporize me?"

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.120
Johnny:"Leverage.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:05.500
If there are other Psychlo colonies out there, they'll send out their gas drones and exterminate us....

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.980
But if they learn that it was your greed that destroyed their home planet,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.920
then all the credits in the universe won't equal to the bounty that they put on your head."

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.460
(imitating Johnny) So rather than living in a world where they're trying to kill us,

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.520
we're living in a world where they're trying to kill us getting to this guy! This was a good plan.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.840
Ker:"(Laughs) Look at the Bright sight,..

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.920
At least you finally got your gold"

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:38.520
Oh, the irony! He got his gold, but is totally unable to use it! D-did we emphasise that enough?

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.440
The part about him having the gold but not being able to use it,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:48.380
cause that's what's going on here! He has the gold, but is totally not able to use it, God, roll the credits!

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.600
(YAAAAY)

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.760
Oh, fuck you, Roger Christian, whoever the fuck you are!

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:02.440
This is an absolute ass of shit! I mean, this is bad, this is really, really...bad!

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:11.240
The acting's over-the-top, the camera work's a joke, the story is beyond idiotic, it's just bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.580
And like I said, how are we supposed to believe even for a millisecond

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.760
that these dumbasses of a race are supposed to take us over?

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.060
Terl: Just you wait, Critic, for soon, we will conquer your primitive species just as we have for centuries-

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:25.880
Uh-oh.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.600
Whats wrong?

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.960
Terl: Oh, it looks like someone lit a cigarette on our home planet and now

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.340
the whole damn thing's going to explode

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:33.840
(Imperium of man is attacking)

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.940
Oh...gee. I'm sorry, it's-

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:36.840
Yeah

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.100
Well...is there anything I can do?

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.240
Terl: No, no, it's cool, just let me work on my dying words!...OH-

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.040
You know, im not gonna miss him

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.640
(Me neither)

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.560
Terl:"While you were learning how to spell your name!"
