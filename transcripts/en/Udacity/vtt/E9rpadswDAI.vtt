00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.680
Using this set of chromosomes, we would expect a

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.810
female to develop. If we look just at the sex

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.760
chromosome pair here, we see that we have two x's.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120
And two x's means that we don't have a y.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.360
A y is what triggers male development, so in

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.410
the absence of the y chromosome, it means that we're

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.940
going to get female development. In humans, all females are

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.170
genetically xx. They have two x chromosomes. And all males

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.970
are genetically xy. They have 1 x and 1

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.860
y chromosome. Now, there's no yy combination that exists in

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.020
reality. And it's for two main reasons. The first

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200
is that you only have two parents, a male and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.600
a female. So you have someone XX and someone

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.490
XY. So there's only one Y to pass down to

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.510
the next generation anyways. So, getting a second Y

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.360
just really isn't even possible, normally speaking. And the second

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.550
reason is that the Y chromosome is a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.920
lot smaller than the X. There's actually a lot

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.940
of important information that's on the X chromosome here

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.050
that's not on the Y, and without that information,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.720
a human without an X chromosome can't survive.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.560
So you always need at least one X chromosome,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280
and although there are actually variations on this theme

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.430
here. The only two real combinations that we'll talk

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.930
about are the XX combination, which develop as

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.470
females, and the XY combination, which develop as males.
