00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.330
So I'm curious as
to what happens

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.380
if I were to take
a rational number

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.870
and I were to add it to
an irrational number.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.010
Is the resulting number going
to be rational or irrational?

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.650
Well, to think about
this, let's just

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.520
assume it's going to be
rational and then see

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.040
if this leads to any
form of contradiction.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.750
So let's assume
that this is going

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.850
to give us a rational number.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.790
So let's say that this
first rational number

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.860
we can represent as the ratio
of two integers, a and b.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.720
Let's call this irrational
number, let's just call this x.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.890
And their sum gives us
another rational number.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.800
Well, let's express
that as the ratio of two

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.070
other integers, m and n.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.990
So we're saying that a/b
plus x is equal to m/n.

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.340
Well, another way of
thinking about it--

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.800
we could subtract
a/b from both sides

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.670
and we would get our
irrational number

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.770
x is equal to m/n
minus a/b, which

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.295
is the same thing as n
times b in the denominator.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.390
And then let's see.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.835
m/n is the same
thing as mb over nb.

00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:33.330
So this would be mb.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.990
I'm just adding
these two fractions.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.850
mb minus--

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.580
Let's see. a/b is the same thing
as n times a over n times b.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.470
So minus n times a.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.020
All I did is I added
these two fractions.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.850
I found a common denominator.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.170
So to make it clear, I
multiplied this one b and b,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.190
and then I multiplied
this one n and n then

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.250
I just added these two things,
and I got this expression right

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.480
over here.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.909
So this denominator
is clearly an integer.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.630
I have the product
of two integers.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.380
That's going to be an integer.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.690
That's going to be an integer.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.520
And then this numerator,
mb, is an integer.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.509
na is an integer.

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.800
The difference of two integers.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.591
This whole thing is
going to be an integer.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.290
So it looks like, assuming
that the sum is rational,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.290
that all of a sudden we
have this contradiction.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.380
We assumed that x is irrational,
we're assuming x is irrational,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.706
but, all of a sudden, because
we made that assumption,

00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:39.580
we're able to assume
that we can represent it

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.510
as this ratio of two integers.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.265
So this tells us that
x must be rational.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.480
And that is the contradiction.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.450
That is a very large
contradiction right over there.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.140
The assumption was
that x is irrational.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.090
Now we got that x
must be rational.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.920
So, therefore, this
cannot be the case.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.980
A rational plus an
irrational must--

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.460
so this is not right--
a rational plus

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.530
an irrational must
be irrational.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.670
Let me write that down.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:22.870
So a rational plus an
irrational must be irrational.
