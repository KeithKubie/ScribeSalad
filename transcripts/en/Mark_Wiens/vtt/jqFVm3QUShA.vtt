00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:01.629
- [Narrator] Anybody who
visits southern Thailand,

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.254
all Thais that come to southern Thailand,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:04.668
and to Nakhon Si Thammarat,

00:00:04.668 --> 00:00:05.888
they would never leave without

00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:07.561
having a meal of kanom jeen.

00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:10.394
(mid tempo music)

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:20.651
Hey everyone it's Mark Wiens,
I'm in (foreign language)

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:22.044
Nakhon Si Thammarat in souther Thailand

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:25.178
and this is a city that is
not all that well known,

00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:27.156
it's not a big tourist destination,

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.905
but I think it's an amazing
city that you can visit.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:31.995
So today I'm gonna take
you on a full tour of

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:32.828
of Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:00:32.828 --> 00:00:34.514
We're gonna eat some
amazingly delicious food

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.759
and visit some of the famous sites

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.339
and I can't wait to share
everything with you today

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.584
in this video.

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:42.386
We are starting off
this morning at a place,

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:45.432
it's just called Ko Pi and
that just means coffee,

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:47.437
but this is the local coffee shop.

00:00:47.437 --> 00:00:49.152
This place is legendary.

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:53.679
They date back to 1942
and I love how this place

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.929
has preserved its heritage.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.173
We ordered a couple of different things,

00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:00.757
Ying was asking what
their specialties are,

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.079
but what most people, I
think, come here to eat

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.163
is the bak kut teh.

00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:08.973
Bak kut the, it literally
translates to pork bone tea,

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:10.653
but there's actually usually,

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.699
I don't think there's ever
in any tea in the recipe,

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:15.744
but it's mostly like
a Chinese herbal broth

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:17.567
with pork bones and this one though,

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.612
includes a lot of extra ingredients.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.952
There are some needle mushrooms in there.

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:23.305
There's some type of a green vegetable.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:24.808
There's some other mushrooms
and some goji berries,

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:26.509
some dried goji berries.

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.174
Oh, oh, that almost
smells like apple cider.

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:31.007
It has a

00:01:32.568 --> 00:01:34.735
holiday spice aroma to it.

00:01:41.207 --> 00:01:43.040
Oh, that is delicious.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.682
And I got one of those little
sour goji berries in it too.

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:50.599
A piece of the pork bone,
that looks wonderful.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.903
Look at that beauty.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:55.820
That's flaming hot too!

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.514
That just falls off the bone.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:05.764
Just a clean steaming bone.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.412
Oh that's melt in your mouth tender.

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:10.388
That is ridiculously tender.

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:13.261
The meat has just absorbed
that herbal broth.

00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.686
I just ordered a black coffee

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:17.612
but they're making it the
traditional, the old school way,

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:19.664
and I watched him as a was
making a (foreign language).

00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:21.561
Normally they put condensed milk in it

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.867
but I'm not a huge fan of condensed milk

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.147
so I ordered it with no condensed milk.

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:27.575
But it's pretty cool
to watch him making it

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:29.493
as he dumps in the coffee
and then scoops out the

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:32.993
condensed milk from the can very expertly.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.172
Yeah.

00:02:38.568 --> 00:02:42.068
That is strong and black and it has a very

00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:47.631
dark dark roast chocolately flavor to it.

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:52.204
So it's actually, I really
like light roast coffees,

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:55.827
but I can appreciate this dark
roast very choclately coffee

00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:59.275
and also just the heritage,
the traditional aspect of it

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:01.599
is what makes it good.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.020
And then finally we got
some khao man gaeng neau.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.935
So it's rice, with some
type of a beef curry

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.768
and an egg on the top.

00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:16.852
Oh that's good.

00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:21.742
That has a wonderful, almost
like masala curry flavor to it.

00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:24.336
You can taste a mixture
of dry spices in there.

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:25.404
This is really good.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.237
That was delicious.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:27.783
That was a wonderful
breakfast to get started

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.701
in Nakhon Si Thammarat, but
what I love about this place

00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.160
is that it attracts,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.550
there are a lot of Bangkok
Thais that come here

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.623
and this is a must eat stop
in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:39.017
But I'm also seeing a
lot of locals eating here

00:03:39.017 --> 00:03:40.680
and just drinking coffee and hanging out.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.900
There's some policemen,
there's some students.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.159
You really feel the
heritage and the mix of Thai

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.302
and Chinese culture at
a coffee shop like this.

00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:53.135
(mid tempo music)

00:03:56.856 --> 00:04:00.533
We made it to Wat Phra
Mahathat and this is

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.390
one of the main Buddhist temples
within Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.305
and this temple was
built in the 13th century

00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:09.677
by the King and what's
interesting about this temple

00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:12.072
is if you can see the main cheti,

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:13.909
the main stuppa in back of me.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.784
It was built with Shrilankan
style and influence

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:21.241
but walking around now, there's a cheti,

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:23.931
there's the main temple and
then there's all these smaller

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.769
stupas as well.

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.602
(mid tempo music)

00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:42.661
This is the very center
of Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:44.776
and I love, this city is great.

00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:47.026
It's a decently sized city.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:53.212
I mean, not too big, but it
has a small city charm to it.

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:55.061
Especially the center
and you can walk around.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.026
It has a real mix of different cultures.

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.359
This is a great little city.

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:02.976
From here we're gonna
go eat some khanom jeen,

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:06.703
which are rice noodles with
curry and it's another thing

00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:07.791
that you...

00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:09.628
It's a must eat when you
come to Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:11.829
There are a lot of khanom jeen restaurants

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:13.003
in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:05:13.003 --> 00:05:15.229
This place is called Khanom Jeen Mae Aed

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.497
and it is just one street
over from the temple.

00:05:19.497 --> 00:05:22.296
It's about 500 meters away so
you could easily walk here.

00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:25.213
(foreign language)

00:05:27.464 --> 00:05:30.216
They make all of the kanom
jeen, the rice noodles,

00:05:30.216 --> 00:05:32.624
fresh every day and he has
this hydraulic machine.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.350
She's gonna show me real fast.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.502
Oh very cool.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.752
(sizzling)

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:53.132
That is a gigantic wok of boiling water

00:05:53.132 --> 00:05:54.753
and he said that it just
needs to boil for one minute

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:56.712
and they are cooked.

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:58.976
Then he fished all the
noodles out with a basket

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:02.242
and then I think he's running
them through some cold water

00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:03.155
behind there.

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:06.905
But that even just
increases the anticipation

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.366
for the noodles that
we're about to eat here.

00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:13.605
The entire table is just full of colors

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.355
and different ingredients.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:17.010
You've got all the different curries,

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.962
this is the basket of
the fresh rice noodles.

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:24.468
You eat the noodles with
the curry but khanom jeen

00:06:24.468 --> 00:06:28.808
would not be the same
without fresh vegetables.

00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:31.262
This is just a gorgeous
platter of fresh vegetables.

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:33.345
There are so many
different herbs and leaves.

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:37.472
I see weened bean, I see climbing waddle,

00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:40.885
I see cashews nut tree
leaves, I see cucumbers

00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:45.052
and then there's also some
pickles, some bean sprouts.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.688
Khanom jeen is all about
this whole experience.

00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:50.848
I love how they pack this rice noodle.

00:06:50.848 --> 00:06:52.285
They put it in a basket with some leaves

00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:56.176
and then give you a pair
of scissors within it.

00:06:56.176 --> 00:06:59.869
I love how these are just
like office scissors as well.

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:02.464
And then on the (foreign language)?

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.387
Alright, that should be good.

00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:04.874
You don't want to chop them up too much.

00:07:04.874 --> 00:07:07.694
But that does, you can see
they have a very sticky,

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:10.605
sticky consistency and if you
touch them with your fingers,

00:07:10.605 --> 00:07:12.928
they immediately stick to your fingers

00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:14.139
because they're so sticky.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.343
Okay, and that should be good to start.

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:20.056
You can kind of break
them apart a little bit.

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:22.721
When you eat khanom jeen,
there is a trio of curries,

00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:26.634
in the south, that is
the most popular trio.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:29.184
And starting from this
side, this is nam ya kati,

00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:31.934
which is a minced fish
curry with coconut milk.

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.792
And this one is nam prik,

00:07:34.792 --> 00:07:38.289
which is more of a sweet peanutty curry,

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.754
and then the final curry
in the trio of curries

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:41.732
this is called nam ya ba.

00:07:41.732 --> 00:07:43.412
I gotta start with the nam ya kati,

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:45.562
which is coconut milk and minced fish.

00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:48.238
This is one of the absolute classics.

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:49.071
Oh yes!

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:54.886
And before doing anything else
I will take a bite of that.

00:07:54.886 --> 00:07:55.969
Oh wonderful.

00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:08.902
Oh yeah, that is just pure,
rich, thick coconut cream.

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:13.315
You can taste the turmeric
and the chilies in there.

00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.167
I'm tasting some lemon
grass in there as well.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:19.385
And then the fish is very
pureed minced down there.

00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:21.004
But it's also thick, not
only from the coconut milk

00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:22.972
but from the pureed fish.

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:25.001
These are cashew tree leaves

00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:26.403
and I have definitely had these before.

00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:28.570
But they, let's just say--

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:30.658
Let me show you.

00:08:30.658 --> 00:08:32.991
(crunching)

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.932
Yup, really really chalky
and really really sour.

00:08:37.932 --> 00:08:39.856
They're awesome.

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:42.477
That just completely
palate cleanses your mouth.

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:45.227
Next up let me try that nam prik.

00:08:49.975 --> 00:08:51.105
I knew it before I tasted it,

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:53.154
but this is always a sweet curry.

00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:56.404
It is very coconutty and very peanutty.

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:59.310
This one is typically not my favorite

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.328
but it is actually quite good.

00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:03.942
Let me go in for the third curry now,

00:09:03.942 --> 00:09:06.109
which is called nam ya ba.

00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:14.078
Um that is a nice strong fishy taste.

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.456
But it tastes like roasted
or dried fish in there.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.640
A little bit of a kick to it.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.180
There are definitely some chilies in there

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.967
and you can taste some herbs as well.

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:26.134
And then another protein
addition is a hard boiled egg.

00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:30.062
Oh, let's run, that's the way I like it.

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:33.026
Alright, and just mix all of
that with the pickles as well.

00:09:33.026 --> 00:09:35.776
You gotta slice up those noodles.

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:37.734
Perfect.

00:09:43.153 --> 00:09:44.869
Oh that yolk is so creamy.

00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:46.591
Another thing they specialize in here

00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.678
is the (foreign language),

00:09:49.678 --> 00:09:53.428
which is a southern Thai
style fried fritter.

00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:55.108
You can see the shrimp.

00:09:55.108 --> 00:09:57.252
There's a shrimp head in this bite

00:09:57.252 --> 00:09:59.217
and bai laeb krut, which is a vegetable,

00:09:59.217 --> 00:10:02.168
which is in English is called ming aralia.

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.606
I believe that's the name

00:10:03.606 --> 00:10:06.523
and then they fry it into fritters.

00:10:09.404 --> 00:10:10.237
Wow!

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:11.816
What's really good about
their version is that

00:10:11.816 --> 00:10:12.970
it's not batter heavy.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.752
Sometimes when you eat this
it's way too much batter

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:18.050
and it's a batter fritter.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.071
This is like almost all leaves

00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.126
and then the batter just
acts to hold it together.

00:10:23.126 --> 00:10:25.415
But the leaves have this wonderful,

00:10:25.415 --> 00:10:28.332
kind of peppery herb taste to them.

00:10:29.397 --> 00:10:31.713
And then another dish they
specialize here is moo tod,

00:10:31.713 --> 00:10:32.606
which is fried pork.

00:10:32.606 --> 00:10:36.107
So may as well taste one of
these guys while I'm at it.

00:10:36.107 --> 00:10:38.557
And I think this would be
good mixed with khanom jeen

00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:39.390
and curry.

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:44.339
Oh yeah.

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:45.730
That does have a nice texture

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.839
and it's very very crispy on the edges.

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:50.195
I'm gonna taste the final
curry that we got here,

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:54.291
which is gaeng keow wan,
which is green curry.

00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:57.083
You can tell that this is a
souther Thai style green curry

00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.279
because of that yellow brown color.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:03.362
So they probably add
turmeric to the green curry.

00:11:11.222 --> 00:11:12.972
Um, that's delicious.

00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:16.078
You can really taste the flavor
of that green curry paste.

00:11:16.078 --> 00:11:19.573
The green chilies in
there, the kafir lime peel,

00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:21.879
which gives it a citrusy taste,

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:25.502
and then I'm pretty sure they
have some turmeric in there.

00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:27.993
It's really good, actually,
everything is good.

00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:29.744
Ying and I are working through this meal,

00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:32.137
but one of the best things
to do is take some of these

00:11:32.137 --> 00:11:33.897
shrimp fritters, put
it under your noodles,

00:11:33.897 --> 00:11:37.929
and then you eat that entire
fritter with some noodles

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:41.107
just soaking in the coconut milk curry.

00:11:41.107 --> 00:11:43.107
This is an amazing bite.

00:11:50.964 --> 00:11:51.870
Oh yeah.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.992
Let's quickly do some vegetable eating.

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:55.962
Long beans, a piece of jankle,

00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:56.962
a ween bean,

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:01.890
cashew nut tree leaves.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.723
What are this Ying?

00:12:02.723 --> 00:12:03.659
(foreign language)

00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:04.492
I don't know the English name

00:12:04.492 --> 00:12:07.011
but in Thai it's called
(foreign language).

00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:08.117
Basil.

00:12:08.117 --> 00:12:08.950
This thing

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:14.043
and a cucumber.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.468
Okay, my mouth is full now.

00:12:17.468 --> 00:12:19.123
That was really a properly good meal.

00:12:19.123 --> 00:12:22.815
And what I like is that it's a lot of food

00:12:22.815 --> 00:12:25.192
and there's so much variety
but it doesn't leave you

00:12:25.192 --> 00:12:27.377
feeling heavy or too...

00:12:27.377 --> 00:12:30.870
It doesn't leave you feeling
greasy or oily or heavy

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.759
because you've got so much vegetables.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:35.562
Even the rice noodles are
quite light and fluffy.

00:12:35.562 --> 00:12:38.320
And then the curries just
provide immense flavor.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320
What a meal.

00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:43.400
I'm so happy and satisfied right now.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.289
Next up we are driving
over to a place called

00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:49.626
Bann Tankhun and this
is a preserved old home

00:12:49.626 --> 00:12:51.126
heritage building.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.507
(mid tempo instrumental music)

00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:08.003
And this is an old, old
mansion, wooden mansion

00:13:08.003 --> 00:13:10.824
that's very really well
preserved and still full of

00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.866
original antiques.

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:14.991
It's over 100 years old, this house,

00:13:14.991 --> 00:13:15.908
and it's...

00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:19.069
What's cool is it's just
open as an open house.

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:21.465
You can come in here, you've
got to take off your shoes,

00:13:21.465 --> 00:13:23.328
to preserve the wooden floors

00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:26.052
but it's just an open house

00:13:26.052 --> 00:13:28.091
and you can come in here and
just kind of browse around

00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:30.591
and it's a real heritage site.

00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:35.032
I just did the math of
when this place was built.

00:13:35.032 --> 00:13:36.938
It was built 105 years ago

00:13:36.938 --> 00:13:40.521
so that makes it that
it was built in 1912.

00:13:43.371 --> 00:13:45.242
It was built in 1912.

00:13:45.242 --> 00:13:48.075
(mid tempo music)

00:14:01.564 --> 00:14:03.167
Nakhon Si Thammarat, just like
other southern Thai cities,

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:06.699
is very diverse and it has
a real mix of cultures.

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:10.263
There is the local Thai and also Malay

00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:11.917
in the south of Thailand,

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.489
but there's also a Chinese influence,

00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:16.888
there is even a Shrilankan
influence that we saw

00:14:16.888 --> 00:14:18.143
from that temple,

00:14:18.143 --> 00:14:21.049
and that's all reflected
in the food and the culture

00:14:21.049 --> 00:14:22.670
in Nakhon Si Thammarat.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.503
(mid tempo music)

00:14:29.543 --> 00:14:31.334
We just arrived to this place

00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:34.602
and it was a little bit tricky to find.

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:37.551
It's on a street called
(foreign language).

00:14:37.551 --> 00:14:40.373
It looks like an amazing beach house.

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:42.975
They have a museum here in the back.

00:14:42.975 --> 00:14:45.190
I think it's all just family run.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.654
So we're just gonna take a
look at the museum real fast

00:14:47.654 --> 00:14:48.914
for the shadow puppets.

00:14:48.914 --> 00:14:51.747
(mid tempo music)

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:57.797
They have a museum upstairs
with some old shadow puppets

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:59.892
and they're all made from leather.

00:14:59.892 --> 00:15:02.725
And these are 50 to 100 years old.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.670
Pretty cool.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.510
She's just giving us a
really quick demonstration

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.938
about how they make the
shadow puppets made from

00:15:09.938 --> 00:15:14.105
(foreign language), which is cow skin.

00:15:15.722 --> 00:15:17.889
(tapping)

00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:23.855
(foreign language)

00:15:26.527 --> 00:15:30.238
These are the actual
puppets and a set as well,

00:15:30.238 --> 00:15:32.237
a shadow puppet set.

00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:35.279
Tonight, we're gonna go to hopefully,

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:38.310
a restaurant where they're
gonna have this showing.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.526
So I thought it would be
cool to see the museum,

00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:42.748
learn about these shadow puppets,

00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:44.327
see them making the puppets,

00:15:44.327 --> 00:15:46.094
and then tonight, while we're eating food,

00:15:46.094 --> 00:15:49.662
hopefully we're gonna see a
traditional shadow puppet show

00:15:49.662 --> 00:15:50.787
southern Thai style.

00:15:50.787 --> 00:15:53.930
We are taking an evening walk
and on our way to a restaurant

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.837
for dinner tonight, that's
called Krua Nai Nang.

00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:59.643
This is a restaurant that
serves southern Thai food

00:15:59.643 --> 00:16:01.958
and one of the highlights of eating there

00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.658
is their shadow puppet show.

00:16:04.658 --> 00:16:07.491
(mid tempo music)

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.023
(laughs)

00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:16.409
(foreign language)

00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:25.214
That's hilarious!

00:16:25.214 --> 00:16:27.874
He's speaking to us over the megaphone

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:29.920
and telling us some of
the signature dishes.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.409
This is a great place.

00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:34.826
It almost has a cowboy western feel to it

00:16:36.354 --> 00:16:38.636
but they have all southern
Thai food on their menu

00:16:38.636 --> 00:16:42.041
including some interesting specialties

00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:42.874
at this restaurant

00:16:42.874 --> 00:16:46.029
and I'm guessing that he is the owner.

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:49.494
He calls out on the megaphone
and he calls you out.

00:16:49.494 --> 00:16:51.820
I was filming the front sign and he said

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.272
you better take a photo of me as well.

00:16:54.272 --> 00:16:56.371
We managed to order
quite a beautiful spread

00:16:56.371 --> 00:16:57.467
of southern Thai food.

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.092
What I got to go in for is the gaeng som,

00:17:00.092 --> 00:17:01.734
which is southern Thai sour curry

00:17:01.734 --> 00:17:04.812
and this particular version
is gaeng som pla kod.

00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:06.545
It's kinda like a catfish type of fish.

00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:07.378
Is it fresh water fish?

00:17:07.378 --> 00:17:09.340
There's some type of fruit in here too.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.840
Let me just first taste the broth of that.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.777
Oh those little fruits, oh yeah!

00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:24.519
I've had that fruit before.

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:28.686
They just like burst with
vinegar tasting sourness.

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:35.003
Oh, that's marvelous.

00:17:36.038 --> 00:17:37.754
Really sour and really spicy.

00:17:37.754 --> 00:17:40.321
Next up this is bai liang pad kai

00:17:40.321 --> 00:17:41.967
and bai liang pad kai is malingal leaves,

00:17:41.967 --> 00:17:44.250
which is one of the ultimate vegetables of

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.083
southern Thailand.

00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:46.916
It's very very common.

00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:49.991
It's garlicky.

00:17:49.991 --> 00:17:52.177
You've got the smokey
taste and then again,

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:55.108
those leaves, I probably
explained them many times,

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:57.427
but they almost have a nutty taste

00:17:57.427 --> 00:17:59.639
and what's also really good
about them is their texture,

00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:00.472
which is...

00:18:00.472 --> 00:18:02.761
It's not really chewy but at
the same time it doesn't have

00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:05.011
that slimy spinach texture.

00:18:08.377 --> 00:18:09.383
They're firm.

00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:10.969
Next up I'm gonna go for this other dish,

00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:14.446
which is kai mode daeng dom kati pak liang

00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:19.258
and it is red ant eggs, which
are boiled with coconut milk

00:18:19.258 --> 00:18:22.348
and it's an amazing source of protein.

00:18:22.348 --> 00:18:26.460
But you can see the ants and
then the little white morsels

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.877
are the ant eggs.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.171
It's amazing.

00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:39.845
That is just focused on
the pure coconut milk.

00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:41.357
The ants are absolutely brilliant.

00:18:41.357 --> 00:18:44.107
The eggs are kinda rich and yolky

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:49.961
and then the ants themselves
have a very sour crunchiness

00:18:49.961 --> 00:18:50.794
to them.

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:53.115
Any chance that you have
to try kai mode daeng

00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:55.806
or red ant eggs or red ants in
Thailand, you should take it.

00:18:55.806 --> 00:18:58.223
It's a real delicacy and it's

00:19:00.209 --> 00:19:02.541
a very sustainable food as well.

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:04.466
Next dish over here is goong pad sataw

00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:07.781
and this is stink beans stir fried.

00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:09.266
The dish is actually
called (foreign language)

00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:11.704
which is a chile stir fried dish.

00:19:11.704 --> 00:19:13.672
Huge meaty prawns.

00:19:13.672 --> 00:19:17.047
Get that stink beans on there as well.

00:19:17.047 --> 00:19:17.880
Oh yeah.

00:19:27.814 --> 00:19:29.469
Oh that's the dish right there.

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:31.135
Oh I love it so much.

00:19:31.135 --> 00:19:33.199
That is outstanding.

00:19:33.199 --> 00:19:35.585
That curry paste has so much flavor in it.

00:19:35.585 --> 00:19:38.769
It's spicy, you can taste
all of the herbs in there.

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:40.121
You can taste the stink beans.

00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:44.162
You can also taste the sweet
basil in there very nicely.

00:19:44.162 --> 00:19:48.229
The peppercorns, the chilies,
and then there's also

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:50.110
some coconut milk in there,
I believe, to make it

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.495
like more rich and thick.

00:19:52.495 --> 00:19:53.912
Amazing, amazing.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.909
This is the dish I love.

00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:58.553
Yeah, I personally love--

00:19:58.553 --> 00:20:00.663
This is one of my favorite
dishes to eat in all of Thailand,

00:20:00.663 --> 00:20:04.947
goong pad sataw and this is
a great great plate of it.

00:20:04.947 --> 00:20:07.835
Micah wanted to join in so
I'm joined with Micah now.

00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:12.202
And the last dish that we
ordered is pla sai tod kamin,

00:20:12.202 --> 00:20:13.802
and I believe in English it's a sand fish

00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:15.902
and it's just deep fried.

00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:18.878
Oh that is triplets right there.

00:20:18.878 --> 00:20:19.802
Okay, I'll save that for later.

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:22.661
But this is deep fried
with garlic and turmeric.

00:20:22.661 --> 00:20:25.161
I'm gonna dip it in the sauce.

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:33.948
That's like a fish french fry.

00:20:33.948 --> 00:20:35.204
Oh and there's some black
pepper in there as well.

00:20:35.204 --> 00:20:37.628
It's garlicky, there's turmeric in there,

00:20:37.628 --> 00:20:40.961
and that's just a crispy bit sized fish.

00:20:42.478 --> 00:20:44.854
So we're just gonna sit here
and enjoy the rest of this food

00:20:44.854 --> 00:20:49.021
and wait for the show, which
should happen pretty soon.

00:20:53.476 --> 00:20:54.441
Ying says we're lucky to find this

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.394
and I don't think I've ever had it.

00:20:57.394 --> 00:21:00.129
So, I'm gonna save it for later though.

00:21:00.129 --> 00:21:02.817
She was just walking through
the restaurant and sold it.

00:21:02.817 --> 00:21:06.984
Gonna save it for later and
I will tell you what it is.

00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:12.189
Food was great and it started
to down pour somewhere

00:21:12.189 --> 00:21:14.667
in the middle of the meal and
it's been raining ever since.

00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:17.115
But finally, the show is about to start.

00:21:17.115 --> 00:21:19.615
(Asian music)

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.647
(foreign language)

00:21:37.627 --> 00:21:39.318
We saw a little bit of the
show but then we ended up

00:21:39.318 --> 00:21:40.751
having to come back to
the hotel pretty quickly

00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:43.149
with the baby and with the hard rain.

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:45.899
But, before, oh yeah, here it is.

00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:49.279
Before I end this video
I wanted to show you

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:52.446
this, which a lady came around selling

00:21:54.173 --> 00:21:56.447
and it's called (foreign language)

00:21:56.447 --> 00:21:59.600
and it's mangosteen but
very young mangosteen

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.023
and Ying says that it's really rare.

00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:06.247
So she immediately wanted
to buy it when she saw it.

00:22:06.247 --> 00:22:10.414
They take out the big outer
husk or the big outer shell

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:13.941
and then put it onto skewers.

00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:14.971
So this is kinda cool.

00:22:14.971 --> 00:22:18.105
I've never seen this in Bangkok before.

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:20.438
(crunching)

00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:23.524
(groans)

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.793
Oh.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.447
Oh that's awesome.

00:22:32.447 --> 00:22:35.030
That's like seedless mangosteen

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.753
and because it's not
fully developed, not ripe,

00:22:39.753 --> 00:22:41.642
it has more of a crisp
texture to it than a

00:22:41.642 --> 00:22:44.475
juicy mangosteen that I'm used to.

00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:52.013
Oh that's the perfect dessert.

00:22:52.013 --> 00:22:53.829
Been a really really good day

00:22:53.829 --> 00:22:56.277
doing some sight seeing
around Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:22:56.277 --> 00:22:58.195
and eating some delicious food.

00:22:58.195 --> 00:23:01.138
This is a city that doesn't
get a lot of tourism

00:23:01.138 --> 00:23:02.888
and some Thais visit,

00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:06.491
but not a lot of foreigners
come to Nakhon Si Thammarat

00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:09.129
but at the same time, it's
quite a nice little city

00:23:09.129 --> 00:23:12.702
and I hope this video has shown
you some of the top things

00:23:12.702 --> 00:23:15.775
to do and just a few
places to eat as well.

00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:17.484
That's gonna be it for this video.

00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:19.730
I want to say a big
thank you for watching.
