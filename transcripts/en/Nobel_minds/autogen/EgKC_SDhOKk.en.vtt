00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:04.299
anybody and it wasn't until much later
that I realized that the stories that

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:04.309
that I realized that the stories that
 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.159
that I realized that the stories that
would be interesting if one got them

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169
would be interesting if one got them
 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.820
would be interesting if one got them
into a larger audience yes what is

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830
into a larger audience yes what is
 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.559
into a larger audience yes what is
important to you when you tell a story

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509
well obviously in those early days the
 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.869
well obviously in those early days the
importance was the happy ending I did

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879
importance was the happy ending I did
 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.869

that confident new writing I was for a
 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.049
that confident new writing I was for a
long time I became very unconfident what

people who were right
and I realized that it was a much harder

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720
and I realized that it was a much harder
 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.630

but I never gave up at all it was just
 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.490

that's just something I did when you
 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.590
that's just something I did when you
start on a story they always have it

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:11.600
start on a story they always have it
 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.400

changes I started with a plot and I work
 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.850
changes I started with a plot and I work
at it and then I see that it goes

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860
at it and then I see that it goes
 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.900
at it and then I see that it goes
another way and things happen as I'm

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910
another way and things happen as I'm

part where you go over the story and
 

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.980

then is when you really have to get to
 

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.070
then is when you really have to get to
work on it and for me it always seemed

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:05.080
work on it and for me it always seemed
 

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.060
work on it and for me it always seemed
worthy to do

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.070
worthy to do

it was my fault that it wasn't better it
was not the story's fault but how do you

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.340
was not the story's fault but how do you
 

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.100
was not the story's fault but how do you
turn it around if you're not satisfied

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.110
 

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.110
hard work but I've tried to think of a

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120
hard work but I've tried to think of a
 

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.380
hard work but I've tried to think of a
better way to explain that you have

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.390
better way to explain that you have
 

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.270
better way to explain that you have
characters that you haven't given a

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:28.280
characters that you haven't given a
 

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.150
characters that you haven't given a
chance and you begin to think about them

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160
chance and you begin to think about them
 

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.490
chance and you begin to think about them
more and do something more quite

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:33.500
more and do something more quite
 

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.090
more and do something more quite
different

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100

sometimes with them and in my earlier

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:38.630
sometimes with them and in my earlier

sometimes with them and in my earlier
days I I was prone to a lot of flowery

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:41.630
days I I was prone to a lot of flowery
 

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.520
days I I was prone to a lot of flowery
prose and I would gradually learn to

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.530
prose and I would gradually learn to
 

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:50.230
prose and I would gradually learn to
take a lot of that out and and you just

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240
take a lot of that out and and you just
 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.930
take a lot of that out and and you just
you just go on thinking about it and

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:54.940
you just go on thinking about it and
 

00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.580
you just go on thinking about it and
getting more and more finding more and

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:00.590
getting more and more finding more and

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.900
would perhaps haven't thought I couldn't
do it but I don't think that would have

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:55.910
do it but I don't think that would have
 

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.100
do it but I don't think that would have
happened really I think it would have

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:57.110
happened really I think it would have
 

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.620
happened really I think it would have
happened for a while but then I wanted

00:14:59.620 --> 00:14:59.630
happened for a while but then I wanted
 

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.680
happened for a while but then I wanted
to write so much that I would have just

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:02.690
to write so much that I would have just
 

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.740
to write so much that I would have just
gone ahead and tried anyway

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:04.750

what's her writing a gift given to you I

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.310
what's her writing a gift given to you I
 

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.380
what's her writing a gift given to you I
don't think the people around they would

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.390
don't think the people around they would
 

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.550
don't think the people around they would
have thought that but I never thought of

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560
have thought that but I never thought of
 

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.960
have thought that but I never thought of
it as a gift I thought of it as

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:16.970
it as a gift I thought of it as
 

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.340
it as a gift I thought of it as
something that that you could do I could

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.350
something that that you could do I could
 

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.430
something that that you could do I could
do if I tried hard enough but I always

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440
do if I tried hard enough but I always
 

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.170
do if I tried hard enough but I always
thought of a trying hard enough

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.180
thought of a trying hard enough
 

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.900
thought of a trying hard enough
so if a gift it certainly wasn't an easy

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:28.910
so if a gift it certainly wasn't an easy
 

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.870
so if a gift it certainly wasn't an easy

very complicated because she was she was

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.140
very complicated because she was she was
 

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.680
very complicated because she was she was
sick she had Parkinson's disease only it

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:08.690
sick she had Parkinson's disease only it
 

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.330
sick she had Parkinson's disease only it
wasn't diagnosed there had been

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.340
wasn't diagnosed there had been
 

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.640
wasn't diagnosed there had been
Parkinson's disease epidemic when she

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:12.650
Parkinson's disease epidemic when she
 

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:18.370
Parkinson's disease epidemic when she
was young and she needed a lot of help

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:18.380
was young and she needed a lot of help
 

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.310
was young and she needed a lot of help
and she she was difficult her speech was

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320
and she she was difficult her speech was
 

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.170
and she she was difficult her speech was
difficult people couldn't tell what she

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:26.180
difficult people couldn't tell what she
 

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.660
difficult people couldn't tell what she
was saying and yet she was a very

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:28.670
was saying and yet she was a very
 

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.260
was saying and yet she was a very
gregarious person who wanted very much

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.270
gregarious person who wanted very much
 

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.760
gregarious person who wanted very much
to in to be part of a social life and of

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:36.770
to in to be part of a social life and of
 

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.550
to in to be part of a social life and of
course this wasn't possible for her

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560
course this wasn't possible for her
 

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:44.460
course this wasn't possible for her
because of her speech problems so I was

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:44.470
because of her speech problems so I was
 

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.940
because of her speech problems so I was
embarrassed by her I loved her

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:48.950
embarrassed by her I loved her
 

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:55.840
embarrassed by her I loved her
and I in a way perhaps didn't want to be

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:55.850
and I in a way perhaps didn't want to be
 

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.880
and I in a way perhaps didn't want to be
identified with her because I didn't

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:57.890
identified with her because I didn't
 

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.000
identified with her because I didn't
want to stand out and say the things

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.010
want to stand out and say the things
 

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.290
want to stand out and say the things
that she wanted me to say to people and

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:04.300
that she wanted me to say to people and
 

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.660
that she wanted me to say to people and
so it became a difficulty that any

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:09.670
so it became a difficulty that any
 

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.370

an admirable thing to be and the people
 

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.250
an admirable thing to be and the people
around me well most of them didn't know

around me well most of them didn't know
 

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.259

I wanted to be a writer because I made
 

00:18:16.269 --> 00:18:19.620
I wanted to be a writer because I made
sure they didn't find out but it would

sure they didn't find out but it would
 

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:23.840
sure they didn't find out but it would
have been to most people ridiculous

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:23.850
have been to most people ridiculous
 

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.340
have been to most people ridiculous
because people most people to that I

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.350
because people most people to that I
 

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.100
because people most people to that I
knew didn't read and they they took to

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.110
knew didn't read and they they took to
 

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.600
knew didn't read and they they took to
life in a very practical way and my

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:33.610
life in a very practical way and my
 

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.990
life in a very practical way and my
whole idea of life had to be rather

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000
whole idea of life had to be rather
 

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.909
whole idea of life had to be rather
sheltered from people they knew has it

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919
sheltered from people they knew has it
 

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:44.279
sheltered from people they knew has it
been hard to tell a true story from a

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:44.289
been hard to tell a true story from a

been hard to tell a true story from a
woman's perspective no not at all

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:46.779
woman's perspective no not at all
 

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:49.200
woman's perspective no not at all
because that's the way I think being a

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.210
because that's the way I think being a
 

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.730
because that's the way I think being a
woman at all and that's sort of it never
