00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.250
So what happens if you just make up an
IP address and port and try to NC to it?

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.470
Well, depending on the address you pick
you might get any of several different

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.660
results.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.850
NC might exit immediately.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.930
Or, it might just sit there and
do nothing for a while and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.810
then eventually exit with an error
saying that it timed out.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.964
You might have sometimes seen
similar errors from a web browser,

00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:23.808
talking about a connection timeout.

00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.970
TCP has a number of built in timers.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.370
If it takes too long to hear back from
the server we're trying to connect to,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.990
TCP will abandon the attempt
to make a connection and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.970
give an error to the application.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.290
There's another different timeout from
when our end has sent some data but

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.810
the other end hasn't yet responded.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.890
So when you're building applications
up at the web level that's something to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.970
keep in mind.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.560
Sometimes you'll send a query
to another endpoint and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.170
you won't get anything back.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.920
And whether the default behavior is
reasonable depends on an application.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.670
That's why various libraries,
such as Python's requests library,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.040
have the ability to set
a timeout on queries and

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.650
notice when that timeout has elapsed.
