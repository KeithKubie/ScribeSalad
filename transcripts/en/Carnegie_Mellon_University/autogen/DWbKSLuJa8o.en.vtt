things that are suitable for looking at
 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.520
things that are suitable for looking at
through a research program and and so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530
through a research program and and so
 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.859
through a research program and and so
among the questions we try to ask and

among the questions we try to ask and
 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.570
among the questions we try to ask and
answer are things like what options

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580
answer are things like what options
 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.040
answer are things like what options
actually are available to reduce

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050
actually are available to reduce
 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.960

what do they cost and what are some of
 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.529
what do they cost and what are some of
those trade-offs we also try to look and

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539
those trade-offs we also try to look and

for new improved technologies that have

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069
for new improved technologies that have
 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.089
for new improved technologies that have
lower costs or better performance and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099
lower costs or better performance and
 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.490
lower costs or better performance and
from a policy perspective what does one

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
from a policy perspective what does one
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800
from a policy perspective what does one
need to do how can we spur the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810
need to do how can we spur the
 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.110
need to do how can we spur the
technology innovations in fact that are

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
technology innovations in fact that are
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.059

needed to do a better and more
 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.020
needed to do a better and more
cost-effective job and finally we look
