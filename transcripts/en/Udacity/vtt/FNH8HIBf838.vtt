00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.703
So this is a lesson on
improving cache performance.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:06.397
There are many methods for
improving cache performance, but

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.673
in general,
they can be grouped in three categories.

00:00:09.673 --> 00:00:14.351
And these three categories
have to do with

00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:18.896
the average memory access time or AMAT,

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:25.992
which is equal to hit time + miss
rate x miss penalty of a cache.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:30.416
So pretty much if we always hit,
we get the hit time.

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:35.625
If we miss, we get the miss penalty and
how often we miss is the miss rate and

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:41.250
the average memory access time as seen
by the processor is equal to this.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.740
So the methods for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.630
improving cache performance can be
those that try to reduce the hit time,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.590
those that try to reduce the miss rate
or trying to reduce the miss penalty.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.160
All of these would reduce the average
memory access time, which improves

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.770
the overall performance of the processor
when it needs to access the cache.
