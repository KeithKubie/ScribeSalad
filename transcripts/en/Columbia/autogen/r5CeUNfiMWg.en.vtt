00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.200
presentations here we realized that we
were in a unique position to build a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
were in a unique position to build a
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.600

and we also discovered that there were
 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.810
and we also discovered that there were
very few established best practices in
