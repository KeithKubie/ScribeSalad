00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:02.721
- The functions y is equal to eight

00:00:02.721 --> 00:00:04.984
times 3/4 to the x power,

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:08.908
and y is equal to 1/8
times 7/4 to the x power

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.241
are graphed in the xy-plane.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.681
Which of the following statements

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.805
accurately describes whether each function

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:18.148
is always increasing or decreasing?

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:19.518
So let's look at each of these functions.

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:24.227
So this first function right over here,

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.789
let's see, as x increases, what happens?

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.284
Well as x increases, we're
going to multiply by 3/4.

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:34.243
We're going to raise 3/4 to
higher and higher powers.

00:00:34.243 --> 00:00:36.205
And every time you multiply by 3/4,

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:37.889
you're actually going
to decrease its value.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:40.443
Let's just draw a little table here.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:44.425
So if this is x, and if this is y,

00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:48.824
when x is zero, well 3/4
to the zero is just one.

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:51.251
And then y is just going
to be equal to eight.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.888
When x is one, it's going to be

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:55.929
eight times 3/4 to the first power.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.380
When x is two, it's going to be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.047
eight times 3/4 times 3/4.

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:03.347
When x is three, it's going to be

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:08.347
eight times 3/4 times 3/4 times 3/4.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.150
And every time you multiply by 3/4,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.449
you're going to get a smaller number.

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:13.679
If I take 3/4 of something,

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.525
you're going to get a smaller value.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:19.263
So as x increases, y is decreasing.

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:24.263
So this right over here
is a decreasing function.

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:25.985
Now what about this one over here?

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:29.758
Y is equal to 1/8 times
7/4 to the x power?

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:31.859
Well here as x increases,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.599
you're going to multiply by
7/4 more and more and more.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.340
And so when you multiply by 7/4,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.022
7/4 is greater than one.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:41.657
Increasing powers of 7/4

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:43.504
will make the entire value larger.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:45.744
It doesn't matter that you
started with a lower value.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:48.518
As x increases, y is going to become

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:50.167
larger and larger and larger.

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:52.616
So this is an increasing function.

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:54.764
And the way these functions are defined,

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:56.727
you can have more than just

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:59.025
whole number or integer values of x,

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.777
but these are good,
these are indicative ways

00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:04.423
to just think about well
what happens as x increases.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.582
So as x increases, y increases.

00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:10.076
Here, as x increases, y decreases.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:13.489
So the graphs of both functions
are always increasing? Nope.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.766
That's not right.

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.891
The graphs of both functions
are always decreasing? Nope.

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.514
This one's decreasing,
this one's increasing.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.544
The graph of y is equal to
eight times 3/4 to the x

00:02:22.544 --> 00:02:23.868
is always increasing? Nope.

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:25.609
That one's decreasing.

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.465
The graph of y is equal to
eight times 3/4 to the x

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:30.067
is always decreasing.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:30.845
That's right.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:34.329
As x increases, as you move
to the right on the x axis,

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.605
your y value is going to get

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.613
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:41.223
And the graph of y is equal
to 1/8 times 7/4 to the x

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:42.187
is always increasing.

00:02:42.187 --> 00:02:42.825
That's right.

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.346
As x increases, you're going

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:46.691
higher and higher powers of 7/4,

00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:48.247
and the more you multiply by 7/4,

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:50.187
the larger your overall
value's going to get,

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:52.484
because 7/4 is larger than one.

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:55.497
So this one is right.
