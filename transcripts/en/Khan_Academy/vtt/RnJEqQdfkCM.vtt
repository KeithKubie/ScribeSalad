00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.150
Problem 20.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.610
The expression 5 to the minus
8 times 7 to the minus 9 is

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.160
equal to which of
the following?

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.000
And here we see a bunch
of answers.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.090
Let's see, where they
have a 35 there.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.210
So I suspect that they want to
have us somehow multiply the 5

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.690
times the 7.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.890
So let me write this in terms
that I have an easier time

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.570
understanding it.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.660
So, 5 to the minus 8 times
7 to the minus 9.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.070
That's the same thing as 1
over 5 to the 8 times 1

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.830
over 7 to the 9.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.690
The negative in the exponent
just means one over the base

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.310
to the positive exponent, that's
all the negative means.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.450
That's equal to 1 over 5 to
the 8 times 7 to the 9.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.920
And that's not one
of our answers.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.230
Somehow we have to multiply
the 5 and the 7.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.580
And the way we can do that is
by having the same exponent.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.070
So let me rewrite 7 to the 9.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.080
I can rewrite that as 7 to
the eighth power times 7.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.330
So then, our whole expression
becomes 1 over 5 to the 8

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.660
times 7 to the 8 times 7.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.210
All right, I just
rewrote this.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.380
I rewrote 7 to the ninth as
7 to the eighth times 7.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.100
But now if I group this, just
put parentheses around it, I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.850
can do that because
multiplication is associative.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.420
It doesn't matter what
order I do it.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.160
This is the same thing
as 5 times 7 to the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.390
eighth power, right?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.875
a to the x times b to the x is
the same thing as ab to the x,

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:36.630
so the same thing as 5 times
7 to the eighth power.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.160
So this is equal 1 over-- 5
times 7 to the eighth power is

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.800
35 to the eighth
power times 7.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.220
This piece, right here, is 35 to
the eighth power, and then

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.300
you have your 7.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.540
And then that is choice
B, right there.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.430
They just switched the order
of the 7 and the 35 to the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.060
eighth power.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.290
21.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.430
Use the diagram below
to answer the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.270
question that follows.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.530
OK, they just have numbers
listed in order and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.460
have five per row.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.870
Which of the following algebraic
equations could best

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.960
be used to explain why, for any
3 by 3 cross, like the one

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.520
shown above, the sum of the
numbers in the vertical

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.510
rectangle-- so this is the
vertical rectangle, right

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.120
there-- is equal to the
sum of the numbers in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.310
the horizontal rectangle.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.650
So the horizontal rectangle
is that right there.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.260
So let's look at this
a little bit.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.410
What's the sum in the
vertical rectangle?

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.870
If we call this number x, let
me just draw it generally.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.590
Let me draw as best I can.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.310
If that middle entry
is x, what's the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.870
entry right above that?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.770
Well no matter where you go,
it's going to be 5 less,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.420
that's because we have
5 per row, right?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.350
14 minus 5 is 9.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.210
12 minus 5 is 7.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.330
8 minus 5 is 3.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.950
So this is going to
be x minus 5.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.040
By the same logic, if you go
down a row, you're adding 5.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.470
14 plus 5 is 19.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.910
15 plus 5 is 20.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.010
So this is going
to be x plus 5.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.620
So the sum of the entries in the
vertical column, the sum

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.040
of the numbers in the vertical
rectangle are x minus 5 plus x

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.200
plus x plus 5.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.270
So that's the sum in the
vertical column.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.420
And then in the horizontal
column, if this is x, what's

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.090
this going to be?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.280
It's just one below that.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.220
It's x minus 1, and then
to the right of it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.170
is just x plus 1.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.640
So the sum in the horizontal
column is going to be x minus

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.980
1 plus x plus x plus 1.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.460
Now let's see if any of these
choices look like what I just

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.570
wrote down.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.000
A bunch of 9's.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.620
Maybe, so that's simplified.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.440
Here you go.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.500
This looks very similar.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.910
Actually this is exactly what
I wrote up here if you just

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.010
switch the left- and the
right-hand side.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.710
And you can do that because
there's equality.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.180
They wrote this here, and
they wrote this here.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.660
So this is what I could use to
prove that the sum of the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.995
vertical rectangle is equal to
the sum of the horizontal.

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:14.720
If I wanted to keep going, you'd
notice that these 5's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.000
would cancel out, these 1's
would cancel out, you'd get 3x

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.829
is equal to 3x.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.310
And that would be, that would
complete your proof.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.560
Next problem.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.970
A landscaper bought some
decorative cement blocks from

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.110
a landscaping store.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.960
The supplier charged 5%
sales tax, and the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.150
total came to $315.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.760
All right, 315 after 5%.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.720
Without the tax, the landscaper
could have bought

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.930
six more blocks for the same
total cost. How many blocks

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.480
did the landscaper buy?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.900
If p represents the price
of one block.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.030
OK, p is the price one block.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.560
In which of the following
equations does x represent the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.520
answer to the problem.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.970
But remember, the answer to
the problem is, how many

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.170
blocks did the landscaper buy?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.970
So x equals blocks.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.900
x is equal to blocks bought.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.570
Now, this first equation says
that after paying 5% sales

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.160
tax-- so before tax, he bought
x blocks, he payed p for each

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.910
of those blocks.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.580
That's what they tell
us right here.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.890
So this is the pretax price.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.940
p per blocks times x blocks is
how much he pays, but he has

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.350
to pay sales tax on that.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.480
He has to pay 5% of that on
top of that as sales tax.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.130
So plus 0.05-- that's the same
thing as 5%-- times whatever

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.170
the pretax value is.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.840
And that's going to
be equal to $315.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.910
And then this, we could just
add the coefficients.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.520
This is a 1 out here, right?

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.620
1 plus 0.05 is 1.05
times price times

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.610
quantity is equal to 315.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.300
And let's see if we have
anything like that over here

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.430
in our answers.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.050
Which equation does x represent
the answer to the

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.740
problem above?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:21.050
0.95 px, price, he bought six
more without the tax.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.030
So another way you can think
about it, if you didn't have

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.240
tax, $315 would have been
the price without tax.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.680
So let's see if that simplifies,
because I don't

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.610
see exactly what I wrote here
from that first equation.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.980
So without the tax, he could
have bought x plus 6, if there

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.900
was no tax.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.290
So he would have bought x plus
6 for p per block, and then

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.500
that is going to be
equal to 315.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.190
This is the situation
with no tax.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.470
If there was no tax, for $315 he
could have bought six more

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.690
than he originally bought.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.460
So this is what the second,
this-- let me graph it.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.580
Without the tax.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.390
So this first equation came
from the first sentence.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.710
The second equation comes from
this red sentence, right here.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.680
Let's see if we see
this anywhere.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.770
p times x plus 6 is
equal to 315.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.400
I don't see that
anywhere here.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.850
But we can see-- we can do
something interesting.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.770
We can use all of the
information from the problem.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.410
Remember, the first problem, it
said, the supplier charged

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.450
5% sales tax, and the
total came to 315.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.930
That gave us this equation,
right here.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.660
The second one said, without
the tax, for $315 he could

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.230
have bought six more blocks.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.760
So we get this one,
right here.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.180
Notice, both of these
equations equal 315.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.460
So we could set this
equal to that.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:55.760
So we could say p times x
plus 6 is equal to 1.05

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.020
times price times x.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.810
And let's see if that looks like
anything we have here.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:09.710
So we have, let's see, p times
x plus 6 is equal to 1.05px.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.420
So the answer is
C, right there.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.170
We're just saying, both of these
things equal 315, so we

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.950
set them equal to each other.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.880
Problem 23.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.810
A store that sells handcrafted
items-- let me pick a nice

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.600
highlighting color-- a store
that sells handcrafted items

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.370
takes $3 per item plus
40% of the sale price

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.280
for each item sold.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.520
OK, the rest of the money--
takes $3 per item plus 40% of

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.860
the sale price for each item
sold-- the rest of the money

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.440
from the item sales goes
to the craft person.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.740
That's nice of them.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.010
All items sold cost
$5 or more.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:09:00.320
OK, if p represents the sale
price of one item, which of

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.670
the following expressions
represents the amount of money

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.530
the craft person gets
for each item sold?

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.560
So you start off with p.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.540
That's how much the
customer gives.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.010
And then the store takes $3.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.790
So p minus 3, plus 40%
of the sale price.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.480
So not 40% of after the
$3, it says plus

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.110
40% of the sale price.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.940
So the store is going to take
another 40%, right?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:32.150
0.4, or 0.40, times
the sales price.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.110
So the store takes $3 and then
40% of the sales price.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.580
And this is what the
craft person gets.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.600

This is what craft
person gets.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.780
So what is this?

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:52.980
This is p-- switch colors-- p
minus 0.4p is 0.6p, then you

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.080
have the minus 3.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.635
That's what the craft
person gets.

00:09:55.635 --> 00:09:57.590

They wrote it all
as fractions.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.080
0.6 is the same thing
as 6/10 p minus 3.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.750
6/10 is the same thing
as 3/5 p minus 3.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.080
So it's 3/5 p minus 3.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.360
