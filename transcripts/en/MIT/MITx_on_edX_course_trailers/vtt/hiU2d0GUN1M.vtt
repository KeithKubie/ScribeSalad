ERIC KLOPFER: Educational technologies
have the potential to transform how we

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.880
teach and learn, but realising that
potential is a significant challenge.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.060
To be effective, these
technologies need to be

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.670
designed based on what we
know about how people learn

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.250
and how they interact with technology.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.710
Learning, however, is not
a straightforward matter.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.860
Knowledge can be as
complex as the students

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.930
and groups of students
engaged in learning.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.930
That's why it's helpful
to have an understanding

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.500
of existing educational
theories, frameworks,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.650
and rich history of
previous efforts that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.750
can inform the design
of learning experiences.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.620
Hello, I'm Eric Klopfer.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.580
I'm a professor of education at MIT,
where I run the Scheller Teacher

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.344
Education program and
the Education Arcade.

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:44.760
You're here because you have
an interest in the enterprise

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.550
of educational technology, be it the
development aspects, product design,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.850
or the underlying theories.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.120
So welcome to Design and Development
of Educational Technology,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.640
the first of MIT's Ed
TechX course series.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.430
We hope and expect that you come
from a variety of backgrounds

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.590
with varied experience in
education and/or technology.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.191
This course is different--
or at least I hope it is.

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.690
We're not only trying to teach
you about some important past

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.580
and present educational technologies,
and good pedagogical practices,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.520
but we're also trying to practice what
we preach through the course itself.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.770
Throughout this course, we'll
travel across the nation

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.280
to talk with a variety of experts
working with educational technology,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.020
including educators,
researchers, and developers.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.440
Through interviews, informal lectures,
and on-location case studies,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.440
we'll hear more about
the tools they designed,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.380
the theories their
designs were based on,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.360
and what they found out
about how they were used.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.190
This course culminates
in a final project--

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.410
a Kickstarter-style pitch for
a new educational technology

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.020
that will serve as
proof of your learning.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.310
There will be no grades.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.960
This is your chance to design your own
technology-based learning experience

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.317
and gather feedback from your peers.

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:53.150
The real source of learning in this
course, however, comes from you.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.920
Throughout this six-week course,
you'll be an active participant

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.790
engaging with the exciting
ideas introduced in the course

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.880
through your projects and your
interactions with fellow learners.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.790
In fact, developing this course
is part of our own process

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.500
here at MIT-- of discovering what works
best in online learning environments.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.210
This is only the beginning.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.160
Educational technology is
a rapidly-expanding field,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.380
but the best practitioners
know that you can't just

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
mash education and technology
together carelessly.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.260
It's a delicate process
to develop technology

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.020
from an educational approach, and
here, at Design and Development

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.680
of Educational Technology,
we'll show you how.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.810
We're excited to begin
the adventure with you.
