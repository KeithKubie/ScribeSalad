00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:15.586
&gt;&gt;My name is Dylan.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:21.406
I'm thirteen years old
and I'm an eighth grader

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:24.356
at Gilbert H. Hood Middle School.

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.656
When I was really young my
mom set me up on the computer

00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:32.656
with this huge ball mouse,
with the most gigantic button

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:33.456
in the front of it.

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:38.256
And I used educational
tools on the computer

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:41.606
to help me learn my
phonics and my alphabet.

00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:45.866
I'm not sure if I would know my
alphabet if I didn't have technology.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:53.806
&gt;&gt;At seven fifteen, I go to the
high school for my math class.

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:58.466
&gt;&gt;I'm just not gonna talk
about Michelle Obama's fashion.

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:02.196
&gt;&gt;At about eight, I go to
my regular middle school

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:03.386
for the rest of my classes.

00:01:03.386 --> 00:01:05.946
&gt;&gt;Kimberly: You have three
choices on how you would

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:10.026
like to represent your
reflections in your website coding.

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:14.696
And Dylan's gonna be actually
picking his technology piece today.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:19.766
&gt;&gt;Dylan chose to just make a podcast
so that he could voice record himself

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.186
into Garage Band, export
it as an iTunes file

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:25.406
and then he embedded
it into his web page.

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.276
&gt;&gt;Dylan: I've grown to see
that the experience I have

00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:30.356
in middle school are much different

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.236
than the ones I've had
in elementary school.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.786
&gt;&gt;Peter: In the fall of
2007, Dylan approached me,

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:42.256
asking if I'd be a coach for
him for his ThinkQuest project.

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:45.356
I had never heard of ThinkQuest
before, but when I read

00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:46.496
about it, I was fascinated.

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:51.136
It's a global contest
where students form a team

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:55.886
and create a website that's supposed
to be both informative and fun

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.306
or entertaining for
children, to raise awareness

00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:00.476
of whatever issue they
decide to focus on.

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:02.686
Through his other projects,

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:05.256
he had already made connections
with other students around the world

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:07.386
that he wanted to be
part of this team

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:13.196
and he knew exactly
what he wanted to do.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:16.716
&gt;&gt;Dylan: The project we were working
on was called Sentenced for Life

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:23.096
and we were working on a website,
trying to get more people aware

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:27.826
about animal cruelty and how it
could be possible to stop it.

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:36.106
We used online forums
and chats and conferences

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:38.766
to communicate with each other.

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:43.016
I collaborated with other
children from Argentina,

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:47.326
Japan and India to
work on this project.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:51.206
&gt;&gt;Peter: It's funny, because
I'm a child of the fifties.

00:02:51.206 --> 00:02:55.006
I remember having projects
in my class where two

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.666
or three students said,
"We can't work on this

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:58.806
at home 'cause we live a
mile away from each other."

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:02.956
And in Dylan's project, they
were collaborating continually.

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.946
And again, it blows me
away that students all

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.156
over the world can have
these daily discussions.

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:13.686
&gt;&gt;Dylan: I think it's pretty amazing
to be able to have a conversation

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:17.856
with people from other countries
that easily, but honestly,

00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:22.036
since I've been doing it for a
really long time, I've gotten used

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:22.956
to that being able to happen.

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:29.556
[Dylan playing piano]

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:33.686
&gt;&gt;Krithika: He writes
songs, he composes music,

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.546
he makes ring tones, downloads them.

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:38.906
He makdes videos, publishes
them, you know, on YouTube,

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:43.056
he has karates on somedays.

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:45.476
&gt;&gt;Dyland: Three, two, one, go.

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:48.966
&gt;&gt;Krithika: He walks around with
friends, carrying his flip camera.

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:51.746
They take random video clips.

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:52.846
&gt;&gt;Boy 1: Hey, you guys.

00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:54.656
Eat frozen H2O.

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:58.406
&gt;&gt;Dylan: Oh, I wish
I was still filming.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:02.646
&gt;&gt;Krithika: When they go out
to shoot it, they have no idea,

00:04:02.646 --> 00:04:04.756
but when they come back
they would spend twenty,

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:08.566
thirty minutes putting it together
and sometimes it's just hilarious.

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.396
&gt;&gt;Ha, ha, you fell for it.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:12.326
&gt;&gt;Krithika: They come
up with something

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.186
which is really interesting.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:19.166
I think it's made him a very creative
person using all these technologies.

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.336
&gt;&gt;Kristin: Dylan and two other
students have come together.

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:25.536
They're three very close friends
and they sort of live by the motto

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.386
that going green isn't a
choice, it's a responsibility.

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:33.406
He started a website, GreenYourLives
.org, and that sort of holds all

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.916
of the information that his
team is working on currently.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:41.766
&gt;&gt;Dylan: The Go Green initative,
I'm working with a few teachers.

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.326
We're making movies and flyers to put

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:48.836
up to help get the school
district to start going green.

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:53.616
And we actually now
have all seven schools

00:04:53.616 --> 00:04:56.126
in the school district doing that.

00:04:57.356 --> 00:05:01.146
&gt;&gt;When I talk to people the
communication takes place

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:03.836
through this chat box here.

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:10.766
I like to use WebX because it
allows me to show what's going

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:15.606
on on my computer screen to someone
that could be extremely far away.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:19.786
That ripple effect was a transition.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:25.386
And I'm showing video to the other
people that are in the meeting

00:05:25.386 --> 00:05:29.186
to get them to help review.

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:31.946
&gt;&gt;Okay, guys, guys, join.

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:39.716
&gt;&gt;For fun, I go online and I play
video games where you can collaborate

00:05:40.016 --> 00:05:43.136
with other people in a
completely different location.

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:47.176
&gt;&gt;Peter: When I was in school,
the expression was "Think globally

00:05:47.336 --> 00:05:50.196
and act locally," you know, 'cause
that was basically the only option.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:05:52.766
&gt;&gt;Dylan: Hello, I invited
you to a game.

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:54.976
&gt;&gt;Peter: But I look at
Dylan and realize that no,

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:58.126
these kids can think
globally and act globally too.

00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:00.696
&gt;&gt;All right, we got
it, Okay, let's go.

00:06:01.146 --> 00:06:04.986
&gt;&gt;Dylan: Yesterday's film
is very, very simple;

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:09.966
Two of my friends started throwing
snowballs at two of my other friends.

00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:11.266
&gt;&gt;All right, ready?

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:13.176
Three, two, one.

00:06:13.296 --> 00:06:16.446
&gt;&gt;Boy 1: Hey, you guys,
eat frozen H2O.

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:20.416
&gt;&gt;Boy 2: Ha, ha, you fell for it.

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:23.106
&gt;&gt;Dylan: We usually come up
with better plots than that.

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.476
&gt;&gt;Okay, that's good.

00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:27.336
&gt;&gt;Hey, that was horrible.

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:34.336
