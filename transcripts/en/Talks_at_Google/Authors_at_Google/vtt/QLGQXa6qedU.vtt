LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
Thanks, Bjorn.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.710
And I've really been looking
forward to coming today.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.160
I actually grew up just
a stone's throw away

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.982
in Stuyvesant Town, and my
dad owned a toy store right

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:19.190
across the street from there.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.120
So it's always fun
to come home but also

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.570
because a lot of my work
recently, in the last decade

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.580
or so, has been on the
history of science.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.228
And I actually use
Google tools all the time

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:32.770
when I'm doing that
work, and they're

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.500
extraordinarily helpful.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.760
So it's a pleasure to have a
chance to talk with you today.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.830
So I'm going to start
with a question, right?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.870
Suppose that you could
build the perfect dog.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.670
What would be the key
ingredients in your recipe?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.720
Well, you definitely want
cute, right-- maybe something

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.600
with floppy ears
and a curly tail

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.650
that wags in anticipation
whenever you're around.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.930
You'd want smart.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.880
You'd want loyal,
and you'd definitely

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.360
want unconditional love.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.240
The thing is that
you do not need

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.310
to build this animal because,
for the last 60 years,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.110
a dedicated team of Russian
geneticists in Siberia

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.480
have been building it for you--

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.620
the perfect dog--
except, as you might

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.820
guess from the title of today's
talk, it's not a dog at all.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.230
It's a fox-- a domesticated fox.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.030
They built this in the
minus-40-degree winters

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.500
of Siberia, but
more importantly,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.660
they built it in the blink of
an eye in terms of evolutionary

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.500
time--

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.730
a hundredth of the time
that it took our ancestors

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.440
to domesticate wolves into dogs.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.820
This is my friend and colleague
and co-author Lyudmila Trut.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.220
Lyudmila recently
turned 85 years old,

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.610
and every day including
today for the last 60 years

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.960
she has led what's come to
be known as the silver fox

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.630
domestication experiment.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.380
And for the last 10
years or so, I've

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.430
had the honor of working with
her as a historian of science

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.810
to tell the story of what they
have done to as many people

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.690
as we possibly can.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.450
So today, I am going to tell you
about domesticated foxes that

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.810
will melt your hearts
and lick your ears just

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.910
like this guy did five seconds
after they put him into my arms

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.415
in Siberia.

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:55.790
More than that,
though, I'm going

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.190
to tell you about
cutting edge work

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.760
on this process of
domestication, which is not

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.540
something only of
interest to biologists

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.440
because, if you think about
it, when our ancestors began

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.420
domesticating
plants and animals,

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.250
we dramatically changed our
own evolutionary history.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.687
We would be very, very different
if we had not done that.

00:03:19.687 --> 00:03:21.770
And this experiment that
we're going to talk about

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.070
is the gold standard
for understanding

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.220
how domestication comes about.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.030
So I'm going to try and
give you an overview

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.020
of what they've been doing
and why it's important.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.620
60 years-- the experiment
starts with this fellow,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.790
Dmitri Belyaev.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.710
In the late 1930s, Belyaev
was an undergraduate student

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.010
at a place called the
Ivanova Agricultural Academy

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.740
outside of Moscow.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.800
And while he was there,
he studied genetics,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.530
and because it was an
agricultural academy,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.330
he had all sorts of interactions
with domesticated species.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.550
When he graduated Ivanova, like
every Soviet male of that era,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.230
he went and fought in World
War II for four years.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.220
After that, he came back
and landed a position

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.820
as a research scientist at
a place called the Central

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.610
Research Laboratory for
Fur Breeding Animals,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.980
also in Moscow.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.840
And it was there
that Belyaev came up

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.060
with the idea that
would eventually

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.900
become the silver fox
domestication experiment.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.570
And it started like this--

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.270
he knew from his interaction
with domesticated species

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.660
and also from reading
Darwin's famous book

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.470
about domestication-- he knew
that many domesticated animals

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.110
share a whole suite
of characteristics.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.250
So they tend to have things like
floppy ears and curly tails.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.610
They also tend to have
sort of juvenilized body

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.660
and facial features compared
to their wild ancestors.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.940
They tend to have low
stress hormone levels.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.100
They tend to have all sorts of
variation in their coat color,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.130
and they also typically
have much longer

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.750
reproductive seasons than
their wild ancestors.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.000
Not every domesticated
animal has

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.170
every one of those
characteristics,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.050
but most have many of those
characteristics, so much so

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.820
that that whole thing--

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.550
the floppy ears, the curly
tails, the low stress hormone--

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.752
all that is referred to today
as the domestication syndrome.

00:05:41.752 --> 00:05:44.335
And Belyaev thought about this,
and he thought, you know, this

00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:50.320
is really weird because our
ancestors domesticated species

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.430
for all sorts of
different reasons.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.250
Some, like horses,
we domesticated

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.600
for transportation.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.890
Others we domesticated
as food sources.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.910
And yet others, like
dogs, we domesticated

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.930
for some combination of
protection and companionship.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.980
Yet, regardless of what
we domesticate them for,

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.260
they tend to have many
of the characteristics

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.160
in the domestication syndrome.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.726
Why?

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:20.380
And Belyaev's hypothesis
went like this--

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.620
the one thing that
our ancestors always

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.190
needed in whatever species
they were trying to domesticate

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.810
was an animal that would not
try and bite their heads off.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.470
And so he hypothesized
that the earliest stages

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.870
of all animal
domestication events

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.530
involved our ancestors
choosing the calmest, tamest,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.120
friendliest towards
human animals.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.430
He further hypothesized
that, somehow--

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.350
and he really didn't know how--

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.200
but somehow, all of those
other characteristics

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.320
in the domestication syndrome--
longer reproductive periods,

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.860
juvenilized facial
features-- all

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.530
that was somehow genetically
connected to choosing animals

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.390
based on how friendly
they were towards humans.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.010
And he decided he would test
these ideas in real time,

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.070
using the foxes
that he became very

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.940
familiar with at the Laboratory
for Fur Breeding Animals

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.300
because, at that laboratory,
the two key species they worked

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.980
with were foxes and mink
because there was so much money

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.210
associated with fox
fur and mink fur.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.110
So he decided he would
test these ideas in foxes.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.000
And the experiment he envisioned
was very basic at its core.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.870
He imagined testing
hundreds of foxes

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.280
and choosing the calmest ones--

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.790
the ones that are most
friendly towards humans--

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.610
preferentially breeding them.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.700
Then when their pups
grow up, test them.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.440
Preferentially
choose the ones that

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.120
are friendliest towards humans.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.480
Do this generation after
generation after generation.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.940
Foxes breed once a year,
so essentially one year

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.220
equals generation.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.730
He would do this
every generation.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.640
And he would see--

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.170
first of all, was he, in fact,
getting inherently calmer,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:22.030
friendlier to human animals,
and strictly choosing them

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.700
based on how friendly
they were, did he also

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.150
begin to see the
emergence of other traits

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.820
in the domestication syndrome?

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.309
Did they start showing
lower stress hormone

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.159
levels or other characteristics
of domestication syndrome?

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:45.520
This is a classic experiment
in evolution and genetics,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.460
but Belyaev had a problem,
and it was a big problem

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:57.110
because, as he came up with
this idea in the mid-1940s,

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:03.550
it was a time when it was
illegal to do modern genetics

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.100
in the Soviet Union.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.770
And the reason
that it was illegal

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.040
was because of this
person right here--

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.330
Trofim Lysenko.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.030
Lysenko was a
fraud, a charlatan,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.420
a pseudo-scientist
who had risen up

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.590
both in the scientific and
political ranks of the Soviet

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.030
Union.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:33.420
And what Lysenko said was
that modern genetics was

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.720
bourgeois science being
promulgated by wreckers

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.750
and spies from the West,
that instead, he argued,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:48.580
a long disproven idea known
as Lamarckian inheritance

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:54.310
was, in fact, not only
correct but more in line

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.280
with Soviet philosophy.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.030
He then went and made
up a bunch of studies

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.140
that he never did to suggest
that he was, in fact, right.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.610
And by doing this, he rows
up to become, not only one

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.900
of the most powerful
scientists in the Soviet Union,

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.060
but Stalin's right-hand
man on science.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.970
So this picture comes
from a conference

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.450
where Lysenko was giving one
of these fire-spitting talks,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.170
calling Western geneticists
saboteurs and wreckers.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.220
And when he finished, Stalin
stood up and yelled out,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.430
bravo, comrade Lysenko.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.750
Because of Lysenko, thousands
of Soviet geneticists

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:46.440
lost their jobs, hundreds
were thrown into prison,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.000
and about 20 were actually
murdered by Lysenko's thugs

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.840
for doing the crime of
modern Western genetics.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.610
This is the environment in
which Belyaev is conceiving

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.380
an experiment in genetics.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.870
Nobody knows better
how dangerous

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.890
this is because one
of those 20 people who

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.610
was murdered by Lysenko was
Belyaev's older brother--

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.130
20 years older--
who had been an up

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.720
and coming star in
the field of genetics.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.470
But Belyaev decided
this was too important,

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.330
and he was going to do it.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.290
So he initiates a tiny,
little pilot study.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.450
He has a friend who runs
a fox farm in Estonia,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.550
and there are hundreds
of these fox farms

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.040
around the Soviet Union
and their satellites

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.380
because, again,
there's so much money

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.230
selling fox furs to the West.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.730
So he talks to one
of his colleagues

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.220
in Estonia, who runs one
of these smaller farms,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.975
and he says, here's
what I wanted to do.

00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:54.750
I want to do an
experiment, where I select

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.743
the calmest, tamest ones.

00:11:56.743 --> 00:11:58.160
And it's a small
pilot experiment.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.640
It involves testing a couple
of dozen foxes every year--

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.880
test them on how friendly or
not they are towards humans,

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.010
breed the ones that
are friendliest.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.310
And he and his colleagues do
this for four or five years,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.680
and the results are promising.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.460
Even in that short
amount of time,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.150
they began to see animals
that were inherently

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.870
a little friendlier
towards humans.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.230
Then Belyaev gets his
big chance to start

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.490
a full-blown experiment in 1958.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:37.580
What happens is he is offered
a position as vice director

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.840
at a new institute
of biology in Siberia

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.730
in a place called Novosibirsk.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.220
And this institute is
part of a place that

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.850
still exists today called
Akademgorodok, or the Academic

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.870
Village.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.410
Basically, what happened was,
in the mid- to late-1950s,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.600
the Soviet political leaders
and scientists worked together,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.820
and what they did
was they cleared out

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.780
a large chunk of Siberian
forests near Novosibirsk,

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.610
and they built two dozen
world class institutes

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.500
in associated science.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.840
So there was the institute
that Belyaev was involved

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.360
in as vice director in biology.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.330
There were institutes in
chemistry, physics, early

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.320
computer science,
and so on, and so on.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.220
They literally brought
in tens of thousands

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.140
of scientists and
associated people

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.450
to build this Academic Village.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.240
So Belyaev knows now
that, as vice director

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.840
of this new institute
of biology there,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.210
that he is going to have
the power and the money

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:49.230
to start a full-blown silver
fox domestication experiment.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.080
But because of all the
administrative stuff

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.900
he's going to have to do as
vice director, what he's not

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.570
going to have is the
time to be the person

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.730
to lead the experiment
on a day-to-day basis.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.220
So right before he moves to
Akademgorodok, while he's still

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.210
in Moscow, he goes on a hunt
for the perfect young scientist

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.080
to lead this experiment,
and he does this

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.780
by going to Moscow State
University, which is not

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.930
only one of the best but one of
the most beautiful universities

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:19.500
in the world.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.860
And he talks to some
colleagues he has there,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.120
and he lays out the
ideas and says he's

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.620
looking for a young scientist.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.350
So one of the people who comes
into interview for the job

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.560
is 25-year-old Lyudmila.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.930
The interview happened in 1958.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.830
When you talk to her today, it
seems as if it happened just

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.760
yesterday.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.650
The first thing that struck her
was that Belyaev immediately

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.910
treated her like an equal.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.070
So in 1958, Soviet science
was very patriarchal.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.500
But here was a vice
director of an institute

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.080
talking to a newly
minted undergraduate

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.450
and treating them like an equal.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.260
And that mattered.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.240
So Belyaev lays out the idea.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.370
We're going to test hundreds
of foxes every year.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.020
We're going to
choose the calmest,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.515
most friendly towards
human foxes, breed them.

00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:10.640
We're going to do this
generation after generation,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.130
see-- do we get more
calmer and calmer animals,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.800
and do we begin to see
floppy ears and curly tails

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.170
and all the stuff in the
domestication syndrome.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.965
And Lyudmila loves the idea.

00:15:19.965 --> 00:15:21.590
She thinks it's a
brilliant experiment,

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.570
and she also likes
the idea of moving

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.250
to this new scientific oasis
in the middle of Siberia.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.670
But before she gets too excited,
Belyaev stops her and says,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.800
look, you need to know
a couple of things.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.860
First of all, even though
Lysenko is not as powerful

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.760
as he used to be, if he decided
to make an example of us,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.560
he could still throw
us into prison.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.680
Lyudmila knew that anyone who
studied biology knew that,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.430
but it meant something that
Belyaev stopped her and said,

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.480
think about this.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.938
And the other thing he said
was, I've run this little pilot

00:15:54.938 --> 00:15:55.480
experiment.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.260
It's promising.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.650
But this is an
experiment in evolution.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.740
It could take 10 years before
we find anything interesting.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.090
It could take 20 years.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.670
She remembers Belyaev
saying to her,

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.130
it could take your whole life.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.565
But she was hooked.

00:16:10.565 --> 00:16:11.440
He liked what he saw.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.940
He offered her the position.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.550
Six months later,
Lyudmila, her husband,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.280
and their two-year-old daughter
hop on a train from Moscow

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.920
to Siberia, which is
no easy train ride,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.370
to begin the
full-blown experiment.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.980
From day one, Lyudmila
would tell you

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:32.050
that her motto comes directly
from the wonderful children's

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.310
book, "The Little Prince," where
the fox tells the little prince

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.770
that you become
responsible forever

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.630
for what you have tamed.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.520
So Lyudmila gets there, and
Belyaev has money and power.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.750
But he still hasn't been able
to procure a very large area

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.410
to build a fox farm
right in Akademgorodok,

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.020
where they could
do the experiment.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.760
He's working on that.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.890
He's planning to do it.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.540
But at the start, there
is no such place yet.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.970
So for the first
year or so, Lyudmila

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.802
travels around the Soviet
Union to all of the-- you

00:17:07.802 --> 00:17:10.010
know, to many of these fox
farms I've told you about.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.130
All of them are owned by
the government, of course.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.900
And she's trying to
find the perfect place

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.329
to start the experiment
until they have some place

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.700
at Akademgorodok to move it to.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.310
And eventually, she
settles on one place

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.300
known as the Lesnoi Fox Farm.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.760
It's an overnight, about 12-hour
train ride from Akademgorodok,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.940
and Lyudmila's plan is that
she'll go down there four times

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.800
a year.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.550
Some visits will be
for a couple of weeks.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.342
Other visits will be
for a couple of months

00:17:36.342 --> 00:17:39.090
to start the
full-blown experiment.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.780
So this place
Lesnoi is gigantic.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.170
It's a cash cow for
the Soviet government.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.330
At any given time, there could
be 10,000 foxes at Lesnoi,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:55.913
all being bred for pretty fur.

00:17:55.913 --> 00:17:57.830
And when Lyudmila first
talked to the director

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.690
there and said what
she wanted to do,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.290
he looked at her
like she was nuts.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.530
Why would anyone want to
waste their time trying

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.490
to build a friendlier fox when
there's so much money to be

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.800
made for the government in fur?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.657
But Lyudmila said
that Belyaev sent me,

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:17.240
and Belyaev's name now carried
enough weight that the director

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.430
said, fine, test 500 foxes.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.840
It's not going to bother me.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.470
Go ahead and do it.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.360
So she begins the experiment,
and it works like this--

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.970
every day at 6 o'clock
in the morning,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.690
she begins, and she works
methodically from cage to cage.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.370
Each fox is in its own cage.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.800
And she's going to score
them on how friendly

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.990
or not they are towards her.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.460
And she is going to
score every fox twice--

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.580
once when it's a pup, and then
once again when it's an adult.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.470
And she's going to
score them first

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.670
as she approaches the cage--

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.820
she'll note whether they are
friendly or not towards her--

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.730
then as she stands by
their closed cage, then

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.940
as she opens up the
cage door, and then

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.620
as she puts something--

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:06.630
typically a stick or her hand
in a very, very thick glove--

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.550
into the cage.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.390
And she is going to score
them on a scale of 1 to 4,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.790
where 4 means relatively
calm and friendly,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.260
and 1 means relatively
not so, either aggressive

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.700
or running away and hiding.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.650
So she scores every one of
around 400 or 500 foxes twice--

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.620
once when they're a pup,
once when they're an adult.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.780
And then she takes the 105--

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.920
the 10% of the males and
then the 10% of the females--

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.470
who had the highest
aggregate score--

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:46.400
the friendliest of the foxes,
the top 10% friendliest foxes.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:53.300
And she does this every year,
generation after generation.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.150
Initially, Lyudmila
describes these animals

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.040
as fire-breathing dragons.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.348
They're not
technically wild foxes,

00:20:00.348 --> 00:20:01.640
but they're pretty close to it.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.950
And most of them
acted the way that you

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.550
might expect foxes
to act, especially

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.320
if they are in a cage.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.790
But even after just two
or three generations

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.170
of selecting the calmest,
tamest, friendliest animals,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.600
there were a few--
and just a few-- foxes

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.340
like Laska and Kisa.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.960
So you're looking
at Lyudmila holding

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.540
Laska, which means "gentle."

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.350
These animals were calm enough
that Lyudmila could hold them

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.310
in her arms.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.790
And so she held hope that,
if the experiment goes

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.470
on long enough,
they really will be

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.450
able to find out some
fundamental things

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.140
about this process
of domestication.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.940
So she goes back year after year
after year four times a year

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.980
and does the same thing.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.490
In 1965, she comes up with
this classification system.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.280
She has what she
calls Class III foxes,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.780
and these are animals that are
either aggressive towards her

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.680
or run away, and they
never make the top 10%.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.380
Then there are foxes
like Laska and Kisa

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.960
that are what she
calls Class II foxes.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.150
These animals can
be held, but they

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.890
don't show any emotional
response towards Lyudmila.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.650
And then there
are Class I foxes,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.370
and these cannot only be held,
but they display friendly

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.300
behavior.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.560
They wag their tails
as Lyudmila approaches,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.490
and they whine and
whimper when she leaves--

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.260
no training, no teaching.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.960
This is what they do.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.540
In 1965, Class I foxes made
up maybe 2% of the foxes.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.090
Today, they make up
80% of the foxes.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.280
So all of that 10% that are
being selected-- they're

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.520
all coming from
Class I and Class II.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.180
A year later, Lyudmila has
to expand this classification

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.860
system to what she
calls the Class

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.100
I-E, or the elite
domesticated foxes.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.790
So here is a description
of those foxes

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.750
in Lyudmila's own words--

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.230
"In the sixth generation,
there appeared

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.250
pups that eagerly sought
out contact with humans,

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:08.250
not only tail wagging,
but whining, whimpering,

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:13.140
and licking our hands
in a dog-like manner."

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.550
In addition, some of those
elite domesticated foxes

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.820
were not only
wagging their tails--

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.880
they were wagging
their curly tails.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.000
Wild foxes don't
have curly tails,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.350
but curly tails are a classic
part of the domestication

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.160
syndrome.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.070
It's the first of the
domestication syndrome traits

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.890
to appear in the
foxes, always keeping

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.740
in mind that the only
thing they use to determine

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.060
who is going to
breed is how friendly

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.310
are they are towards humans.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.810
Whether you have a
curly tail or not

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.720
does not affect whether
you're selected to breed--

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.790
only behavior-- and
yet, still, here

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.090
is the first of the
domestication syndrome traits

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.980
to appear.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.900
So a couple of years go by.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.830
1967-- now Lysenko is gone.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.030
He's no longer a threat.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.890
Plus this is an important
year because this

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.420
is the year that the fox
farm in Akademgorodok

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.460
is up and operating.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.970
This is what it looks like
on a nice day in the Siberian

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.260
winter.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.800
Each one of these sheds
holds maybe 50 foxes,

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.720
and at any given time, there
could be 700 to 1,000 foxes

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.900
on the fox farm.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.690
And this was a watershed
moment because it

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.420
changed the dynamics of the
experiment in a couple of ways.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.020
First of all, it meant
that Lyudmila and a team

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.120
now could work with the foxes
everyday, not just four times

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.860
a year, even if it
is a couple of weeks

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.980
or a couple of months--

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.602
every day.

00:23:43.602 --> 00:23:45.810
The other thing that was
really important to Lyudmila

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.630
was that, when she was
working down at Lesnoi,

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.450
Belyaev was too busy to
come visit very often, maybe

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.780
once or twice a year.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:58.290
But now he's just 20 minutes
away at the institute,

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.330
and he can come and
interact with the foxes

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.290
anytime he wants.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:06.830
And just as important, if
something major happens,

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.850
she can immediately get Belyaev
over to see what's going on.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.450
And one of those
"something importants,"

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:19.400
one of those major things was
this little guy right here--

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.390
Mechta, or Dream.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.590
Dream was the first of
the domesticated foxes

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.650
to have droopy, floppy ears.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.920
So here's the deal about
foxes and their ears.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.670
In the wild, foxes
do have floppy ears

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.620
till they're about
six weeks old.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.960
And then their ears shoot
ramrod straight the way

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.210
that you might imagine
a fox in the wild.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.580
Well, at six weeks, Dream's
ears were still floppy.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.080
Two months, they
were still floppy.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.640
Three months, they
were still floppy.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.550
Four months, they
were still floppy.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:53.440
Lyudmila calls
Belyaev out there,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.830
and Belyaev looks at
Dream, turns around,

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.130
and asks Lyudmila, what
kind of wonder is this?

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:04.600
Now they were seeing yet another
trait in the domestication

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.990
syndrome, not only curly
tails, but floppy ears-- all

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.530
as the result of selection on
behavior and behavior alone.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:17.350
Belyaev used to take a
slide of Mechta to talks,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.985
and when he would come back
from these talks-- by this time,

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.610
they were not only
in the Soviet Union,

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.470
but all around the world.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.950
When he would come back,
he would tell Lyudmila

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.220
that his colleagues would
come up to him after the talk

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.510
and accuse him of trying to
stick a picture of a dog puppy

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.662
up on the screen to
convince them that the fox

00:25:36.662 --> 00:25:37.620
experiment was working.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.720
That's how much Mechta
looks like a dog.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.860
OK, so the experiment goes on
year after year after year.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.860
And one of the things
that Lyudmila and her team

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.490
have always been
doing along the way

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.840
is taking blood samples so
that they can look for changes

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.500
at the hormonal level.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.700
So by 1974-- so
about 15 generations

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.510
into the experiment-- what
they're finding is that

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:05.580
their domesticated foxes
have about a 50% lower level

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.730
of stress hormones--
corticosteroids--

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.880
than wild foxes.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.880
What's more, by this point,
they have started a control line

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.200
in the experiment.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.720
So in the control
line, they test

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.313
the foxes exactly the
same, but who gets to mate

00:26:19.313 --> 00:26:20.980
has nothing to do
with how friendly they

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.470
are towards humans or aggressive
they are towards humans,

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.150
so it's a nice control.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.860
When they compare the
domesticated foxes

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.460
to the control, they also find
that the domesticated foxes

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.780
had about 50% lower
stress hormone levels.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.570
And they were also beginning to
see all sorts of other things

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.530
appear in their
foxes by this time.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.580
Domesticated pups
by the mid '70s

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.420
opened their eyes, on average,
a day earlier than the control

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.910
foxes or wild foxes.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.690
Domesticated pups respond
to sounds two days earlier

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.310
than typical foxes.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:05.810
Females have a slightly
extended reproductive season.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:09.920
Typically, wild foxes breed for
about 10 days in late January

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.020
or early February.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.810
Domesticated foxes, particularly
the elite domesticated foxes,

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.800
were in breeding state
for about 14 days--

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.020
so a real difference,
not dramatic,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.340
but a real difference.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.070
Yet another one of the traits
in the domestication syndrome--

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.780
it's typical for
domesticated species

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.940
to have longer
reproductive periods

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.500
than their wild ancestors.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.790
And even, you also see in
domesticated species cases

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.220
where the wild
ancestor breeds once,

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.640
but the domestic domesticated
version breeds multiple times.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.710
Now they're beginning
to see a slightly

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.880
longer reproductive season
in the domesticated females.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.430
They were also beginning to
see all sorts of strange things

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.310
in their coat
coloration-- another trait

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.840
in the domestication syndrome.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.700
In particular, there was this
strange star-shaped pattern

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.520
that was becoming more
common on the foreheads

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.330
of the elite domesticated foxes.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.443
And if any of you
are horse fanatics,

00:28:06.443 --> 00:28:08.360
you know that there are
breeds of horses where

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.985
you see the same
thing, and this is not

00:28:09.985 --> 00:28:13.273
uncommon-- this strange
star-shaped, white pattern

00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:13.940
on the forehead.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.280
It's not uncommon in
domesticated species.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.320
Now it's in the domesticated
foxes, and so on--

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.020
many, many more
changes by this time.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.650
So at this point, they
decide that they're

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.360
going to expand the
experiment even further.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.510
So they've got this line--
the domesticated line--

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.360
where they choose the
10% that are friendliest.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.445
They have a control line,
where they choose them

00:28:37.445 --> 00:28:39.320
regardless of how they
behave towards humans.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.370
Now what they're going to do
is have a third line, where

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:49.700
they choose the 10% that are
most aggressive towards humans,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.820
not because they're interested
in aggression per se,

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.480
but because I think that having
this new part of the experiment

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.260
will let them understand their
domesticated foxes better.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.850
And that can happen
in lots of ways.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.840
So for example, you
could breed the foxes

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.920
from the domesticated line with
those from the aggressive line.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.170
And when you study
their pups, you

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.590
can get some hints about
underlying genetic change.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.930
But I want to focus on another
reason that they did this,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:22.480
and that is that
this whole experiment

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.860
that we've been talking about--

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.630
it's an experiment
in behavior, and it's

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.550
an experiment in genetics.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.750
It's an experiment in
behavioral genetics.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.730
And any time you
do an experiment

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.550
in behavioral genetics where
what you're selecting on

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.420
is behavior, you're always
worried about something,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.360
and that is that maybe
non-genetic factors are

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.890
influencing your results.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.265
So over these 15
years, we talked

00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:48.557
about all the things they've
been finding in the foxes,

00:29:48.557 --> 00:29:51.130
and their underlying assumption
has been all of these things

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.620
are due to changes
at the genetic level.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.830
But maybe non-genetic
factors are playing a role.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.870
Classic non-genetic
factors might be something

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:03.030
like pups learn, whether it
be friendly or aggressive,

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.530
by watching their
parents or other adults.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.350
Another classic
non-genetic factor

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.420
would be the
hormones that you're

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.200
exposed to during development
might influence whether or not

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.200
you turn out to be
aggressive or calm.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.040
And the only way to know whether
these non-genetic factor play

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.020
a role is to design
an experiment.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.820
This is often referred to
as a transplant experiment,

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.693
sometimes referred to as a
common garden experiment,

00:30:29.693 --> 00:30:31.360
except what we're
going to be looking at

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.900
is a common garden experiment
where the garden is

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.850
the uterus of a pregnant fox.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.370
So here's what Lyudmila did--

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.780
she had five or six
pairs of females.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.110
Each pair was made up
of an aggressive female

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.380
and a tame, domesticated female.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.858
And both females were
pregnant, and the transplant

00:30:55.858 --> 00:30:57.650
that's going to happen
happens when they're

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.390
about one week pregnant.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.850
Even though no one had ever
tried this in an animal

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:07.130
this big, Lyudmila learned a
detailed surgical procedure

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.580
so that she could swap
developing embryos

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.530
from one uterus to another.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.130
So here's what the
uterine horn of a fox

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.620
looks like when
they're pregnant,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.210
and you can see that
they're carrying about 6

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.570
or 7 developing embryos.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.430
What Lyudmila did
was she took half

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.690
of the developing embryos--

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.600
one week old-- from
the aggressive fox

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.380
and moved them over to
the uterus of the tame fox

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.140
and took half of the developing
embryos from the tame fox

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.670
and put them over in
the aggressive fox.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:45.200
This is the classic experiment
you do to determine whether

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.720
what you're seeing is due to
genetic factors or non-genetic

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.900
factors because what
you do is you wait--

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.690
about eight weeks in this case--
till the females give birth.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.480
Then when the pups are
up and moving around,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.870
what you do is you
immediately see

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.750
how they behave towards humans.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.490
And you look to see--

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.790
do they behave like
their genetic mother

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:13.040
regardless of what uterus
they happen to be raised in?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.390
If they do, that tells you that
the changes you're looking at

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:18.740
are genetic.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.350
If they behave like
their foster mother,

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.920
then that suggests non-genetic
factors might be at play.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.250
So Lyudmila sets this up.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.660
She's waiting,
but of course, she

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.130
has a little bit of a problem.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.500
The problem is, when she moves
the one-week-old developing

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.470
embryos from one uterus to
another, she knows who is who.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.780
But how is she going
to know who is who

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.090
when the females give birth?

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.310
Fortunately, she thought
she thought about this

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:52.510
and recognized this problem
before she did the transplant.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:57.160
The foxes can provide you
the answer to that question

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.200
because fox coat color is a very
well understood genetic trait.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.770
That means that Lyudmila
could color code the parents.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.450
So in some treatments, the
domesticated female and male

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.600
had light fur color,
and the aggressive pair

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.150
had dark fur coloring,
and others vice versa.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.450
And she then knew by the
coat color of the pups

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.140
who their genetic parents were.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.030
OK, so she's waiting,
and she's waiting.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.517
And at this point, I just
want tell you quickly

00:33:28.517 --> 00:33:30.100
about another group
of people involved

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.975
in this experiment--
the people that Lyudmila

00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:35.630
and all the scientists refer
to nicely as the workers.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.350
So anytime you have
700 foxes on a farm,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.840
someone's got to feed
them, change their cages,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.890
make sure they're OK.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.810
These are the
workers, and they tend

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.705
to be poor women
from local villages.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.910
They don't understand the
details of this experiment,

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.880
but they know that
what's going on here

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.920
is really important science.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.820
And they often go way
above the call of duty

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.990
to work with Lyudmila.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.250
And it was the workers who
first discovered the females

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.270
giving birth.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:13.280
They ran to Lyudmila's
office with cake and wine

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.760
and had a giant party
to celebrate it.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.770
So what do they find?

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.510
I'm going to show
you the results

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:27.570
from one aggressive female, who
gave birth to a bunch of pups,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.290
OK?

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.409
The results are very
similar across all females,

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.409
but I'm going to let
Lyudmila, in her own words,

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.409
tell you what she found.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.230
So Lyudmila says,
"It was fascinating.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.989
The aggressive mother
had both foster offspring

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:43.168
and her genetic offspring."

00:34:43.168 --> 00:34:44.960
Of course, that is
exactly the way Lyudmila

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.440
set up the experiment.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.989
"Her foster tame offspring
were barely walking,

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.730
but if there was a
human standing by,

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.699
they were already rushing
to the cage doors,

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:00.660
wagging their tails, and
also licking her hands."

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.690
Lyudmila continues,
"She, the mother,

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.740
was punishing her foster
tame offspring for such--"

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.410
I love this phrase--
"improper behavior.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.290
She growled at them,
grabbed their necks,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.770
threw them back into
the corner of the cage."

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:18.630
And what did those
little pups do

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.020
but get up, walk back
over to the cage,

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.920
and start licking
Lyudmila's hand again?

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:29.490
They behaved exactly like
their genetic mother,

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.550
not like their foster mother.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.950
OK, so Lyudmila continues.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.040
Now she's going to look
at the genetic offspring

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.430
of the aggressive mother.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.630
What did they do?

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:44.220
And again, I adore the way
that she describes this.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.490
"They retained their dignity,
growling aggressively--

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.140
the same as their mother--

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.730
and running to their nests."

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.090
They behave like
their genetic mother.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.420
This was common for all the
pups born to aggressive females,

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.490
and it was also common
to all the pup born

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.900
to domesticated females.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.010
The pups behave like
their genetic mother.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:08.630
OK, so the experiment's going
on, and what's happening

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.810
is happening even faster than
Lyudmila and Belyaev dreamed

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:12.560
it would.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.920
So at this point,
Lyudmila goes to Belyaev

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.730
with an audacious idea.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.100
She says, there is
this tiny little house

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.160
on the experimental fox farm--

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.270
about 700 square
feet or something.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:28.810
I want to move in there with
one of the elite domesticated

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:36.010
females and live with that
individual 24/7, the way

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.030
that we live with our dogs--

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.060
more importantly, the
way that our ancestors

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.940
lived with protodogs.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.560
And I'm going to take notes
on everything that happens,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.210
and we can really
see just how far

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.150
down the path of domestication
these foxes have come.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.100
Yes, it's only a
sample size of one.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:54.910
It's an anecdote.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:59.960
But maybe it'll teach
us something important.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.900
So Belyaev says, I love it.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.900
And Lyudmila has the
perfect fox in mind.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.090
The fox's name is
Pushinka, which

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.790
means "tiny ball of fluff."

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.660
And from the time that Pushinka
was three weeks old and walking

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.610
around, she was the
friendliest of all

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.180
the elite domesticated foxes in
the history of the experiment,

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.670
and Lyudmila knew
she was the one.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.770
But Lyudmila decided
she was going

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:28.720
to wait a year until Pushinka is
ready to breed at one year old.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.370
And she breeds Pushinka
with an elite male,

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.620
and now the idea is
that she is going

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.110
to move in with Pushinka
right before Pushinka

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.230
is ready to give birth
so she can take notes,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.080
not just on what
Pushinka does, but what

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.122
pups who, from the
moment they're born,

00:37:47.122 --> 00:37:48.580
are interacting
with humans the way

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.530
that we interact with dog pups--

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.400
how they act.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.110
This is the only known
picture we have of Pushinka--

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.070
Belyaev petting her.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.860
This is what the experimental
house looks like today.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.200
It still stands even though this
experiment is in the mid-1970s.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.460
But if you look inside
today, it's pure rubble.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.340
And the reason that I'm
showing you pure rubble

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:22.940
is that, the first time that
I visited in January of 2012,

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.100
it was about minus 35.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.170
The snow was about up to here.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.280
Lyudmila is about up to
here, and nevertheless,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.750
at 80 years old, she insisted
upon taking me out to the house

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.570
and giving me a room-by-room
tour, telling me,

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:42.080
this is where Pushinka used
to lie on the edge of my bed

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:42.830
at night.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.630
This is where the pups
used to play ball,

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.860
and so on, and so on.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.160
So they moved in.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.540
And on April 6, Pushinka
gave birth to her six pups,

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.130
including this
little guy, Pushok,

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.220
which is the male version
of "tiny ball of fluff."

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.333
And she took notes on
everything that they did.

00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:03.500
So this was April, and they
had been living together

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.260
for about three months,
so it's now July.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.760
Now, this picture comes from
when I was there in the winter,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.120
but in the summer, in July,
it's really hot in Siberia.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.550
It can get to be 90
degrees at night.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.770
And so what Lyudmila
would do every evening is,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.230
on the other side of this
house, there's a little bench.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.240
And she would sit out
there reading a book.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.310
And like you might
with your dog,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:24.410
Pushinka would be
lying by her side,

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.750
and Lyudmila would be
reading and petting Pushinka.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.560
And every evening,
around 7:00 PM or so,

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.680
there was a guard that would
come around the fox farm just

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.970
to make sure everything was OK.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.350
And they had hired a new
guard that nobody knew.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.350
And this guard, on the
night of July 15th,

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:45.620
was approaching Lyudmila and
Pushinka in a sort of brisk way

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:49.638
that maybe you might interpret
as slightly aggressive.

00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:51.180
And Lyudmila looked
down at Pushinka,

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.550
and she could not believe
what was happening.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:40:00.580
Pushinka had bolted up, charged
towards the nightwatch person,

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.050
and began barking at them
exactly the way that a guard

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.230
dog would, and
exactly like no fox

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.410
in the history of the
experiment had ever barked.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.640
And Lyudmila's first thought
was, Pushinka is protecting me.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.440
But then she stopped
and said, wait a minute.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.200
I know better than
most how dangerous

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.760
it is to fall into
that trap to think

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.660
that animals are behaving the
way we would in that situation.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.920
But then something
else happened,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.390
which was that Lyudmila
went over to the watchperson

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:35.870
and began talking to them
in a very calm, serene way.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.620
And when Pushinka saw
that, she stopped barking,

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.570
walked back over to
the bench, lay down,

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:47.690
and waited for Lyudmila to
come back and start reading.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.230
Is it possible Pushinka
wasn't protecting Lyudmila?

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.630
Of course, it's possible.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:57.110
But what Lyudmila wanted
to know with just how far

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.480
down the path of domestication
these animals had come,

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.400
and Pushinka told her that.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.310
And because you become
responsible forever

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.650
for what you have tamed,
Lyudmila would tell you,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.810
from that night
forward, she knew

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:12.087
she would never leave the
experiment, and she never has.

00:41:12.087 --> 00:41:14.420
So let me just take five more
minutes to quickly run you

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.850
through some other incredible
things that have gone on

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.720
in this experiment.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.110
I mentioned before
that, in the '70s,

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:24.500
the reproductive season
of domesticated animals

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.930
were slightly longer-- another
trait in the domestication

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:27.800
syndrome.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.260
In the early '80s, something
remarkable happened.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.980
In about '84, a handful--
maybe four or five of the elite

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.210
domesticated foxes--

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:42.660
were ready to breed
twice in a year, not

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.170
only in the typical
January, February time,

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.670
but a second time in September--
absolutely unheard of ever

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.930
in foxes, but typical
for domesticated animals.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.710
Lyudmila bred those
handful of elite females

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.740
with a handful of elite males
who would breed with them.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.560
They produced a
second clutch of pups.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.930
Think about how
radical the change has

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.490
to be in a reproductive
system to be

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.010
able to go from breeding just
once a year to twice a year,

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.250
all as the result of selection
on behavior and only behavior.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.800
By the '80s and
'90s, Lyudmila was

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.140
working with people who had
very sophisticated equipment

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.710
that allowed her to measure
their faces and bodies

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.380
of her domesticated foxes.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.130
And what she found was
a couple of things.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.850
First of all, the
domesticated foxes

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.433
have a rounder, shorter,
more dog-like snout.

00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:37.850
If you think of a
fox in the wild,

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:39.600
you think of this long,
pronounced snout--

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.280
domesticated foxes-- more
dog-like, round, short.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.720
Another thing you might think
of with domesticated foxes--

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.140
another thing you might
think of with wild foxes

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.040
is they have these gracile limbs
that they're running around on.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.580
The domesticated foxes
are chunkier and lower

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.350
to the ground than
wild foxes are.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.090
So as the experiment
progresses, and we

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.597
get into the era of
molecular genetics,

00:43:05.597 --> 00:43:07.180
they begin looking
at these questions.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.013
And what happened was
there was a geneticist

00:43:09.013 --> 00:43:12.000
by the name of Anna Kukekova,
a Russian geneticist,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.290
who had worked with dogs.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:16.500
And she approached Lyudmila
because now the tools

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.680
for studying genetics in dogs
are easily adaptable to foxes.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.050
And she said, do you want
to do some work trying

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.960
to understand the underlying
molecular genetic changes?

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.950
And what Anna learned, which is
what everybody learns when they

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.430
work with Lyudmila, which is
that, if she thinks that you

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.220
can help her better understand
her domesticated foxes,

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.110
she will not only
work with you, she

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:40.260
will work with you in a way
that will make your head spin.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.950
And before she knew it, Anna
had hundreds of blood samples

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.530
that allowed them to
start doing analysis

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:49.500
of the underlying molecular
genetic changes that

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.120
have occurred in their foxes.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.590
And they've done this in
many, many different ways.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.010
I'm just going to show you one--

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:57.610
an early study.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.953
So one of the first questions
they asked was this--

00:44:00.953 --> 00:44:02.870
there are all these
changes that have happened

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:03.920
with domesticated foxes--

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.430
not only they're calmer,
but all the morphological

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.050
changes we talked about-- the
floppy ears, the curly tails,

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.690
and so on.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.500
The first question was, at
a molecular genetic level,

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.420
are the genetic changes
associated with that--

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.510
are they kind of spread all
over the genome of the foxes,

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:25.760
or are they localized in sort
of hotspots of genetic change

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.730
associated with domestication?

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.090
What they found was
many-- not all, but many--

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.390
of the changes in their
domesticated foxes

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.640
could be localized
to one chromosome--

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.073
fox chromosome number 12.

00:44:40.073 --> 00:44:41.490
That's sort of
interesting, right?

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.280
It's not spread all
over the genome.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.360
It's in a hotspot or in one
of a couple of hotspots.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.910
More interesting was
that, at the same time

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.220
they were asking that
question, a group of people

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.560
were asking the same
exact question in dogs.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.360
So dogs have more
chromosomes than foxes,

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.150
but fox chromosome
number 12 is essentially

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.830
spread across-- bits
of it are spread

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.462
across three dog chromosomes.

00:45:08.462 --> 00:45:09.920
For anyone who's
a biologist, these

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.420
are homologous chromosomes.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.440
But basically, fox
chromosome 12 is divided up--

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.780
bits of it-- onto
three dog chromosomes.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:22.640
Lo and behold, one of those
three dog chromosomes, again,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.640
is a hotspot for domestication--
changes associated

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.550
with domestication.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.630
So even deep down at the
molecular genetic level,

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.910
it looks like they're
mimicking the process that

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:34.460
happened with wolves to dogs.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.570
OK, last example--

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.970
I'm going to tell
you about one trait

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.040
that they have only found
in the last 15 years.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.520
And this may be my
favorite of all the traits

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.140
that the domesticated
foxes have.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.670
But before I tell
you what it is,

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.848
I want to tell you
why it's my favorite.

00:45:51.848 --> 00:45:52.890
It's a couple of reasons.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.840
First of all, this trait did not
appear till about 15 years ago.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.490
So that means the experiment
was going on 45 years

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:04.340
before this trait emerged,
making it the poster

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:09.950
child for why long-term
experiments are important.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.220
If any one of us had
worked 30 years on a given

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.560
biological system, we
would sit back and start

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.600
getting lifetime
achievement awards,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.990
and you would not have worked
nearly long enough in a system

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:22.490
for something like this.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.500
The second reason I
love this trait is it's

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.620
hard to imagine a
more perfect trait

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.160
for a domesticated pet-like
species to have than this.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.770
So here's the story.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.500
In about the early
2000s, a woman

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.230
by the name of Svetlana
Gogoleva approached Lyudmila.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.272
And Svetlana studies
animal communication.

00:46:42.272 --> 00:46:43.730
And she said, I
want to come there.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.128
I want to study the sounds
that your foxes make.

00:46:47.128 --> 00:46:49.670
And I want to study it in the
domesticated foxes, the control

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:51.380
foxes, and the
aggressive foxes--

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.610
see what we might find.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.877
Lyudmila said, great.

00:46:54.877 --> 00:46:56.960
Svetlana started coming
year after year-- ended up

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.130
with 2,000 hours of tapes of
the sounds these foxes make.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.230
And what she found was,
across all the foxes--

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.250
domesticated, control,
and aggressive--

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.350
there are about eight different
unique sounds they make.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:12.200
Most of those sounds
are made by foxes

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.200
in all the groups--
domesticated, control,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.430
and aggressive.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.880
But there were two-- and I'm
going to focus on one here--

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.460
that are only made by
the domesticated foxes.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.580
And the one that we're
going to hear in a second--

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.690
this is only made by
domesticated foxes.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:34.580
It's made by almost all of them,
and it's made from the time

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.030
that they start walking
around, and this

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.580
is what it sounds like.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.960
[FOX LAUGHING]

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.850
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: There
is no non-human sound

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.040
that's closer to human
laughter than that sound.

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.050
If you put it on a
spectrogram and look at it

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.388
and compare it to
human laughter,

00:47:58.388 --> 00:48:00.430
there's no sound that's
closer to human laughter.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.740
And it's almost
too perfect, right?

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.880
I mean, now you have an animal
that is not only incredibly

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.090
friendly and incredibly
cute, but you

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.520
have an animal that's
going to laugh with you

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.040
when you're laughing,
and it's going

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.540
to laugh with you
when you're angry,

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.123
and it's going to laugh with you
when you're crying because it

00:48:18.123 --> 00:48:19.640
doesn't care about any of that.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.020
But nonetheless, it's making
this perfect sound, right?

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.880
And so it's just what
you'd want to have

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.430
in a domesticated species.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.820
OK, so if you talk
to Lyudmila 60 years

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.970
after she began and continues
to work on this experiment,

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:39.680
and you ask her about our hopes
and dreams for the future, what

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.410
you'll get is-- well, you'll
get a six-hour answer,

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.150
but I'll give you
the quick version.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.650
The first thing
she'll tell you is I

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.290
hope it's possible to register
them as a new pet species.

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.460
So technically, they are
considered an exotic species.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.760
There are, in fact, a couple of
dozen in people's houses across

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.580
the United States and Europe,
but because they're-- and

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.620
they're very expensive,
and all the money goes

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.740
to the experiment.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.430
But because they're
an exotic species,

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.100
the rules about whether
you can have one of these

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.190
vary, not just from country
to country and from state

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.330
to state, but from city to city
and subdivision to subdivision.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.970
Now, there is an
international panel

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:20.990
that can assess whether an
animal should be considered

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.010
a house pet, and they're working
to get that classification.

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:31.040
Once they do, then the foxes
could go into houses anywhere.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.350
And what Lyudmila
envisions is they

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.870
have plenty of foxes to
keep the experiment going

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:39.290
and also to put a few
hundred into people's houses

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.700
every year.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.760
The other thing that Lyudmila
will tell you about her hopes

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.110
is, one day, I'll
be gone, but I want

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.250
my foxes and the
experiment to live forever.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:55.030
I do.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.910
I hope you do, and I appreciate
you guys taking your lunch

00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:58.870
to hear this talk.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:59.710
Thanks very much.

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:02.125
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:10.336 --> 00:50:12.550
AUDIENCE: So in
anthropology classes,

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.840
you hear about this nonstop.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.910
So I'm curious--

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.330
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Oh, really?

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.775
You hear about this experiment?

00:50:17.775 --> 00:50:18.300
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:18.670
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Oh, good.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:19.714
That's good to know.

00:50:19.714 --> 00:50:21.490
AUDIENCE: It's part of the
curriculum [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:23.282
I'm wondering when you
first heard about it

00:50:23.282 --> 00:50:25.112
and how you got involved.

00:50:25.112 --> 00:50:27.070
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Well,
because my own degree

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.090
is in evolutionary biology, I
don't remember exactly when,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.520
but it must have been in
one of my graduate classes

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.370
because it is a very
famous experiment.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:41.590
I got involved in it
seriously about 10 years ago

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:46.120
when I was looking for a new
history of science project.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.470
I had done some work on
Russian evolutionary biology,

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.733
so I knew not only about some
of the basic things they found.

00:50:53.733 --> 00:50:55.150
See, the thing is,
a lot of people

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.650
know a little bit about this
experiment because 95% of it

00:50:58.650 --> 00:50:59.650
is published in Russian.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:02.390
So people know about floppy
ears and stuff, but not a lot.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.090
So I knew a little bit about
the science, and I thought,

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.465
I know this is
important science,

00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:09.802
but I also had a sense
that Lysenko was involved.

00:51:09.802 --> 00:51:12.010
I had a sense that there
were some really interesting

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:15.680
human-animal bonding
stories and all of that.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.260
So I approached
Lyudmila about it,

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.960
and she was keen
on doing something.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.657
So I'd say 10 years ago.

00:51:21.657 --> 00:51:22.490
And it's been great.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:25.420
I mean, Lyudmila and that
whole group in Novosibirsk

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.460
have become like family.

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.100
And I just emailed
with her the other day,

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.420
and she's doing fine.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.260
And she's still
leading the experiment.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:34.880
Yeah, sure.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.130
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.540
The foxes are adorable.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.960
I'm curious if they
tried to control

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:47.170
for researcher's bias, like
would Lyudmila favor animals

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:49.020
that have that domestication?

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.020
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.635
Right, and so this is
an inherent problem

00:51:55.635 --> 00:51:57.010
in this kind of
experiment, where

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.330
you're going to gauge behavior.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.310
So I think that, over the
course of the experiment,

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:05.440
they've gotten much better
and tighter about this.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.600
Initially, like when I talked
about that place, Lesnoi,

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.020
it was really Lyudmila
and Lyudmila alone.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.720
But once the experiment moved
in 1967 to the experimental farm

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.340
and there was a
whole team of people,

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.400
they began to do other
things that really

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.050
controlled as much as possible
for what you're talking about,

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:24.550
OK?

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:26.793
So first of all, the
key thing they do

00:52:26.793 --> 00:52:28.210
is they've adopted
techniques that

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.190
come from psychology
because psychologists

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:31.660
have this problem all the time.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.368
You're measuring
behavior, and how do you

00:52:33.368 --> 00:52:35.800
know you're only using
what you think you are?

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.780
Maybe you're being
affected by other things.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.980
The classic way to do this is to
have multiple different people

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.270
independently assess whatever
is being looked at and then look

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:50.230
for type correlations across
people in terms of who says

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.830
the animal is friendly
and who isn't.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.920
And that's what they do now.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.370
The other thing that
they do is that there

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.500
are many, many components
of behavior that they're

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.650
looking for, not just the
four things that Lyudmila

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.350
talked about early on.

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:08.718
The core of it is they're
still looking for attributes

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.510
of friendliness towards
humans, but they've

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.870
subdivided that into
dozens of different things.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.370
So that plus the
multiple observers

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.630
is the classic way to
handle this problem,

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:21.687
and they do the best
they can with it.

00:53:21.687 --> 00:53:22.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.075
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Yeah.

00:53:25.075 --> 00:53:26.460
AUDIENCE: Just same question.

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.043
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
OK, same question?

00:53:28.043 --> 00:53:29.720
OK.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.447
OK, yeah, sure.

00:53:30.447 --> 00:53:32.280
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thanks for the talk.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.240
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
You're welcome.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.410
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, in your words,

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.840
you said that this happened
sort of in the blink of eye

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.370
on an evolutionary scale.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:40.380
Is that something
inherent to foxes

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:43.350
or how quickly they
reproduce or to some larger

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.120
classification of animals than,
like, if you selected something

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.320
from a totally different,
not related at all

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.490
to foxes or wolves--

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:51.720
what would that be?

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.720
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.290
And we know the
answer to some extent

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:03.650
because, on the other side of
the farm where the foxes are,

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:06.180
are hundreds and
hundreds of mink.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.540
And for the last 40
years, another person

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:13.920
has been running the exact
same protocol on mink

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.010
and finding very
parallel results.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:22.230
So they're smaller animals, so
they're not quite as dramatic

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.850
and sexy as what
happens in the foxes,

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:26.590
but if you choose on
behavior and behavior alone--

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.610
and they've done that both
domesticated and aggressive

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:30.990
like with the foxes--

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:33.100
you not only get
behavioral changes,

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.160
but you get changes
in coat coloration,

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.800
hormone levels, juvenilized
facial patterns--

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.770
all of that same sort of stuff.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:48.050
I will tell you that, as
scary as the foxes that

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:51.920
have been bred for aggression
are, the minks that

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.900
have been bred for aggression--

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.570
I still have nightmares
walking by those cages.

00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:58.790
I mean, they're demonic.

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:02.960
And there's a third experiment
that started with their group

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.940
but then migrated to
one of the Max Planck

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:07.790
Institutes in Germany, where
they're doing essentially

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:09.650
the exact same thing in rats--

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:15.400
and again, smaller animals, so
not as dramatic, but same basic

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:15.900
results.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.150
Select on behavior--
you get, not

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.530
just changes in
the behavior, but

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.930
the morphological,
anatomical, hormonal changes.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.020
AUDIENCE: How about in, like,
the number of generations--

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.060
was it sort of like
a similar timeline,

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.420
or did it take much longer?

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.795
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
Yeah, I mean,

00:55:28.795 --> 00:55:30.990
so the mink too
breed once a year,

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.260
and I think they
were beginning to see

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.500
serious changes within a
couple of dozen generations

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.790
like the foxes.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.640
Now, you have to remember
also that this is--

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.050
I mean, it's hard
to say anything

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.700
about the absolute
amount of time

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.620
and how important that
is in the domestication

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:51.650
process in the wild only
because this is really

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.190
super intense selection.

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.440
You know, you're just
using the top 10%.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.790
In evolutionary
history, our ancestors

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.990
would not have been
doing that kind of thing.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:04.550
And initially, it would have
been unconscious selection--

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:07.503
just sort of the ones that
came closest were the ones that

00:56:07.503 --> 00:56:08.670
were friendliest, and so on.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.040
Then, when they started
doing it consciously,

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.665
it would not have
been to the intensity

00:56:11.665 --> 00:56:12.915
that we're talking about here.

00:56:12.915 --> 00:56:13.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:16.530
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Sure.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.480
AUDIENCE: So one
thing that you kept

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.100
bringing up in this
presentation is

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.930
that these specific domesticated
behaviors that these foxes

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:28.497
acquire are dog-like behaviors.

00:56:28.497 --> 00:56:30.330
And I know that there
is some relationship--

00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.270
I'm not sure how close it is--

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:37.590
but are there differences
between the two

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:42.210
that still persist,
and how close are they

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:46.020
really after domestication
in this form?

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.550
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
Well, I guess

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.717
you can answer that at a
couple of different levels.

00:56:49.717 --> 00:56:52.110
First, they're both
canines, right?

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.810
So they have a shared
evolutionary history.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:57.030
But their most recent
common ancestor

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.870
was on the order of
12 million years ago.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:00.990
But they're all canines.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.840
I use the language
of "their behavior

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.660
is very dog-like" as a
way to sort of put it

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.230
in context, meaning they
lick hands, they wag tails,

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:11.850
and so on.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:15.780
In that sense, they
are very dog-like,

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.690
but in many, many other
ways, they are not.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.260
So they are not animals that
are inherently gregarious.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.020
They don't necessarily--
they're not animals

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.090
that like to live in groups.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:30.870
There are many, many differences
between the domesticated foxes

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:33.300
and dogs, but there
are a tremendous number

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:36.450
of similarities that seem
to be due to choosing

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:40.240
for this pro-social behavior.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:45.180
I mean, at the genetic level,
although the underlying changes

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.460
like we talked about
have been similar,

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.830
you couldn't breed them
or anything like that.

00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.880
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.760
I guess, I don't
want to hold up,

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.190
but I would have
also asked how far

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.658
away are we from speciation?

00:57:57.658 --> 00:57:59.700
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:03.080
And the answer is
very far, I think.

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.870
So the aggressive foxes
and the domesticated foxes

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.093
can breed perfectly well.

00:58:08.093 --> 00:58:10.260
They do it all the time to
understand the underlying

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.190
genetics.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:14.310
They've never attempted
anything with wild foxes

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:17.010
because they're terrified
of introducing rabies

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.160
and all this sort of thing.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.410
But there's no
reason in the world

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.785
to think that they
wouldn't breed

00:58:20.785 --> 00:58:22.950
perfectly well with wild foxes.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:26.970
So, so far, there's not
reproductive barriers.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.270
But again, this is 60
years, which is nothing.

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:32.970
If they ran the experiment
for another 500 years,

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:34.860
would there be differences?

00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.490
Maybe.

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:37.700
Even that's a small amount
of evolutionary time.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:38.921
But we don't know.

00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:39.754
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:39.754 --> 00:58:41.212
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
You're welcome.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering
what the lifespan of the foxes

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.550
are and if it changed when
they were domesticated.

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:51.300
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
Another good question.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.230
So believe it or not, we
don't know a tremendous amount

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:58.910
about the lifespan
of wild foxes.

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:02.900
People estimate it at maybe, you
know, on average, two or three

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.560
years.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:06.950
But then all the
foxes on the fox farm

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:09.620
can live six, seven years.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:13.340
Now, but in terms
of differences,

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:17.560
there are no differences between
the domesticated animals--

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.900
the domesticated line,
the aggressive line,

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.890
and the control line.

00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:26.820
So one of the changes has
not been longer lifespan.

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.740
They have slightly more
offspring, but not longer

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.820
lifespan per se.

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:34.368
Yes.

00:59:34.368 --> 00:59:34.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.530
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: Hi.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.120
AUDIENCE: Of course,
this experiment

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.795
has never run for humans.

00:59:39.795 --> 00:59:41.420
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN:
Oh, I'm glad you're

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.410
going to ask what
you're going to ask.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:43.160
Go ahead.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.230
AUDIENCE: Right, I mean, once
you dedicate your whole life,

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:49.550
I'm sure she had some great
observations on humans.

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:52.280
I wonder if she ever
exchanged any stories

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.795
with you or any observations.

00:59:54.795 --> 00:59:57.170
LEE ALLEN DUGATKIN: So we do
talk about this a little bit

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.980
in the book.

00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.270
So here is the short version.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.590
In the late '70s,
Belyaev, her mentor

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.860
and the person who basically
was her go-to person

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.300
on this experiment,
Belyaev hypothesized

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:20.000
that human evolution was an
example of self-domestication.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.350
And the self-domestication
idea is this--

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:30.110
instead of some external force
choosing the animals that

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:34.070
are friendliest or calmest,
in self-domestication,

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:35.760
that happens by mate choice.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.540
So the idea was, in
evolutionary history,

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.070
both males and
females would have

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.590
been more likely to
choose calmer, more

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:46.020
cooperative mates, right,
for all sorts of reasons.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.970
First of all, interpersonal
aggression would be minimized.

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.820
And also things that
require cooperation

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.070
would have been maximized.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.440
And the argument,
then, is that, by doing

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.130
that, by selecting the
calmest, friendliest mates,

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:04.070
you are, in fact, mimicking
the process of domestication.

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:05.870
It's just self-domestication.

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.270
This was an idea that
Belyaev had in the late '70s.

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.610
Didn't really do a lot with it.

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:15.140
Just in the last three
months, Richard Wrangham,

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.950
a colleague of mine at
Harvard, has an entire book out

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:20.870
on human self-domestication.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:24.530
And now there's evidence
from all different fields

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:28.550
to suggest that we may
very well be the product

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:30.650
of self-domestication.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.810
And the evidence comes in
lots of different forms,

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:38.060
one of which is that,
if you compare--

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.030
oh, if you compare--

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.200
it says, wrap up, please.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:42.700
I got it.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.490
OK, I'm ready to stop any
time you guys are, right?

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:47.990
So you have to tell
me when to stop.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:56.030
So one of the forms is that, if
you compare us to our closest

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.180
living relatives,
meaning chimpanzees,

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:03.680
we tend to show traits that
are more in the domestication

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.040
syndrome than
chimpanzees do, right?

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.110
We have longer
reproductive periods,

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:11.000
we have lower stress
hormone levels,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.210
we have many juvenilized
features compared

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:16.460
to chimpanzees.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.500
And there are many
other forms of evidence

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.130
to suggest that we have
self-domesticated ourselves.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:24.440
I would suggest, if
you're interested,

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.920
Richard's book is called
"The Goodness Paradox,"

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.830
and it just came out.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.170
It's getting a lot of attention.

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.123
You could easily
find it on Amazon

01:02:33.123 --> 01:02:34.290
when you search for my book.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.720
So there you go.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.810
Thank you very much.

01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:39.860
[APPLAUSE]
