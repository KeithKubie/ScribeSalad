00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.220
We're on problem 53.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.820
It says Toni is solving this
equation by completing the

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.430
square. ax squared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0, where a

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.325
is greater than 0.

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.525
So this is just a traditional
quadratic right here.

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.550
And let's see what they did.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.660
First, he subtracted c from
both sides and he got ax

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.950
squared plus bx is
equal to minus c.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.570
OK, that's fair enough.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.380
And then let's see.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.410
He divided both sides by a.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.530
Right, that's fair enough.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.800
He got minus c/a.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.970
Which step should be Step
3 in the solution?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.159
So he's completing the square.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:37.260
So essentially, he wants this
to become a perfect square.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.870
So let's see how
we can do that.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.783
So we have x squared plus b/a
x-- and I'm going to leave a

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:52.020
little space here-- is
equal to minus c/a.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.110
So for this to be a perfect
square we have to add

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.810
something here, we have
to add a number.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.190
And we learned from several
videos in the past and we kind

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.860
of pseudo-proved it.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.710
And actually, I have several
videos I do solely on

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.730
completing the square.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.010
You essentially have to add
whatever number this is, add

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.830
half of it squared.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.340
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, watch the Khan Academy

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.680
video on completing
the square.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.340
But what is half of b/a?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.590
Well it's b over 2a.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.510
So 1/2 times b/a is equal
to b over 2a.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.115
And then, we want to
add this squared.

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.330
So let's add that to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.860
So we're left with x
squared plus b/a x.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.830
And we want to add
this squared.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.980
Plus b over 2a squared is
equal to minus c/a.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.940
Anything you add to one side of
the equation, you have to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.580
add to the other.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.090
So we have to add that
to both sides.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.220
Plus b over 2a squared.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.580
And let's see if we've
solved the problem so

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.943
far, what they want.

00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:02.760
X, b over 2-- right.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.640
This is exactly what we did. x
squared plus b/a plus b over

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.720
2a squared, and they add it to
both sides of the equation.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.560
So D is the right answer.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.290
Now if you find that a little
confusing or if it wasn't

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.400
intuitive for you, I
don't want you to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.350
memorize the steps.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730
Watch the Khan Academy video
on completing the square.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.970
Next problem, 56.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.480
No, 54.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.790
All right, this is another one
that should be cut and pasted.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.490
All right, four steps to derive
the quadratic formula

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.000
are shown below.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.490
I said in previous videos that
you can derive the quadratic

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.830
formula by completing
the square.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.090
And we actually do that
in another video.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.080
I don't want to give too much
of a plug for other videos,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.410
but let's see what
they want to do.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.630
What is the correct order
of these steps?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.500
So the first thing you want to
start off with is just a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900
quadratic equation.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.900
And this one is the
first step.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.060
This is where we started off
with in the last problem.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.870
Then what you want to do is
add 1/2 of this squared to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.210
both sides.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.040
So b over 2a squared you want
to add to both sides, and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.360
that's what they did here.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.012
So our order is I.

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:10.440
And then you want to do IV.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.620
That's what we did in
the last problem.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.860
We did IV.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.110
And then from here, you know
that this expression right

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.740
here is going to be equal to
x plus b over 2a squared.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.490
And once again, watch soon.
the completing the squared

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.640
video if that didn't
make sense.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.170
But the whole reason why you
added this here is so that you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.780
know that, OK, what two numbers,
when I multiply them

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.480
equal b over 2a squared, and
when I add them equal b/a?

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.250
Well that's obviously,
b over 2a.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.100
If you add it twice you're
going to get b over a.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.982
If you square it, you're going
to get this whole expression.

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:44.560
So you say, oh, this is just x
plus b over 2a squared and you

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.690
get that there.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.840
And then, is equal to--
and then they just

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.950
simplify this fraction.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.160
They found a common denominator
and all the rest.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.170
And so the next step
is Step II.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.800
And then all you have
left is Step III.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.970
And you've pretty much derived
the quadratic equation.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.450
So I, IV, II, III.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.660
That's choice A.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.520
Problem 55.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.450
Which of the solutions--
OK, I'll put all

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.700
of the choices down.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.089
So which is one of the solutions
to the equation?

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.670
So immediately when you see all
of the choices, they have

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.170
these square roots
and all that.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.420
This isn't something that
you would factor.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.950
You would use a quadratic
equation here.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.670
So let's do that.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.510
So the quadratic equation is, so
if this is Ax squared plus

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.370
Bx plus C is equal to 0.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.270
The quadratic equation
is minus b.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.270
Well they do it lowercase.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.280
Plus or minus the square root of
b squared minus 4ac, all of

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.500
that over 2a.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.250
And this is just derived from
completing the square with

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.440
this, but we do that
in another video.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.540
And so let's substitute it in.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.170
What is b?

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.310
b is minus 1, right?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.870
So minus minus 1, that's
a positive 1.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.220
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.290
Minus 1 squared is 1.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.220
Minus 4 times a.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.560
a is 2.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.030
Times 2.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.040
Times c.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.080
c is minus 4.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.690
So times minus 4.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.930
All of that over 2a.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.995
a is 2, so 2 times a is 4.

00:05:25.995 --> 00:05:31.540
So that becomes 1 plus or
minus the square root.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.560
So we have a 1.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.170
So we have minus 4 times
a 2 times a minus 4.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.530
That's the same thing as a plus
4 times 2 times a plus 4.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.490
Let's just take that
minus out.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.490
So it's plus.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.210
There's no minus here.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.670
So let's see, 4 times 2 is 8.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.860
Times 4 is 32.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.140
Plus 1 is 33.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.840
All of that over 4.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.030
Let's see, we're not
quite there yet.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.740
Well they say, which is one of
the solutions to the equation?

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.200
So let's see.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.080
If we wanted to simplify
this out a-- well,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.770
this is right here.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.800
Because we have 1 plus
or minus the square

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.750
root of 33 over 4.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:08.740
Well they wrote just
one of them.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.300
They wrote just the plus.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.800
So C is one of the solutions.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.310
The other one would have been if
you had a minus sign here.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.600
Anyway, next problem.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.810
56.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.960
And this is another one I
need to cut and paste.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.280
It says, which statement best
explains why there's no real

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.010
solution to the quadratic
equation?

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.670
OK, so I already have
a guess of why this

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.960
won't have a solution.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.700
But in general-- well, let's
try the quadratic equation.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.870
Before even looking
at this problem,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.480
let's get an intuition.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.260
It's negative b plus or minus
you the square root of b

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.520
squared minus 4ac, all
of that over 2a.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.310
My question is to you, when does
this not make any sense?

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.075
Well you know, this'll work
for any b, any 2a.

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:05.400
But when does the square root
sign really fall apart, at

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.920
least when we're dealing
with real numbers,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.200
and that's a clue?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.050
Well, it's when you have a
negative number under here.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.820
If you end up with a negative
number under the square root

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.230
sign, at least if we haven't
learned imaginary numbers yet,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.810
you don't know what to do.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.320
There's no real solution to
the quadratic equation.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.210
So if b squared minus
4ac is less than

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.810
0, you're in trouble.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.540
There's no real solution.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.420
You can't take a square root of
a negative sign if you're

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.090
doing with real numbers.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.730
So that's probably going
to be the problem here.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.970
So let's see what b squared
minus 4ac is.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.410
You have b is 1.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:44.320
So 1 minus 4 times a.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.410
a is 2.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.030
2 times c is 7.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.680
And sure enough, 1 times 4 times
2 times 7 is going to be

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.330
less than 0.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.610
So let's just see what
they have here.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.890
Right, the value of 1
squared-- oh, right.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.080
It's b squared.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.520
Well 1 squared, same
thing as 1.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.000
1 squared minus 4
times 2 times 7,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.090
sure enough is negative.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.150
So that's why we don't
have a real

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.270
solution to this equation.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.100
Next problem.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.350
I'm actually out of space.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.360
OK, they want to know
the solution set to

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.400
this quadratic equation.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.210
I'll just copy and paste.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.250
So that's essentially the
set of the x's that

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.020
satisfy this equation.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.480
And obviously, for any x that
you put in this, the left-hand

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.630
side is going to
be equal to 0.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.990
So what x's are valid?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.929
And they just want us to apply
the quadratic equation.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.600
So we've written it a couple of
times, but let's just do it

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.250
straight up.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.919
So it's negative b.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.169
b is 2.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.169
So it's negative 2
plus or minus the

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.740
square root of b squared.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.970
Well that's 2 squared.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.520
Minus 4 times a.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.410
a is 8.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.070
Times c, which is 1.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.560
All of that over 2 times a.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.800
So 2 times 8, which is equal to
minus 2 plus or minus the

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.215
square root of 4-- let's see.

00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.040
Did I write this down?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:21.160
Negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.650
4 times a times c.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.270
Right.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.890
So you get 4 minus 32.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.900
That's why I was double checking
to see if I did this

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.460
right because I'm going to get
a negative number here.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.700
All of that over 16.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.690
And so we're going to end up
with the same conundrum we had

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.480
in the last. 4 minus 32, we're
going to end with minus 2 plus

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.785
or minus the square root
of minus 28 over 16.

00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:46.200
And if we're dealing with real
numbers, I mean there's no

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.080
real solution here.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.950
And at first I was worried.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.650
I thought I made a careless
mistake or there was an error

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.360
in the problem.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.460
But then I look at
the choices.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.440
They have choice D.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.500
And I'll copy and paste
choice D here.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.350
Choice D.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.370
No real solution.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.780
So that's the answer, because
you can't take a square root

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.860
of a negative number and stay
in the set of real numbers.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.620
Let's see, do I have time
for another one?

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.910
I'm over the 10 minutes.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.330
I'll wait for the next video.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.580
