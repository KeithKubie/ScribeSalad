00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.486
The square root of 98 equals 7 root 2, the square root of 150 equal 5 root 6.

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:10.200
And the square root of 72 equals 6 root 2. Great work if you got each of these

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.459
correct. You're really mastering your square roots. We can split up 98 into 2

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.161
times 49 and then take the square root of 49 which equals 7. The 2 states

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.995
inside of the radical are the square root. Because we can't simplify it. We use

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:29.640
a similar approach for the square root of 150. We rewrite 150 as 25 times 6.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.855
And take the square root of 25 to get 5 root 6. And finally, for the square

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:40.400
root of 72, we rewrite 72 as 36 times 2. And then take the square root of 36.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.736
Which leaves us with 6 times the square root of 2 or 6 root 2. I hope you're

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:49.700
starting to see some patterns with square roots. And, if anything, you can

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.582
always start simplifying these even numbers by dividing by 2. I've shown you

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.778
the quickest way to get to the final answers but there are, of course, some

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:58.580
other ways you could have gotten there as well. Be sure to compare your work to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.933
these answers to see if you could have gotten to the answer more quickly.
