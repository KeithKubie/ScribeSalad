00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good afternoon everyone and
welcome to this Friday's edition of The Friday

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.509
App Clinic.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.180
Today we're looking at finance apps.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
My name's Reto.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm Ian.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And hopefully we're gonna be
able to provide some advice as to how you

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.150
can take your finance app and make it all
the better.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And in honor of finance app
week, instead of beer, today we're drinking

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.650
Hendricks's dry martinis.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very nice.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.650
Keeping it classy.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.030
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Two olives and a Spanish caper.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Wow, taking note at home I hope.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.840
So I tried to find the richest person I knew
and the closest I could come was Ian who does

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.950
drive a BMW.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true, my wife bought
it.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020
[Laughter]

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.020
That'll work.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It makes me rich in two ways.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Awe.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Awe.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.760
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I hope she's watching at home
so you'll get full credit for that.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.760
[Laughter]

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.329
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Of course she's not watching
at home she'd be watching at work.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That would make a lot of sense.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.430
So, right, we took a look at several financial
apps that we're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yep.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: of course, suggested by viewers.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.700
Now, we weren't able to look at all of them
and part of the reason is that financial apps,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.109
by their very nature, can ask for some sensitive
information and neither one of us were comfortable

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:14.880
giving our bank accounts to a third party.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.049
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is true.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which, uh, actually when you
think about it is a little silly, maybe.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.759
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Possibly.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.749
And certainly some of the apps, I think Mint
in particular was one app which has gotten

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:30.380
huge reviews, it's an editor's choice, it's
by all counts very trustworthy and a very

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.109
high quality app.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.729
So in a way I felt like people have already
looked at this thing and said how great it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.880
is so we can probably skip it.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.189
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Point of fact, we have already
looked at it

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.189
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's true.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.189
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: and worked with a team.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.189
We loved it.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.189
I've seen it in beta.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.450
But, yeah, I didn't, it's not so much I didn't
wanna trust Mint with my credentials, I just

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.409
didn't wanna show everybody my financial statements
[Laughter]

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: On air.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.710
Reto Meier: That's a fair call.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, the sheer amount of
beer budget

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think would have really

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.880
boggled people's minds.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.669
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Mm, yeah, you don't want to
shock anyone too dramatically.

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:04.929
So, yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.600
Sadly, neither of us has a Cayman Islands
account that we can use to just, you know,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.069
demonstrate how it would work.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.040
So you'll have to try that yourselves at home.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But what we do have is brand
new microphones and a couple new cameras today.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So before we get into we just
wanna show stuff off.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.489
We're on the new microphones which are high
quality microphones as opposed to the ones

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.120
we got on like Amazon or Overstock sale for
like 400 bucks for 4 of them.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It was 400 for 8 now that
I think about it.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is good news for the local
Karaoke team who will really enjoy being able

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.849
to use those mics.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.219
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.670
So if you have any comments about the sound
quality just keep them to yourself today.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.890
We don't wanna hear it.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.110
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Just kidding.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.049
Daniel Pham, our engineer, is looking out
for sound quality but if he misses anything

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.049
just let us know.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.939
Speaking of Daniel Pham, let's switch over
to the engineer cam!

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.939
Woo!

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:55.939
Engineer cam!

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.800
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: I don't have one yet.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.290
Later, guys.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Later guys, alright.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.829
No engineer cam quite yet.

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.829
I saw it move.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.000
You can see engineer cam right there.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.650
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Hi guys!

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's right; we moved the
lights after we set up engineer cam.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.349
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Yeah, it's right up in my face.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.349
I'm gonna move over.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.349
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.349
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Perfect.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.190
We have the sun in the studio now so we're
hoping to get some better light quality as

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.190
well.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed, although I think we
are still getting this

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.019
[Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's alright.

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so let's

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.019
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's move on.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.689
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's get slightly less meta
and have a look at some apps.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.689
So, we've got a few.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.720
We're gonna try to get through as many of
these as we can and they represent quite a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.989
varied, a large variation in app types I think
is fair to say.

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.269
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I think, you know, we
talked about financial apps and I think our

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.780
viewers took that a lot of different ways.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.560
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Everything from Amp Sale to
IOU to Fat Mole Free.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which I noticed you have installed.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.639
Maybe you didn't realize that it's all about
managing your finances.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.639
This is sort of a metaphor.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.639
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, that's interesting.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.380
Yeah, I did see the game and I thought, "This
is a game, why is it in my app review?"

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.959
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well if you think of it as
a game

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In the same way that life

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.170
is a game.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, in fact, it's disappointing
that no one's nominated the game online cause

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.860
I guess that would have been an interesting
opportunity.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.170
So why don't we take a short look at AppSavings.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: This is, I guess it's financial
in a way but not quite the way we were thinking.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's about saving money,
I suppose, rather than managing your finances.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is totally legitimate.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So this is kind of an interesting,
we think that it might skirt the line on Google

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.880
Playstore policy.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.610
So, what it does is it tracks the prices of
apps on the Google Playstore so that you can

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.150
be notified if something goes on sale.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very nice.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.580
It has a nice UI.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.080
Fairly straight forward using an action bar,
it's not actually an action bar it's more

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.380
of a pseudo action bar but, you know, that's
okay.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know we're seeing a lot
of this, Reto; we're seeing a lot of fake

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.410
action bars, why do you think that is?

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Probably because there's no
framework way of being able to have action

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.900
bars for devices running new, old versions
of Android.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.920
[Inaudible due to audio]

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.610
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think the,
[Cannot understand due to audio]

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.300
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does provide something that
is very authentic and gives you that ability.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.360
With that said, I think what's happening in
this app, here, is totally legitimate.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.230
It is an, it is an action bar, it works the
way that you would expect it to.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.020
The only feedback I'd give in this particular
instance is to be careful about the icons,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.010
the style of the icons that you're using.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, in this case they're using,
sort of, the themed icons so that they, sort

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.680
of, faded into the action bar itself.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.880
It's an interesting approach but that's immediately
what makes it obvious that this isn't, you

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.160
know, a standard action bar.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.170
I would have a look at the design side and
stick to the design guidelines in terms of

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.170
your icons.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.550
This is, I think, what we've said over and
over is that if you have a great design idea

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.760
that doesn't fit into our design guidelines,
by all means use it.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.900
But, if you're trying to mimic something that
the Android design guidelines already covered

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.910
and it looks enough like a standard Android
feature that people might think it is then

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.140
don't make it work differently and preferably
don't make it look particularly different.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.140
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.140
I think that's the key here.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.130
If you wanna do something radically different
then that's a fantastic idea, I mean, we love

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.210
to see really innovative designs.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.400
But if you're doing something which is supposed
to, which looks like an action bar or any

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.910
other sort of system element, it should behave
the same way and it should look as close to

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.370
it as possible so you're not, sort of, getting
thrown.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.150
Now, speaking of icons, I think that's actually
my biggest concern about this app because

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.170
I should say right off the top, I love this
app.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a great app.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I love the fact that this
app exists, I love the idea behind it but

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.540
there is one thing that I am concerned about
and that is that the app is using these icons

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.590
which represent each of the applications.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.960
Now, those applications have uploaded icons
to the Google Playstore and given Google permission

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.130
to use that artwork.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.890
And their artwork does actually belong to
the people who have created the application.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very true.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, to the people that made
AppSales, um, the one thing that I would wanna

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.661
be sure of, and of course I have no idea,
but in general you wanna make sure that you

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:33.470
have negotiated the rights to these icons
before you use them because you don't necessarily

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.400
have permission to use them in this context.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.950
And in this instance, I imagine it's not gonna
be too hard to get that approval if you're

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.110
able to reach out because you're basically
helping people to sell their apps when they've

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.110
got them on sale.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.920
So it's free advertising, but as Ian said,
just because it is definitely useful for them

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.160
doesn't mean that you automatically get the
right to use them.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The other thing, which I'm gonna
look at, I'm not actually gonna click it because

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.410
then I will have seen something which can't
be unseen.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:02.620
But, it implies here that perhaps this is
gonna link me to something which is not downloadable

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.060
from the Google Playstore which would be a
violation of the content policies which says

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.340
that you can't link to an external app store.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.760
If you wanna have app downloads, it's gotta
be through Google Play.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.630
So, I'm not gonna click it and that way I
won't know but if the developer of AppSales

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.460
is out there I would definitely look carefully
at that and make sure you're not violating

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.130
any of our policies.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.430
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.180
Okay, so I think that's all we need to say
about AppSales.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah I think that's all we need
to say.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.180
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it's a really cool
idea.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Definitely.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:35.270
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Definitely just need to maybe
take care cause any time you get into app

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:41.330
information at all there's a bunch of twiddly
legal and policy issues that you really need

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.330
to take care of.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.320
It's a great idea and as an engineer I think
we can all get on board.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.700
It's the, sort of thing we think, "Hey, this
would be really cool.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.190
An app which tracks which apps are for sale,
that would be really useful."

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.190
And it is.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.950
But then sadly the legal policy stuff gets
in the way and you kind of have to do your

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.830
due diligence to find out what you can in
content.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, you know what else would
be awesome?

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What's that?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Is just a site where I could
go and just find free movies.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then I would just download

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.010
that.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.010
I would download them really fast.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That would be useful, yes.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.010
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.570
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Also, possibly some legal complications
there.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Not everything we want to
have happen is legal in today's world.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960
Contact your representatives.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Uh, so, should we go to Timesheet?

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's check out Timesheet, yeah.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.220
Let's fire it up here.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:30.730
As you can probably see we have one of our
new cameras giving us a different view of

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.730
the phone cam.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.210
So hopefully this is easy for everyone to
see at home and with 90 to 100 percent fewer

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.210
reflections.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yes.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.300
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So this is, this is kind of
an interesting app.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.180
You know, those of you who, like me, has done
contract work in the past, or, you know, run

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.590
your own business, then the idea of having
to keep time sheets is as familiar as it is

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.590
frustrating.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I probably shouldn't admit
this but I had a dream a few nights ago where

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.000
you were chasing me around trying to fill
out a time sheet.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.130
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then you explained that

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.610
all time spent on personal calls could not
be included in my Google work day.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.050
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.440
That doesn't sound like something I would
do.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I need to see somebody.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You do need to see somebody.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.431
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think next week we can have
self help apps.

00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:16.431
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:17.431
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That might help you out.

00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:18.431
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:25.310
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so, okay, so looking at
the app straight away, what I found kind of

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.460
interesting about this was the navigation,
I guess, was the problem to put it in a nutshell.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.400
The look and feel is great; you've got the
action bar on the top using standard icons

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.260
you know exactly what's going on.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.780
So the first time I, and I kinda like this

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: it's really cool, I like it.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.650
It's in a nice sort of cursive font, sort
of giving you a hint as to what's going on.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.731
So once you've got things set up that's fair
enough.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.190
So we are in the app clinic, so I should start
working.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Still working on a task so you
can stop working, have a break, all these

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.090
sorts of things.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.250
It does actually stick it into your ongoing
notifications so you can continue to do other

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.250
work.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, that's very cool.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And you're notified when that's
happening.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.250
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, hang on, just a second.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.250
Break.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.450
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, let's continue.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.300
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, let's continue.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.300
Perfect.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.610
So, now, interestingly we have to now put
in details

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Did I enjoy the break?

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.330
I did, actually.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.790
It was quite refreshing.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.940
And, save.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.940
So, this is interesting.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.290
So, again, here we have an interesting workflow
dynamic where we're asked to save the description

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.480
for the break that we're editing.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Now, given the way that this
worked, as in I finished my break and then

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.900
straight away we were dumped into this edit
break, there is really no circumstance where

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.410
I wouldn't want to save what I've done.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So you can probably get rid
of your save icon and just, and the trash

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.832
icon, and just basically allow you to hit
back or hit up and be done.

00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:56.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and there's really two
problems here because even if you did determine

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.350
through, let's say, extensive user experience
testing that having a save button and a cancel

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.500
button was the right thing to do, there are
common icons for that.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.000
There's a little check box meaning done

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: which implies saving and there's
an X meaning cancel.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:18.630
So the little disc icon, although I do realize
that the floppy disc is a universal save symbol

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We don't use it on Android;

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.920
we have our own set of icons.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's true.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You should always use the
system icons wherever possible because that

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:31.870
will help, not only help your app be understandable
to users but help the entire eco system be

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.870
learnable.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.040
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed and one of the benefits
you get from using those system icons as well

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.900
is that everything will be sized and shaped
the same way and in the same style.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.330
So looking at this, what I know to be a trash
icon because I'm expecting it to be a trash

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.980
icon, but could just as easily be a birthday
present.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.530
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or a spaghetti pot.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or a spaghetti pot, yeah.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.170
That's better, actually, with a slightly oversized
lid.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.330
Yeah, so, you know, you don't want users to
have to try and interrupt what your glyphs

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.330
are.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.670
You just want it to be straight forward and
you wanna get rid of them wherever you can.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.670
So let's

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What's on the, what's on the
overflow menu?

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I was wondering that myself.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what, I like having
settings on the overflow menu and I, personally,

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.660
I don't think that everyone agrees with me
on this.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.860
This is not a requirement.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.780
I personally like having settings be pretty
much accessible everywhere.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I kind of agree.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.020
I think if you've got these, sort of, universal
applications like settings back up and the

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.630
support page, if you have them anywhere you
may as well have them everywhere.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.840
I think that makes it easy.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.860
You don't want to have to navigate your app
to figure out where you can get settings.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think that's reasonable.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But, let's see what happens,
okay, so

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, canceled.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:43.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Again, we had three way, no,
four ways of leaving that particular activity.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.860
One was the up affordance; the other was the
back key, are we calling the back an affordance

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.860
now?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think just the back key.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm not really sure what affordance
even means but it makes me sound really, really

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240
smart.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It really does.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, the up affordance, the
vertical y axis positive affordance

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.600
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Took us back.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.490
The back key, I would assume, probably would
also take us back.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I would assume it does that
same thing.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.170
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then you've also got the
done and cancel, or save and cancel.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.980
So four ways to exit that activity

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Not all of which were self
explanatory.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No and all but one will actually
cancel what you were doing which seems counter

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.190
intuitive.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which is weird.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: To be honest I'm a little stuck
now because I took a break, I ended the break

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.029
and then I had to describe the break but then
I canceled.

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:30.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Didn't feel like describing
the break so I left

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.530
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: but now did I not take a break?

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.250
Or do I just not have the break described?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.440
I'm not sure.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it depends on whether
this app has the power to manipulate time.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Do you feel like you've had
a break?

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.120
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, I should probably have
another break.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
[Pause]

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, breaks over.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.970
Back to work.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so now I'm gonna hit save
this time.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So that we go back.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720
Break successfully saved.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.050
So, again, this is something which we talked
about last week and something that we've discussed

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:09.400
internally as a team is this notion of using
toasts to inform people when things happen.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.410
And my feeling is this is kind of a developer
hack.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.561
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: it's the way that you say, "hey
I'm not entirely convinced that my code does

00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:21.860
what I expect it to so every time I'm gonna
do something I'm gonna pop up a notification

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.240
telling me so that when I hit save I know
that my service has, in fact, kicked off and

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240
saved it in the background.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240
"

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I mean, when you put
a toast in you're basically saying, "I have

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.510
something to say but it is completely unimportant."

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.510
[Laughter]

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Because if you miss it, I
don't care.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So what you really wanna be
doing here is having the faith in your own

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.410
app.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.990
So, by all means have toasts in the same way
that you have log statements so that when

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:47.190
you're doing your own testing, when you're
figuring out whether your workflows all work

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.589
and you're pressing the backs and the ups
and confirming what does what, that makes

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:55.541
total sense, but before you ship you should
probably be able to move pretty much all of

00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:56.541
your toasts.

00:15:56.541 --> 00:16:00.490
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Most of them, I mean, there
certainly are times when I appreciate a toast

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.490
or two.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure, first thing in the morning?

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.820
After a late night?

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: With a soft boiled egg?

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.410
Well, poached usually.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Poached, yeah that's nice, yeah.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.149
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But in this case I don't know.

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:20.649
One of the main issues that I have is that
this particular toast was telling me that

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:24.680
something that I've been working on was rejected
because I happened to hit the wrong button.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.680
[Laughter]

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.520
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And in that case, to me, that's
not toast worthy.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.310
That's more of a flashing, you know, drudge
report light saying

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.950
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, something has gone

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.870
seriously wrong.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.870
But that's just me.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.360
I mean, I don't, the main question is, did
I still take that break?

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360
How would we find out?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I don't know.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360
Let's have a look.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.150
So I'm, looking at this I'm gonna go ahead
and assume that what we have done in the bottom

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.150
here is some sort of report.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.070
That's not telling me much.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.650
I'm gonna drop that back down.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.650
Alright.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, well, what if we stop
working, would we be able to

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, let's stop working.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.589
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, alright

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:05.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Now it's asking us what work
have you done?

00:17:05.779 --> 00:17:08.059
It's a fair question.

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:14.019
Hm, let's just, I have a suspicion that if
I hit back or up or anything other than save

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:16.869
then it's gonna lose the work that I've done.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.980
We should have about 6 minutes of work there,
we hit save, we go in, task saved.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.110
So we've got, let's have a look on breaks.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.459
So it did both breaks of minus and minutes.

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:29.750
I think maybe it can manipulate time.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:30.789
Oh.

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:35.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That can't possibly be negative.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.429
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think what it's saying is
that, uh, so this is essentially like a double

00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:41.080
accounting.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.499
So this is minus a minute in that it's a minute
away from the total amount of time that we

00:17:44.499 --> 00:17:45.499
spent.

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:46.499
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, right.

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:47.499
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So this makes sense.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:50.059
But, in the way that it's described here it's
kind of backwards.

00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.869
So I understand from your accounting perspective
that it represents a negative number but in

00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:59.210
terms of breaks I'm looking at this going,
"How am I spending minus time on a break?"

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:04.249
So you should probably make sure that everything
is in the correct orientation, I guess, before

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.619
you do it.

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:12.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What if we just say, well,
yeah see, you're right that it's very similar

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.951
to double accounting but the thing that makes
double accounting understandable is that there

00:18:17.951 --> 00:18:19.659
are, in fact, two columns.

00:18:19.659 --> 00:18:21.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Two columns.

00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:22.019
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:23.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's kind of the key.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.799
So you can only really, it makes it appropriate
if you have sort of your work time and your

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.730
breaks next to each other, then it makes sense.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.230
If not, as in here, it kind of doesn't.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah, indeed.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.639
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No expenses, no details etcetera.

00:18:34.639 --> 00:18:39.110
So, I think the key piece of information from
what we've looked at here is really that you

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.539
want to make it obvious to the user what they're
actions are going to do.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:46.799
So in this case, even though we hit cancel
and it said that the action in which we had

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:49.429
tried to perform had been canceled, it hadn't
been, right?

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:50.429
It's still here.

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:54.570
We still have the break which is, frankly,
what the user wants and expects so we're glad

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.169
that it does behave this way but don't tell
me that it's canceled if it's not canceled

00:18:59.169 --> 00:19:00.169
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:04.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Really all you're saying here
is that you didn't put in a description.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.690
And frankly, the use case where you're gonna
wanna go in there and type something and then

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.309
not keep whatever you've typed is pretty close
to zero, right?

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:14.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, well, especially if
you have the ability to edit it afterwards.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Precisely, so you can always
change it.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.450
So really in that case it should only be,
there should only be one thing you can do

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.700
there which is basically edit that break which
is exactly what you're doing.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.249
So you want to edit it and then return back
to where you were.

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:30.419
So you don't need, you don't need to confirm
save, you don't need to cancel, you don't

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:34.390
need to do anything other than be able to
exit back so it should really just, everything

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.390
should take you back one step and successfully
save.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So the other thing, so if we

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:44.320
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, I wouldn't mind
also the ability to, I mean, if I'm gonna

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.401
keep track of breaks like that and if actually
want to fill in details which, by the way,

00:19:50.401 --> 00:19:51.401
I don't.

00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:52.880
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I am so glad that I don't

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.200
work on a job that, where that is even remotely
necessary.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is true.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But if I did I probably wouldn't
wanna type, I mean, what do I do?

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:09.529
Like, I went to get coffee, go to the bathroom,
you know, go smoke, buy drugs

00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:10.529
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, any of these things

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:12.129
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Like more cigarettes, of course.

00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:14.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Or, I mean, this is the state
of California.

00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:15.539
[Laughter]

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:16.539
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's very true.

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:20.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Point is, I have a limited
number of things.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.380
I would like to have some defaults.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.440
Yeah, defaults would be nice.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.080
It'd be good if it remembers the sorts of
things you do on your break or even the work

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.379
tasks so you can select them.

00:20:28.379 --> 00:20:30.009
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That would be ideal, right?

00:20:30.009 --> 00:20:33.580
Because you can just say, yeah, you know,
at 9 a.m.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.779
I always have my coffee.

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:39.859
At 11:30 I kill someone, at noon I have lunch,
all these things

00:20:39.859 --> 00:20:41.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Three o'clock hide the body.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is, I mean, so obviously
it would just be nice to remember an auto

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.460
fill.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.450
If you want it to be really, really, really
special, you would keep track of those breaks

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.940
which do occur at the same time and say, "Ah,
Ian's taking a break at 9.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.519
It's probably coffee, refill it with coffee
and you can always change it.

00:20:56.519 --> 00:21:00.790
With most of these things it's gonna be the
same repetitive tasks over and over again,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:01.970
particularly when it comes to breaks.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And this is what I noticed
about all time keeping tools cause I've seen

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:14.610
a lot of them, the simpler they are and the
less interaction they take, the better they

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.610
work.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.610
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.549
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So for instance, one of the
ultimate time keeping tools that I saw for

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:23.580
software engineering just keeps track of whether
you're typing or not.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.759
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice, very simple.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:30.700
I built a time keeping app myself and it was
exactly the same principle.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.340
You don't want to have to do much.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.549
Really, the only thing you wanna have to do
is say I'm switching to another task.

00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:40.889
And frankly, you don't even necessarily even
want to have to say what that task is at the

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:45.440
time, you just wanna hit one button and be
able to move on with actual work cause every

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.850
time you're having to fill in the time sheet
you're not working.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.850
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sadly, very few companies will
let you put time sheet management in your

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.500
time sheet as a task.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, no, that would be--

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is unfortunate cause I,
there was a couple of jobs where I had to

00:21:58.809 --> 00:22:03.400
fill out three different time sheets at half
hour intervals, so that was fun.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I haven't filled out a time
sheet since I was like 22.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.640
[Laughter]

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice, nice.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But then again I never did
contract work.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.070
You never did contract work.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that's probably where the
big backs are.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, in the finance industry
they care, they care a lot.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.100
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: They do, indeed.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.299
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So we're not gonna spend too
much time on this one cause we've already,

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:27.249
I think, given most of the feedback but the
key thing I wanted to point out here is that

00:22:27.249 --> 00:22:32.390
what do I do if I want to work on a different
project?

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.980
So you've got the, uh, you've got the Friday
games coming up later today, I'm gonna be

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.679
producing that as well, how do we set this
up so we can now get the time to a different

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:43.679
job.

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:47.070
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, um, that?

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.999
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is.

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:52.499
So you've discovered it which is nice.

00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:55.929
Now, while we're going through this, what
I actually quite like here is that as you're

00:22:55.929 --> 00:23:00.519
putting through all the details you can actually
hit this button and it'll figure out the office

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:01.519
details for you.

00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:02.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, that's nice.

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is quite nice.

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Anything that makes--

00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:06.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, yeah, but I'm gonna give
it that.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.450
[Laughter]

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.590
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: What it might also be even more
useful is to a geocoding reverse look up and

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.649
figure out what businesses are in the nearby
vicinity and let me choose from that.

00:23:16.649 --> 00:23:17.649
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:18.649
That'd be really cool.

00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:21.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cause chances are I'm more interested
in the company than I am in the actual specific

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.950
location.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:30.730
But, I wanted to highlight this, so now, see,
I guess my problem here is that this navigation,

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.919
so we are using this appropriately for navigation
but it's not immediately obvious that all

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:36.169
these other things exists.

00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:40.840
And export and files don't really fit that
category; they should kind of, probably be

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.460
in the overflow menu as something you can
always get to.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.971
So you're really only looking at time sheets
and projects.

00:23:46.971 --> 00:23:49.511
So I would, I'm certainly not endorsing a--

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:52.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, yeah

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:57.429
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I'm certainly not endorsing
a dashboard patent but I think in this instance,

00:23:57.429 --> 00:24:02.299
where you've got this sort of amount of space
here on your homepage effectively, it might

00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:06.220
be useful to have a way, right here, of being
able to initiate that.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And that's the thing, too.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.299
Okay, I've got app clinic, I dropped that
down, I assumed that if I had more projects

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:15.590
that I'd have more in the dropdown.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:21.149
The thing is, when I'm looking at this, that's
a natural time for me to be thinking, "Oh,

00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:22.149
I need another one."

00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:23.149
So I wouldn't mind having a--

00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:24.149
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right there, yeah.

00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:25.149
New project.

00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:26.149
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Something in there.

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:27.149
Yeah.

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.769
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I think it's reasonable to
have this here in the navigation by time sheets

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:33.399
and projects, but I think what you want here,
cause this is the screen, this is your main

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:34.399
screen.

00:24:34.399 --> 00:24:36.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now what if I just hit the,
you know, there's a plus button there.

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:37.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There is a plus button.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's the wrong plus button

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:39.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is.

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:40.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's actually the Bayer Aspirin
button.

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:41.509
[Laughter]

00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:42.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is the Bayer Aspirin button.

00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:46.009
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's, uh, trademark infringement
all over the place.

00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:50.419
So now I have, okay, add task.

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:53.100
Alright, I guess I was in the task view, is
that

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I think the idea here is
that for every project you have tasks.

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:57.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:24:57.789 --> 00:25:01.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So say you went and bought donuts
for the App Clinic, you would add that task

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.330
to this project.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.710
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is a task that you consistently
fail at.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.029
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, it really is.

00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:07.029
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:08.759
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So yeah, let's just have a quick
look.

00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:13.330
You can add tags, working with me, none, fail
at that.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.360
Location, feeling pretty sad about it, not
quite sure what the feeling is for but I kind

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.600
of like it.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.269
And there's no way to, so there's no description
or anything else for the, for this task.

00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:27.169
It's just basically the description, a summary.

00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:28.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.570
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I hit save.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:35.999
Again, it's not, it's not entirely clear what
that means.

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:41.500
So we go back here, it seems like I've gone
back twice.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.979
Go to projects; see now the navigation is
broken.

00:25:45.979 --> 00:25:50.009
I'm sort of like "Wait, I didn't navigate
that many parts in and this task that I just

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:51.440
saved where does it live?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.600
What does it do?

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.340
Do I need to have been working in order to
create the task?"

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.340
So,

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: the way that all the things
join together; how do projects and tasks and

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:03.830
breaks and work, how does that all fit together?

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.830
It should be obvious.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.909
I shouldn't have to figure it out because,
as Ian said, I don't wanna have to fill out

00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:10.169
a time sheet to begin with.

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:14.260
I'm only doing this, either because my employer
requires it or because I need to be able to

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.669
keep track of who to bill.

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:16.669
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:20.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And so you wanna do as little
thinking as possible when it comes to filling

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.380
in that.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.889
So you wanna have a really clear flow of navigation
through each of those tasks.

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:26.269
I think, as a homepage.

00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:30.809
This is really nice and it shows you what
you're working on and sort of one click to

00:26:30.809 --> 00:26:31.809
start which is great.

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:37.450
So, if you can have ways to link to new projects
and new tasks, as appropriately from that,

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.730
I think you're onto something.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.460
And you also, I think, want to, you wanna
simplify this navigation.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.400
So once you get into the project side it all
starts to get a little complicated with, so

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.919
here's the task.

00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:55.299
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: One thing I think that could
really just turn this into a winner is integration

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:57.989
with something in the Cloud.

00:26:57.989 --> 00:27:00.630
Even just a simple, you know, say App engine
database.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.630
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: where I could bring this down
as a spreadsheet, edit it in let's say, Google

00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:13.700
Docs or your favorite documentation tool and
be able to set some of this stuff up on the

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.120
computer where I've got a full size keyboard
and I don't mind doing some of this stuff.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.999
So that's something which when I was experimenting
with various Google APIs, before I joined

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:24.559
Google, I did exactly that.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:28.609
So, it actually saved everything straight
into Google calendar so you could see exactly

00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:32.379
what task you performed and there's a script
that ran on a server which paused the calendar

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:36.179
and created a Google Doc spreadsheet which
was the actual time sheet.

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:37.179
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is really cool.

00:27:37.179 --> 00:27:40.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which was tidy and, you know,
I liked that because it meant that I could,

00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:44.429
you know, record the information on my phone
but then when it came to actually saving it

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:48.190
and producing it and printing it out it was
all done, you know, in the Cloud.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice, I've never hooked anything
up to my Google calendar like that because

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.809
I think it would demonstrate exactly how much
of my time is wasted every single day.

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:57.809
[Laughter]

00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.419
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's a little depressing,
really.

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:02.419
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It could be.

00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:03.419
So, but anyway.

00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:04.419
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's just these two hours
a week that I get anything done.

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:05.419
[Laughter]

00:28:05.419 --> 00:28:06.419
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well at least you get those
two hours, that's important.

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:07.419
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:10.129
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So yeah, I think that would
be the other piece of the functionality device

00:28:10.129 --> 00:28:11.690
is definitely hook it up to the Cloud somehow.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.159
It doesn't need to be through a Google specific
product but some way to know that what I've

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:19.460
entered in here is gonna be recorded and saved
somewhere, I think is really vital.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.169
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:22.169
So

00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:23.169
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, what else we got here?

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:24.849
Did we wanna have a quick look at Timesheets
on the tablet?

00:28:24.849 --> 00:28:25.849
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure.

00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:28.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: see if they've optimized for
tablets.

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:31.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So they say they've got a
new design.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.139
Ok, so this, in this case, well I haven't
set this up so it's asking me for a new project

00:28:37.139 --> 00:28:41.470
which, again, will be our mobile
[Pause]

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:53.919
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, and, oh I guess I
have a save button here.

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.259
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: okay.

00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:56.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, so that's--

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's nice.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.899
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that's actually a much more,
although--

00:28:58.899 --> 00:29:05.100
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Ian, can you jiggle the HDMI
cable a little bit?

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.649
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:29:06.649 --> 00:29:07.649
[Pause]

00:29:07.649 --> 00:29:10.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Beautiful, here we go.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:16.599
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, but now I'm missing my,
I wanna, ah there we go.

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:17.599
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You gotta go back up.

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:19.090
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I miss the little coffee cup
now.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I do too.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.860
Particularly because you've got all this white
space and you don't have the coffee cup.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.909
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And what I really want is
I want a big red start working button.

00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:27.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:28.909
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wouldn't that be great?

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:32.099
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely and maybe even shaped
as, usually I don't suggest going away from

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:35.119
Android styling but an actual like big button

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.119
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.119
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Would be kind of cool.

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:38.119
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I would go for that, definitely.

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:39.309
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And let's just, you know, if
you have a look at--

00:29:39.309 --> 00:29:44.279
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: there's actually a really
good one on Istock photo, it costs like 7

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:46.350
bucks, I think you can probably afford it.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think it'd be worth it.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.139
So, you know, in fact, I think in this particular
instance when you're working on tablet, this

00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:51.919
is your view, right?

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:56.809
So I think you almost want to avoid having
that entire, you know, this view I think is

00:29:56.809 --> 00:29:58.429
much less valuable.

00:29:58.429 --> 00:30:03.830
You wanna basically start in projects and
then use your dropdown to navigate between

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.830
projects.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.559
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Same way which Gmail let's you
choose labels, so you're always looking at

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:08.559
this.

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:11.759
And I would have in, you know, in an extra
fragment somewhere in this zone.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:12.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:18.730
Now if I go to tasks here, the one thing that,
okay, so I do have an add new task action.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:25.009
Now, just this, now this zero kind of in the
middle here is a little confusing to me

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:28.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Particularly, I think, cause
we had this nice style that we saw earlier

00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:32.539
with the sort of cursively written hints,
that would be much nicer here.

00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:37.399
You don't have any tasks, you know, click
the add tasks button to add something, I think

00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:38.429
would really add.

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:39.429
[Pause]

00:30:39.429 --> 00:30:42.609
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, here we go.

00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:48.860
I think I may be a little, okay, you're right
I'm happy.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You're happy now.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm reasonably happy.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.640
You know, I don't like mint martinis as well
as beer.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You'll be happier later then,
I guess.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.279
Okay, so, um, what'd I do?

00:30:58.279 --> 00:31:02.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, so now you're viewing the
task.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.229
So this is a really interesting example of
why the navigation doesn't quite work.

00:31:06.229 --> 00:31:07.229
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:31:07.229 --> 00:31:12.379
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Cause what you really want is
to tag this task view within this fragment

00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:13.379
scenario.

00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:16.649
So you basically wanna have this view.

00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:21.340
You basically, on a tablet, you never wanna
be getting rid of this size, this side, that

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.899
should be your, kind of your control pad where
you choose your projects and that's where

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:29.139
you start working, have your breaks, everything
lives there and then the detail all comes

00:31:29.139 --> 00:31:31.119
in on the right hand side.

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:35.109
So I'd say, you know, it seems like, that
their tablet layout is relatively new.

00:31:35.109 --> 00:31:39.760
I would say you're on the right track, definitely
keep going along those lines but try and come

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:43.429
up with more ways to be able to really reduce
those, that navigation flow.

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:46.399
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well let me emphasize this,
you are absolutely on the right track.

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:47.399
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:50.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You're doing everything right,
you're not doing anything stupid, there's

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.919
just a few things you could probably think
through how you could reduce the amount of

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:56.950
complexity in the app.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.049
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.049
Yeah.

00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:03.080
Reduce complexity, reduce the navigation,
I think if you stick anyone who knows vaguely,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.429
you know, someone who uses time sheets but
has no idea about your app, sit them in front

00:32:07.429 --> 00:32:09.850
of it and just watch them try and figure out
how to do things.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.869
And every time they click something and then
go back and click something else, trying to

00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:14.460
find it
[Audio/video skips ahead]

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Something, but for finishing
it, for adding details, all of these things,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.379
you know, maybe it really just needs to be
a completely separate flow.

00:32:23.379 --> 00:32:24.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.940
Let's move on.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.940
We've still got a few more minutes.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.940
Squeeze that across.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.029
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And let's have a look at Invoice2Go,
I think.

00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:34.029
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:37.210
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So we're gonna have to breeze
through the next couple a little more quickly

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.869
than we have thus far.

00:32:38.869 --> 00:32:39.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:41.200
Always happens, always happens.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.739
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Always does.

00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:46.210
We're gonna zoom in on the phone camera, I
can see it happening.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.679
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yes, it's gonna happen any
minute now.

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:50.679
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Any minute now.

00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:51.679
Yes!

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:52.679
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There we go.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:53.679
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Look at that.

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:54.679
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:55.679
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:56.679
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: Which app is this?

00:32:56.679 --> 00:32:57.679
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is Invoice2Go

00:32:57.679 --> 00:33:01.340
&gt;&gt;Daniel Pham: This isn't right.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:08.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What I think is interesting
is that the Invoice2Go action bar

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Now I'm just confused.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: This is really, really, weird
cause you'd think that if the title in the

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:20.200
action bar is Radioactive Yak and there is
a way to add multiple companies which, where

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.549
you might be switching between companies,
it seems like Radioactive Yak should be a

00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:25.549
dropdown

00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:26.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:28.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: On the left hand side which
is, of course, the

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So I would expect to

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.429
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So what happens if you add
another company?

00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:31.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's have a look.

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:37.080
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Start a new company.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.559
New company.

00:33:38.559 --> 00:33:40.499
So this is the workflow when you begin.

00:33:40.499 --> 00:33:44.869
So this is how you basically go through and
decide what the invoice is going to look like

00:33:44.869 --> 00:33:45.889
for your company.

00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:47.769
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There really are quite a few,
nice size.

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:50.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's quite a nice, yeah, quite
a lot of nice ones.

00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:53.970
Let's go with Fresh.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:57.379
So we can choose all of our different fields,
it's not gonna go through all of these in

00:33:57.379 --> 00:33:58.379
detail.

00:33:58.379 --> 00:34:04.970
Company name, let's see, we'll go with the
App Clinic.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.440
We need to give an address.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.580
So, again, this may be a good opportunity
to figure that I'm putting in the details

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.649
where I currently am.

00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:21.540
Let's have a look here, do I need all of them?

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.659
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, but you need 2 address
lines.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.279
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Two address lines which is interesting.

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:26.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Interesting.

00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:33.139
The truth is that data validation when you're
enforcing business rules is important but

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:34.790
I think people take it too far.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:40.960
I think that when you're writing something
that's, you know, gonna be handed off to a

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.139
data entry clerk it's nice to have some validation,
when you're doing the setup, however, maybe

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.139
not so much.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:51.830
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's my company, I get to decide
exactly how it should appear on the address

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.830
form.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.099
So, yeah if, exactly.

00:34:54.099 --> 00:34:56.220
So we're gonna skip all of these as well.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:04.551
Minor point; you don't need the e.g. to propend
you just have the sample stuff and, in fact,

00:35:04.551 --> 00:35:08.869
even the phone itself, fax etcetera, isn't
kind of the standard way you do hint text.

00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:12.390
You wanna, yeah, you just wanna show what
they should be putting in there and let them

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.390
put it in there themselves.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So here you just have phone
instead of e.g. phone

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.760
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, or you would just have
the phone number.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.760
Just say 555-5555

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: As an example.

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:23.039
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, that's fair.

00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:25.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Certainly what you would do
for email and those sorts of things.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I guess so.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is interesting in that
we're not doing any validation on the cell

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.319
phone numbers.

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:35.100
Chances are you're only gonna use numbers
and maybe dashes, you wanna set the keyboard

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.430
type appropriately.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:39.940
Set our tax rate.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.440
Sure, and then we're done.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.410
So now we're back in mash and, again, so now
if we wanna choose a different company then

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.410
we go through this.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.410
So that's

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, that seems a little
unfortunate.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.740
That's the action bar navigation is pretty
solid.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: People are gonna expect that.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think in this instance it
makes obvious sense, you know, if you have

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.700
the company name here you're gonna expect
that that dropdown is gonna let you choose

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700
them.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Particularly as you go into
this action bar style.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.230
Very quickly, I'll switch companies.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:10.220
Otherwise this is kind of a dashboard patent
which, I guess, kind of makes sense in this

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.539
instance in that you're just trying to do
these particular things.

00:36:13.539 --> 00:36:17.390
It doesn't really make sense to drop you into
any one of them independently.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.940
But I wonder, how does this look on the, on
the tablet?

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think they actually have
a pretty nice tablet layout.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.049
It's, it's unconventional.

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:27.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is actually quite different
from the phone.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:28.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Uh, yeah, it really is.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.190
So, the, there's a couple things that I wanted
to point out.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.660
First, the action bar, of course, is just
as useful as it was on the phone which is

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.660
to say

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Not particularly.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, not as much.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.549
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then they have this area

00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:44.559
over here on the left.

00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:47.160
Now, that's really interesting to me.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:53.869
It's unconventional, I don't dislike it, I
find it to be useful but there is actually

00:36:53.869 --> 00:36:57.730
a pattern which we just added which is called
the, help me out here, the Drawer.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The Drawer, absolutely.

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:04.819
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If you look for the Drawer
pattern, you've seen variations on this in

00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:07.940
several apps; Facebook app had it, the Google
Plus app, the YouTube app

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.670
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: there were a lot of requests
for it to be added to the design patterns

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:17.980
so the design team sat down, looked at all
of the variations on this and sort of tried

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:24.349
to figure out which ones were most effective
and most like other Android patterns.

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:25.349
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:31.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, what we settled on is
something you can slide this in and out.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.670
Usually you don't just see icons.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.180
Usually you'll see icons and such.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.660
It should always be under the action bar,
never over the top and never pushes the action

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660
bar over.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:41.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.960
Action bar is a first class citizen.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.039
It's always there; it stays at the top of
your app.

00:37:45.039 --> 00:37:46.039
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:37:46.039 --> 00:37:47.039
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Consistently.

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:49.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And, point of fact, I think
it was YouTube that was actually implementing

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.690
all of our suggestions.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right, I think all of the examples
on the design sites use YouTube.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.630
So, if you're wondering how should it work,
how should it look in practice, I would definitely

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.960
check out the latest YouTube app.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.210
So this is very, very close to the Drawer
pattern and the Drawer pattern is basically

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:12.420
saying I have a fairly complicated bit of
navigation, more than is sensible for the

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.420
dropdown area

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And so, I don't want it to
always necessarily be visible.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think I would switch to
that.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:29.710
Now, over here in the main area we've got
the original sort of dashboard idea and then

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.520
some extra stuff.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.900
I don't hate it but I, I can't rationally
defend it either.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.900
[Laughter]

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does look like what can we
put here to fill up some space?

00:38:41.809 --> 00:38:42.809
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:38:42.809 --> 00:38:45.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, I'm not sure what the
right solution is.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.230
I wonder if there are shortcuts

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:50.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean, if we go to an invoice,
right, uh, right now I'm kind of bugged by

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:57.770
this because now it's using the entire screen
and I kinda would like to still have some,

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.770
you know,

00:38:58.770 --> 00:38:59.770
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Some navigation.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.359
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:05.200
You know, maybe even just, you know, and this
is all create.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.670
You know, maybe what I would like is to see,
oh, so that's my product view, I guess?

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.670
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: This, okay, now this is what
I want.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.880
Okay, I've got invoices and add invoice.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.010
And to me, A, I don't want to go to this screen.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.369
I want the add invoice activity to be a fragment
inside here.

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:29.180
I think that makes a ton more sense.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:35.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I would like the invoices
to be listed over on the left whereas right

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.829
now I think this is more, you know, most likely
the list, right?

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:40.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think it's gonna be all of
your invoices, yeah.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I think that, that's really
what we've been getting at is, in general,

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:51.440
this is, you know, I would call this like
the Windows Explorer or Finder type of view

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.700
on something where you've got this sort of
folder idea over on the left and then a list

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:04.480
view on the right and that, that almost never
feels right to me.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.380
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No, it's not, it's not quite
right.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.760
I don't know, not on a mobile device, on a
phone or a tablet, where you don't wanna have

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.060
to navigate, you don't wanna have to think
about things being in this hierarchical folder

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.060
structure.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.740
There's really no reason why you can't, sort
of, have everything kind of on the left.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.820
Especially since they've already gone hierarchical
with this so it wouldn't be that hard to just

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:33.289
say, "Okay, I'm gonna open up my invoices
and see them listed underneath invoices and

00:40:33.289 --> 00:40:36.030
then I could see the invoice details over
on the right.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, just have a big plus icon
next to each of the categories so you can

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.869
add any new invoice, new estimate, purchase
order etcetera.

00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:45.369
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I think I would probably
prefer that.

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:46.369
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:50.000
So, again, it's basically the same sort of
story that we've been saying all the time

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
which is to simplify your navigation as much
as possible.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.329
You don't want to have, every time you change
the entire screen, you're changing the context

00:40:57.329 --> 00:41:00.829
in which you're working which means you need
to take a few seconds to figure out what just

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:01.829
happened, where am I?

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:02.829
what do I have to do?

00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:03.829
The list you can do that--

00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:08.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: This is something that actually,
you know, they've done cognitive studies where

00:41:08.529 --> 00:41:15.539
when you chance context it's the habit of
your brain to actually forget what you were

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.539
doing.

00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:19.460
It's why, and they've shown this like every
time you go through a door, for instance.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I've seen this, yeah.

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:25.471
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So this is why you go into
another room and then ask yourself, "Why am

00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:26.589
I here?"

00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:28.450
Now, I do that because I'm old
[Laughter]

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.869
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But other people do that because
of this cognitive thing.

00:41:30.869 --> 00:41:32.440
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You just forget, you walked
through.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.020
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, yeah, every time you switch
something completely and I think that's really

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.140
what I'm getting at, right?

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.010
It's not that I don't like the layout here,
it's not that I strongly object, it's just

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:48.160
the fact that to get anything done, to see
anything useful I have to pick something that

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.859
is gonna take me to a completely new area,
right?

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:54.380
Some of these are worse than others, you know?

00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:01.579
So to view an invoice, you know, it sort of
took me over to the right where now I've got

00:42:01.579 --> 00:42:03.839
this list view here.

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:06.690
So I don't hate that as much, but to add an
invoice--

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.609
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a completely new screen.

00:42:08.609 --> 00:42:09.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, completely new screen.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:11.609
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And definitely not tablet optimized,
either.

00:42:11.609 --> 00:42:16.190
You know, for something like this, oh, it
is confusing.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.981
Add invoice, so for something like this where
you've got a huge amount of white space, now

00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:25.869
obviously once you've got the icons that may
change, but it may not even be a bad thing

00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:30.200
here to actually have the white space around
the borders rather than in the middle of your

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.760
screen cause this part here in the middle,
this is where you actually are gonna be paying

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.579
attention, that's where the user is gonna
be looking.

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:38.269
But all the important stuff is on the edges.

00:42:38.269 --> 00:42:45.171
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So I think if I had to choose
the most Androidy way to do this it would

00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:55.069
probably be to have this left hand navigation
area be expressed as either action bar navigation

00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:56.349
or a view pager.

00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:59.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, a view pager actually
would be quite nice, I think.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:00.750
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, flip between them and you
don't actually need to see them next to each

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.060
other.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:09.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, we never even see this;
instead we always see this view.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.690
So we have the view of the, you know, the
master view here, we have a detail view here

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.740
that's actually a detail view instead of another
master view.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:18.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:24.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And then I could, you know,
page through either by dropping down or doing

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.260
some paging here or using the drawer, I mean,
there's any number of ways that I could do

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.260
that.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.260
I think it'd be quite--

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But I wouldn't waste this
kind of space on what's essentially a navigation

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960
field.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.090
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah because keep in mind, as
well, that these things don't actually have

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.839
anything in common.

00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:43.210
The commonality is that they're all pieces
of paper that you have to generate business

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:46.110
to either charge someone, pay someone or be
paid.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.650
But having them listed here sort of implies
a hierarchy that doesn't really exist.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Not so much, yeah.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.279
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So just having them separated
by navigation or I quite like the idea of

00:43:54.279 --> 00:43:58.720
having the view pager so you scroll between
your invoices and your estimates.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.450
It's not a huge number so it doesn't become
unwieldy or hard to find.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.069
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But yeah, that's your call,
something to experiment with perhaps but that's

00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:07.250
what I'd consider.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Great.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:14.710
So I think we've, we've offered a lot of constructive
feedback on apps that we thought were really

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.710
quite good.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:25.041
Um, there are a few apps that we don't have
time to look at in exhausted detail; quite

00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:28.109
honestly I didn't think that they were quite
as good.

00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:29.109
One is Financiso

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:35.329
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I struggled with this one so
I'm looking this up and pretty quickly turned

00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:38.470
it back off because I really didn't understand
what I was supposed to do with it.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:45.430
Now, maybe if I was considerably more wealthy
because I did notice that I have the ability

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:50.410
to do all sorts of things in this application
in any currency I want.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:57.380
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Something like 200 built in
currencies and including special drawing rights

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.790
which who has those, right?

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:04.140
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right and I can also use my

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.510
own made up currency.

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:06.510
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's handy.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.630
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, with my own symbol and
everything.

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:11.720
So I made up the Twitter bucks with, of course,
the at sign as the symbol.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Because it's Ian I was expecting

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.720
Ni-Lewis bucks.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.829
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, no, it didn't make nearly
as much sense.

00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:21.059
So, and that, of course, is what I'm paying
my minions.

00:45:21.059 --> 00:45:22.059
[Laughter]

00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:23.180
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.240
That's interesting.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But this kind of surprised
me, too.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:33.990
Like I can see that I can add budget items
but as far as I can tell each budget is partly

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:37.250
red and partly green for no apparent reason.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.780
I'm really, really not understanding that.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It seems like it's just there
to--

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.779
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I haven't paid it because
I don't have a transaction, maybe?

00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:49.580
In other words, there's, this is one of those
things where there's obviously a lot of power

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.609
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But it makes no sense.

00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:53.609
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:45:53.609 --> 00:45:57.220
It fails the I just installed this app how
do I get started test.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.019
And I can't see, when I start this app I don't
see, what is the value?

00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:02.019
What can I do?

00:46:02.019 --> 00:46:04.269
What is it giving me that some other app hasn't?

00:46:04.269 --> 00:46:08.390
So I just downloaded a bunch of budgeting
apps then I'm kind of stuck here cause I loaded

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:13.480
up and if we switch to the phone view, I haven't
put anything into this one yet so we should

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.049
be able to fire it up.

00:46:15.049 --> 00:46:21.780
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And this is kind of what you're

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.890
presented with at start up and it's kind of,
it's the old school model so it's a gingerbread

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:30.589
type tabs and buttons and everything else
which is already a bit off putting.

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:35.740
There's no title bar or action bar so, again,
there's no context hint as to what am I doing?

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.579
How am I supposed to do things?

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:41.549
And it just says you should get started by
creating an account by hitting a plus.

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:48.990
And then title which doesn't quite make sense
my accounts have titles, I guess.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.069
It feels like it should be name or description
or something.

00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:54.109
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well that's a minor thing.

00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:58.540
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is a minor thing but it goes
to the whole flow of being like I'm not quite

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.230
sure what they want or what this is for or
how this is gonna help me.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.980
Compare that to the other apps we've looked
at, it became pretty obvious straight away,

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.210
like, okay so this is for creating invoices,
first thing I do is choose what the invoice

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.410
looks like and then you understand right off
the bat that, okay this is probably gonna

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.641
create invoices for me.

00:47:15.641 --> 00:47:22.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: My major objection to this
is that with the state of things now, I'm

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.660
much more likely to do something that can
hook into my actual bank account because all

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.890
my things are done electronically and I think
that's why I gravitate to something like Mint.com.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.210
Alright, we're just about out of time but
one app that we didn't really look at was

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:36.020
IOU.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:42.039
The truth is, IOU is, you know, gonna be honest.

00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:44.250
I was never a huge fan of holo.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:45.779
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay.

00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:49.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: From the beginning I said
to myself it's interesting that we all wanna

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:55.150
be like holographic and electronic style but
I don't personally like it.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.760
So, with that in mind,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.760
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:02.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: what I'm about to say may
be complete, just a complete personal problem

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.890
but I find this black screen to be off putting.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:10.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well I think, you know, it'd
be helpful if we had Roman here to confirm

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:15.660
but I think in general we found that for most
sort of data entry things, anything other

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.769
than media, the hollow light theme is sort
of more visually pleasing.

00:48:18.769 --> 00:48:19.769
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:48:19.769 --> 00:48:23.220
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The white backgrounds and white
action bar rather than dark.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.559
Dark works well for things like YouTube, for
video playing

00:48:25.559 --> 00:48:26.559
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There you go.

00:48:26.559 --> 00:48:28.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Anywhere there's sort of the
content is front and center and what you're

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.130
looking at is really important so you want
everything else to just sort of fade into

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.130
the background.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well I think we can just say
there's a rule of thumb here is if you're

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.630
going to be using this app while wearing your
little black dress then it should be holo

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.880
dark and if you're going to be wearing it
wearing your white shirt and tie then it should

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.880
be holo white.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.070
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think that's something everyone
should find very useful.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.851
Especially those who wear both a shirt and
tie and a little black dress.

00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:53.851
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And a little black dress.

00:48:53.851 --> 00:48:55.079
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Maybe this is

00:48:55.079 --> 00:48:56.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I thought we weren't gonna talk
about this on air.

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.079
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:48:57.079 --> 00:48:58.079
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Moving on.

00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:59.089
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Really unique.

00:48:59.089 --> 00:49:05.759
So we, we don't have time to discuss it more,
it does actually seem like it's got some nice

00:49:05.759 --> 00:49:08.390
functionality and we might wanna cover it
more

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:12.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And look, generally speaking
it keeps things simple, it's obvious what

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.640
it's for, not overly complicated navigation
so they do a few things right.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.640
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.980
It's nice that you can

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.910
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It would be nice if that was
a view pager so you can slide between

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:25.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: between them
[Laughter]

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: yeah, right now I'm wondering
why can't I slide between them.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:29.470
Alright.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.829
So, and that falls into the bucket that we
talked about earlier which is if you make

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:39.569
something that looks like a standard Android
UI element, you know, if you have to implement

00:49:39.569 --> 00:49:44.200
your own, if you want to implement your own,
bravo to you, you're completely wasting your

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.200
time,
[Laughter]

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But if you do, make sure it
operates in exactly the same way because otherwise

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.390
people will just be frustrated.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:55.839
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean, honestly, it's like
getting into a car and finding out that the

00:49:55.839 --> 00:49:57.579
brakes on the right and gas is on the left.

00:49:57.579 --> 00:49:58.579
[Laughter]

00:49:58.579 --> 00:49:59.579
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's not gonna end well.

00:49:59.579 --> 00:50:03.700
I had a problem; I came to the US, opened
the car and found the entire steering assembler

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.329
was on the wrong side of the car.

00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:09.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, well it's, you know,
when you come to a different operating system,

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:10.950
let's say,
[Laughter]

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:11.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: you often

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.000
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You need to adapt.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.059
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But I think you probably will
have noticed that every car in the United

00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:18.150
States drives that way.

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's true.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:22.960
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So even though it may appear
completely wrong, consistency is a virtue.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.450
As they say, adapt or die, in some cases a
little more literally than others.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:28.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.150
Alright, that's all we have time for today,
folks.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.191
So thank you very much for joining us.

00:50:32.191 --> 00:50:36.089
Let us know on our Google Plus page what you
think of today's show.

00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:41.849
If you'd like us to, I don't know, bring back
the hangouts or switch microphones again

00:50:41.849 --> 00:50:45.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: or anything else let us know

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.800
what you think and until next week I'm Ian
Ni-Lewis.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.190
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm Reto Meier and we'll see
you guys later.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:55.759
In fact, we'll see you next week for music
players, I think.

00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:57.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I believe it is.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:58.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.330
Music players, that should be a really interesting
show.

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.330
And, uh, yeah, see ya next week.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:00.720
