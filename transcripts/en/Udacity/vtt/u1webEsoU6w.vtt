00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.810
Recyclerview was added to
the support library to

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.910
ultimately perform many of the same
functions that list view does.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.650
The addition of material
design list item animations

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.040
necessitated a significant change
in the way adapters worked.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.560
The list view code was already
exceptionally complicated.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.340
A relatively monolithic code
base handled Layout, Recycling,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.660
Selection, UI decorations like dividers,
Scrolling, Empty View.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.000
The decision was made to start over and
produce a more flexible control.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.070
RecyclerView is focused on doing
precisely what its name suggests.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.670
Managing the recycling of views.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.280
Most of the functions of ListView have
been separated int separate RecyclerView

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.420
components.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.400
And we've added an additional
animator component.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.820
One of the exciting ways this is
being used is with LayoutMangers.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570
Which allows us to create different
pluggable layout experiences.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.280
Of course, we have standard vertical
list views, and horizontal lists.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.250
It's a big deal if you've been
doing Android for a while.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.208
It wasn't actually easy
to do a horizontal list.

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:08.940
Grid layouts and this very cool

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.520
staggered grid layout manager which
lays out children of different sizes.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.650
Which supports horizontal and

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.800
vertical layouts as well as the ability
to layout children in reverse.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.630
One of the key features that
Recyclerview supports is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.370
custom animations.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.730
So if we delete an item
the default animator will

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.820
nicely animate the closing
of the space left behind.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.860
And because the animator,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.900
like everything else in
Recyclerview is plugable.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.830
We can change it and
customize it, the way it works.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.430
And, because the animator, like just
about everything else in Recycler View,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.950
is pluggable, we can customize
the way this works in the future.
