00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.480
Now, we're moving into
the world of native apps.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.050
And this is a world that's flourishing.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.940
You might notice some similarities
between what we spoke about for the web,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.240
but there are also some specific
monetization methods for native apps.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.670
&gt;&gt; At first, you need to think, what
would be the best model for your app?

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.500
It's likely to change, but that's fine.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.920
You need to be agile and
listen to your customers.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700
Let's look at some of
the most popular options.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.840
&gt;&gt; First, you can monetize premium apps.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.280
That's selling your app for
a fixed price.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.240
In a lot of cases, this might not
provide you with enough revenue, so

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.620
you can also optionally include ads or

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.259
use in-app billing to sell
additional features or content.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.880
Now this model works great for
certain categories, like games for kids.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.220
In this example, parents can
pay a full price up front, and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.030
a model with like ads or in-app
purchases may not work as well since

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.690
the kid would have to
make those purchases.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.860
However, this model may also limit your

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.320
app's monetization potential
in developing markets.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.300
You may be able to achieve greater
revenue using the freemium subscription

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.360
or advertising model.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.680
&gt;&gt; And monetizing freemium apps.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.260
Users are more likely
to download a free app.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.620
Later, you could use several
options to monetize.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.250
First, use in app payments
to unlock more features.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.770
For example, games like Angry Birds,
Clash of Clans and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.802
many others, and productivity apps,
Evernote, Springnote,

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.385
all are using this to
provide a free tier.

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:35.195
Second, subscriptions for
recurring services.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.825
It might be used progressively or

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:42.455
expire after a period of time, such as
a game booster or a news subscription.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.695
Many examples like Pandora,
Financial Times, Strava,

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:48.465
Dropbox and many more are using it.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:51.345
Another option is just to
leave the app free, and

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:54.840
use it as a marketing or
as an enhancement to another product.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.805
&gt;&gt; E-commerce is another monetization

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:00.360
option
&gt;&gt; In this model, you can sell physical

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.550
goods, like tomatoes, clothing,
electronics, what have you.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.900
And you can also sell other services.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.217
Think about Etsy and
Amazon as good examples of e-commerce.

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:15.820
&gt;&gt; The question is, which model
gets the best results for your app?

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.750
Most app services are made
to help you figure out

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.230
what combination works best both for
your audience and your bottom line.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.140
You should remember that you
will need a lot of traffic

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780
in order to make this model work for
you.
