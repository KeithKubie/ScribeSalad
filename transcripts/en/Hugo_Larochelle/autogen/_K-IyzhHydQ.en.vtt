00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 in this last capsule on the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.430
 first round logic we will see 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.510
 some last concepts that are 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.730
 important the logic of the first round 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.460
 so far so office that I have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
 describes this is the general principle of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 proof by resolution without 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.930
 necessarily lobry sure comment this 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 that we print as input 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 automation of the prep resolution in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 do we can imagine we could 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.960
 solve this problem the letter the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 heuristic search 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.559
 for example makes it our function 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.700
 purpose that would correspond to reaching a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 state that contains an empty clause in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.760
 what if our state makes both of them 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.950
 initials it would consist of our base 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 of knowledge and then the application 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 of the resolution rule that allows 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.329
 to add formulas to our database 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.199
 knowledge this would correspond to 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.350
 make a transition 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 and here we will try to reach a goal that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.579
 is to reach a state that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.080
 contains the rhythm clause and our 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 office transition function that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 could match all 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.369
 possible applications to rick's 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 resolution a given state and so we 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 would not be able to demonstrate 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.470
 thing if in fact after exploring 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 all the giraffe could not find 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.630
 a state that reaches the goal function so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.450
 we could imagine a way of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 solve the problem or automated the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.189
 proof by resolution with research 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.299
 heuristic searching in a serious 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.560
 I'm not going to the edges and there on by 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.470
 against you can go see the section 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 9 points 5.6 for in the book of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.869
 energetic resources to learn 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 a little more on the subject a few 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.460
 applications of automation of 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 first run logic we can do the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.540
 computer software audit 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.680
 so when it's the basis of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 art knowledge contained any 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.090
 information on the effects of each 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.729
 instruction in the program that their 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.930
 conditions to be executed and the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.860
 kind of question we could ask 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 that's what we can get to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 a state of the program that corresponds to a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.270
 any bug or problem of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.890
 security and so once we have 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.600
 formulated all the effects of each 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.970
 instruction of our program with these 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.140
 conditions of execution in our base 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.910
 of knowledge that can be rephrased 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.460
 problem of finding a bug 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690
 basically a problem of maybe 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.050
 of security compared to our 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.330
 program like a rocket 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.760
 in first order logic we can even 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.670
 defeat the synthesis of 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.050
 software that is, we would formulate 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 a question of this kind is what exists 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.860
 a program that would allow 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.570
 meet a certain specifications 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.590
 the application the support the not rendered of the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.390
 first-order logic 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.300
 however, it is probably the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 expert systems where we have an expert who 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 will put in the bottom all his 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.070
 knowledge his expertise under a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.380
 form 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.550
 logical so that's going to be the basis of 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.370
 knowledge and one could do 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.959
 among other things the medical diagnosis or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.390
 given a patient's symptoms 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.670
 precise to determine what is the key 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.440
 the disease behind these symptoms then 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.160
 what are the what is the treatment the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.110
 more appropriate and so we had a 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.010
 formulation in the form of logic of 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.049
 first order of all his 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.519
 knowledge the bridge could make some 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.290
 queries and finally simulate the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.840
 reasoning of an expert in by 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.760
 to his expertise and one can even 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.940
 to prove theorems 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.410
 automated mathematics I invite you 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.150
 to look in the book where we discuss 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560
 a bit of what kind of theorems have 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.180
 already been shown like that but it's 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 something lucky that is possible to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.080
 do when automating the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.209
 logical reasoning with the logic of 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.250
 first rank and besides also in the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.890
 book we are going to speak just for 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.620
 some mathematical interests we have 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.510
 need them other types of logic 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.860
 there are logic a little more complex 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.360
 that first-rate logic of which it is 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.840
 things that are discussed in the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.380
 book in logic of the first add on 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.190
 normally includes the notion of equality 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.799
 which we denote there with the equal symbol and 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.450
 it's actually a notion that we do not have 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.910
 not spoken in the previous capsules 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.560
 but a way of managing equality in 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.049
 the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.820
 the context we've seen up to 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.040
 now with our definition of the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.660
 syntax of the first rank logic 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.680
 actually wants to add several 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.980
 formulas that would describe equality so 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.660
 which will represent among others 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.630
 symmetry properties transitivity of 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.770
 equality and at that moment adding 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.510
 these formulas there we will be able to 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.639
 manage the notion of equality between 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.370
 different constant that could 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.560
 refer to the same objects and apply the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.930
 proof by resolution that we saw in 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.250
 the president capsules there are 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.070
 other ways of managing equality then 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.130
 for that I invite you to watch the 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.370
 section 9 points 5.5 of the milk of the soul 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.330
 angry and did in practice in 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.580
 automated logic systems 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.560
 often in fact we avoid having to manage 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.139
 equality by doing away with 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.120
 unique or unique English names 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.940
 nielsen 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.880
 this provision did it she says that 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.160
 two constants that have a symbol 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.160
 different necessarily correspond 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.630
 different entity entities so in 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.550
 other words and usefully it wants you 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.490
 to say that we will never designate the same 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.789
 person or the same object under two names 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.680
 different symbols so in this case 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.600
 as simple as we do not really have to 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.820
 manage the equality between terms that 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:46.850
 are different another guess 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.380
 which is sometimes done in logic 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.070
 from the first we suppose we call 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.240
 that the open domain solution what 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.250
 it actually means that there is no 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.220
 no known limits on the set 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.680
 objects that are modeled in our 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.970
 knowledge base what that wants 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.930
 to say concretely is that we can not 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.970
 replace universal quantification 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.710
 like here for all x we ​​could not 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.270
 replace the use of the 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.970
 universal quantification by a 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.229
 very long conjunction or in this 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.660
 example if for all x 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.270
 nobody is mere mortal x 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.630
 can not replace it with a list of 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.979
 formula one would have nobody x implies 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.990
 mortal x for all values 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.130
 possible of x 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.130
 and the reason we can do 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:35.540
 it does not write limit on all 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.410
 terms of the constants which to which 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.010
 could reference 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:43.820
 exit so that's the guess of the 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.530
 open domain and there are some 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.780
 logic reasoning software that will 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.230
 to make rather a guess 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.180
 closed domain because if it takes 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.820
 explicitly say what is the whole 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.480
 objects of my world that I model 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:02.030
 with with the logic of first rank and 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.240
 in this case we could use 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:08.990
 a long, exhaustive conjunction that 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.320
 involves all the objects for that it's 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.600
 another way to actually model 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.920
 or add knowledge 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.290
 involving universal quantification 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.700
 but explicitly it would be 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.410
 possible to do south in a field 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.540
 closed and we can do the same 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:32.030
 reasoning for quantification 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:33.950
 existential another important concept 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.900
 logical and it's a girl guess 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.520
 logical base pts effect this first 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.240
 round this is called the position 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.430
 of an open world in what it wants 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.550
 to say concretely is that if I have 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.750
 learned from kpd x that is not part of 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.550
 the vast knowledge base of 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.620
 formula but it does not imply 

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.990
 necessarily that his contract his 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:57.010
 negation is going to be true ok so if i have 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.510
 not put an acquaintance or a formula 

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.530
 as explicitly true in my base of 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.450
 knowledge a little say that the 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.510
 contrary is true so it means that 

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.150
 negation against some 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.530
 software that logical reasoning 

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.110
 that they are going to do just this 

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.700
 guess there then we'll talk about a 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.960
 closed domain ie question nos 

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.840
 pool comics in something is 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.850
 true its opposite your cold so 

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.920
 prologue is an example of a language of 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.900
 logical programming that allows 

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.510
 to automate logical reasoning 

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.160
 who does these three positions 

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:31.370
 there of which we have just spoken not unique 

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.260
 closed domain then a closed world and 

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.300
 it's actually it's potion water 

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.680
 are quite common and we make them 

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.150
 reference to his kits there 

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.969
 as being on bail of the 

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:44.620
 semantic of tons passes 

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:46.750
 so if in future reading on the 

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.540
 logical provence you see these 

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:53.079
 terms there you will be a little more to what 

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.860
 it corresponds among other ideas of 

00:08:53.079 --> 00:08:59.110
 concepts that are often used in 

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.370
 the practical deployment laws of the 

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.689
 first logical logic of the canton 

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.839
 want automated in a system 

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:03.839
 data processing 

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.500
 finally one thing I did not talk about 

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.750
 again it's actually in my base of 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.129
 initial knowledge so at the very beginning 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.009
 before we start trying to 

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:20.290
 demonstrate something we had 

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:21.629
 explicitly we must assume that there 

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.769
 no contradiction 

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:26.019
 so for example we do not have in our 

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:29.259
 knowledge base predicts copy 

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:31.060
 of x and his negation because 

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:32.110
 actually on my opinion that would be 

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.459
 easy to use art and 

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.230
 resolutions to arrive immediately 

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:38.920
 the empty clause for any 

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.759
 any formula that 

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.819
 would try closely 10 is actually the 

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:49.779
 problem of saying if a conjunction of 

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:51.490
 several clauses a conjunction of 

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:53.050
 several shots I can never between 

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.819
 that is, there is essentially 

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.079
 two contradictions this problem which 

00:09:54.819 --> 00:09:59.199
 knew about computer in time the 

00:09:56.079 --> 00:10:03.309
 problem of satisfying it so 

00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:06.279
 say if we have a conjunction clause that 

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:07.660
 can never be and we'll say it's 

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:11.470
 a klose conjunction that is not 

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:13.779
 satisfactory and the problem of me 

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.910
 answer is like answer to this 

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:17.050
 question there pardon that's what we 

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.620
 call the problem of the satisfied 

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:22.180
 militating and in fact it's a problem that 

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.160
 has been shown to be a problem 

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.660
 mt complete what it was a little 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.300
 accomplice and we do not know 

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.720
 of algorithms that a ponoma complexity 

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.199
 polynomial that can respond to this 

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.639
 problem 

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:36.699
 it's actually the problem of city 

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:37.779
 reliability this is the first problem that 

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:40.509
 has been shown to be a tool 

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:42.370
 complete and after an instance of this 

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:44.079
 problem there that the problem 3 sat who 

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.300
 is very well known in computer science more than 

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:48.640
 you may see NATO 

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.740
 in other courses you go 

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.720
 follow the computer and that it comes 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.030
 to determine a conjunction of lawn 

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.620
 of literal troyes specifically so 

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.210
 with the constraint that we are king the 

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.400
 potting soil in every clause in my 

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.520
 conjunction then the palace of herminis 

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:07.450
 a conjunction clause of three liberals 

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.700
 is satisfying it's a problem that 

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:15.450
 know the problem 3sat so this is a 

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:17.500
 instance of the segregated premium so empowered 

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.870
 unfortunately being a base of 

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.210
 knowledge we have developed is 

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.400
 it is difficult to 

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.470
 to say is there a competition 

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.840
 beats so be careful 

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.250
 when we list our database 

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.020
 knowledge in an application 

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.640
 practice to make sure not to introduce 

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.460
 contradictions which unfortunately 

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.230
 there is not an algorithm that in 

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.590
 all cases in general vote to 

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.180
 be effective in identifying her so 

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.910
 you have to prove your involvement 

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.350
 aude to the development of a database of 

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.620
 knowledge in logic of the first 

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.620
 twenty
