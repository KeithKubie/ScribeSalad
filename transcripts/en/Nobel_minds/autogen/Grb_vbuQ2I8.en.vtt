00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.020
Hello
Oh, hello.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.260
My name is Adam Smith, I'm calling from Nobelprize.org,
the official website of the Nobel Prize.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.180
Do you know what time it is right now?

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.120
Yes, it is just coming up to twenty to two
in the afternoon.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.099
OK, twenty to two good.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.269
If I ramble on can you cut me off at ten to
two ‘cause I have to give a talk at two,

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.279
and set up my slides.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.830
Of course.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.169
You know, I have a keynote at a conference
here I'm giving at two.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.169
Yeah.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.360
Quite right, well I can bet you'll get a stunning
reception.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.199
How nice that you're sticking to schedule.

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.859
Well, first of all, you're in Germany now
so how did the news reach you?

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.281
Just the committee themselves, they called
me around 11:30.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:49.100
And what was your first reaction?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:58.850
Well, I mean, shock, a little bit of quakes
for about 20 seconds, then equal measures

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
of happiness and fear.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.230
What's the fear about?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.940
The fear is, you know, your life being changed.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.830
You know, I mean I really like my life the
way it is now.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.150
And I don't need… you know…

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.110
I'm busy enough as it is.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.040
So I don't like saying no to people and I'm
going to have to learn how to say no more.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:34.160
And I mean obviously I'm happy with it but
I am a little bit scared about how much it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.680
will, particularly over the next three months,
affect things.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.780
Yes indeed.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.580
It comes with the territory, right?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.080
You yourself have tended to tread a fairly
unconventional path.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.930
I mean you resigned from Bell Labs, you stepped
away from academia.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990
Quite a risky strategy.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.990
Well, yes and no.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.510
I mean, in my opinion the only real asset
one has is one's reputation, right?

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.820
I mean any company, and institution can go
belly up at any time.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.200
But if you have a good reputation, you know,
you can usually find somebody who can, who

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.720
thinks they can use what you have to offer.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.200
So, I never really viewed it as all that risky
at some level.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.990
Frankly, I guess, I don't really understand
why people, why so many people, are so risk

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.720
averse.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.290
You know there's always ways to wiggle your
way out of any situation if you're motivated

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.290
enough.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.040
This is a chemistry prize, do you consider
yourself a chemist, a physicist, what?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040
Ha!

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.640
I already said to my son, you know, chemistry,
I know no chemistry.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.780
Chemistry was always my weakest subject in
high school and college.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.680
I mean, you know, it's ironic in a way because,
you know, trained as a physicist, when I was

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.030
a young man I would look down on chemists.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.100
And then as I started to get into super-resolution
and, which is really all about the probes,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.440
I came to realise that it was my karma because
instead I was on my knees begging the chemists

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.510
to come up with better probes for me all the
time.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.130
So, it's just poetic justice but I'm happy
to get it wherever it is.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.240
But I would be embarrassed to call myself
a chemist.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.240
Last question.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.420
You've changed fields a few times in the past.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.030
Do you think you'll change field again?

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.440
Well, I was almost certain I would before
this prize happened.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.460
Now it's going to be, now people are going
to want to keep me from changing too much.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.099
But, you know, it's probably a quixotic dream
but, you know, I've always been… when I

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.250
was a kid I wanted to be an astronaut and
I've been watching with jealousy the development

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.350
of the private space transportation companies.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.290
You know, if I could ever get away from this,
it might be fun some day.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.780
Hell, if I was just sweeping the floor of
the assembly bay while they were putting the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.660
rockets together I just think that would be
a blast.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.420
You know?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.779
I don't know, I'm an engineer at heart so
that impresses me – like super-resolution

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.840
it's just a fascinating engineering challenge.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120
It's been a great pleasure to speak to you.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.120
Thank you very much indeed.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120
Congratulations again.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.210
Alright, good, thanks a lot.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.210
Bye, bye.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.629
Thank you, bye bye.
