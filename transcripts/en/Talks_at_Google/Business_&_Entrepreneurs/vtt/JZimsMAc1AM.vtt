[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:11.350
ANDY LEVITT: Thank you.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.220
Thank you so much.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.380
Appreciate the
introduction, and real happy

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.560
to be here with you all today.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.200
So it's a privilege to come
out and speak at Google

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.210
and share my story,
and I look forward

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.300
to giving you an overview of
what motivates me to start

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.690
this company, and how I try to
make a difference in all that I

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.060
do here through this
company, Purple Carrot,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.380
and I look forward
to our discussion.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.790
So I thought I'd start off today
with an image of our four kids.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.771
It's not necessarily to ask
you to ooh and ah at how cute

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.770
they are, though I do
think they're pretty cute.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.840
I'm a little biased,
as their father.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.990
But these guys
really give me a ton

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.020
of motivation and inspiration
to succeed and make

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.650
a difference in the world.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.530
And I think about the
world that they're

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.960
going to inherit, and
quite frankly, the world

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.740
that each of us is going to be
inheriting in the years ahead,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.260
and it's pretty scary
to think about what's

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.670
happening right now.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.540
I see myself as an optimist.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm usually a
half-full kind of guy.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.360
But when you look out, and
you read the news stories,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.600
and you see some
of the data, it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.150
enough to give you pause about
what our future looks like.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.650
And there are some
people that might

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.890
say it's even too late to make
some meaningful changes that

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.730
could alter the trajectory of
the way our planet is headed,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.690
but I'd like to believe that
if we start acting together

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.460
in a meaningful
and deliberate way,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.290
there's a good chance
that we can change

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.330
the course of our future.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.790
I want to think about creating
a great world for these kids

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.180
to grow up in, and
so this is my story.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.820
So I'm borrowing an image that
I was reminded by from Leonardo

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.120
DiCaprio when he was serving
as the host of a new film that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.520
came out a few months ago
called "Before the Flood."

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.270
I'm not sure if any
of you have seen that,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.940
but this picture really
resonated with me.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940
I was an art history major
in college many years ago,

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.190
and this is an image called
"The Garden of Earthly Delights"

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.100
by Hieronymus Bosch.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.650
It was made about 600
years ago, and it's never

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.460
been more timely to
take a look at this.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.700
So it's a very large triptych.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.450
If we take a look at the first,
leftmost part of the painting,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.860
you see it's a really
nice, idyllic setting.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.300
There's plenty of light.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.380
There's not many people.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.930
It's not overcrowded.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.460
People seem pretty happy.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.510
It's relaxed.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.395
It's open.

00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:38.680
It feels pretty nice.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
As we shift into the middle
panel of the triptych,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.750
you start to see
things changing a bit.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.360
There's a lot of overcrowding.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.870
There's a ton of people.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.950
There's some partying.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:48.670
There's sex.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.080
There's drinking.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.600
People are having a
great time, and it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.300
starts to take a shift
from the earlier stages

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.220
that we saw in that
image Into something that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.580
starts to get a little
bit more like overcrowding

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.150
and the situation that we
might be living in today.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.640
And then at the end, as we
head to the far right part

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.570
of the image, you see it's
really decidedly very dark.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.020
There's death, there's
destruction, there's fires,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.360
there's a lot of concerning
elements to this image.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.860
I think I can see
an image of Donald

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.230
Trump in the bottom
right corner there.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.140
And it's just a scary
view of what might

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.610
be happening in our future.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.460
And for a guy that painted
this more than 600 years ago,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.494
it's worth taking note to think
about what this could mean

00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:31.660
for all of us in our future.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.530
So as you may have
heard in the opening,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.440
I spent a lot of my life in
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.280
about 20 years, promoting the
value of Western medicine.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.510
And I still strongly
believe in the value.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.170
That the drugs that are
created in this country

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.530
are great and can be life
changing and life saving.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.310
But with all those medicines
that are available to us today

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.420
and all the awareness that
is happening in our country,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.170
there's still some
pretty scary statistics

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.790
that are worth pointing out.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.050
For starters, 70% of us
are overweight or obese.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.614
And that's just a
shocking stat to see

00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:11.030
the way people are
consuming food,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.750
and the way they exercise
or don't exercise to be

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.920
in that type of situation.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.240
One in three of us are going
to die of heart disease,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.870
and that actually makes heart
disease America's number one

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.350
killer.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.030
And largely driven by the
food choices that we make.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.770
And on top of
that, 50% of us are

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.689
going to be diabetic or
pre-diabetic by 2030.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.230
And these are three
health conditions

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.110
that are all chronic
in nature and that all

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.040
can be reduced or
reversed by incorporating

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.810
a plant-based diet.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.280
But I think if we
continue to eat

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.610
the sugary, yummy
donuts and fried chicken

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.700
and other things that are
bringing a lot of health issues

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.420
upon us, things are
not going to change.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.100
Environmentally,
it's not much better.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.550
When you look out, and you
think about 50% of our land

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.640
is currently allocated
to animal agriculture.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.430
And to me, that just feels like
an incredibly inefficient use

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.660
of our land.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.450
And it's our choice
to continue to raise

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.540
cattle that is only
raised for slaughter,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.030
largely raised for
slaughter, to feed

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.960
our massive consumption
of meat and of dairy

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.650
and these oversized,
supersized type of appetites

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.840
that people have developed.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640
Now, if you're a
farmer, and you are

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.294
fortunate to have an acre
of land to work with,

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.710
and you decided,
well, what should

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.876
I do with that acre of land?

00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:33.530
And you said, heck, I'm
going to raise cattle.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.240
Well, you can think
about how a farmer's

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.400
going to think
about that product,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.780
and how they could use that
animal to make a profit

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.270
and sell food into
the marketplace,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.620
and the way they could
use that product.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.912
And if you're efficient with
that cattle usage the way

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:51.370
you raise that
cattle, you probably

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.410
can get about 375 pounds
of beef that you're

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.830
able to sell in the marketplace.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.580
If you think about
that same acre of land,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.180
you can get 37,500 pounds
of plant-based food

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.380
from the same space.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.150
So if you stop and think about
the amount of hunger that

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.400
is pervasive across this
world and the growth

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.860
of our population to be north
of 9 billion people in 2050,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.360
we ought to think about how we
can change the way we consume

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.330
food, how we produce food, and
the food choices that we make

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.820
that could be redeploying
some of our land

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.280
and our precious resources to
feed those who are so hungry

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.150
and so in need.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.900
From a water
consumption perspective,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.300
the meat and dairy
industry is associated

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.190
with the use of about
one third of all

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.442
the fresh water on our planet.

00:06:36.442 --> 00:06:38.900
If you just stop and think
about how much water is required

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.750
to raise cattle,
to continue to move

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.580
that process through
the system, it's

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.670
taking up a tremendous amount
of a very limited resource.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.140
And coming out
here to California,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.310
I think about that even
more, as this state rather

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.620
has experienced a tremendous
drought over the last five

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.254
years.

00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:57.170
Things seem to be getting
a little bit better,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.740
but not a whole lot.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.530
And it's a concerning
statement to think

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.110
about how water is being
allocated when it could

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.290
be used in a far different way.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.500
Building on that, the headline
from January of this year

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.660
was that the earth hit
a temperature record

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.694
for the third year in a row.

00:07:13.694 --> 00:07:15.110
And it talks about
how we're going

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.690
into this incredible
change in our environment

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.610
that is considered
to be unsustainable

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.250
by most scientists,
though some will tell you

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.860
that it's fake news.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.320
I would beg to disagree.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.290
Arctic sea ice hit a record low
in the North Pole just a couple

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.430
of months ago.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.800
And that's certainly
clearly driven off

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.510
of the global warming issues.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.480
And just last week, there was a
massive iceberg that broke off

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.190
of the coast of Antarctica.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.340
And it's just more bad
news after more bad news.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.184
So again, I'm not trying to
paint such a miserable picture

00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:47.600
of the world and
what's happening,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.050
but it really points to
some issues that we have.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.150
And a lot of those
problems, with respect

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.480
to the environment, come
off of this incredible use

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.420
of greenhouse gases, or the
emission of greenhouse gases,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.670
and about 18% of
that is associated

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.700
with agricultural farming.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.150
And so that type of practice is
only causing greater problems

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.850
in our environment,
and that trumps

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.970
all of the
transportation emissions

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.220
that people seem to associate
with global warming.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.800
But animal agriculture is the
number one culprit of that.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.384
So when you think
about all that data

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.300
that I just shared with
you, it's probably not

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.780
hard to look back at this image
again of the "Garden of Earthly

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.630
Delights" and think about this
image, there, on the far right,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.630
is not too far off from
where we could be headed

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.816
if we don't make some changes.

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.440
And it is really for
that reason that I

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.720
decided to start my own
company three years ago,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.970
called The Purple Carrot.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.320
The Purple Carrot
is the only 100%

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.899
plant-based meal
kit on the market,

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.190
and we provide all of the
raw, pre-measured ingredients

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.010
that people need to cook
three meals every week that

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.395
are exclusively plant-based.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:53.770
Our whole mission
is that we want

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.660
to get people to eat
more plants, largely

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.072
for the reasons
that I described.

00:08:57.072 --> 00:08:59.155
And we think that there's
a bright future in that,

00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:00.700
and that we need to
help more and more

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.324
people start to think
about eating more

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:03.827
plants as a common way of life.

00:09:03.827 --> 00:09:05.410
It's a little bit
of a weird statement

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.430
to think about eating plants.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.013
I've never loved the
term plant-based,

00:09:08.013 --> 00:09:10.780
because I feel like most of us
don't go out there and think

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.330
about, god, I can't wait
to have some plants today.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.240
It's not really a crave worthy
way of thinking about it.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.370
But there's a lot to that
that we can try to uncover.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.910
It's awesome that here
at Google, Eric Schmidt

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.100
made some predictions
and comments

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.900
about some of the most important
tech trends that are out there.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.690
And the first one
that he commented on

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.350
was Nerds Over Cattle, which
is the idea of using technology

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.680
to drive the greater use of
plant-based foods and meat

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.790
alternatives.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.760
And it's great that he was
so far ahead of the curve

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.490
to be recommending
that as a material way

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.060
we can improve the environment.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.840
I just saw yesterday this
article in "Fast Company"

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.190
about your quest to
develop a plant-based power

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.060
dish more popular than meat.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.560
So I'm not sure if you were
even aware of this as employees,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.900
that there's been some
adjustments in the amount

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.110
of meat content in the burgers,
and it's moving into some more

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.080
mushrooms without
calling that out,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.390
to see if people still
enjoy it as much.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.090
So no matter the way
you're approaching

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.600
getting to a plant-based world,
certainly here at Google,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.810
it's nice to see that
being so well embraced.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.870
So it's a big misconception
that Purple Carrot is just

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.207
for vegans.

00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:23.290
When I started the company
almost three years ago,

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.870
I always said this was
vegan food for non-vegans.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.380
And I'm really thrilled to see
that, as our data represents,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.320
82% of our customer
base are omnivorous.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.290
And we have welcome
surveys when people sign up

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.410
to subscribe to our
service, and they tell us

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.680
what their dietary choices
and preferences are.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.750
And so the fact that
four out of five of them

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.421
continue to eat a
full, omnivorous diet

00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:47.920
is very encouraging,
because I think

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.044
that's where the market is.

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:51.870
That's where the opportunities
to change people's habits

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.517
exist.

00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:54.100
And we're excited
to be doing our part

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.410
to help move them along.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.840
We've created a
word to characterize

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.700
who our customers are.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.550
Someone who is what we
call a balanceatarian.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.706
And this is a word we coined
back in November of last year.

00:11:06.706 --> 00:11:08.080
And the idea is
that it's someone

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.840
who still can embrace
a plant-based diet,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.200
but doesn't totally divorce
themselves from eating meat,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.430
some dairy, and some eggs.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.430
I think it's fair to
recognize that it's

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.130
really hard to be a vegan.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.240
I'm not a vegan.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.320
I eat a lot of
plant-based foods,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.610
but the draw for dairy
and some animal protein

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.970
is pretty pronounced and sort
of deep-seated in our evolution

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.620
as human beings.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.190
And for those who are vegan and
who stick with a vegan diet,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.300
I think it's largely driven
from ethical beliefs,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.930
and I really admire people
who have the ability

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.932
to let that limit
their food choices.

00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:45.640
But for the majority
of people out there,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.200
it's really hard to stick with
a diet of any type, really,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.390
and vegan is extremely
limited in choices.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.199
There's certainly a lot more
today than there ever has been.

00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:56.740
But our goal is to
try to move people

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.350
along a continuum that
almost looks at us as sort

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.190
of a gateway drug of sorts.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.254
That the more you start craving
and enjoying plant-based meals,

00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:05.920
the less and less you
are going to start

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.277
to want to eat animal protein.

00:12:07.277 --> 00:12:09.610
The less you'll want to have
dairy, and the more mindful

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.330
you'll be about the food choices
that you continue to make.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.450
So you can proudly say
you are a balanceatarian.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.360
So the trends are
certainly with us.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.340
This is a pretty cool
chart, worth sharing.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.250
It was an image I captured
from Google Trends,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.350
and all the bright
people in this company

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.460
have this novel tool that allows
guys like me to log in and type

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.190
in the word plant-based, and see
the trends over the last five

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.849
years.

00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:35.890
And it's pretty amazing
to look over here and see

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.079
this type of spike in the last
few months around plant-based.

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:40.870
So it gives us a lot
of hope and confidence

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.369
that we're making a difference
and getting on people's radar

00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:45.750
screen, as the
general consciousness

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.774
is increasing about the
importance and value

00:12:48.774 --> 00:12:49.690
of plant-based eating.

00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:53.890
So I thought it
might be worth just

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.955
taking a moment or two talking
a bit more about that category.

00:12:56.955 --> 00:12:58.330
I'm not sure, by
a show of hands,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.650
how many people have
or use a meal kit?

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.450
So you get the idea.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.620
It was started by Matt, who
launched Blue Apron back

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.820
in 2012.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.280
And Nick from Plated was at
Harvard with him as well,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.150
and the two of those guys
started similar companies,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.440
Blue Apron and Plated,
right around the same time.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.470
And Blue Apron has
really run away

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.310
with the dominant brand
in the meal kit category.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.150
Hello Fresh came
over from Europe,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.450
which is where the
whole concept started.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.180
And those three companies
began the process

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.180
about five years ago.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.510
And it's amazing to think
that this industry is

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.370
only five years old.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.309
The idea is that consumers can
subscribe to these services,

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:42.850
and they are shipped all of the
raw, pre-measured ingredients

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.980
in little baggies or bottles
and containers that really

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.690
should make it a lot
easier for people

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.114
to cook at home every week.

00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:55.280
My wife and I would always
talk, and in the morning,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.420
be sitting there
having breakfast.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.830
And she might turn
to me and say,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.750
honey, what are we having
for dinner tonight?

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.880
And even though I started
this company three years ago,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.213
I still get that question a lot.

00:14:03.213 --> 00:14:05.390
But it's made a
little bit simpler

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.220
thinking about maybe
the choices are, well,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.910
which Purple Carrot
meals do we have

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.160
in our refrigerator this week.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.460
So the idea is that it's
really intended to make

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.790
it easier for people to cook.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.180
They all come with these
colorful recipe cards

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.950
that explain step by
step instructions,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.870
with the before and
after shots of what

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.730
you're looking to create.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.580
It provides a curator
experience of meals

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.430
that all tend to go together
in that particular week.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.560
They can align specific
to dietary needs

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.260
or dietary preferences
that you might have.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.410
And it's a lot of fun.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.951
It's a nice way to
learn how to cook,

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:40.040
and I think there's a lot of
millennials who are also not

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.160
as informed about how to cook
as some of the older generations

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.230
and look for guidance,
and meal kits

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.420
do a great job of
providing that training

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.330
in tutorial experience.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.460
So from a business
perspective though,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.097
it's really become a
very dynamic category.

00:14:55.097 --> 00:14:56.930
What you see here on
the screen are a couple

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.450
of images about the
different meal kit delivery

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.380
companies in the food
tech space and the growth,

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.590
largely driven off of
this part of the country,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.650
or in Silicon Valley.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.190
The massive influx
of cash and capital

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.810
into the food tech space.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.620
Food was sort of considered the
new tech from a few years ago,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.530
and a lot of money
has rushed in.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.170
A lot of it has been focused
around the immediate delivery.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.610
And I think that
those of you here

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.540
can attest to the commonality
of on-demand, everything being

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.990
here in 10 or 15 minutes, and
just that incredible mindset

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.830
that is really dominant here in
this part of the country, that

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.290
may be less pronounced in
other places that are certainly

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.650
far less concentrated
with a population.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.890
And a lot of hope has been
placed on these rapid delivery

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.270
options companies.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.420
But a lot of them are starting
to fail or have been failing,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.070
if they're not
closed down already,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.930
on these VC dreams of where
and how fast there can be

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.720
disruption in the marketplace.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.870
The category around food tech
has just exploded though,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.980
and you can see from this image
the incredible amount of logos

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.160
and brands and players that are
all trying to pursue and make

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.830
a bit of a difference
and find their spot

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.490
with their own offering
somewhere around the way people

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.440
consume food.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.750
As a frame of reference,
the grocery business

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.050
is about an $800
billion dollar category.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.462
The meal kit category is far
smaller, at about $5 billion,

00:16:25.462 --> 00:16:28.100
with a lot of room
for growth, certainly.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.220
But the way people consume
food and how frequently

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.540
they do it is a big reason for
a lot of these companies coming

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.830
into play to try to
disrupt the space.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.260
From a meal kit perspective,
I'm really honored

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.590
to see our name in a pretty
short list of companies

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.100
that are considered
leaders in the category.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.040
What I show you here are what
I would consider the leaders.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.360
I probably would add Sunbasket,
maybe, at this point.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.140
Maybe instead of Peach Dish.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.360
But there's a relatively
small grouping

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.910
now of companies who I think
have found their niche, who are

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.579
doing well, who are growing.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.680
And where I would
look at this is

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.680
that Purple Carrot stands
out as the only one that

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.140
offers 100% plant-based meals.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.849
The rest of them
really are focusing

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.770
on pretty much the
same type of offering.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.900
That's not to disparage those
offerings, they're all great.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.470
But I think that it
leads to so much more

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.839
competition for the same type of
consumer, who the companies are

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.650
looking to acquire
as subscribers,

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.880
and offering a pretty identical
offering from any of these.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.320
And given the substantial
venture capital investment

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.240
that these companies
have received,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.100
they're able to use
those dollars to offer

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.480
free trials and first box
free, or 50% off these orders.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.990
And it creates a pretty
promiscuous user base,

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.940
where you can game the system.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.660
You can try any one of these
companies, including ours,

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.960
and shift each different
week and get discounts.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.577
Ours, we don't discounters
much, kind of for that reason.

00:18:00.577 --> 00:18:01.910
We don't want to play that game.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.480
But there's a big, big
shift of the way people

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.740
are thinking about how
they consume meals,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.074
and the category is growing.

00:18:09.074 --> 00:18:10.990
I think it's a pretty
exciting space to be in,

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.330
and it's an honor to
be in this short list.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.624
Now, there is a new player in
the category that just came out

00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:17.540
a couple of weeks ago.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.000
You might have heard of this
company, they're called Amazon.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.200
It's a little bit scary
when, being in this space,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.660
you see a name like that
announcing that they're

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.810
entering the category.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.324
Jeff Bezos and team are a
pretty dominant force in what

00:18:33.324 --> 00:18:34.490
they want to do and disrupt.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.610
You've got to give them a
lot of respect and belief

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.151
that they can do
whatever they really

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:40.710
want to do, given
their infrastructure,

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.970
their knowledge, their financial
capabilities, supply chain

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.100
control, reach, consumer
engagement, the list goes on.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.090
So seeing that, it was
both like, oh no, great.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.249
And then, great, oh no.

00:18:54.249 --> 00:18:56.540
You know, that was sort of
happening in the same moment

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.890
when I saw that news.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.719
But they're now into the mix
with meal kits of their own.

00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:01.260
So we'll see.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.650
I think they're still
pretty much in a beta phase,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.560
offering it to a limited number
of people in the Seattle area

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.160
through Amazon Fresh.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.910
But it probably won't be long
before they become slightly

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.070
more involved in this category.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.520
They even filed a
trademark to do meal kits.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.950
And that has been
a bit of a pain

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:26.445
point for Blue Apron, which went
public just at the end of June,

00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:28.320
right around the same
time this is happening.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.304
So it's pretty
current information

00:19:30.304 --> 00:19:31.220
that I'm sharing here.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.610
And it does make me wonder if
Matt Salzberg did something

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.400
to piss off Jeff
Bezos, because it's

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.490
shocking to see the timing, and
I feel a little bad for him.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.600
But when they launched
their IPO at $10 a share,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.870
just at the end of June, it's
now trading around $6.75 or so.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.910
And it's really been
under pressure, largely

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:55.290
from Amazon's decision to
move into the meal kit space.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.417
They've really been
battered down by the news

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:00.500
that Amazon is doing that.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.590
They're also, of
course, further hurt

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.690
by the fact that
Amazon's also announced

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.652
that they are buying Whole Foods
Market for almost $14 billion.

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:11.360
And the timing of
those two announcements

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.890
came right after the other.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.240
One before the other, actually.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.980
And that's been a big
problem for Blue Apron,

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.510
as Amazon sits out there as a
big competitor in the space.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.790
It certainly is a
competitor to me

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.670
at Purple Carrot
and our business.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.772
So interesting times.

00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:29.480
I thought it was worth
sharing this image

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.230
that I found that was
incredible to see.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.250
And as much as you see
how they negatively

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.980
impacted Blue Apron in their
recent IPO and their stock

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.874
price, how as soon
as Amazon announced

00:20:39.874 --> 00:20:42.290
the acquisition of Whole Foods,
what it did to the grocery

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.770
category, to see Walmart,
Kroger, Target, and Costco

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.619
get totally pummeled.

00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:49.160
The only one that
went up, of course,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.340
was Whole Foods, through
that acquisition.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.110
I believe that also
Amazon announced

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:59.300
they're moving into replacing a
Geek Squad that Best Buy offers

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.020
traditionally.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.540
And Best Buy had this similar
type of negative impact.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.280
So Amazon's a really substantial
player in the category.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.310
And probably other than Google,
as a sort of dominant player

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.800
out there, you have to
give them a lot of respect

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.690
for what they can do.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.240
So it sort of feels like
this is the moment where

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.250
I'm that little guy in
the diaper, practically,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.390
and facing up against this
really strong competitor,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.050
to think, how in God's name am
I going to be able to compete

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.400
with these huge players?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.017
And it has really
been a challenge,

00:21:31.017 --> 00:21:32.600
I think, since I
launched the company,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.670
where I wasn't a food guy.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.910
I was not a VC.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.860
I'd come from a 20 year history
in the pharmaceutical world,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.530
and I think people
thought, you're

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.970
launching a vegan product?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.280
There's a very small
percentage of vegans out there.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.050
Depending on which
study you believe,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.850
it's anywhere from 2%
to 6% of the population.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.630
And people said, Andy, why
doesn't Blue Apron just go do

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.250
their own vegan line?

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.320
And it was really
hard to get out there.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.120
So I'm proud of the
fact that here we

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.211
are, almost three
years later, a part

00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.960
of the national
conversation on meal kits.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.545
But it's only going to get
harder and more competitive.

00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:06.920
And so I'll spend
the last couple

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.770
of minutes talking
about what I see

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.230
as part of our ways to succeed.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.332
So the guy on the screen here.

00:22:15.332 --> 00:22:16.040
You may know him.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.440
His name is Guy Kawasaki.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.830
Guy is an incredible thinker.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.630
He's now a venture capitalist.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:28.010
He was most well known, I think,
for being the first evangelist

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.780
at Apple Computers.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.720
And now, probably
30 plus years ago,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.770
guy was out there
evangelizing Apple to schools

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.200
to get Apple
Computer to be known.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.830
And it was a very little
known company back then,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.920
and Guy was this very
innovative thinker.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.584
And he has evolved
into the world of VC.

00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:51.500
And he wrote a book
called "Art of the Start."

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.250
And I read that book back in
the end of 2006, actually.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.644
And it's always stayed with
me, and some great things.

00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:00.560
So if anyone's in here
thinking about starting

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.450
their own company,
I'd highly recommend

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.960
you take a look at this
book, "Art of the Start."

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.626
And the first thing
that Guy talks about

00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:08.670
in there is this idea,
that he says, make meaning.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.090
It's different from make money.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.730
And while he is a
venture capitalist

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.063
and thinks about that, he's
probably made a ton of money

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:16.690
in his life.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.490
And as much as I want
to make money in mine,

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:23.240
the idea about
focusing your decisions

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.630
and deciding how you want to
go about building a company

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.450
is having it grounded with
the underpinning about make

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.020
meaning.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.853
And that's been really
pronounced in the way

00:23:31.853 --> 00:23:33.815
I've thought about
building up Purple Carrot.

00:23:33.815 --> 00:23:35.690
About providing something
that's plant-based,

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.630
that has all the benefits
that we talked about up front.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.280
That creates a
meaningful opportunity

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.170
to establish ourselves
and do something

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.500
that is inherently
different from a lot

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.910
of the other competitors
in the category.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.200
So I really love-- this
artist's name is Hugh MacLeod,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.810
and he created something
called Gaping Void.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.570
So if you're not familiar
with Hugh or his work,

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.120
I'd encourage you to
check out gapingvoid.com.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.770
And you can sign up and get
this daily feed of his doodles.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.080
And this one I saw
several years ago,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.760
and it also stayed
with me a lot,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.940
which is this idea of living
on the edges or not at all.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.050
And seeing that, it just
felt like the whole idea

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.720
was to stand out and be
different and be distinguished.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.824
And it's scary,
and it's exciting,

00:24:20.824 --> 00:24:22.240
but that's how
you'll get noticed.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.850
And I followed up on
that image recently

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.309
to see a bit more about
what he wrote about.

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:29.600
I thought I'd read this to you.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.460
He says, "just as sheep
move to the center

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.510
of the flock for purely survival
reasons, so do human beings.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.750
That's why we wear khakis
and join tennis clubs.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.960
But some of us move to the
edges for the exact same reason;

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.450
survival.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.080
If we stay in the
middle, we're just

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.060
going to get creamed
like everybody else

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.066
once the market moves on."

00:24:49.066 --> 00:24:53.330
And I think Google is probably
the most innovative, edgy

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.885
company out there, so I
would imagine this resonates.

00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:57.980
But I thought that was
pretty cool to see that.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.790
And again, going to that
edge of providing vegan food

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.504
for non-vegans was the edge.

00:25:04.504 --> 00:25:06.920
People said, why don't you
just offer a vegetarian option,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.980
which to me would be far more
mainstream and simplistic.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.770
But all the other big guys
have vegetarian options,

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.170
none of them offer vegan.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:18.550
And so that was the
approach to go to the edge.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.980
So another guy who I love is a
guy by the name of Seth Godin.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.960
And he's photographed
here for you.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:30.110
And Seth has been one of the
most pronounced influences

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.620
in my whole life.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.640
And I think he's
a genius of a guy.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.870
He's written a ton of books.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:38.510
If you don't know Seth,
I really encourage

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.270
you to check out sethgodin.com
and sign up for his blog.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.350
You click on his bald head, and
you can get his blog every day.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.420
And every day for years, he
writes an incredible blog

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.790
that you'll get in
your inbox for free.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.530
And he's just a
brilliant writer.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.090
He's written a lot of books,
and he does wonderful work.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.595
So I can't say enough
great things about him.

00:25:56.595 --> 00:25:58.220
But one of the books
that he's written,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.310
of the 18 or 20 books
or so out there,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.290
is a book called "Purple Cow."

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.360
And "Purple Cow" is all
about being remarkable.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.460
It's transform your
business by being

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.470
remarkable is the subtext.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.360
And the storyline
with "Purple Cow"

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.772
is that if you're driving out--

00:26:12.772 --> 00:26:14.480
he was driving with
his family in France,

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.510
I believe-- and he was going
along, past this pasture.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.342
And there's cows, and they stop.

00:26:19.342 --> 00:26:21.050
And at first they
think, no, that's cool.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:21.841
There's these cows.

00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.260
And then in a minute,
it's not that interesting

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.070
when there's just
all these cows.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.880
And he said, imagine if
you saw a purple cow.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.840
You would stop the car.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.330
You'd get out.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.040
You'd take pictures.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.206
You'd tell all your friends.

00:26:32.206 --> 00:26:35.090
And it was this idea of creating
a purple cow or something that

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.000
is remarkable that
forces you, almost, given

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.550
its remarkable nature,
to tell people about it

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.870
and speak to others
and spread the word.

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.140
So when I think
about purple cow,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.110
that was sort of the genesis of
the name of my company, Purple

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.040
Carrot.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.050
I remember thinking about
starting this company

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.966
and walking down Park
Avenue South in New York

00:26:52.966 --> 00:26:54.985
City one night, and it
just kind of hit me.

00:26:54.985 --> 00:26:55.610
And I said, OK.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.620
That's the name of my
vegan company, Purple Cow--

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.536
Purple Carrot, rather.

00:26:58.536 --> 00:26:59.480
[CHUCKLING]

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.350
Still slip.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.230
And so it's been great.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.090
And it's really about
being different.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.430
So I thought about,
well, how could we

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.900
be remarkable in our space?

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.664
What can we do to stand out?

00:27:11.664 --> 00:27:13.080
What you see on
the screen here is

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.430
an image of me talking
about one of our meals.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.601
And this dish here
is Okonomiyaki,

00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:23.100
which most people probably don't
even know how to pronounce.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.490
It took me a little while to
get that right for the video.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.430
But the idea is that
it came from a moment

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.040
that my wife and I had
a few months earlier,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.500
where the last meal we
had at home that week

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.665
was called Tofu Halloumi.

00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:39.060
And it was one of our
meals from Purple Carrot.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.000
And I didn't know
what Halloumi was,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.740
and I wasn't that
excited about what that

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.390
seemed like it was going to be.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.400
And we ended up
making it, and it

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.740
was one of my favorite
Purple Carrot meals

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.425
I've had in three years.

00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:52.800
And I thought,
god, people really

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.720
need to understand
what our meals are.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.470
Because we do have some
unique and not common

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.575
names to our products or
to our recipes each week,

00:28:01.575 --> 00:28:05.920
and it's part of the adventure
of trying plant-based meals.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.810
Okonomiyaki is no different as
far as not a commonplace name.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.140
And so I felt like if I can get
out there and talk about one

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.530
of the three meals every
week through video, post that

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.206
to social as well as share that
over email to our database,

00:28:20.206 --> 00:28:22.080
there might be another
reason for someone who

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.480
has all those choices from
the number of companies

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.680
that I shared with you.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.725
That instead of looking
at something and saying,

00:28:27.725 --> 00:28:29.100
I've never heard
of that, I'm not

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.930
going to take the
risk of spending money

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.600
on a product that's going to
make me look foolish at home,

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.989
but hearing from me--

00:28:34.989 --> 00:28:36.030
or someone at my company.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.821
I was the one that they
nominated to do it.

00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:39.570
So I said OK.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.920
Unfortunately,
these have converted

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.640
at about six times the rate
of our typical e-mails.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.390
So it's been really cool to
see video and the connectivity

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.520
we are building with
our customer base

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.540
to create a real, emotional
connection with them,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.350
so that they feel
connected to our product.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.180
And they feel a reason
to stick with us

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.610
and continue to
subscribe and not

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:04.260
maybe choose other options that
they have on the marketplace.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.860
Something else that feels very
probably Google-esque that

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.700
maybe has already
been developed here

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.930
is something that we are looking
about releasing in a Purple

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.020
Carrot app that will
soon to be developed

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.900
that will allow people
to track their impact

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.840
and to create a game-ification
system of sorts.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.420
That as you use
Purple Carrot, you

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.000
can track and see how
much water you've saved,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.710
how much carbon
emissions you've reduced

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.650
through your choice
of meals, and create

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.990
a competitive
game-ified experience

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.400
from you and your friends.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.710
This idea of a network
effect that your product has.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.420
How can you make your
product better when

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.060
your friends are using it also?

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:41.190
Right?

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.780
So the famous example
is the first guy

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.034
who bought a fax machine.

00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.450
I don't know what
he was thinking,

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.730
to think who he was going
to send a fax to if nobody

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.870
else had the machine.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.330
But how can you
make Purple Carrot

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.330
better, or more interesting,
more sticky to our customer

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.230
base, so that if you can create
this game-ified approach,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.240
make you feel like you're
a part of something

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.280
larger than yourself
by tracking your impact

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.460
and seeing how this month,
by eating these meals,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.860
as compared to more traditional
meals that would be similar,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.710
you've saved thousands and
thousands of gallons of water.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.800
It's like leaving your
shower on for three months.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.480
Instead, you've
eaten these meals.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.490
And so ways to do that.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.580
We're excited about what
that will look like for us.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.270
We've also partnered with a guy
that some of you may have seen.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.550
His name is Tom Brady.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.680
We partnered with Tom
and his colleagues

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.840
at TB12 back in
March of this year,

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.440
so we're about four or five
months into that partnership.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.560
It's a three-year engagement
that we have with him.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.630
And Tom is about an
80% plant-based eater,

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:47.280
and he represents, to
me, the absolute pinnacle

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.510
of success for a human being, to
achieve all that he's achieved.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:55.410
He turns 40 next week, and he's
playing at the top of his game.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.460
And he assigns a lot
of value to the foods

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.880
that he eats as a key component
to his long-term success.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.530
So TB12 is all about sleep
and muscle pliability

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.190
and nutrition and mental
energy and hydration.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.750
And so as five of those key
components exist for them,

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.610
Purple Carrot fit
in really nicely.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.509
And when we went out and spoke
with those guys last fall,

00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:22.800
we talked to them about Purple
Carrot and the potential

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.700
to create a
long-term partnership

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.330
and develop the TB12
performance meals.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.150
And so we were really
thrilled with that Tom

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:35.220
is a partner with us and has
allowed us to create a new line

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.690
extension from Purple Carrot.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.560
So we have our core meals
that feed two people.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.825
We have a family plan.

00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:43.950
And then now we offer these
TB12 performance meals,

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.050
which are gluten-free as well as
plant-based and slightly higher

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.120
in protein.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.210
And so it's another way to
differentiate and distinguish

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.450
ourselves.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.920
And through our
partnership, we've

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.550
tried to take that
a level deeper

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.370
by offering exclusive
content that

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.630
takes us beyond a meal kit.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.710
But now you're really a
part of the TB12 line.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.340
A lot of people have signed up
because they love Tom Brady.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.240
I'm one of them.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.640
But there's also a
whole desire for health.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.950
And so what created through
these TB12 newsletters

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.670
is exclusive content
that you can only

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.610
get by being a subscriber.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.670
And so every other month, we
put out these newsletters.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.810
They're eight pages.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.160
They are all designed in-house.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.320
This is an example of
one of the spreads that

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.970
shows various summer
produce, different sauces

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:33.950
that Tom might enjoy, and things
that are consistent with that.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.110
We've featured "24
hours with Tom."

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:37.530
We've got "Questions with Tom."

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.250
We've got
behind-the-scenes content

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.250
that you're just not going
to get anywhere else.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.220
And again, that's
an exclusive piece

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.220
of the way we can
merchandise and make

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.900
the most of this partnership.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.390
We also have the
nice opportunity

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.850
to send our subscribers
a letter from Tom.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.525
You see that in
the far left side,

00:32:54.525 --> 00:32:56.150
with a little bit of
a creepy guy who's

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.310
there holding the image of Tom.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.810
And then on the
right, it's actually

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.930
a real autographed binder.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:04.370
Tom signed 12 of these.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.596
Everything he does
is in the 12 number,

00:33:07.596 --> 00:33:09.220
as you can imagine,
with the number 12.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.340
And so what we did is when
you order our product,

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.282
after your 12th
box has arrived--

00:33:15.282 --> 00:33:17.240
after three months--
you'll get a wooden binder

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.330
that's got this TB12 etching in
it with the performance meals,

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.120
and it's a three-ring
binder where

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.260
you can retain and organize
the recipe cards that we ship,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.960
that are also
three-hole punched.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.030
And so 12 lucky people received
an autographed Tom Brady

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:32.930
binder.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.460
And people post it on social.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.350
And it just allows
us to do things

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:39.660
that really no other
meal kit can do.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.230
So we feel pretty good about
where we're headed there.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.840
And it comes down to this image.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.170
When I think about the sea of
choices and what's out there,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.690
how can we stand out, and how
can we take all these choices

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.690
and say, I'm the guy that
they're going to pick.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.480
And so that's what drives
me to try to do that.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.010
I'll leave you with this last
image from Hugh that I love,

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:01.970
and it just really spoke to me.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.860
And a lot of the
words that he shared

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.670
when he posted this image
about you try so hard,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.480
and you're scared.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.719
You wake up in the
middle of the night.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.552
You've got a pain in
your side, and you just

00:34:11.552 --> 00:34:13.949
do it because you love it,
and you believe in the future.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:17.540
And so this idea of I love
this, and it's terrifying.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.670
And I can tell you,
it is terrifying.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.960
It's a thrill.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.510
It's an honor to do what I do.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.310
And I'm just looking
to make a difference,

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.260
and hopefully we're succeeding.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.804
So thank you so
much for listening.

00:34:29.804 --> 00:34:32.179
You can get in touch with me
with that information there.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.370
And I'm happy to take
any questions from anyone

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.750
here or remotely.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.500
Thank you so much.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.760
AUDIENCE: I was curious
about big food lobbying.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.021
And I'm sure--

00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:49.020
I mean, obviously lobbyists
have a big influence

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.679
on policies that
encourage meat consumption

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.840
and how much meat we sell
in our grocery stores

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.910
and advertisements for
cool steaks on the grill

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.610
and all of that stuff.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.320
So do you-- is there
a way to combat that?

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.230
Because I would like to see
more companies like this

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.370
advertised, and senators
fighting for plant-based meals

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.150
in public schools.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.560
Stuff like that.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:19.350
Are there any things we could
do to scale this quickly, or?

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.850
ANDY LEVITT: Thank you.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.979
I love the support.

00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:25.020
We just watched a documentary
about two weeks ago

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.310
called "What the Health."

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:28.890
I'm not sure if
you've seen it yet,

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.240
but it's really
worth checking out.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.600
It really highlights
the inherent conflict

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.820
that exists between big
food and our government

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.600
and the presentation of
meals and the recommendations

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.260
that are made.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.920
And also with health
advocacy groups

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.290
within the pharmaceutical world.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:57.660
It was really concerning to see
this misalignment of incentives

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.390
where the American Diabetes
Association or the American

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.720
Heart Association, which one
would think as a consumer,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.700
you could rely upon
for good guidance,

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.270
and then you start to
see the amount of money

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.484
and the funding that comes
in from big industry.

00:36:12.484 --> 00:36:14.400
So whether that's the
pharmaceutical companies

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.090
or the large food manufacturers,
candy companies, meat

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.600
companies, dairy
companies, the works.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.720
They're all part of that.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.220
And their goal is to
further perpetuate

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.410
the consumption of the
foods and the products

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.230
that they create and
provide, and there's

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.640
that inherent misalignment.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.587
So I think it's a big task
to fight big government.

00:36:37.587 --> 00:36:39.420
I think documentaries
like "What the Health"

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:43.290
do a really nice job of
shining that bright light.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:45.165
And I think it's--

00:36:45.165 --> 00:36:50.670
there's a bumper sticker that
says, when the people lead,

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.797
the leaders will follow.

00:36:51.797 --> 00:36:52.630
Something like that.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:55.995
It's that idea that I think we
have to start acting together.

00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:58.380
It talks about what I said
at the beginning of this.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.850
Our world is on pretty
precarious ground.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.190
And I think as more people
start to make those changes,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.856
it doesn't seem weird anymore to
think about eating plant-based.

00:37:07.856 --> 00:37:09.660
And I'm amazed out
here in California

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.130
how much choice there is
and how aware that is.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:16.870
And it's not
everywhere like that.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.300
And so I think the more it
becomes more mainstream,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.200
the more you see the growth
of plant-based searches,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.430
the more leaders get involved.
and I think the more change

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.970
that comes through a younger
generation of millennials

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.930
who are the very large cohort,
who also are the ones that

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.590
are most interested
in transparency,

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.540
in meat and dairy replacements.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.870
That that's going to
start shifting policies

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:46.160
that will enable more of
us to succeed through this.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.417
So.

00:37:47.417 --> 00:37:48.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.250
ANDY LEVITT: Yeah, thank you.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:56.420
So my question is about
how you source recipes.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.830
I have been preparing
plant-based meals probably

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.430
for about a year and a half, and
I've done several Purple Carrot

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.982
recipes, and I find that
they are very unique compared

00:38:06.982 --> 00:38:09.190
to a lot of the things that
you find on the internet,

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:12.160
in terms of the ways
that you can create

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.520
really interesting things.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.330
For example, there was a recipe
where you made scallops out

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:20.290
of mushrooms, which was really
awesome and tasted great.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.540
So I'm just wondering where
are these ideas come from,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.970
and who's working on
the recipes themselves.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.290
ANDY LEVITT: Sure.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:29.200
So by and large, all the recipes
that we make at Purple Carrot

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.350
come from our own
chefs we have on staff.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.850
So back in-- we're based
in the Boston area.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:39.310
We've got about 30 employees
on staff full-time.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.140
Two of those are
chefs, and we've

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.660
got a couple other sous
chefs and assistants

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:48.340
to help order products for
them to be testing in our test

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.556
kitchen back in Boston.

00:38:50.556 --> 00:38:52.180
We do outsource our
fulfillment, and we

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.880
have that happening in three
centers in New York, LA,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.530
and Ohio.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.750
So our corporate
offices, if you will--

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.450
they're not that corporate--
but the corporate office

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.840
has these 30 folks, and
we have a test kitchen.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.430
And so are our chefs are just
singularly focused on creating

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.320
incredible plant-based meals.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.150
We have parameters
by which they need

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.750
to stay, from both the cost
of the meals, and the cost

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.760
of ingredients,
the time it's going

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.030
to take to make a
dish, some of the--

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.280
we try not to have more
than one of the three meals

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.170
every week require
a food processor,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.380
just to find the balance.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.480
Not make them too complex.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.970
Which we tend to be a little
bit more chef-y than maybe

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.480
I would like, but it
is that experience.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.400
But the flavors--

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.470
I really have to just applaud
the work that our chefs do

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.609
to create incredible things.

00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:45.400
The mushroom dish that
you mentioned though

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.010
comes from a couple
of friends of mine

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.740
who run a company called
Wicked Healthy, Derek and Chad

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.490
Sarno, who are really
incredible vegan chefs.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.890
And they take these
king oyster mushrooms,

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.850
and they taste and
feel like scallops.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.420
They're incredible.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.440
So you'd never know
that for someone

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.680
who wants to make this
transition from eating

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.390
a more traditional diet to
one that's more plant-based,

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.880
how far things have
come with innovation

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.050
using oyster mushrooms that
you slice and you saute a bit.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.770
It looks, it tastes, it
feels like a scallop.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.300
So it's cool.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.520
But I think there's a--

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.382
what we try to do is make
our meals taste so good

00:40:31.382 --> 00:40:32.590
that you don't miss the meat.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.477
You don't miss those flavors.

00:40:34.477 --> 00:40:37.060
And again, we're trying to get
someone to do that three nights

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.570
a week.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.380
We're not saying be vegan.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.450
As I said, I'm not vegan.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.330
I don't preach veganism
through our company.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.062
And I think that's gotta be
someone's personal choice.

00:40:45.062 --> 00:40:47.020
For the majority of people
that aren't choosing

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.330
that, I think if you start
eating this three nights

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.663
a week, you might say, wow,
that's actually really good.

00:40:51.663 --> 00:40:53.671
And you almost become
more inclined to watch

00:40:53.671 --> 00:40:55.420
the documentaries, to
start seeing things.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.020
And not so much in terms of
the shocking, horrible animal

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.494
treatment that exists
that I think a lot of us

00:41:01.494 --> 00:41:03.910
stick our head in the sand and
don't want to pay attention

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:05.430
to that animal suffering.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.560
And we don't ever talk about
that within our company.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.450
I think that's a hard
thing to trade upon.

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.825
But I think for
those people that

00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:15.250
start to get curious
about it and learn more,

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.224
it starts to seep in.

00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:17.890
And once the genie
is out of the bottle,

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.850
it's hard to put it back in.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.520
And so if we can just
get people to make

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.620
some gentle shifts over
time without saying,

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.710
hey, everybody's
got to go be vegan.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.270
I think that's unsustainable.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:32.170
But if we can all make some
subtle changes in our diet,

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.150
the impact we can
make collectively

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.739
is really quite pronounced.

00:41:35.739 --> 00:41:36.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.354
Thank you so much.

00:41:37.354 --> 00:41:38.020
My name is Alex.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.030
I work on Google
Express, and we try

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:44.210
to connect people to their local
stores, like Target and Costco.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.890
And in doing so, we notice that
when competing with Amazon,

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.430
these local stores
struggle on the operation

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.420
side and the shipping.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.424
How does Purple
Carrot deal with that?

00:41:56.424 --> 00:41:58.090
ANDY LEVITT: Take it
a little bit deeper

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.210
from the operations of just
shipping to our customers, or--

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.430
AUDIENCE: Shipping to
customers and getting things

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.980
within the two days
or fast delivery

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.650
that other meal kit companies
have also struggled with.

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.400
ANDY LEVITT: Sure.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:09.900
OK.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.410
Thank you for the question.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:15.040
So when I first
launched the company,

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.470
we were-- it started in my
garage for the first month.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.750
And then we moved into a
slightly more proper facility,

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.120
but it was not so proper.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.770
And we had no heat
through that winter.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.400
We launched in October,
so in November,

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.170
we were in this facility.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.570
By December, it was
starting to snow in Boston,

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.070
and it was just bloody
cold for the next 90 days.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.220
And a lot of snow that winter.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.710
And we were in this
warehouse with no heat,

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.510
and our product was--

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.510
we weren't so worried
about it losing freshness,

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.926
but we were limiting it to one
and two day ground shipping

00:42:45.926 --> 00:42:47.860
with a FedEx truck.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.800
We use insulation and gel packs.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.810
And the produce would hold up.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.375
We were learning that
basil might wilt.

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:57.390
It almost gets too cold,
and it would turn black,

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:58.902
and it would perish.

00:42:58.902 --> 00:43:01.110
As we moved into the summer,
with no air conditioning

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:04.020
either, and we're
in this warehouse

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.730
that was just like 90 degrees.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.650
It was miserable.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.620
Those products would also
start to wilt in the heat.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.500
So that wasn't-- we quickly
got ourselves out of that

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.972
because we realized that
was not working so well.

00:43:15.972 --> 00:43:17.430
Where in the box,
there would still

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.181
be a lot of-- four gel
packs and thick insulation,

00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:22.680
and again, limiting
it to one or two

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.466
day ground shipping
was key for us.

00:43:24.466 --> 00:43:26.340
That in our tests, that
we never wanted to go

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.290
longer than that in the box.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.950
By November of 2015, about
one year after I launched,

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.470
we opened up a West Coast
distribution center,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.060
and we moved out
of our facilities

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.010
into also a more
proper place that

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:42.000
was a cold room that we were
packing our product in cold.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.300
And so from both distribution
centers in Boston and LA,

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.900
they were always
packed in cold rooms

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.210
and then packed into boxes
with insulation and gel packs,

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.100
limiting it to one and
two day ground shipping.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.480
We then moved our Boston
facility to New York

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.930
for broader reach and
a bit more efficiency.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.450
We've just opened up a third
distribution center in Ohio.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.420
And so now we have 100% coverage
in the continental US with one

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.059
or two day ground shipping.

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:09.600
There are some
customers that we need

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.990
to do a two-day air, which
we don't want to be doing,

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.910
and we're moving to
move that third facility

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:18.030
to have the capacity to get
everyone meals within one

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.250
or two days from when
they ship with a truck,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.430
rather than using an airplane.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.030
The downside to that is the
requirement on insulation.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.600
We have had some learnings
and experiences where

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.060
we had a certain
thickness to our boxes,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.730
and just this summer, we
went through a problem

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.940
where we had some
insulation that was--

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.520
we needed to add more
gel packs to keep it cold

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.590
because the insulation
was failing.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.944
So that was a whole separate
story with our supplier

00:44:45.944 --> 00:44:47.610
that caused me some
gray hair in my head

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.980
to add to what's there already.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:52.890
And putting more
gel packs in then

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.850
started compromising the
integrity of the box.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.850
And so people would get
boxes that were beat up,

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.864
and the box would compress under
the weight of the added gel

00:44:59.864 --> 00:45:02.280
packs, and the gel packs were
melting faster because there

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.960
wasn't the insulation.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.910
So it becomes a snowball effect.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.077
And we were able to quickly
shift to a thicker box,

00:45:08.077 --> 00:45:10.410
and that issue has gone away,
and we changed the liners.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.990
But it's a really--

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:17.310
the amount of complexity that
I think happens in the meal kit

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.770
space is really pronounced.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.180
And to get incredibly fresh
and incredibly fragile produce,

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.850
a lot of times, especially
in a plant-based meal kit,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.400
where we're not relying on
chicken or beef or other animal

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.500
protein as the
source, we're really

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.590
having to bulk up on great
vegetables and grains

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:37.050
that some of that stuff
is really fragile and also

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:37.980
hard to source.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.780
So it can be complex if you are
sourcing a watermelon radish.

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.130
Well, we had issues where the
watermelon radish was too big.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.690
And it was supposed
to meet spec,

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.690
but the suppliers couldn't
get us the smaller watermelon

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:52.729
radishes.

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:54.270
Now you have a big
watermelon radish,

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.603
it's going to throw the flavors.

00:45:55.603 --> 00:45:58.290
Then you have to go and cut
the watermelon radish in half,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:02.480
and that worked because there
was stability to that product.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.670
An onion wouldn't hold up
nearly as well, if at all.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.650
So there's decisions
that we have

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.770
to make every single
week, throughout the week,

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.340
based on what the supply
chain enables us to access.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.710
And I think what
Blue Apron's done

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.470
to control a lot of the
supply chain is brilliant.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.850
Because they should
have the best

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.190
pick of the produce,
and suppliers

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.270
are growing things
just for them.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.140
So that should enable them to
avoid some of those challenges

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.070
that we face as a
smaller company.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.330
But getting it to someone
in a really fresh manner

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:36.000
is certainly the
most important piece.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.440
And when our suppliers, like
a FedEx or OnTrac deliver,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.217
sometimes they miss,
but we have to own that.

00:46:44.217 --> 00:46:46.050
So we can't go back to
the customer and say,

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.206
sorry OnTrac messed
up this week.

00:46:48.206 --> 00:46:50.580
We have to then take that, we
need to refund them or give

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.102
them credit.

00:46:51.102 --> 00:46:54.120
So it's challenging.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.930
But I love it.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:55.780
[CHUCKLES]

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:56.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.188
ANDY LEVITT: Thank you.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.910
AUDIENCE: So I have
somewhat of a related

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.160
question on packaging.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.380
So one of the common
criticisms of meal kits

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.267
is that it involves
a lot of packaging.

00:47:07.267 --> 00:47:09.100
And that's one of the
things that's given me

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.840
pause about trying it out.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.450
So I'm just curious,
how do you think

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.400
about environmental
sustainability

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.390
in your packaging?

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.730
And I work in
finance, I'm always

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:19.880
curious about the numbers.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.830
Do you know how much the impact
of packaging and transport,

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.890
how does that offset the
environmental benefits accrued

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:29.260
from actually eating
a plant-based diet?

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.560
ANDY LEVITT: Sure.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.060
Yeah.

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.650
We're actually starting
to study that exact issue.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:41.050
What I can tell you is we're
very aware of the challenge

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.800
with insulation.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.880
I'd say by and large, it is
the single largest complaint

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.330
against meal kits is how much
packaging and insulation goes

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.940
in to get the customer
their relatively

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.340
small amount of food, as
compared to the size of the box

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.790
that is being shipped.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.020
We have moved, over time,
from standard insulation

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.740
to recyclable insulation.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.370
Through the spring we
were using the first 100%

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.970
curbside recyclable insulation.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:18.987
And we're now into-- we now use
a recycled insulation that's

00:48:18.987 --> 00:48:21.070
made from water bottles,
that's been recycled down

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.580
from that, that is then
further recyclable.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.110
All of our boxes are recyclable.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.520
The baggies, the bottles,
everything can be recycled.

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.820
So we do our best to
minimize that impact.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.779
And I think broadly speaking,
the industry is aware of that,

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:36.820
and more and more companies
are helping consumers

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.360
get comfortable with that idea
that you can at least recycle

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.720
the product that is being
shipped to you from what's

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:47.200
required to get you
those fresh items.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.480
But as a plant-based
company, which

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.780
has a big connection to
environmental sustainability,

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.390
it's incumbent upon us,
I believe, as a company,

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.100
to have the words
match our actions,

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.800
or the actions match
our words, so that we're

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.200
continuing to innovate.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.655
I'm pleased with what we've
accomplished in a relatively

00:49:04.655 --> 00:49:05.530
short period of time.

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.479
I think the gel packs
is a piece that-- like,

00:49:07.479 --> 00:49:09.520
we were looking about
taking frozen water bottles

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.590
and using that.

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:14.020
So you put frozen water
bottles into the packing,

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.660
and let that cool the
produce that is in there.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.780
Then you can drink
the water bottles.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.280
Recycle the water bottle, and
you've got really zero impact,

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.807
as compared to the gel
packs that many people have

00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:26.140
a little discomfort about
having to either squeeze those

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.407
out or throw them away.

00:49:27.407 --> 00:49:28.990
It feels like a lot,
especially if you

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:30.031
order on a regular basis.

00:49:30.031 --> 00:49:30.730
They build up.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.490
You feel like, oh my god, what
am I doing with all these?

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.090
So it's no doubt a challenge.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.259
I think if people
factor in the gas

00:49:38.259 --> 00:49:40.300
that they're using to
drive to the grocery store,

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.940
and also you think about
the amount of impact

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.780
that grocers have, with
respect to receiving truckloads

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.370
of groceries that come in.

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.880
There's a massive amount
of sort of violation,

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.010
if you will, that happens
at the grocery level,

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.530
that I think people forget
about and assign all of that

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:57.260
to the meal kit.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.750
And so it's--

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:04.080
I think it's the reality that we
have about the impact we make.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.660
But I think that there's also
a relative falsehood that it's

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.360
the carbon emission that
happens from transportation that

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.150
is so big, when in fact, it's
the animal agriculture that's

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:14.650
even bigger than that.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:18.114
So hopefully we can move
people in that direction.

00:50:18.114 --> 00:50:19.910
Yeah.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.990
AUDIENCE: So do you have any
advice for young entrepreneurs?

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:26.680
And how did your time at
NYU Stern and in sales

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.290
impact your career?

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:30.040
ANDY LEVITT: Yeah.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.470
Thanks for the question.

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:34.240
So if you're a
young entrepreneur,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:40.120
I would build on what I said
already about following Seth

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.010
Godin, reading his teachings.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:46.460
I would drink up every single
thing that you can on that.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:49.990
And Guy Kawasaki is a
great resource as well.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:52.890
Gary V is a pretty--

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:54.854
he's out there
with what he says.

00:50:54.854 --> 00:50:56.020
He's got a particular style.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.704
But he's all about
entrepreneurship as well.

00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:01.120
I think more than
anything though,

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.910
it's having the courage and
confidence to take the leap

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.470
and not wait for
the perfect moment,

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.386
because there's never a
better time than right

00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:09.040
now to start your company.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.190
What people have, the resources
that are available today than

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:15.160
was available last year or five
years ago or 15 or 20 years ago

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.900
certainly is incredible.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.670
And you don't need
permission to start,

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.610
you just have to have
the guts to do it.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.820
And access to capital
is so much easier today

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.980
than it's ever been before.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.690
You can publish on your own.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:32.290
You don't need
permission to do that.

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:35.660
And the economy is
supportive of startups.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.900
And so I think the idea of
being able to create a business

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:46.420
and using tools like Slack that
enables you to be disconnected

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.650
from your people from
a proximity perspective

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.219
but stay connected.

00:51:50.219 --> 00:51:51.760
The tools that are
available to build

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.230
websites in rapid fashion.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:58.010
That the opportunities
are right in front of you.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.200
And it feels great to
try to make a difference

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.900
and to test yourself
every day with that

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.437
and give yourself
a challenge that

00:52:05.437 --> 00:52:07.520
is so different than working
in corporate America,

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.360
with all due respect
to corporate America,

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.930
where I spent a fair
bit of my career.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:14.840
But it's great.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.790
And once you get the bug,
you'll never go back.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.390
And I don't think I could ever
work again in corporate America

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.614
and never plan to.

00:52:22.614 --> 00:52:24.530
And I think for those
young entrepreneurs that

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.050
are thinking about
that, to do it

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.910
and to just play the
long game and know

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.604
when you've got to quit
that if it's not working,

00:52:31.604 --> 00:52:33.020
so that you have
the chance to try

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:35.150
the next thing and the next
thing and the next thing,

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.150
and hopefully you make
some money along the way,

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.990
and you can then roll that
into your next approach.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.370
You know, NYU was--

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.520
it was five years
of a lot of pain.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.630
It cost me a lot of money.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.480
It cost me a lot of my time.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.967
The fact that I have an MBA, I
don't think it really mattered.

00:52:51.967 --> 00:52:52.550
I have to say.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.160
I wish I could think
differently about it.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.644
I think those who
go full-time have

00:52:55.644 --> 00:52:56.810
a much different experience.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:00.620
I went part-time and went from
7:00 to 10:00 PM for classes

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.520
most nights for five years,
and that was really draining.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.474
And I don't think I had the
best teachers at those hours.

00:53:07.474 --> 00:53:09.140
So I think someone
thinking about an MBA

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:11.840
should do it full-time
and go all in instead

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.590
of doing like me, which was
squeezing it in while I worked.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:19.089
And sales is just a great tool
to be able to know how to sell.

00:53:19.089 --> 00:53:20.630
And whether you're
selling a product,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.431
or you're selling an
idea, whether you're

00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:24.680
trying to convince your
spouse where to go on vacation

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.730
or tell your kids
what food to eat,

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.560
it's all sales at
the end of the day.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.700
And so being able to sell ice to
Eskimos or anywhere in between

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.830
is a really important
tool and a skill

00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:40.690
that I encourage for anybody.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.390
AUDIENCE: And on a related note,
aside from meal kit delivery

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.550
services, what
other opportunities

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.980
for entrepreneurship do you
see in the plant-based space?

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:56.930
ANDY LEVITT: So the
plant-based space

00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:59.030
is growing by leaps
and bounds, and it's

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.190
projected to go from
about a $13 billion

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:03.620
industry to a $25 billion
industry in the next five

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.035
years.

00:54:05.035 --> 00:54:06.410
So there's a lot
of growth there.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.730
I think product development
is a huge area of innovation,

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:14.600
to think about educating
people with different types

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.385
of products that
are plant-based.

00:54:19.106 --> 00:54:24.300
I think the area of education
is a great opportunity,

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.960
whether it's teaching people
how to cook plant-based,

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:31.880
or even providing services
to help people become

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.430
more plant-based
and be someone's

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:37.130
chaperone through a process.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:41.900
There's probably interesting
innovation opportunities there.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.692
But I would also not
encourage-- it doesn't--

00:54:44.692 --> 00:54:46.400
you don't have to be
an entrepreneur just

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.290
in the plant-based space.

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:48.770
I mean, the plant-based
space thing is really cool,

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:50.720
and I love what I'm
doing and the difference

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.420
that I make by being
in a plant-based space

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.069
versus selling or trying
to promote other things.

00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:59.360
But I would say if someone's
interested in plant-based,

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.110
a great thing is go to
Expo East or Expo West.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.180
Expo West is in Anaheim,
Expo East is in Baltimore.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.060
Those conferences
happen twice a year.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:12.880
It will open your eyes up
to the incredible growth

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.630
of the category and
the number of products

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.330
that are servicing
those people who

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:21.020
care about health and wellness
through the foods and choices

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:21.930
that they make.

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:23.397
So that will be worth going to.

00:55:23.397 --> 00:55:24.230
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.540
Thank you.

00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:28.240
ANDY LEVITT: You have
another question?

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:28.830
Oh, no.

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:29.330
OK.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:29.960
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:30.390
ANDY LEVITT: All right.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.230
Thanks so much.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:34.580
[APPLAUSE]
