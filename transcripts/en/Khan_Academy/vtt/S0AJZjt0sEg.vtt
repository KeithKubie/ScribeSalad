00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:02.277
- [Voiceover] In this video
we're gonna talk even some more

00:00:02.277 --> 00:00:04.192
about parallel resistors.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:06.515
Parallel resistors are resistors

00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:09.161
that are connected end to end,

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:11.337
and share the same nodes.

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:14.067
Here's R one and R two,
they share the same nodes.

00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:15.859
That one and that one.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.278
And that means they
share the same voltage.

00:00:18.278 --> 00:00:21.331
And we worked out an expression

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.464
for how to replace that
with a single resistor.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:28.782
R parallel, and we found
that one over R parallel

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:32.281
is one over R one

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:37.076
plus one over R two.

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:38.745
So in this video I'm gonna actually

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:41.689
start working with this
expression a little bit more.

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.850
And we'll just change it around
a little bit to an easier,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.802
an easy way to remember it,

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.721
and then we're gonna do a special case,

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.083
where R one and R two are the same value

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.620
and we're gonna see what happens.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.317
So right now I wanna do
just a little bit of algebra

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:57.546
on that expression, one over R p

00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:00.462
is the same as

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:02.807
one over R one

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:06.436
plus one over R two.

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:10.590
What I wanna end up with
here is an expression

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.965
that on this side says
R p equals something,

00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:16.738
and on this side I just
want one expression,

00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:18.567
not two fractions.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:19.584
So we're gonna go about that

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:22.178
by combining these two fractions first.

00:01:22.178 --> 00:01:27.097
So the least common denominator here, LCD,

00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:31.228
equals R one times R two,

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:34.275
and I'm gonna convert both these

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:36.973
to convert this to that proper denominator

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:40.750
I have to multiply it by R two over R two,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.673
so we'll do it.

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.353
We'll do all the steps.

00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:49.468
We'll multiply it by R two over R two.

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:56.138
This expression we have to
multiply it by R one over R one.

00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:07.076
And this equals, of course, one over R p.

00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.528
Continuing on, one over R p

00:02:15.808 --> 00:02:19.752
equals R two

00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:24.123
over R one R two

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.629
plus

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.993
R one over

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:34.005
R one R two,

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.338
and now I can combine them together.

00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:40.190
Let's move up here.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.569
One over R p

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.331
equals, we'll keep everything
in numerical order,

00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:50.764
R one

00:02:50.764 --> 00:02:54.709
plus R two over

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:59.728
R one R two.

00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:03.916
And now I'm gonna take the reciprocal

00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.614
of both sides of the expression

00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:08.423
so I get an expression in R p,

00:03:08.423 --> 00:03:12.901
R p equals, and just flip
over this expression,

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:16.515
R one R two

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:17.856
over

00:03:17.856 --> 00:03:21.973
R one plus R two.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:27.671
That

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:37.880
is a way you can remember how
to combine parallel resistors.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.401
The parallel equivalent resistor, R p,

00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:44.231
is the product of the two
resistors over the sum.

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.721
So it's the product

00:03:47.721 --> 00:03:49.473
over the sum.

00:03:49.473 --> 00:03:51.064
That's how I remember it.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.844
Now this arithmetic, this expression,

00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.657
is exactly the same as the
original one that we had,

00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:57.610
these are the same,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.543
and it's just a question of

00:03:58.543 --> 00:04:00.493
which one do you want to remember,

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.205
which one's easier to remember

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.403
and which one's easiest to calculate.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:06.845
I like to remember this one here.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.024
Let's do a quick example using it.

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.337
I'll move the screen up a little bit.

00:04:15.607 --> 00:04:17.686
Let's leave that there so we can see it.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:20.704
Let's say we have two parallel resistors.

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.052
And we'll say the first one is 1,000 ohms,

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:36.988
and the second one is 4,000 ohms.

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.038
And the question is, what
is the parallel combination

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:45.984
of those things.

00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:49.047
How can I replace these with one resistor

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:51.082
so the same current flows.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.918
And we'll use this expression here.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:56.360
So R p

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.005
equals a product which is 1,000

00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:03.845
times 4,000

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:06.505
divided by the sum

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:09.004
1,000

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:12.133
plus 4,000

00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:15.466
and that equals, oh my goodness

00:05:15.466 --> 00:05:16.516
there's a lot of zeroes here.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.791
Four and six zeroes,

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:22.611
one, two, three, four, five, six

00:05:23.963 --> 00:05:27.948
over, that's easy, 5,000.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:31.654
All right?

00:05:31.654 --> 00:05:32.664
And let's say,

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:35.682
let's take out three
zeroes out of this one.

00:05:37.064 --> 00:05:39.708
Let's knock off three zeroes here,

00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:41.821
and three zeroes here.

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:45.034
And I have 4,000

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:48.450
divided by five

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.259
and that equals 800 ohms.

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.941
So that is this

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.478
and that's how we use this expression.

00:06:08.478 --> 00:06:09.574
Now just something to notice here,

00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:12.869
notice that R parallel, the
equivalent parallel resistor,

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.721
is smaller than both of these.

00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:18.531
And that happens every time,
that happens every time.

00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.239
The parallel resistance

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:22.240
is smaller than the smallest resistor.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.547
So here it was 1,000, it's
gonna be smaller than that.

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:28.651
And that's a property
of parallel resistors.

00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:30.811
Because you have two current paths

00:06:30.811 --> 00:06:33.048
that allow current to
go two different ways,

00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:35.244
the effective resistance is always smaller

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:38.010
than the smallest original path,

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.669
because there's a way for
current to go around another way.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:47.452
So this is now the expression
for two parallel resistors,

00:06:47.452 --> 00:06:49.844
and that's a good one to remember.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.411
Now I'm gonna show you one special case,

00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:58.794
and we'll do this in this color.

00:07:00.497 --> 00:07:04.942
What if R one equals R two?

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:08.932
What is R p?

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:16.126
And for this special case,
we use the same expression,

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:19.759
we say R p,

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.152
we say R p is the product,

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:26.175
we'll just use R because R is,

00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:27.477
it's the same value.

00:07:27.477 --> 00:07:29.220
R times R

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.051
over R plus R,

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.497
and that's multiplied.

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.845
And so that is R squared

00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:43.699
over two R,

00:07:45.242 --> 00:07:47.534
and one of these Rs cancels,

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.997
so let's cancel

00:07:50.997 --> 00:07:55.267
that R and that squared,

00:07:55.267 --> 00:07:56.921
and we end up with

00:07:58.747 --> 00:08:01.895
R over two.

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:04.245
So for the special case,

00:08:04.245 --> 00:08:08.689
if R one equals R two,

00:08:10.822 --> 00:08:15.687
then R p

00:08:16.902 --> 00:08:20.687
equals R over two.

00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:23.051
It's just half, and
that should make sense.

00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.802
If we do something like this,

00:08:24.802 --> 00:08:28.089
if we draw two resistors in parallel,

00:08:28.089 --> 00:08:30.461
like this.

00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:33.749
and we say this is 300 ohms

00:08:33.749 --> 00:08:36.838
and this is 300 ohms,

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:39.328
that means the effective,

00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:42.110
the effective parallel resistor,

00:08:47.266 --> 00:08:50.652
150 ohms.

00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:55.078
And that's got a very
pleasing symmetry to it

00:08:55.078 --> 00:08:56.750
because these resistors are the same,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.323
they have the same voltage,

00:08:58.323 --> 00:08:59.837
they're going to have the same current,

00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:01.986
basically twice as much current

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:04.679
is gonna flow in this
circuit as would flow

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.459
if there was just one of these guys,

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:08.786
so that's where the
divide by two comes from.

00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:12.489
So for two resistors in parallel,

00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:15.216
if the resistors are the same value,

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:19.284
the effective parallel
resistance is just half.
