00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:05.855
 We have 3x of degree Î± by bx ^ 4, 

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:09.337
 which equals -24x6. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.280
 Pause the video and see if you can find a and b. 

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.360
 To find them, we can multiply this left side, 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.787
 so let's do it. 

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.249
 What we have here, 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 we can just write it as 3 x x degree, 

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.280
 on b by x on fourth. 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.264
 And we can change the order. 

00:00:34.264 --> 00:00:36.448
 We simply multiply 4 different things. 

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:41.180
 It's the same as 3 in b, 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 by x of degree a, 

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:46.497
 x per fourth. 

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:48.261
 If you decide it yourself, 

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.445
 there is no need to do all these steps, 

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.325
 but I want to make clear what is actually happening. 

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:53.997
 And how much will it be? 

00:00:53.997 --> 00:00:56.017
 Well we have ... 

00:00:56.017 --> 00:00:57.433
 Let me write it in a new color. 

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.661
 here we have 3b. 

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.193
 This is 3b, 

00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:05.428
 but how many x is in degree x x in fourth? 

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:07.920
 x of degree a by x of fourth. 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.480
 We have the same foundation, elevated to varying degrees 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.860
 and we multiply them. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.237
 We know from the properties of the pointers, 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.160
 that it is the same as x of degree a plus four. 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.260
 x is equal to x (a + 4). 

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:24.642
 We just collect the grade pointers, 

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:27.864
 because we have the same foundation and multiply the two numbers. 

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.371
 So now we have 

00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:34.342
 3b by x of degree a plus four. 

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.820
 And this will be equal to what, 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.683
 which we have on the right side. 

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.447
 This will be equal to ... 

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.910
 I will write it in the same color. 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.960
 This is equal to -24x6. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.778
 What can we do now? 

00:01:48.778 --> 00:01:50.778
 We can notice that 

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:56.883
 3b must be equal to -24 

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:03.036
 a + 4 here must be equal to 6. 

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:04.521
 Let's save it. 

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.520
 3b equals -24. 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 Surely you can solve it in your mind 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.300
 or if you want to solve it a little more systematically, 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.873
 you can divide both sides to 3, 

00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:16.016
 to find b. 

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:19.382
 And you get b equal to -8. 

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:24.382
 We can also say that a + 4 equals 6. 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.960
 You get 4 on both sides and you get, 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.226
 that a is equal to 2. 

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:30.712
 And we're ready. 

00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:32.153
 If you want, you can check it out. 

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:33.987
 We can write it like ... 

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.450
 If we say that a is equal to 2, 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.543
 we can say 3x ^ 2 on ... 

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.475
 Here, instead of b, it is -8, 

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:45.378
 -8x4. 

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:46.678
 What will that be equal to? 

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:48.488
 3 at 8 is -24. 

00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:52.181
 x ^ 2 by x ^ 4 is x ^ 6. 

00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:54.364
 And once again - it is not necessary 

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:55.631
 to do all these steps, 

00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:56.941
 if you decide on a piece of paper. 

00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.965
 But when you see the initial task, 

00:02:59.965 --> 00:03:03.340
 you have to say, "I can multiply the coefficients 3 by b, 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.345
 to get this coefficient here. " 

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:08.619
 So 3 in b is -24, 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.803
 b should be -8. 

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:13.891
 So b here should be -8. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.040
 And you could say that x in degree a x in fourth 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.094
 is x on the sixth. 

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:20.091
 So, let's see, step indicators, 

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:22.087
 a + 4 will be equal to 6, 

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:25.059
 therefore a = 2. 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.383
 So you can do it so easily, 

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:27.660
 but that's how you do it, 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.953
 even if you do it in mind.
