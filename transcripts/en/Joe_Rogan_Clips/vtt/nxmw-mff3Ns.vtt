1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.280
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.780
Wrestlers in particular wrestlers are so good at many of you.

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.600
Do you see that Jordan Burroughs?
Ben Asked her match last night.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.330
Fucking credible.
How good is that Guy Jordan,

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.350
the boss to do that to a guy like Ben ask Ryan.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
I mean it just shows you Ben hasn't competed I think in nine years,

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.280
but Ben is one of the greatest,
I mean I'm a huge fan of his wrestling.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.360
It's so interesting.

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.690
I think that is like the worst matchup for Ben Asker I think because you're

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
taking,
uh,

11
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.330
one of the most creative wrestlers ever been been asked her and I don't want to

12
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.690
over over overstate it,
but he has incredibly creative,

13
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:44.750
one of the great pinning wrestler.

14
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.260
So he pins people he like confuses them and pins them incredibly well.

15
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
And you,
you put them against basically a freak blast,

16
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:58.890
double like the greatest double leg take down maybe of all time.
All time.

17
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.820
There was like somebody put a clip up that said,
uh,
is this it?
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.720
So when you put a clip of,
Oh shit,
he went off the fucking Matt into the crowd.

19
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:09.960
That's pretty,
that was the best part.
As he defended a take down.

20
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.080
Those are the best part.
That's crazy,
man,
that they,

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.610
they have such a drop off with these guys.

22
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200
Like you shouldn't really have a platform like that where a guy could fall off

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.620
into the crowd.
That seems so stupid.
It rarely happens.

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.550
What the fuck are you talking about?
It just happened.
Rarely happens.

25
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.630
They rarely have these.
It's true.
This is our,
but that's a terrible thing.

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.510
How that shit flat on the ground.
That is so dumb.

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.420
I can't even believe they did that.
I think this whole mass should be contested.

28
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:40.190
It doesn't count.
Well I don't,
I don't,
you know,

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.890
I think,
look,
that's stupid.

30
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.400
That's not smart devil.

31
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.860
A guy who's a fucking powerhouse of a blast,

32
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:54.450
double hitting you and sending you flying to the cause.
That's crazy.

33
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.470
That is crazy that they didn't have anything in place to stop that.

34
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.800
That's the reason why wrestling takes place on the ground.
You fucking assholes.

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.790
And why do you haven't people wrestle on a platform?
That's why is this show,

36
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:09.370
so the,
the,
the whole show,
you can have a show where it's on a board.

37
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.480
It's on the grounds called basketball.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's on the ground.

38
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.890
I mean it was worrying because Vanessa and I said,

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.300
and I'm a fighter and you got injured with that right there.
Right there.

40
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.400
It could have torn his lead Nia part easily.

41
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.300
Well the silver lining is that he's okay.
Yeah.
The silver lining.
And uh,

42
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.460
and we got to see that,
you know,

43
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.940
it was interesting Jordan Burroughs had on his Instagram,
there's levels to this,

44
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.550
you know,
they're raising his hand up and let's like that's what we got to see.

45
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.120
Cause Ben is a phenomenal wrestler.
But you're right,

46
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.590
he hasn't competed in a long time.

47
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.110
He's not necessarily at the level that he was back then.

48
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:44.930
Even though he's incredible for MMA standards.
It's good to see like it's good.

49
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.910
It's good to see that with boxing it's good to see that with anything like when

50
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:50.560
Floyd,
man Mayweather fought Conor,
I think it was good to see that,

51
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.590
that there are really levels to this.

52
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.870
And the interesting thing about German borrowers,

53
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:58.650
I think he's so good that he's probably going to stay out of MMA.

54
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.890
That's so crazy.
But there are some,
here's some clips of it,

55
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.470
but yeah,
we can't show it to a t you people.
But uh,
who,

56
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.120
who put this on flow wrestling,
flow,
wrestling,
put this on.

57
00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:14.570
I wonder if people are pirating it online or if they,
they put it online.

58
00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:19.040
If they're allowing and no,
they,
well,
people are pirating it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

59
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.540
Okay.
Yeah.
Good luck stopping that.
Right.
Well,

60
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:27.530
I think people should support flow wrestling though though.
They do have like a,

61
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.230
um,
I'm a member.
Are you,
oh,
look at this.
Look at this to God.
He's good.

62
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.260
Yeah,
man.
So we're watching this,
ladies and gentlemen who are just listening.

63
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.800
It's probably boring as fuck for you,
but,
um,
Jordan Burroughs is,
uh,

64
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.860
one of the best wrestlers.
Really.

65
00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:45.980
America's ever produced three time world champion.

66
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I tragically lost in the previous Olympics and he's back at it again.

67
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.820
But wonder if he's ever considered MMA.
I know he handled,

68
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.830
there was some talk about it,
but I wonder if we ever really,

69
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.390
I think at this point he's,
he is basically a no,

70
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.550
but there are a few terrifying people,
especially on the Russian side that I,

71
00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:12.320
that I think the heavyweight division and I'm a,
and UFC should let you,

72
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:16.100
should be really worried.
I don't know if you heard about the,
the Russian tank,

73
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.610
the 22 year olds from Dagestan knows this guy is a wrestler at rest there and

74
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.220
he's going to fight MMA.
No,
he's,
he's uh,

75
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.630
he will after 2020 is what his expectation is for now.

76
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.360
He's probably going to be the greatest wrestler of all time.

77
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.050
Really him against Kyle Snyder,
those two heavyweights as a Merritt College,

78
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.910
not as American and another guy right here.
20 the tank of Dagestan.

79
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.170
How'd you say his name?
Uh,
it says out don't rush.

80
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.580
July of [inaudible] Abdulla Rasheed said ally of 22 years old.

81
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.960
Rashid's Snyder.
You can do call Snyder versus what a great name.

82
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.050
Abdul Rashid's on a lie of that alive.

83
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.800
That this Russian as Snyder is 23 years old and he's another incredible person

84
00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:07.850
who will do MMA.
And that competition between Snyder,
uh,

85
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.240
I mean this is,
look at the look,
the look of the thickness.

86
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.110
These guys are monsters and they're not just how much these guys way I uh,

87
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.210
97 kilograms.
What does that to 20?
Yeah.

88
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.130
Two 20 under two to 15.
But they cut for it,
right?

89
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.370
Just under heavyweight guys.
What do you think they would compete at two oh five.

90
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.630
If they're going to fight in MMA,

91
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.360
these are heavyweights cause so that we just don't remember it in the weight.

92
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.770
These are still boys.
Oh 22.
Right,
right.

93
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.030
They still haven't gotten the full like,
yeah.

94
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.020
I wonder that about UFC fighters that are thickening up as they get older.

95
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.630
I wonder how many of them are damaging their body by cutting weight.
Yeah,

96
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.780
that's a thing fellow.
So,
um,

97
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.050
right now we're just seeing mostly stalemate and that's uh,
from,
uh,

98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.290
the American guy and the,
yeah.

99
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.000
Is there like a highlight reel of his or something that we could,
there is,

100
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.290
but he's pretty young.
He's a,
I think he's a seasoned Olympic champion,

101
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.240
and he goes from the whole line of,
um,

102
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.530
the [inaudible] brothers and the all the Dagestani wrestlers.
