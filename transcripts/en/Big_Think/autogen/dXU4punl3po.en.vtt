doing that is not he's very happy to
 

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.620

he's probably bought many more of those
middle ones and the reason that tends to

middle ones and the reason that tends to
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.780
middle ones and the reason that tends to
work is that we we reference the value

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:33.790
work is that we we reference the value
 

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.000
work is that we we reference the value
of that middle one by the ones on the
