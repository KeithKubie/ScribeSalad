WE MOVED INTO HER HOUSE,
A MANSION THAT SHE SHARED

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.040
WITH SEVERAL FREE-SPIRITED
HOUSEMATES.

LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.262
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT THESE WERE MY PEOPLE.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.264

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.856
AS WE SETTLED IN
TO OUR NEW LIFE TOGETHER,

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.393
I WAS FILLED WITH A SENSE
OF ANTICIPATION FOR THE FUTURE

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.428

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.206

- SWEETHEART?
