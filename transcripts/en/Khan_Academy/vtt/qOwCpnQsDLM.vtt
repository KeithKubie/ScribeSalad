00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.400
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.530
we had a mature
massive star, a star

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.860
that had started
forming a core of iron.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.770
It has enormous pressure,
enormous inward pressure

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.350
on this core.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.140
Because as we form heavier and
heavier elements in the core,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.510
the core gets denser
and denser and denser.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.640
And so we keep fusing more
and more elements into iron.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.740
This iron core becomes
more and more massive, more

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.460
and more dense.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.410
It's squeezing in on itself.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.880
And it's not fusing.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.750
That is not exothermic anymore.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.600
If iron were to fuse,
it would not even

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.800
be an exothermic process.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.960
It would require energy.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.501
So it wouldn't be
even something that

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:47.040
could be helped to fend off
this squeezing, to fend off

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.470
this increasing
density of the core.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.170
So we have this iron
here, and it just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.240
gets more and more massive,
more and more dense.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.610
And so at some mass, already
a reasonably high mass,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.110
the only thing that's keeping
this from just completely

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.069
collapsing is-- we could call
it electron degeneracy pressure.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:13.850
So let me write this here,
electron degeneracy pressure.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.590
And all this means is we have
all of these iron atoms getting

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.920
really, really, really
close to each other.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
And the only thing that keeps it
from collapsing at this earlier

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.130
stage, the only thing that keeps
it from collapsing altogether,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.672
is that they have
these electrons.

00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:35.130
You have these
electrons, and these

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.504
are being squeezed
together, now.

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:40.800
I mean, we're talking about
unbelievably dense states

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.580
of matter.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.430
And electron degeneracy
pressure is, essentially--

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.920
it's saying these
electrons don't

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.990
want to be in the same
place at the same time.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.130
I won't go into the
quantum mechanics of it.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.680
But they cannot be squeezed
into each other any more.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.830
So that, at least
temporarily, holds this thing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.350
from collapsing even further.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380
And in the case of
a less massive star,

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.920
in the case of a
white dwarf, that's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.020
how a white dwarf actually
maintains its shape, because

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.510
of the electron
degeneracy pressure.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.390
But as this iron core gets
even more massive, more dense,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.180
and we get more and more
gravitational pressure--

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.650
so this is our core, now--
even more gravitational

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.830
pressure, eventually even
this electron degeneracy--

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.022
I guess we could call
it force, or pressure,

00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:31.980
this outward pressure,
this thing that keeps it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.500
from collapsing--
even that gives in.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.130
And then we have something
called electron capture,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.210
which is essentially
the electrons

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.130
get captured by
protons in the nucleus.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.980
They start collapsing
into the nucleuses.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.990
It's kind of the opposite of
beta negative decay, where

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.850
you have the electrons
get captured,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.170
protons get turned
into neutrons.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.210
You have neutrinos
being released.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.582
But you can imagine an
enormous amount of energy

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:06.540
is also being released.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.248
So this is kind of a
temporary-- and then

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.760
all of a sudden, this collapses.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.024
This collapses even more
until all you have--

00:03:14.024 --> 00:03:15.940
and all the protons are
turning into neutrons.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.110
Because they're
capturing electrons.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.440
So what you eventually
have is this entire core

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.103
is collapsing into a
dense ball of neutrons.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.740
You can kind of view
them as just one

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.130
really, really,
really, really, really

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.850
massive atom because it's
just a dense ball of neutrons.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.940
At the same time, when
this collapse happens,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.560
you have an enormous
amount of energy

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.520
being released in the
form of neutrinos.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.620
Did I say that neutrons
are being released?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.680
No, no, no, the electrons are
being captured by the protons,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.440
protons turning into
neutrons-- this dense ball

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.690
of neutrons right here--
and in the process,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.054
neutrinos get released,
these fundamental particles.

00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:04.470
We won't go into
the details here.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.450
But it's an enormous
amount of energy.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.740
And this actually is
not really, really well

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500
understood, of all
of the dynamics here.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.220
Because at the same time that
this iron core is undergoing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.070
through this-- at
first it kind of pauses

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.820
due to the electron
degeneracy pressure.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.600
And then it finally gives
in because it's so massive.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.325
And then it collapses into
this dense ball of neutrons.

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:30.450
But when it does it, all
of this energy's released.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.780
And it's not clear how-- because
it has to be a lot of energy.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.488
Because remember, this
is a massive star.

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:36.670
So you have a lot of mass
in this area over here.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.810
But it's so much energy that
it causes the rest of the star

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:48.880
to explode outward in an
unbelievable, I guess,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.820
unbelievably bright or
energetic explosion.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.110
And that's called a supernova.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.470
And the reason why
it's called nova,

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260
it comes from, I
believe-- I'm not

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.360
an expert here--
Latin for "new."

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.839
And the first time
people observed a nova,

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.130
they thought it was a new star.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.240
Because all of a
sudden, something

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.730
they didn't see before,
all of a sudden,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.670
it looks like a star appeared.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.211
Because maybe it
wasn't bright enough

00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.650
for us to observe it before.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.310
But then when the nova occurred,
it did become bright enough.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.720
So it comes from
the idea of new.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.970
But a supernova is when you
have a pretty massive star's

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.490
core collapsing.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.070
And that energy
is being released

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.530
to explode the rest of the star
out at unbelievable velocities.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.150
And just to kind of fathom
the amount of energy that's

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.410
being released in
a supernova, it

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.686
can temporarily outshine
an entire galaxy.

00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:45.560
And in a galaxy, we're
talking about hundreds

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.670
of billions of stars.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.045
Or another way to
think about it,

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:49.580
in that very short
period of time,

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.650
it can release as much
energy as the sun will

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.580
in its entire lifetime.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.260
So these are unbelievably
energetic events.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.030
And so you actually
have the material

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.830
that's not in the core
being shot out of the star

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.310
at appreciable percentages
of the actual speed of light.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.900
So we're talking about things
being shot out at up to 10%

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.410
of the speed of light.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.240
Now, that's 30,000
kilometers per second.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.640
That's almost circumnavigating
the earth every second.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.230
So that's, I mean, this is
unbelievably energetic events

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.700
that we're talking about here.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.410
And so if the original star
was-- and these are rough

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.910
estimates.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.743
People don't have kind
of a hard limit here.

00:06:32.743 --> 00:06:43.180
If the original star
approximately 9 to 20 times

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.550
the mass of the sun,
then it will supernova.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.250
And the core will turn into
what's called a neutron star.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.580
This is a neutron
star, which you

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.080
can imagine is just
this dense ball.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.500
It's this dense
ball of neutrons.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.380
And just to give
you a sense of it,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.820
it'll be something about maybe
two times the mass of the sun,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.090
give or take one and a half
to three times the mass

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.530
of the sun.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.130
So this is one and a
half to three times

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:21.210
the mass of the sun
in a volume that

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.810
has a diameter of about
10-- on the order of tens

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.040
of kilometers.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.990
So it's roughly the size of a
city, in a diameter of a city.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.336
So this is unbelievably
dense, diameter of a city.

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:35.960
I mean, we know how
much larger the sun

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.070
is relative to the Earth.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.200
And we know how much larger the
Earth is relative to a city.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.300
But this is something
large-- more mass

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.600
than the sun being
squeezed into the density,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.520
or into the size of a city,
so unbelievably dense.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.670
Now if the original star
is even more massive,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.387
if it's more than 20
times the sun-- so

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:55.470
let me write it over here.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.970
Let me scroll up.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:02.220
If it's greater than
20 times the sun,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.800
then even the neutron degeneracy
pressure, even the pressure,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.340
even the neutrons' inability to
squeeze further will give up.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.820
And it'll turn
into a black hole.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.574
And that's-- and I could
do many videos on that.

00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:16.740
And that's actually an open
area of research, still,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.330
on exactly what's going
on inside of a black hole.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.980
But then you turn
into a black hole,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.950
where essentially
all of the mass

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.080
gets condensed into an
infinitely small and dense

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.690
point, so something
unbelievably hard to imagine.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.230
And just to give
you a sense of it,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.381
so this will be more mass
then even three times the mass

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:34.880
of the sun.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.240
So we're talking about an
incredibly high amount of mass.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.070
Just to kind of
visualize things,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.289
here is actually a
remnant of a supernova.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.524
This is the Crab Nebula.

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.190
This is, right here,
is the Crab Nebula.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.760
And it's about 6,500
light years away.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.410
So it's still, from
a galactic scale--

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.950
if you think of our galaxy
as being 100,000 light years

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.460
in diameter-- it's still not
too far from us on those scales.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.710
But it's an enormous distance.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.220
The closest star to us
is four light years away.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.310
And it would take Voyager
travelling at 60,000 kilometers

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.829
an hour, 80,000
years to get there.

00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:16.120
So this is a very, very--
that's only four light years.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.940
Now this is 6,500 light years.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.240
But this supernova,
it's believed

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.530
happened 1,000 years
ago, right at the center.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.210
And so at the center here, we
should have a neutron star.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.080
And this cloud, the shock
wave that you see here,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.650
this is still the
material traveling

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.020
outward from that
supernova over 1,000 years.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.120
This shock wave, or the diameter
of this sphere of material,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.410
is six light years.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.230
So we could say this distance
right here is six light years.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.320
So this is an enormously
big shock wave cloud.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.350
And actually, we believe
that our solar system started

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:02.900
to form, started to condense
because of a shock wave created

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.894
by a supernova
relatively near to us.

00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:07.560
And just to answer
another question that

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.370
was kind of jumping
up, probably,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.910
in the last video-- and this is
still not really, really well

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:13.810
understood.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.540
We talk about how elements
up to iron, or maybe nickel,

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.727
can be formed inside of
the cores of massive stars.

00:10:20.727 --> 00:10:22.560
So you could imagine
when the star explodes,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.330
a lot of that material is
released into the universe.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.890
And so that's why we have
a lot of these materials

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.710
in our own bodies.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.650
In fact, we could not exist if
these heavier elements were not

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.650
formed inside of the cores of
primitive stars, stars that

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.110
have supernova-ed
a long time ago.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.650
Now the question is, how do
these heavier elements form?

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.650
How do we get all of this other
stuff on the periodic table?

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.610
How do we get all these
other heavier elements?

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.120
And they're formed during
the supernova itself.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.070
It's so energetic.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.650
You have all sorts of particles
streaming out and streaming in,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.940
streaming out because of
the force of the shock wave,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.940
streaming in because
of the gravity.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.961
But you have all sorts of
kind of a mishmash of elements

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:04.460
forming.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.876
And that's actually
where you have

00:11:05.876 --> 00:11:07.680
your heavier elements forming.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.410
And because-- and I'll talk more
about this in future videos--

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.130
most of the uranium,
or actually,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.720
all of uranium on
Earth right now,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.830
must have been formed in some
type of a supernova explosion,

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.980
at least based on our
current understanding.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.900
And it looks to be about
4.6 billion years old.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.440
So given that it looks to be
about 4.6 billion years old,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.856
based on how fast it's decayed--
and I'll do a whole video

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:33.870
on that-- that's why we think
that our solar system was first

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.510
formed from some type
of supernova explosion.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.190
Because that uranium
would have been

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.284
formed right at about the
birth of our solar system.

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:44.200
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that interesting.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.450
This is a fascinating picture.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.536
And if you go to Wikipedia
and look up the Crab Nebula,

00:11:49.536 --> 00:11:50.660
keep clicking on the image.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.480
And eventually you'll
get a zoomed in picture.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.438
And that's just kind of
even more mind blowing.

00:11:54.438 --> 00:11:57.344
Because you could see all the
intricacy in this actual photo.
