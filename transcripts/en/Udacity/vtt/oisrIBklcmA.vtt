00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, everyone, welcome back.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In our last exciting episode,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we learned how to take a string or a sentence

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and use lexical analysis to break it down into a list of tokens or words.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And lexical analysis was based on our old best friends regular expressions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And remember that we need to break down HTML or JavaScript source code

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
into tokens and then into valid utterances

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in order to understand them and build our web browser.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
However, it turns out that just having a list of tokens

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or a list of words is not enough.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We can still be confused.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, I've written here 2 collections of words.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first, "Simone de Beauvoir wrote 'The Mandarins,'"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the second, "wrote wrote Simone de de de."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Even though this second collection of words

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
uses only words that occur in the first,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we like this one, and this one makes us very confused,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so just a list of words isn't enough.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They have to adhere to a valid structure.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
There's a subject and a verb and an object,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and down here in bag of words 2,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's not really clear what's going on.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In particular, we're tempted to say that bag of words #1,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"Simone de Beauvoir wrote 'The Mandarins,'" follows English grammar,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
follows the rules of how we construct sentences or thoughts in English,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the second does not.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The grammar for any modern natural language, be it Mandarin Chinese,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
English, French, admits an infinite number of utterances.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But not--and this is super critical--not all utterances,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
all interesting grammars, rule something out.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Provide structure by saying that you can't say gibberish.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You have to say something meaningful.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Despite the fact that we're going to rule out quite a few bags of words,

00:02:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
we're still going to have plenty of room for creativity, and you'll see how in just a minute.
