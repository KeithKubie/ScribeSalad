00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.530
&gt;&gt; Maggie: Welcome. So my name's Maggie Johnston.
I work in Education and University Relations

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.379
here at Google. So welcome to another installment
of "Author's at Google" and today we have

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.610
Ben Wildavsky, who is a senior fellow in research
and policy at the Kauffman Foundation, and

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:30.539
a guest scholar at the Brookings Institute.
He is also a former, ah, what is it, educational

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.480
editor for US News and World Report, and a
higher education reporter for the San Francisco

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.600
Chronicle. So he's here today to tell us about
his new book, which is "The Great Brain Race".

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.370
The only tactical thing I wanted to mention
is that when we get to the Q&amp;A part of the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.280
session, there is a microphone over there,
and we want to try to make sure that everything

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.209
is recorded, because we will be putting this
up on YouTube. So Ben, welcome.

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:01.960
&gt;&gt; Ben: Well, Thank you very much Maggie for
that kind introduction. I am really delighted

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
to be here. My brother Adam, who is here,
is a Googler in the New York Office, and so

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.302
I have been there a few times. Never been
to the Googleplex. It's already looks like

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:16.960
a wonderful place. And you know Google is
one of the worlds' talent magnets, so that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.360
is something that I will be talking about
today. So I hope that this will have a particular

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.150
salience to all of you. When I was told, asking
around, in terms of what would really be effective

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.260
for a Google audience, obviously a sophisticated
bunch, highly educated with a lot of skills,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.570
and I was told that the crucial thing was
to start with pictures of cute animals. These

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.990
are some monkeys that I came across when I
was in South East India, a couple of years

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.300
ago. This is the edge of the National forest
and this is a place called, it's outside of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.120
Chennai, which used to be called Madras. And
this is taken from the balcony of a guest

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.160
house where I stayed. You can see these monkeys
are very adorable, but it turns out that they

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.790
have a dark side. I found out the day after
I arrived, that if you leave your room, and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.090
you leave any of your windows open, or the
door open, they will come in and they'll trash

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.510
the place. So I guess that tells you that
things are not always what they seem. And

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.630
the same is true of this place, it's completely
gorgeous, not only are there monkeys, there

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.130
are deer running around, there are these magnificent
banyan trees everywhere. And it looks like

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.230
a gorgeous, but it's sort of a sleepy out
of the way place. But it turns out that this

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.600
is the campus of an elite engineering school;
The Indian Institute of Technology in Madras.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.010
It's one of a chain of IIT's around the country.
They are often called the MIT of India. It's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.390
incredibly hard to get into. Only 2 or 3%
of applicants make it in on this intense national

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:00.319
exam. And not only is this out of the way
place home to this elite campus, it's also

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.720
very much connected to the new global network
of knowledge and talent mobility that I'll

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.540
be talking about a little bit more. My first
day as I usually do, when I visit a campus,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.880
I went to see the President, known as the
Director, a guy named M.S. Ananth right here,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.320
and he's just come back from Davos in Switzerland.
A big International gathering of the world's

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.180
elite every year, and he'd just taken part
in a higher education working group, that's

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.580
headed up by Rick Levin who is the president
of Yale University.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.569
So this out of the way place is very much
connected to the global education market place

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.160
that I'm going to talk about that is now developing.
And as I was working on this, oh I should

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.319
also mention walking around the campus of
this IIT, I went to the recruiting office

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.610
or careers office where there was signup sheets
for interviews as you see in American campuses.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.650
And Google was there with a signup sheet,
McKenzie was there with a signup sheet and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.330
I walked down the same corridor and I saw
a big poster advertising graduate scholarships

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.099
at a place called KAUST and this is the King
of Jewel University of Science and Technology;

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.370
it's a brand new university that's been created
just last year in Saudi Arabia. They're trying

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.160
to recruit the best in the world so of course
they're going everywhere including of course

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.829
to this corner of India.
And as I was working on the book, I came across

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.240
lots of scenes like this that were to me,
to my westernized somewhat unexpected juxtapositions

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.840
that I would not have thought of, and in fact
the whole book was really not what I expected

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.160
to write. I went into this with an idea for
a book that would sort of be a Cooks tour

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.630
of the worlds' great universities with maybe
a chapter about some of the best, most interesting

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.421
places out there. So the IIT's were a stop
on this tour. But I discovered after working

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:50.290
on this for a couple of months that I felt
I was missing the real story. A much more

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.560
interesting story, which was really a shaking
up and is a shaking up of the old order of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.380
Universities. A real change in who are the
places that are at the top and who are going

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:11.410
to be the places that are at the top in the
future. Now, I'm gonna talk about what I think

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.800
global higher education is, why I think it's
important, why some people are worried about

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.690
this whole phenomena of globalization and
why I think they shouldn't be worried, because

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.040
in my view what I call free trade in minds,
is really an opportunity for the world and

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.680
not a threat.
I'm going to talk about three main trends.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.730
One is huge academic mobility around the world
of students in particular and also of faculty

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.560
increasingly, it's at a level we've never
seen before. Now the 2nd is a real quest everywhere

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.400
from South Korea to Saudi Arabia to China,
to try to create very competitive Universities

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.300
that are world class; they can compete with
the best in the world.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.630
And the 3rd is near and dear to my heart,
since as Maggie mentioned in introducing me,

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.520
I am the former editor of the US News and
World Report College and graduate school guides

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.730
rankings. Rankings have now become a global
phenomena. So I'm going to start by telling

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.370
you a little of what's happening in the world
of mobility.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.070
The first thing to know is the numbers are
huge. There are now 3 million globally mobile

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.810
students, students studying outside their
home countries. That's a 57% increase in just

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.590
the last decade. And I should mention, these
are not study abroad kids, these are not the

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.040
semester and summer program. That stat is
only for students who are going overseas for

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.220
a year or more. Many of them are degree seeking
students. There is a very big; these students

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.410
are very eagerly recruited by Universities.
Really for several reasons. At the elite level

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.759
the best graduate students, the best post
docs, form the backbone of the research enterprise

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:51.060
at the big research universities. So everyone
wants the best. At the mass level students

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.750
of course a source of human capital, a lot
of countries want to have great students coming

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.960
there. They also want the revenue because
in many cases foreign students pay full freight,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.490
just as out of state students, for example,
in California the UC system, pay a lot more

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.210
than in-state students. And the recruiting
has gotten so intense that people have resorted

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.290
to some unconventional methods. New Zealand,
like Australia, is trying very hard to go

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.389
after the Asian student market, so their higher
ed promotion agency came out with a viral

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.490
video a few years ago.
I thought the video may not be appropriate

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.639
for this forum, but I have a still from that
video. And you'll see that it shows a young

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.460
couple sort of smooching in the corner of
the hot tub, and the camera pulls back and

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.139
you see this very stern disapproving parents
over in the other corner. And then you see

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:42.220
the caption says "Get further away from your
parents". And this was a huge success, I think

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.330
they had it out there for a month or two,
and then they discreetly took it off. You

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:52.009
can still find it if you Google hard enough.
And what's remarkable is how successful this

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:56.210
seems to have been, because if you look at
the 10 year trend in student recruiting, New

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.699
Zealand is actually number two, second only
to, ah, I actually can't read from here, I

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:08.569
think it's South Korea at the top. So I guess
this shows you that marketing can really work.

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:13.160
So mobility of students is one big phenomena.
We know that academics are of course very

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.260
mobile. Half of the worlds top physicists
no long work in their home countries. We also

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:22.270
see a lot of mobility of research, which you
can define in various ways. Just in terms

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:28.880
of cross boarder collaborations in scientific
publishing, there has been a doubling of those

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.930
collaborations since 1990, more than a doubling.
You also have interesting new models developing.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.719
Yale University, for example has a collaboration
with some Chinese universities where each

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:45.990
really takes advantage of their comparative
advantage, as economists would say.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.940
Yale provides some high level tenured professors,
scientists, who go over to work in China with

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.370
Chinese Universities where there are very
high quality and very cheap lab space. There

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:59.871
are very highly trained techs, again very
inexpensive. China, the Chinese universities

00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:06.290
benefit from this great expertise that comes
to them. And the US gets the ability to do

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.040
experiments on a scale, and research on a
scale, that they can't do as easily or as

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.230
cheaply as back home. So it's really win-win.
And I think that dynamic may change as the

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:21.540
skill set in China gets larger. But for the
time being it's really working very well.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.520
The other mobility example, there is a disproportionate
of the best scientists have worked outside

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.320
their home countries during their careers.
Now that is not necessarily causal, it may

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.820
just be some kind of correlation, but I think
it's striking that the global experience is

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.149
so closely associated with really excellent
research.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:46.970
So a third kind of mobility is mobility of
campuses themselves. And by that I'm talking

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:53.010
about the phenomena of branch campuses or
satellite campuses. This is when western universities

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.430
typically spread out and create outposts in
the Middle East very often, also in Asia where

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:04.101
there is a huge demand for western degrees.
There are now 162 of these satellite campuses

00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:07.830
around the world and again that's a figure
that's increasing very quickly. It's gone

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:14.209
up by 43% in just the past 3 or 4 years. There's
just huge demand for western style universities.

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:22.290
And one place I visited is in Doha, in Qatar,
and it's called Education City. This is a

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:28.620
compound on the edge of the city, funded very,
with a lot of money from the Qatari government.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.570
And places like Georgetown School of Foreign
Service has set up a campus there: Northwestern's

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.230
Journalism School, the Medill school is there;
Cornell's Medical school, The Weill School

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:43.860
of medicine is there. And you'll see this
is Texas A&amp;M's campus. The buildings are incredibly

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.790
lavish, marble all over the place and again
you see these interesting juxtapositions,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.371
this massive tall door, probably twice the
height, or one and a half times the height

00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:58.130
of the room that we're in. And it opens up
and you see three young women in black Abaya's

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.370
from head to toe coming out, and they're not
veiled but you know they have the traditional

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.460
garment, and they walk out, but then if you
look down the street you can't see them in

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.600
the slide, but there's these big banners that
say Welcome to Aggieland, and that's of course

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.370
the kind of thing you see on the home campus
in Texas in College Station. And they're really

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.090
trying to bring a piece of Texas to the Middle
East. So you walk into these buildings and

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.430
you'll see the men's prayer rooms, the women's
prayer room, but then you'll also see all

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:29.560
kinds of Texas paraphernalia, you'll see the
fast food courts, and it's really a meeting

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.290
of cultures.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.769
Interestingly to me there's also an effort
I think, really very much encouraged by the

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:43.590
host country here to bring in some liberalization
and some of the values we associate, I mean

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.750
classical liberalization we associate with
western universities including debate. So

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.750
there's a debate series that's sort of in
the tradition of the Oxford style of debates

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.510
and there are posters all over these campus's
saying "The next debate the resolution was

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:02.420
resolved. This house believes that Gulf Arabs
value profit over people". And you know that's

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.100
the kind of thing I wasn't expecting when
I went over there. And I think that tells

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.790
you that there really is an effort to push
the envelope a bit. I talked to a guy at the

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.070
Medill school of Journalism and he was going
around to the local newspapers and talking

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.040
with them and saying "You know what? You don't
have to put a picture of the Emir on the front

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.260
page every day,” which was something new
for them. So there is really an effort to

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.270
spread the influence of Western universities
as I said, with encouragement from the host

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.270
countries.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.980
Now I've talked about all these kinds of mobility
and I think they’re fascinating but they

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.770
have created a certain amount of anxiety.
And I'll just give you one or two examples.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.380
One of the things that you hear a lot about,
and I just talked to some Indonesian scholars

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.870
a couple of weeks ago and it's something they
raised; is the question of "brain drain."

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.779
It’s something that has been worrying the
developing world for some decades. Many of

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:59.100
these countries don't have great education
opportunities themselves. A lot of their best

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.540
people go overseas to universities in the
west, often in the States. You know we've

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.339
been a huge magnet for foreign students since
World War Two. And the fear is that they'll

00:13:06.339 --> 00:13:11.001
go away, they won't come back, and people
will lose their talent. And sometimes people

00:13:11.001 --> 00:13:14.790
take measures to try to prevent this which
I think are very ill advised. Just a couple

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:21.200
of years ago, the president of another one
of these IIT's in India, in Bombay, north

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.339
of what is now Mumbai, he basically said,
all the students who were very sort after

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:32.820
for foreign internships in industry and academia,
he said you can't go overseas any more. I

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.910
don't want to lose the talent. You have to
stay home. Obviously this was very unpopular.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:44.480
And conversely on the receiving end, mobility
is sometimes viewed with suspicion or concern

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.970
because people are worried about their own
students being crowded out by foreign students.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:53.930
In Malaysia for example, you know, they've
put a quota of 5% on foreign students coming

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.450
into their public universities. Even here
in the States we don't tend to be so restrictionist

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.600
in explicit ways, but once in a while you'll
hear of a quota like that. The University

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.240
of Tennessee as recently of 10 years ago had
a quota of 20% on foreign students in their

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.030
graduate department. Whereas nationally in
fields like Engineering, or Computer Sciences,

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:17.700
you all know, you hear of any place else you
hear of, 60-65% of PhD’s in those fields

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.170
are foreign born. So people are worried about
this, they take various measures to try to

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:29.930
stop it or to slow it down. My view is that
we really should not worry about this kind

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:36.141
of mobility, we should embrace it. It's really
good for us. The key inside here, I think,

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:40.950
is that we're in a dynamic world in higher
education. It's not a static world any more.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.180
And the old patterns of mobility are changing.
So, yeah, brain drain, I wouldn't say it's

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.649
a non-issue, it's a problem for many countries
but we're starting to see new patterns as

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:54.870
the world is changing. I'll just mention that
in China for example, traditionally a big

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.910
sending country and India, also a big sending
country; you're now seeing what sometimes

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.769
will be called "brain circulation."
And so the idea is that somebody might follow

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:07.589
the traditional pattern to go to the west
for a degree, but they might then go to another

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:11.070
country for a 2nd degree and then as their
economies are taking off, they are much more

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:16.459
likely than before to come back home and they
might work for a multi-national, but they're

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:22.420
able to do things that they did not always
do. And [coughs] Excuse me. China there's

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.290
also, you know, recruiting patterns are changing
regionally. China now takes in more foreign

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.630
students, mostly from Asia, than it sends
overseas. Which is contrary to the image that

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.440
we have of China.
People call this, as I said, brain circulation.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:40.000
I've heard the term "brain trade." Just to
show how it's different from the migration

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.820
of the past, and one wonderful example is
a guy named, at the faculty level, a guy named

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:51.970
Choon Fong Shih who is ethnically Chinese,
born in Singapore, goes to Canada for a Masters,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:56.440
goes to Harvard for a PHD, becomes a very
well regarded material scientist, I believe

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.149
that's his field. He goes to Brown University,
becomes a tenured professor, very successful.

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:06.170
So far that's the traditional trajectory,
you know, brain drain for Singapore, a gain

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:11.889
for the US you might say. But in the new world,
he get's recruited back to Singapore to the

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:16.520
National University of Singapore which is
trying very hard to upgrade itself. So he

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.829
becomes the head of an institute there, and
then he gets promoted; he becomes president

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:23.820
of National University of Singapore. So that's
already a reversal of the traditional pattern.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.160
But then the new twist is, I've talked about
KAUST; the new Saudi university, he gets recruited

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.839
by KAUST when they started up last year, to
become the first president of KAUST. So, he's

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:37.480
sort of, I wouldn't say he's typical, but
he's emblematic of the kind of possibilities

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.459
that we're seeing in this dynamic world of
talent mobility.

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:47.920
Now, you might say, well OK, all this talent
mobility is something that can be achieved

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.769
by individual decisions. You know, students,
are able to, you know, if they have a desire

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:56.750
for these kinds of degrees and there are host
universities that want them, they can make

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:02.240
these decisions individually, and the same
for the faculty who are starting to move around

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.130
more. But as globalization is upon us, you
know, it's a lot harder for universities as

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.970
institutions to change. You know, universities
are sort of notoriously change resistant.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.539
But in fact what's really remarkable is that
universities are beginning to change in really

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:21.339
big ways. I think that is because they're
really anxious to keep up with this very competitive

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:25.779
globalized world.
And this is seen in the second big trend that

00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:31.070
I've mentioned which is this real effort to
create world class universities all over the

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.710
place. I think the central reason people are
doing this, is they really see, very correctly

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:40.429
in my view, that creating great universities
is just key to innovation and it's key to

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:46.109
economic growth and one of my favorite quotes
on this, is from two economists Claudia Goldin

00:17:46.109 --> 00:17:50.440
and Lawrence Katz in a book that came out
a couple of years ago, "The Race between Education

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.309
and Technology", and they say as you can see
"Human capital, embodied in one's people,

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:59.759
is the most fundamental part of the wealth
of nations." And I think this is now broadly

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:04.620
accepted. Everybody wants to create, it's
become a cliché but sometimes clichés are

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:10.059
true; they want to create knowledge economies.
They want to improve education and have the

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:14.289
kind of societies that are gonna prosper economically
because of the human capital that they have.

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:18.539
And you know they understand that their competition
is just like other areas in business. The

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:23.879
competition is not just local, it’s not
regional it's not national, it's global and

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:27.109
they want to compete with the best. So, how
are they doing this?

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:29.109
Well, really in three ways.

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:33.659
They are spending a lot of money. They want
to be competitive, and money is the weapon

00:18:33.659 --> 00:18:40.019
that you have. So in China, billions are being
spent, not only on upgrading the capacity

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:43.940
of the universities, the number of students
in China, the number of students enrolled

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:49.570
has quintupled in the past decade or so. So
huge changes in capacity, but also trying

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:54.889
to focus on quality with a much narrower set
of universities that they would really like

00:18:54.889 --> 00:19:02.609
part of the scientific elite worldwide. At
the same time, in Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:07.169
started KAUST with a 10 billion dollar endowment,
which meant that it instantly had the 6th

00:19:07.169 --> 00:19:10.619
largest university endowment in the world.
So spending is very important.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:13.850
The other thing that I have already alluded
to is recruiting. One of the ways that you

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:19.399
do this is that you try to get the best talent
in terms of facility talent to your campuses.

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:23.519
Again, China has done this in a very big way.
Because they have more money from the government,

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:29.890
because the economy is now taking off, they're
trying to get western professors, often Chinese

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.159
born professors who have gone to the west,
they are trying to bring them back, and they

00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:38.010
can offer them very attractive packages. They
call them "sea turtles." Which, I'm not a

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.940
Chinese speaker unfortunately, but apparently
in Chinese sea turtle is a homonym for the

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.150
word for returnee. So they are really going
after the sea turtles in a big way. And the

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:51.299
same is true for places like South Korea,
who has government funding to try to get western

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:56.139
professors. So does the National University
of Singapore. So that's the second thing.

00:19:56.139 --> 00:20:00.039
And the third thing they're doing is really
trying to forge partnerships with western

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:03.190
universities. Singapore is probably the best
example of this, as I mentioned they want

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.799
to become a global hub. They are trying to
jump start, what they already have, and how

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:10.070
do you jump start it? You try to bring in
other people who already are the best. So

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:15.200
MIT now has a presence at the National University
of Singapore. So does the University Of Chicago

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.169
Business School. You know business of course,
along with the so called stem subjects, science

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:25.009
and engineering and technology, business is
very, very popular in foreign countries that

00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:31.440
want to benefit from western expertise. So
Singapore brings in lots of other places as

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.840
part of this new ethos of competition.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.369
Now again, I think that these are fascinating
and important developments. But they're causing

00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:46.929
a lot of worries, a lot of anxieties. I think
that in the west in general, and in the United

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:51.751
States in particular, the central fear is
this; we are going to lose our edge. Right

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:57.210
now we are number one, and we may not be number
one any longer. I think that when it comes

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:03.029
to Chinese universities, Asian universities
in particular, there is a sense that we are

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:08.830
educationally threatened, that we are economically
threatened. These places are producing enormous

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:14.440
numbers of science and engineering PhD's.
You know, an example of this kind of anxiety

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.770
came during the last presidential campaign,
when President Obama at one of his campaign

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.600
speeches basically said "how are we going
to stay competitive when the number of PhD's

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.360
in these subjects is soaring in places like
South Korea and Japan and China, and it's

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.289
stagnating or getting less here?" The basic
view here is that, if others are getting ahead,

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:43.059
then we must be falling behind. Once again
I think that it's perhaps understandable if

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:46.929
there is some worry about what is happening
elsewhere, but I really think that it's misguided

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:51.729
and that we should embrace these changes.
We shouldn't be afraid of them. Now it's absolutely

00:21:51.729 --> 00:21:55.669
true that western universities are getting
a run for their money. I mean we're in a much

00:21:55.669 --> 00:22:00.879
more competitive environment than we have
been before. I think that we should be energized

00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:04.649
by this. We shouldn't be worried about it,
and the fundamental reasons, really one of

00:22:04.649 --> 00:22:08.299
the take home points, you know, I can't resist
showing this again, the new book, "The Great

00:22:08.299 --> 00:22:13.169
Brain Race." One of the take home points is
that increasing knowledge is not a zero sum

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:17.620
game. There is not a finite amount of knowledge
in the world that we all have to scramble

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:23.549
to fight over to get our piece of. If there
is more smart people in China, more people

00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:30.109
with PhD's, with more education, that's good
for us. It's not bad for us. You know, economists

00:22:30.109 --> 00:22:34.580
will talk about knowledge as a public good.
It's something that can't be contained within

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.159
national borders. So a lot of people, I'm
going to use the economist Tyler Cowen, there's

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:43.779
many others who have made this point, if there
is a discovery which is made in South Korea

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:48.720
or Saudi Arabia or wherever. In the United
States we are particularly recognized for

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.570
our ability to innovate for example. So it's
entirely possible that there is new knowledge

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.350
created someplace else, but then we'll come
in, and we'll do something fascinating with

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.359
it and important, and we might create the
next Google. So again, I think if you take

00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:04.779
a more expansive view of what is going on,
you can see the opportunities which are out

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:09.830
there.
Now I've talked about the ways in which a

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:18.389
very highly competitive global market place
has developed. And in my view, global education

00:23:18.389 --> 00:23:25.159
markets, just like markets in finance or in
other areas, markets need information in order

00:23:25.159 --> 00:23:32.700
to function effectively. It may be inevitable
that all this global competition, mobility

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.700
of students, competition to create world class
universities, has given rise to global college

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:45.210
rankings. They have really proliferated in
the last couple of decades, not just at the

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:52.320
national level, but globally as well. I'll
just give you a very quick view of what I

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.159
think has happened with rankings. The first
one which I have been able to find, which

00:23:55.159 --> 00:24:02.009
for a Bay Area audience, I hope will be particularly
interesting, came in 1895 at the University

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:08.870
of California, at Berkeley. Then, practically
a brand new university. This is a chart you

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.230
can see, it's a little hard to read. This
is one of the first rankings I have been able

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:18.469
to find, and it's also very cutting edge because
it's a value added ranking, which is now a

00:24:18.469 --> 00:24:22.929
very big issue today. You'll see there is
a picture of these young men, it's all men

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:28.469
doing calisthenics outside somewhere on the
CAL campus, and there is a chart trying to

00:24:28.469 --> 00:24:33.629
show the measurements of these guys; their
neck measurements, their chest measurements,

00:24:33.629 --> 00:24:37.429
their thigh measurements. And they compare
them to a sample of these blue bloods on the

00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:42.019
East Coast, at all these old established colleges,
Cornell and Amherst. They have a pretty impressive

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:46.289
sample, its 30,000 guys on the East Coast,
and as you see at the beginning of this, the

00:24:46.289 --> 00:24:50.169
East Coast blue-bloods probably did a lot
of working out at their prep schools, who

00:24:50.169 --> 00:24:54.879
knows, they are way ahead of the California
guys. But after two years of these calisthenics

00:24:54.879 --> 00:24:56.789
the California guys surge ahead.

00:24:56.789 --> 00:25:02.099
So value has been added. And that's really
a wonderful example of how these kinds of

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:08.859
comparisons, albeit not in the academic realm,
they've been around a long time. Now for the

00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:14.119
next 100 years or so, there were a variety
of different rankings, which I have a whole

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:18.720
chapter in the book which gives chapter and
verse as it were, but they really did not

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.970
take off until 1983. Which is when my alma
mater, my journalistic alma mater, US News

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:28.340
started these college rankings. Initially
just really a beauty contest, a poll of college

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.759
presidents, a fairly conventional journalistic
exercise to try to figure out who you think

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:36.700
is the best. And it quickly became very popular.
The presidents came in, they were mad, they

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.229
protested, they said 'you have to stop, you're
outside of the guild, how dare you presume

00:25:41.229 --> 00:25:46.359
to come in and judge us?' And US News basically
said well OK, we'll try to make it more sophisticated,

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:50.989
so they added a lot of measures, graduation
rates, research spending, qualifications for

00:25:50.989 --> 00:25:56.269
entering students, etc, etc.
Ah, the rankings continued to be hugely popular,

00:25:56.269 --> 00:26:01.090
hugely controversial as you know. What many
people don't know is how quickly the rankings

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.740
spread to more than 40 countries now.
Individual rankings by country, not only in

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:12.159
places you might expect, like Italy or like
Canada but also in places like Peru or Kazakhstan,

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:16.489
which now have their own national level rankings.
Cause there's huge interest in figuring out

00:26:16.489 --> 00:26:20.330
how universities compare with one another.
And then the big breakthrough came 7 years

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.799
ago when a Chinese university, Shanghai Jiao
Tong University created its own global college

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:28.519
rankings, looking at universities around the
world. This was very much part of China's

00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:32.659
effort to upgrade its own universities and
I think the basic feeling was well if you

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:36.679
wanted to figure out your goals, you have
to have some kind of a benchmark, to figure

00:26:36.679 --> 00:26:40.070
out where you are, where your competition
is and where you want to go. So they created

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:45.149
rankings that are very scientifically oriented,
engineering oriented, very connected. Very

00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:50.989
much based on publication citation index's,
things like that. The following year the British

00:26:50.989 --> 00:26:55.710
publication called Times Higher Education;
they used to have the word supplement on the

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:00.219
end, they created rankings as well. Quite
different. Much more survey based, both of

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:05.080
academics and employers. They were initially
more geared to consumers, but in fact both

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.979
rankings became very influential. Not only
to individuals who might want to figure out

00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:12.580
where to study, but also with universities
and with policy makers, trying to figure out

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.899
what are the most effective institutions.
And for the time being, if you look at, excuse

00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:23.739
me, the top institutions, you could all, you
know, coz I'm on Google, you can all look

00:27:23.739 --> 00:27:30.409
for your Alma Mater's on these lists. These
lists are actually pretty similar. This is

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:34.340
the most recent set of rankings. You'll note
of course that the British rankings have a

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.950
few more British universities in the list.
But, the top ones are pretty similar and they

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.879
may stay similar for some time to come, but
I think that what is going to happen, because

00:27:43.879 --> 00:27:47.573
of some of the ferment that I've talked about,
is that if you go into the top 50, the top

00:27:47.573 --> 00:27:52.200
100 we're going to see more and more new entrances,
and more and more shaking up of the way things

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.659
have been.
Now as in every other area that I've touched

00:27:56.659 --> 00:28:01.839
on, there's a lot of worry about the rankings,
there's a lot of concerns and a lot of criticisms.

00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:07.019
And, you know, basically I'll give you an
example, I went to a conference in Shanghai,

00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:11.729
of university officials from all over the
world and a French philosopher named Monique

00:28:11.729 --> 00:28:15.919
Canto-Sperber who is the president of the
Ecole Normale Superieure, which is one of

00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:19.890
the elite grandes ecole in France, she came
over to Shanghai to give a long impassioned

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.759
speech about how terrible the Shanghai rankings
are and they used the wrong inputs and they

00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:29.169
used the wrong measures and they don't do
justice to wonderful places like hers. And

00:28:29.169 --> 00:28:32.139
it was exactly like the discussions I used
to have at US News when college presidents

00:28:32.139 --> 00:28:38.059
would come in and blast us for all the dumb,
terrible things we did with the US News Rankings.

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:40.870
And in this case it was great, I was on the
side lines, it wasn't my fight, you know but

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:45.700
I got to see how the same dynamic was going
on. You know, basically the criticism is that

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.899
the rankings focus on the wrong things, they
create perverse incentives, critics will say.

00:28:50.899 --> 00:28:54.739
The Shanghai rankings have a measure of how
many Nobel winners you have on your faculty.

00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:58.049
And you know, one question is, well Ok, they
grabbed their Nobel 30 years ago, what does

00:28:58.049 --> 00:29:01.350
that have to do with their current research,
do they actually teach students? There are

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.239
lots of reasons why that might not be the
ideal metric, um, and basically you know,

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:08.540
the criticism is that these rankings just
don't tell you just how effective universities

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.190
really are.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:14.580
Particularly when it comes to teaching and
learning, as opposed to research and things

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.909
that are perhaps more easier to quantify.
So in fact places like France, they really

00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:24.519
hate the rankings, they've, people are coming
up with their own. So another one of the French

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:28.930
elite universities and engineering schools
called Paris M.Tech in Paris, they came up

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:34.539
with a global ranking but they created it
themselves, but you ended up seeing this headline

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:39.580
in one of the web based Higher Education publications...
It's one of my favorite headlines. And you'll

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:45.659
see it says "French do well in French world
rankings". So this is what happens when people

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:54.369
start trying to police themselves you might
say. So once again, you know, I think that

00:29:54.369 --> 00:29:58.460
despite these anxieties and despite these
criticisms I think rankings are ultimately

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.999
useful.
And it's absolutely true that they have lots

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:06.580
of flaws. I'm well aware of the flaws in the
US News rankings, the global rankings. They

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:15.710
each have their own flaws, but I think already,
even in their flawed state they can be useful

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.229
to students, they can be useful to universities,
they can be useful to policy makers. Trying

00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:24.269
to get a rough sense on how different institutions
are doing on certain measures and that's particularly

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:27.659
true as long as they are transparent, you
know, you can figure out. Shanghai ranking

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.279
are particularly good at this, you can go
to their website, you can look at everything,

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:33.909
and you can you know re-do it yourself if
you think that there is a better way of looking

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:37.619
at all these factors.
And I think you know, we have to understand

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:42.749
practically speaking these rankings are here
to stay, you know. We're in an age of accountability.

00:30:42.749 --> 00:30:46.299
Everybody wants to figure out how they're
doing, how everyone else is doing, how they

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:50.230
can get ahead and you need some way of measuring
that. So I think the real challenge will be

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.719
how to make the rankings better. Who knows,
maybe there'll be a Google university rankings.

00:30:54.719 --> 00:31:00.809
That would be a great project for a smart
bunch of people like you. I think you know

00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:04.799
what's encouraging is that there already are
some efforts underway to improve existing

00:31:04.799 --> 00:31:10.859
rankings and to create some new ones. I mentioned
Times Higher Education. Well last fall, I

00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:15.479
was gonna say they fired their data firm.
But I got a stern email yesterday from a guy

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:20.970
at the data firm saying, we were not fired,
the contract was not renewed. So I'll say

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:27.659
it for the record. In fact this other company
QS has always been a full partner in the rankings

00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:31.209
and they are continuing with their own rankings,
whilst Times Higher brought in Thomson Reuters,

00:31:31.209 --> 00:31:36.159
you know, obviously a very reputable place,
to revamp their rankings completely. To do

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:38.879
it in a very transparent way, they're going
around speaking about it, they're writing

00:31:38.879 --> 00:31:43.649
about it. They have not yet revealed their
exact new methodology, but I think it's very

00:31:43.649 --> 00:31:45.629
encouraging, because it means they've listened
to the criticism and they're trying to make

00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:48.200
things better.
The other thing that's happening is that places

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:53.269
are trying new kinds of rankings, not just
the French version, but the OECD, the group

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:57.729
of industrialized nations based in Paris,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation

00:31:57.729 --> 00:32:01.393
and Development, they're developing something
called AHELO. Yet another acronym but it has

00:32:01.393 --> 00:32:05.419
to do with Higher Education and learning outcomes.
And they're trying to measure, really, they

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:08.919
don't like to call a ranking, fair enough,
but it's an assessment of what’s happening

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:14.080
on campus in terms of student learning. So
they’re trying to see how much their students

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.729
know coming in, how good is their writing,
how good are their analytic abilities. And

00:32:17.729 --> 00:32:21.580
then what they hope to do is create a value
added measure, this is down the road, but

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.950
they want to say Ok how are they coming in?
How are they when they leave? How much have

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.039
they improved? And they're trying to come
up cross national comparisons that will really

00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:33.909
be valid. It's a difficult thing to do but
I think it’s a really great effort and I

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:38.459
think that ultimately you could get better
measures of learning, and somehow combine

00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:42.429
them with better measures of research productivity,
perhaps not only in science, but in other

00:32:42.429 --> 00:32:46.419
fields as well. Then you'd be creating something
very useful and I think we're going down that

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:49.879
road.
So I've talked about mobility, I've talked

00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:55.779
about world class universities and I've talked
about rankings. And before I finish, I just

00:32:55.779 --> 00:32:59.959
want to reiterate that despite these anxieties
you sometimes hear about each of these phenomena

00:32:59.959 --> 00:33:05.830
I think it's absolutely crucial that we reject
academic protectionism, which is a term that

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:11.059
I use in the book, in all its forms. You know,
as I said before, knowledge is not a finite

00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:15.369
resource, it's not something we have to scramble
over, it's something that can grow, it's something

00:33:15.369 --> 00:33:20.359
that can benefit everybody, and I think it's
just a great opportunity for us, everything

00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:24.629
that's happening.
The final thing I want to say, is when we

00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:29.190
look at the future of higher education, is
that we tend to see it in this country through

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.769
a paradigm of us vs. them. How are we doing?
How is the rest of the world doing? And are

00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:37.369
we keeping up? Are they going to outpace us?
What’s going to happen in the great brain

00:33:37.369 --> 00:33:41.239
race that I used for my title? And I think
that already that this bottle is getting out

00:33:41.239 --> 00:33:46.059
of date. I've talked about the research collaborations
that are growing enormously. I've talked about

00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:50.470
the partnerships that are being created in
places like S.Po in Paris, an elite political

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.499
science school, has a partnership with the
London School of Economics and with Columbia

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:59.019
University. You know, one could imagine in
the future whole new ways of organizing universities.

00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:04.209
You might see mergers; you might see multinational
universities. Already John Sexton who is the

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:08.030
president of New York University. He has a
vision for what he calls a global network

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.879
university. They're already creating a campus
that's opening up in a couple of months in

00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:16.491
Abu Dhabi. That's going to be an elite campus
of undergraduates from all around the world.

00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:21.730
His idea is that you might start in Abu Dhabi
and finish in Washington Square, their New

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.350
York City campus. But they’re hoping to
go to Shanghai as well. And if that happens,

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.659
you might start in Shanghai and finish in
Abu Dhabi. So the notion of this single center

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:36.269
may no longer hold true. And you know, we
really don't know what's going to happen in

00:34:36.269 --> 00:34:39.280
the future. I mean you could go back to the
19th Century when German universities, you

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.639
know that's where the research university
was created, ah, Americans went there, that

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:47.030
was state of the art, and they came back,
they took this idea with them, they created

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:51.770
places like Johns Hopkins university, the
University of Chicago, based on the German

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.730
model of putting research and teaching under
one roof. We took this idea, we ran with it.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.900
We became the best in the world. By far, since
World War II, we are the magnet, right? So

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:07.339
now German universities have really fallen
on hard times. They've had, for decades, a

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:11.559
kind of egalitarian funding model where everyone
became kind of equal in their mediocrity,

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:15.300
and they just don't have great universities
with a few, you know exceptions of some research

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:20.490
institutes. So now, you know 150 years later,
Germany is now looking to us to figure out

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:24.839
how to become excellent. So things can change.
I think we have to approach the future with

00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:30.769
some humility. But I think that what ever
happens, you know, I'm really convinced that

00:35:30.769 --> 00:35:35.849
the key to innovation and the key to economic
growth is going to continue to lie in the

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:41.309
freest possible movement of people and idea's;
and that's true both in university campuses

00:35:41.309 --> 00:35:46.540
and beyond. I think it's a very exciting time
and I'm really curious to see what happens

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:50.260
next. Thank you very much.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.810
[Applause from Audience]

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.650
I'd love to hear your questions.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.230
[silence]

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:11.420
&gt;&gt;Person in audience: Ah Hi, I went to school
in India, and one of the challenges that India

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:18.390
has is that the system sort of expects the
government to do all its work for them. And

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:24.030
what it means is that the private sector has
hardly invested any money in creating world

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.180
class institutions, and what very little there
is,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.010
&gt;&gt;Ben: I'm sorry; could you speak a little
bit louder?

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:32.609
&gt;&gt;Person from audience: Sure. What very little
there is, is basically a for-profit organization.

00:36:32.609 --> 00:36:37.430
So what you have is all these politicians
who are creating the schools and educating

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:42.130
for the money. And it's such a big problem
that the Supreme Court has intervened time

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:47.529
and time again. To sort of cap the fees and
ensure that the education is more egalitarian.

00:36:47.529 --> 00:36:55.650
So my question is, how has the private sector
in most other third world countries, so to

00:36:55.650 --> 00:37:00.270
speak, contributed to education in general,
or is it mostly the expectation that the government

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.880
does all the job for them?

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.960
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well that's a great question; I'm not
just saying that. It really is and in fact

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.481
I have a chapter on the role of for-profits
in globalization which I didn’t get into

00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:16.010
in this smorgasbord overview presentation.
But the private sector, the for profit sector,

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:21.990
is been very important, and I think that will
continue to be the case. I mean there are

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.849
companies that we know in the United States,
like the Apollo Group which is the parent

00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:31.359
company of the University of Phoenix, Kaplan,
which we think of for its tutoring programs,

00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:37.119
um, a number of others that are really going
global in a very big way. I mean Kaplan now,

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:43.089
the company is much more focused on, I think
the percentage of their time and energy is

00:37:43.089 --> 00:37:46.420
spent on higher education is now much greater
than what they are doing in K12, and that’s

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:53.049
their going global too. So what you'll find
in places like Latin America, in Asia, India

00:37:53.049 --> 00:37:59.119
is somewhat of a special case as you know,
because of the regulatory regime and the barriers

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:04.510
to going into India; but they're trying to
fill, well it's really an unmet need in many

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:09.269
countries and it's often students or people
who want to become students who are left out

00:38:09.269 --> 00:38:14.220
of traditional systems, usually state run
systems. And you sort of have the paradox

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.990
in some places where there will be an elite
public university which is free, which sounds

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:22.880
very egalitarian. But it turns out that to
get into this university you have to go to

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.890
expensive secondary schools that mostly affluent
people are able to afford. So it's kind of

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:32.990
a phony egalitarianism, and what happens is
there are lots of people middle class, working

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.970
class people who want to get ahead, they want
to get degrees in often very practical subjects,

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.891
you know accounting, nursing, tourism, and
so the for-profit sector is trying to provide

00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:45.770
that. They're coming in, they're buying up
existing, they're not really setting up the

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:51.059
McKaplan, or the McLaureate but they're trying
to buy up existing institutions with local

00:38:51.059 --> 00:38:56.150
brands but to try to take advantage of using
up their expertise to create to go to skill,

00:38:56.150 --> 00:39:00.920
and to create back office synergies and so
forth. So, to sort of summarize, I think there's

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.070
a lot going on, I think this is going to grow
very very quickly. It's already grown a lot.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:08.461
Countries like India, it's tough. There's
a lot of suspicion, there's a lot of worry

00:39:08.461 --> 00:39:11.650
about quality, which is understandable, it’s
the same in this country, you know people

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.180
are suspicious of the Phoenix’s and so forth,
but I think look that’s never going to be

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:20.230
the whole package. That’s going to be a
component, because people want different things

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.370
and you know the private sector can be very
nimble. I think the question is how are you

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.150
going to try to ensure some basic level of
quality. But frankly that's an issue for some

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:32.309
main stream universities. You know, as you
know better than I do, it's just a tragedy.

00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:39.640
I mean the hungry for learning in the Indian
population is palpable, and the capacity of

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.329
universities is completely inadequate, just
in terms of numbers and the quality of universities

00:39:44.329 --> 00:39:48.779
is completely inadequate. Beyond a few elite
schools, you know the IIT's, the Management

00:39:48.779 --> 00:39:49.940
institutes, the IIM's.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:54.730
So periodically the government will say we're
going to create dozens of new great institutions

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.110
but you know you can't just snap your fingers
and make it happen. They often don't have

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:01.319
the resources to do it, and right now there
is a bill before the Indian parliament, and

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:05.269
I won't talk about India for too much longer
but, foreign universities would like to come

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:09.820
in, it's a great market for them, different,
some elites, some not elites and so far they've

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:15.759
been barred completely from setting up campus's.
So it's really been a protectionist regime.

00:40:15.759 --> 00:40:19.200
There is a bill, there is a higher education
minister who is much more open to changing

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.970
things, but it's controversial. There have
been questions about will the cast quotas

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:27.210
apply to foreign universities? And in particular,
will they be allowed to repatriate money they

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:31.270
make? So clearly for the private sector if
you can't tackle out profits, why are you

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.270
going to go in?

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:36.120
So I think there is a role for the private
sector and in a place like India, there have

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.790
been huge strides in India. I mean you know,
certainly in the broader economy the idea

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:44.109
of central planning is now out of vogue, and
that's why India has grown in my view. I think

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:49.250
you need to bring that same sort of mentality
to the higher education system.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.250
[pause]

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:57.359
&gt;&gt;Person 2 from audience: I'd like to follow
on from this very interesting question focusing

00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:00.009
on Europe since that's where I'm from rather
than India.

00:41:00.009 --> 00:41:01.140
&gt;&gt;Ben: Where are you from?

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:07.970
&gt;&gt;Person 2 from audience: Italy. Um, you mentioned
how German universities in particular are

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:15.099
in a crisis due to their very egalitarian
model. That's not just Germany. Ok, France

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:22.809
may have kept a few bright sparks, um, Italy
may have a few foreign like there is a Texas

00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:30.269
A&amp;M branch in Castiglion Fiorentino, John
Hopkins one, just picking on a few you mentioned,

00:41:30.269 --> 00:41:37.710
in Bologna. And so on, but they're really
not working on a mass scale at all. The mass

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:43.349
will tend to the same egalitarian mediocrity
and you mentioned the cultural suspicion.

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:48.150
Well, you don't know what cultural suspicion
of America is until you've been to France,

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:56.680
which you have of course, but compared with
that it's like, so I don't see any private

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:02.349
sector activity of course. I've been living
in the US for a long time now so I may not

00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:11.410
perceive everything that's going on. But while
you hold out hope for the India's and other

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:16.559
emerging countries, is Europe which doesn't
really, isn't really going to have a booming

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:22.990
economy any time, doesn't have anywhere as
many young people and so on, going to be able

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:29.600
to attract any private initiative, any private
investment the way you hold out for the future?

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.250
&gt;&gt;Ben: Well look, several things are going
on in Europe which I think are encouraging.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:36.009
I mean the first is that you're absolutely
right, I mention Germany only because I was

00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:40.070
trying to make the parallel with the 19th
century. However, France, like Germany has

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.820
had this problem you know of, pretty, and
I lived there for a couple of years, and you're

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:49.030
right I love France, but I'm well aware of
its problems. I was there during the student

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:53.480
protests in 1986 which sort of dates me. They
were talking about how they didn't want to

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.410
move to an American style system where as
everyone knows only the rich goes to college

00:42:56.410 --> 00:43:01.009
and this is when the student fees were going
to go from 300 dollars a year to 350, which

00:43:01.009 --> 00:43:06.529
was going to shut out countless, tens of thousands
of students. So there were a lot of misperceptions.

00:43:06.529 --> 00:43:14.359
But France is now trying to go beyond this
egalitarian model, to create a competitive

00:43:14.359 --> 00:43:18.780
funding model that is designed precisely to
create a small group of world class institutions,

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.119
that they can show that they are really going
to be worthy of the government funding.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:26.720
The same thing is happening in Germany. So
they're really trying to turn things around.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.420
Italy has a place, you will probably know
it better than I do, Bacconi University, which

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.839
is a private university, and they have a goal
for example of, I'm not sure how close they

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:39.030
are of getting half of their faculty from
overseas, within the next 5 or 10 years. So

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.900
they are very globally minded.
And you also have something called the Bologna

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:47.700
Accord. Which is sort of a common market in
education throughout Europe, trying to create

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.450
degrees that are compatible with each other.
Standard three year degree. So it's easier

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:55.140
to move around. It's easier for employers
to assess these degrees. And you can think

00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.240
of it as the higher ed version of the Europe
which I think is going to create some useful

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.359
ability to be mobile.
So I think there are some promising things

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:10.099
going on in Europe. But you're right. Bologna
was one of the seats of the creation of universities:

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:13.460
Paris, Bologna, Oxford. And it's a tragedy
that it no longer has that...

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.109
&gt;&gt;Person 2 from audience: When the King of
England wanted to establish a University,

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:21.809
in a place of so little distinction, that
the best thing it was known for was that the

00:44:21.809 --> 00:44:25.299
river was so shallow that even an oxen could
ford.

00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:30.990
What he did was go right to Bologna and steal
the top academics. There was a lot of that

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.140
going on in the Middle Ages as well.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140
&gt;&gt;Ben: That's right, that's right.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:37.009
&gt;&gt;Person 2 from audience: I'm from Bologna,
that's why I'm so knowledgeable on the subject.

00:44:37.009 --> 00:44:41.789
&gt;&gt; Ben: Ah, I understand. Ok

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:50.210
&gt;&gt; Person 3 from audience: Hi there, what
is the role of the internet to help flatten

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:58.880
the world and make for the fluid transfer
of information and people virtually at least

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.880
in all of this?

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.569
&gt;&gt; Ben: Gosh, I why don't I rap myself over
the knuckles for not getting to that sooner.

00:45:03.569 --> 00:45:05.810
You can't cover everything but again, there
is a lot of that in the book.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:06.810
&gt;&gt; Person 3 from audience: This is Google.

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:15.769
&gt;&gt; Ben: Sure. The internet is very important.
I think that we are still in a period of experimentation.

00:45:15.769 --> 00:45:19.430
MIT has what they call is "open courseware
system" where they put all of their courses

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:23.869
up on the web. Although the president of Yale,
there is a lot of trash talking, he says yeah,

00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:28.450
they’re up on the web, but most of them
are just a skeleton courses. Sometimes it's

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.829
a syllabus; sometimes it's more than that.
Yale has much fewer courses, but they are

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:38.230
much more fully built out, with video and
podcasts and so forth. So there are questions

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:40.690
about how you do it.
The for-profits are also doing this in a very

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:46.349
big way. Some very high percentage of Australian
students, excuse me, Chinese students studying

00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:49.120
in Australian universities, a very high percentage
are doing it online.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.490
And you get into questions of what's the best
model, fully online, or a combination of what

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:58.539
they call it "blended learning", sometimes
they call it 'click and brick' like with Phoenix,

00:45:58.539 --> 00:46:02.549
you'll go right by the freeway exit, because
that's where they’ll put their sites, you

00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:06.960
know, it's easy for working students, that's
their population. You might go periodically

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.920
to have some classroom time, some face time,
and a lot of it you will do whenever it's

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.590
good for you on your computer.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:21.529
Clearly it has huge potential across borders.
I think that you know, not everyone's gonna

00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:26.850
want that. We already have a variety of models,
and if you look at this country I think that's

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.890
one of our great strengths; you know, from
the for-profit sectors, small but growing

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:35.020
fast, the open access community colleges,
the state universities from the Berkeley's

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:40.680
and the UCLA's, to the CAL States, you know,
east bay or San Francisco and there is a different

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.450
entry point for lots of people. Some of it's
gonna be online, some of it's gonna be traditional,

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:49.150
and some people will sit around a tree reading
Thucydides, which is great, I'm all for it.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:55.859
In fact the Asian universities are very interested
in our liberal arts tradition. Where we tend

00:46:55.859 --> 00:47:03.269
to admire their ethos of work and perseverance
and so forth, they look at us and they say

00:47:03.269 --> 00:47:08.119
what's the secret sauce that makes the United
States so innovative? And one of the answers

00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:12.579
may be that people learn certain habits of
mind, questioning what they're taught, and

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:17.299
you know, it's cliché but thinking outside
the box, so to come back to online learning,

00:47:17.299 --> 00:47:22.910
you know, people are going to be trying to
grapple with ways to figure out what's the

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:28.599
optimal learning experience and I think that
online for some people is going to be a part

00:47:28.599 --> 00:47:30.400
of that. Thank you.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.809
&gt;&gt;Maggie: Well on that note, thank you very
much for coming to Google.

00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:33.810
&gt;&gt;Ben: Thank you for having me.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:34.140
[applause]
