00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.912
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's do a quick overview of the method we used to get from this quadratic

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.071
polynomial, which does not have 1 as its coefficient of the first term, to its

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.266
fully factored form. So you started off by finding two numbers that add to equal

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:16.413
this middle coefficient. And then multiply it equal the product of the two outer

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:20.773
coefficients. Let's see if we can try that method out with another problem. What

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:24.588
if we have the expression 5x squared minus 28x minus 12? How would you fully

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:28.877
factor this quadratic polynomial? Remember the method that we used for the last

00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:32.955
one. And if you need to review it, just go back and peek at the past videos.
