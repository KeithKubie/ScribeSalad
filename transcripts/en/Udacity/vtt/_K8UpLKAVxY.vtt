Welcome to Statistics 101, taught by me, Sebastian Thrun and by Adam Sherwin,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
who is our assistant instructor doing a lot of work in the background.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I figure I'll start with giving you a teaser, a challenging teaser.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going to provoke you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, this is you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I believe you should be unhappy,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
not because our class is so bad,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but you and I will prove in a second that you are unpopular.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The reason why I show this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is to show you how deep statistics is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and how we can easily fool ourselves. So let's dive in.
