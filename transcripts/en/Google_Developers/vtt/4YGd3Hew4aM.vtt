[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.930
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Product management,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.030
and I lead up our mobile
display ads teams.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.500
We thought that we would
spend some time today

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.030
talking with all of
you about what we're

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.520
seeing in the mobile app space
in terms of monetization;

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.550
how people are building not
just small businesses, but truly

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.709
global businesses on the backs
of mobile apps; the trends

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.750
that we're seeing, the
techniques that people are

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.650
using, and importantly,
some of the tools

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.090
that we're building to make
this easier for all of you.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.440
We're going to look at this
in three specific areas--

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.420
first, this concept of
smarter monetization.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.120
How you can take advantage
of data and tools

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.860
that exist today, both
manual and automatic,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.670
to build really
innovative business models

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.980
on the backs of mobile apps.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.620
Second, the tools that you
need to scale your businesses.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.480
Many app developers
start with a couple

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.210
of folks in their garage,
and before they know it,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.950
they've created a
multimillion dollar business.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.760
You want to make sure that
the tools that you adopt

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.290
into your app are
tools that will

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.050
help you to scale
from small businesses

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.870
to multi-billion dollar ones.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.160
And three, simplicity.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.470
Because most importantly,
you guys are app developers.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.410
You want to spend your time
thinking about the apps

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.280
that you're building, making
those better, creating really

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.560
rich, engaging experiences--
and the last thing

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.310
that you want to worry about
is letting monetization,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.230
or business models,
get in the way.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.630
Now, I've had an
incredible opportunity

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.550
working with AdMob, my
team, and my partners

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.110
for the better part of the
last three or four years.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.410
And without a doubt, one of
the best experiences that I get

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.050
is to travel this
wonderful globe

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
and to meet app developers
in all regions of the world.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.700
I get to meet app
developers right here

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.010
in my hometown of
San Francisco, I

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.300
get to meet amazing
developers in places

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.000
like Japan and Tokyo
and London, as well

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.670
as in places like Vietnam.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.630
And it's stunning, because
these stories are the same over

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.050
and over again-- you find
bright, young entrepreneurial

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.320
folks who know that
they can change

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.560
the world with some software
on a mobile application.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.140
And we understand
that the barriers

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.070
of the world, these
country borders

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.870
are fading away, as people in
the furthest reaches of Earth

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.210
are building businesses
that are touching us

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.316
all around the world.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.440
So we thought we would
start with just two examples

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.070
to give you a feel for how
folks are turning mobile apps

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.510
into truly global businesses.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.490
The first is a story
of our friend Mehmet.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.240
He's the co-founder
and CEO of Gram Games.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.030
Mehmet grew up in Turkey
in a small village

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.530
called [? Golnar. ?] He
dropped out of college,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.230
but he always had a
passion for engineering,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410
for software development,
and for coding.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.100
And so he taught
himself to program.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.670
Mehmet was a little
bit ambitious,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.360
and within three
weeks he was trying

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.140
to figure out how to
write AI for chess games.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.180
He worked for a variety
of different companies

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.520
as a developer, but he had this
itch for his passion, which

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.550
was gaming.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.660
And so he co-founded a
company, Gram Games, in 2012.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.280
Wasn't easy at first.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.640
You can see how they
operated when they first

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.370
got started-- about
five of them working out

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.089
of their apartments, as
you kind of have to do.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.850
And they were working really
hard to try to develop a hit.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.020
They kept building app
after app after app,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.820
but nothing was sticking.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.980
And then all of a
sudden, in 2014,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.650
the winds changed for them.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.469
And they developed
a truly massive hit.

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.260
I hope some of you of
you in the audience--

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.712
raise your hand, come on,
who's played 10 10 Puzzle?

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:38.420
I certainly have.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.190
Yeah, see, there we go.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.300
And you see how quickly
the stuff spreads.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.280
Before long, they had 5 million
users playing this game.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.380
And they realized, now
we have an opportunity

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.600
to build a business.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.670
So they employed
in-app purchases,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.010
trying to get users to pay
to play more of the game

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.790
that they loved.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.960
But with 5 million users, and
with not a high percentage

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.610
of users willing
to pay, they really

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.030
struggled to create a business
off of in-app purchase.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.120
Late in 2014, they started
researching mobile app

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.030
advertising systems, and
they came upon AdMob.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.960
Mehmet liked AdMob
because it had a high fill

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.580
rate, strong CPMs,
which meant it

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.490
was going to deliver him revenue
without a lot of complexity.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.400
So in the back half of 2014,
they implemented AdMob.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.120
And before they knew it, they
were generating $5,000 a day

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.355
in earnings-- which grew
their business seven-fold.

00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.910
They utilized mobile ads
in a fairly simple way,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.160
leveraging banner
ads for in-game play,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.035
and then interstitials
in between the levels.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.230
And thanks to AdMob,
they were able to move

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.760
from their apartment
to new offices.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.294
They grew from five
employees to 20,

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:02.710
and they've now
scaled-- they have

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.789
20 million users worldwide.

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.330
And see an example up there,
you can see their team behind me

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.829
here, you can see
their new offices.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.530
And they're one of
the fastest growing

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.910
startups in all of Turkey.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.450
And the thing that
really impresses

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.090
me is that they have such
a passion about this space,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.380
that they now run
their own accelerator

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.610
program to help other indie game
developers get off the ground.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.590
Our next example comes
from Backflip Studios.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.920
Julian is the co-founder
and CEO there,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.580
and they have one of the oldest
and most favorite of mobile app

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.612
games.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:41.820
We're going to show you an
example of that right now.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.778
Can you play the video?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.840
JULIAN FARRIOR: I feel
like I'm living out

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.570
my 12-year-old dream,
which is to have created

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.240
an interesting gaming company.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.640
And we get to create product
that people care about,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.160
and that resonates from
an emotional standpoint

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.460
with a very broad
range of folks.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.020
Backflip Studios started
about six years ago

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.630
with a small group of people,
and we went to market quickly.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.140
We started it with
the idea that mobile

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.450
was going to change
the landscape

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.950
and ecosystem of gaming.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.060
So we created all these
free, engaging, casual games.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.380
And we had this huge
audience, but at the time,

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.200
we weren't really sure how
we were going to monetize it,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.740
and how we were going to create
a sustainable gaming company

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.420
out of that.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.545
KEVIN KING: When you're
creating a mobile business,

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:37.840
you have to focus
on the stability,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.280
and you have to be able
to scale that operation.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.410
Without Google, we
would have to work

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.360
with about 20 different partners
to be able to accomplish

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.137
what we do today.

00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:48.470
JULIAN FARRIOR: We use the
Android platform, in addition

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.340
to App Engine.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.820
And we've really seen
our live products

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.050
be able to scale with
the server infrastructure

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.100
and back-end infrastructure
of App Engine.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.790
JASON DALRYMPLE:
We then monetize

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.640
those games with in-app
purchases, virtual goods,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.300
as well as advertising.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.000
And we use DFP to run
our internal ad network,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.520
and then we monetize
using AdMob.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.160
KEVIN KING: In
order to do that, we

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.290
have to acquire users
at a very low cost,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.090
and at a very large scale.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.716
JASON DALRYMPLE: So we know
that 90% to 95% of our users

00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:21.340
are not going to
spend within the game.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.680
Google allows us to
segment our users in order

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.090
to maximize the value we can
get from folks who are spending

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.510
in the game, as well as
advertising revenue for folks

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.029
who are not spending
in the game.

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:33.070
On the engaged side, we
have Google Cloud Storage

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.070
to scale our game as it grows.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.490
We post our game in
the Google Play Store.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.069
KEVIN KING: Being able
to target users based off

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:42.585
of demographics, spend
behavior, makes it

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:44.710
so we have a better
relationship with the customers

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.626
we're trying to reach.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.010
And AdWords is
the first platform

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.230
that we have used that
allows us to target directly

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.940
customers who are guaranteed
to have made a purchase.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.440
JULIAN FARRIOR: The
idea that Google

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.990
has a number of different
tools that we can leverage,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.610
it's allowed us to manage a
portfolio of varying products

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.580
with different revenue
models on each.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.288
JASON DALRYMPLE:
Google's product roadmap

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.720
is really impressive, and
it's become the Swiss army

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.810
knife for us in terms
of monetization,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.810
and we're excited to see
what else they're going

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.950
to come out with.

00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:20.920
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
My team and I

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.320
thought that that was a
fantastic summary of how Google

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.914
is really pulling together all
of the assets, all of the tools

00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:29.330
that we've been providing to
app developers for the better

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.282
part of the last
five years or so,

00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:32.990
and really getting
them stitched together

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.820
under a single umbrella, so
that app developers know that we

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.270
truly provide a full
suite-- from development

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.540
through monetization, to things
like cloud storage, compute, et

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.540
cetera.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.260
So we know that
lots of developers,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.040
like the two that
we've seen here today,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.730
are taking advantage
of Google solutions

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.650
to help them grow
their businesses.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.270
Our solutions, and the
solutions that we're building,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.730
we hope to empower all of you
to grow app businesses just

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.840
as quickly, just a
scaled around the world.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.570
We talk about
scale-- I think it's

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.630
absolutely important to
understand that yes, we're

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.370
Google.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.840
And yes, this is a
Google I/O conference.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.970
But we're here to
serve app developers,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.280
regardless of the platform
that they choose to operate on.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.640
AdMob has been committed
to cross platform

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.860
on both iOS and Android long
before Google purchased AdMob.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.900
This was the case, and it
continues through to today.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.230
Over the last 12 months,
we have seen equal growth

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.180
on the iOS and Android
platforms in terms

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.870
of the number of developers
that are adopting our products.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.070
And if you want to
hear about scale,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.561
we've grown to a very
significant scale

00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.310
in terms of the number
of apps that we now

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.820
serve-- over 650,000-- and
in terms of the ad requests

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.220
that we see every month.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:01.115
That number is now 200
billion ad requests a month.

00:11:01.115 --> 00:11:02.740
And you think a little
bit about this--

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.420
we are seeing the
growth of the mobile ads

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.800
ecosystem, the mobile ads in-app
ecosystem at Google directly.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.670
But that is growth
that we expect,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.530
and folks outside
of Google expect,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.420
to continue for the
foreseeable future at least.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.540
In fact, the predictions
suggest that mobile, in-app ads

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.680
are set to grow three-fold in
roughly the next three years.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.420
And important to understand--
because I know many folks

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.690
think that mobile
ads in apps make up

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.540
a small slice of
the revenue, most

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.530
coming from in-app purchase--
that is no longer the case.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.860
And you'll see why in a second.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.090
But in many of
the major markets,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.265
mobile ads now represent 50% or
more of the total app revenue

00:11:45.265 --> 00:11:46.765
that our app
developers are earning.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.520
So I think the question
is, what's driving this?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.014
What's driving this continued
increase in mobile ads?

00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:58.180
And if we look at it, we
believe that there's really

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.040
three distinct trends.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.500
First, as always, is users.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.420
And users vote with their
clicks, as they're doing here.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.756
90% of all apps that are
downloaded today are free.

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:13.630
And you can see the
phenomenal growth-- there

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.170
it is-- you can see the
phenomenal growth that we've

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.669
had in app downloads
over the years,

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:19.100
and projections moving forward.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.100
But also recognize that that
little, darker bar at the top,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.820
that's it for the paid apps.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.200
More and more users know that
they can download and engage

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.200
and play truly
phenomenal apps for free,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.866
and they're voting
with their finger.

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:35.990
So that's trend number one.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.590
Trend number two, in-app
purchase works, it

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.720
works great for those that
know how to really optimize

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.990
and tune it, it's
absolutely phenomenal.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.900
But dammit, you better do
a good job of turning it,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:55.982
because only 1.5% of users, of
mobile gamers, spend in apps.

00:12:55.982 --> 00:12:57.690
So you've got to find
that right audience

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.210
if in-app purchase is the only
way you're going to monetize.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.790
And even more complicated,
in-app purchase tendencies

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.970
vary a lot per region.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.970
So while that business
model might do well for you

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.950
in Korea or Japan,
for example, you

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.340
might struggle as users
don't end up paying

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.130
as much in the US or the UK.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.800
The third trend
that we really think

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.580
is transforming mobile ads
is much, much better user

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.850
experiences.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.010
We highlight three here.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.480
The first is native advertising.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.670
So because we're bringing ads
into these experiences that

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.270
feel like the experiences
that users are in,

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.060
it's much less
jarring, and I think

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.702
the word native is perfect.

00:13:40.702 --> 00:13:41.910
This is the way folks see it.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.610
They see it as native to the
environment that they're in.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.354
The second is that
we're starting

00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:49.520
to see the transformation
that we've been expecting,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.120
with rich media
ads, full screen,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.100
interstitial-- we call them
light box ads at Google--

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.940
the uptake here has
been very significant.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.640
These are much easier to
create than in years past.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.830
They provide rich interaction.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.500
They allow users to actually
interact with the products

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.960
that they're
considering purchasing.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.530
And the last has
been video-- video

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.170
has transformed mobile overall,
and the advertising space

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.130
is no exception.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.950
So publishers are able
to earn a lot more money

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.340
with these types of formats.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.320
And with Google, you can
leverage TrueView ads,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.740
which put the user in control.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.660
So the user has the choice
to skip the ad if it's not

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.440
relevant to her desires.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.300
Ultimately, all of
this momentum is

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.420
leading to a very, very
significant market.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:43.290
Most projections estimate the
mobile app advertising market

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.540
to be north of $50 billion.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:51.030
This suggests $60
billion by 2017.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.000
$60 billion is an
awful lot of money,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.250
and it's one of the
things in at least

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.230
my experiences that is pushing
more and more folks to want

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.330
to become app developers.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:05.980
You want your own opportunity
to get a slice of this pie.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.930
But you're going to
have to think carefully,

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.570
because the competition
is increasing,

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.690
and the business models
are getting more complex.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.680
And if you just choose
simple business models,

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.070
like in-app purchase
or advertising,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.400
chances are you're
going to come up short,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.170
and you're not going
to be able to compete

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.730
against some of the other
folks who are out there.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.570
And we believe that
until now, developers

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.940
have not had the right
tools to really embrace

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.370
the opportunity that's out there
to create these new business

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.050
models.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.010
And that's what we've
been so hard at work

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.500
at Google at an AdMob building
for the last 18 months or so.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.010
Solving monetization
on apps is a passion

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.300
that doesn't just
consume me, but consumes

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.022
my team on a daily basis.

00:15:51.022 --> 00:15:53.480
That's why we're so excited
about some of the announcements

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.300
we have today.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.160
So what should the
strategy be for your app?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.060
How can you do it better?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.580
And why is it important
to get it right now?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.960
Well, the competition is
growing, as I mentioned.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.990
In 2014 alone, one
million new apps

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.990
were created and
uploaded to the stores.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.100
There's almost six million
developers now, worldwide,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.530
with one and a half million
developers in North America

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.950
alone.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.980
And this number will also grow.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.810
As the democratization of
software development, coding

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.090
and distribution continues
to blanket the world,

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.020
we expect eight million
developers by the year 2017.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.534
All of this means more
competition for all of you

00:16:43.534 --> 00:16:45.700
as app developers-- for the
eyeballs, the mindshare,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.514
and ultimately the
monetization of your users.

00:16:49.514 --> 00:16:51.930
So we're here to give you some
tips, some thoughts that we

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.600
have about what's going
to help all of you

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.590
break out from the rest
of the competition.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.700
Here's three.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.290
First, we believe
you need to realize

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.720
the full value of each user.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.130
Not all users will interact
with in-app purchases.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.180
Not all are going to
interact with ads.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.010
And that's what we're
demonstrating here.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.151
We have a set of users
who are likely to spend

00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:18.109
in in-app purchase, but
a separate set of users

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.920
who are likely to click on ads.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.940
And a third set who
maybe aren't going

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.970
to engage with
either one of those,

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.220
but who will happily
spread the good word of how

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.370
well your app works,
or how awesome

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.930
your game is on social media.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.410
You should probably-- and
the sophisticated developers

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.750
in the audience are nodding,
because you get it--

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.480
you should probably be dealing
with these users differently,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.450
and be building hybridized
business models that

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.750
take all of them into account.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.920
The second tip we'd
have-- and I've

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.070
been talking about this
for the last three years,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:56.870
easily-- please, use a mobile
apps analytics package.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.360
Google Analytics
works great, we're

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.710
going to talk more
about that in a second.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.190
The Google Analytics team
has been really working

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.720
hard to build the best mobile
apps analytics package,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.040
we'd love for you to use them.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.880
But for you guys, and for
your own businesses' sake,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.510
make sure you use some
analytics package.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.370
Because even though
we've been out espousing

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.860
how important this
is, and when you

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.880
do you get the nods from
everybody you talk to,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.825
look at this stat.

00:18:22.825 --> 00:18:24.200
I'm sorry for the
language, but I

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.760
don't know what the hell the
other 79% of the app developers

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.970
are doing-- you're
not able to understand

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.780
what the hell's going
on inside your app.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.200
But it's not sufficient
just to use analytics.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.000
Mike Shipper, my good friend
who helps me with these slides,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.500
he and I created
this visualization.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.150
We love it because
we're of the age

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.960
that we grew up with Hobbit
and Lord of the Rings

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.950
and all that long
before the movies.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.800
And if you remember
The Hobbit, you

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.610
remember Bilbo Baggins
and the cast of characters

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.250
climbing to the mountain,
to the Lonely Mountain,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.630
because the dragon
Smaug had come in,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.020
knocked out all the dwarves,
and sat perched on top

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.600
of the dwarves' treasure hold.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.000
Mike and I thought this
was almost comical.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.070
Like, what the hell
is a dragon going

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.070
to do with all of this gold?

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.680
It's the same thing
with the data.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.160
You can't just have a
data analytics package

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.270
and let it sit there.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.010
You are sitting on a veritable
treasure trove of information,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.335
and we implore you to
take action on the data

00:19:26.335 --> 00:19:27.460
that you've been acquiring.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.610
The third suggestion we
have is to truly maximize

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.230
your ad yield.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.590
You have so many opportunities
for monetization, so many

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.450
different avenues that you
can bring ads and different ad

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.400
formats in, make
sure you're looking

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.990
as holistically as possible,
use a yield management solution

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.960
if you have one, and make
sure that every impression is

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.540
maximized to the most possible.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.090
What you see here-- we
just cut off the y-axis

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.550
so we wouldn't share
the actual CPM values--

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.550
but these are relative
CPMs on our network

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.762
of TrueView versus
interstitials versus banners.

00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:08.470
So you might say, OK,
well I'm just going

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.437
to use TrueView all the time.

00:20:10.437 --> 00:20:12.270
But that may not work
for all of your users,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.300
and you may not get 100%
fill rate on TrueView.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.090
So think about the other ad
formats that you can mix in,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.920
as well.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.190
Because ultimately,
different formats

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.710
will bring a richer
experience to your app,

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.770
and help you earn more.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.560
Talking about interstitials,
specifically, we've

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.080
been out evangelizing how
great interstitials are--

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.740
from an advertiser perspective,
absolutely; from a publisher

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.130
perspective, because
you can earn more money;

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.850
and from a user perspective,
because believe it or not,

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.360
interstitials end up being
a little less disruptive.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.740
Most app developers are able
to swap out about five banner

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.540
ads for a single interstitial.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.490
And you're able to
more carefully place

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.770
those into the flow of the game,
simulating the kinds of things

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.170
that users are used to,
like TV commercials.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.800
And when our app developers
make use of interstitials,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.370
they don't use it all the time.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.960
But those who do use some
interstitials see on average

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.510
20% more revenue than those
app developers who don't.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.530
Speaking of demand, speaking
of different formats,

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.350
when you're thinking
about the networks

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.659
that your plugging into
your monetization tool--

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:20.700
this is something known
as mediation, typically--

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.910
but you can always plug
multiple third party ad networks

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.750
into just about any monetization
tool for apps, including AdMob.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:32.990
These networks all
perform differently.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.535
Mediation doesn't solve all
these problems automatically

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:37.660
for you-- we're going to
talk about the innovations

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.610
that we're bringing--
you need to keep

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.110
an eye on how these various
networks are performing.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.610
Because Network A might do
better on Wednesdays in China,

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.396
but Network B might do
better on Tuesdays in the US.

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:50.770
And you want to make sure that
you're optimizing these ad

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.129
networks correctly, so
that you're maximizing

00:21:53.129 --> 00:21:54.420
your yield on every impression.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.320
So now I want to
go a little deeper.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.470
I want to talk about
what we're working on

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.510
at AdMob, the
features and the tools

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.450
that we have built to
help you take advantage

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.150
of some of these tips and tricks
that we just talked about.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.154
So as we said in the
beginning, the principles

00:22:12.154 --> 00:22:14.070
that we're leveraging
here, and the principles

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.180
that we're focused
on, are the same

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.820
that we're driving into AdMob.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.890
First is to build a
platform they truly

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.550
enables smart monetization.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.150
Where AdMob itself is a bit
of an optimization engine,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.830
with data and users
fed in and us trying

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.220
figure out the right
monetization opportunity

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.440
for the right user
at the right time.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.700
Second, make sure that you're
employing tools to scale.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.680
So what are we doing at
Google to really help

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.480
you scale your business
from a demand perspective?

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.875
And last, how can we make
this as easy as possible?

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.780
So as I said, AdMob, the
focus and the real theme

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.260
of AdMob for the
last three years

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.521
now has been an
audience-aware smart platform.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.770
The simplest way
to think about this

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.990
is that AdMob can
take a set of inputs--

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.700
in this case it's monetization
opportunities-- it also

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.220
takes as a set of
inputs all of the data

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.810
that it's seen about all
of the users you have

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.050
and their behavior in-app.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.640
And churning
through this engine,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.800
we can either put the
power in your hands,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.600
or we can do it
automatically, and we

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.190
can provide that right
monetization opportunity

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:26.700
to the right user
at the right time.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.197
In this case, AdMob decided
a video ad would probably

00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:29.780
monetize best.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.980
Let's look at another example,
where we take advantage

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.199
of the IAP business model.

00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:40.740
So we have this feature in AdMob
called In-app purchase house

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.239
ads.

00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:45.220
And the idea here is, these
will help you promote your IAP

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.080
items to those users who are
actually going to purchase.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.260
And generally, when
I talk to developers,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.110
these users are precious.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:56.400
And what I hear is,
whatever you do,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.730
make sure that you
build the best ring

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.370
fence you can around
my purchasers--

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.269
don't ever show them an ad,
only show them in-app purchases.

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:05.560
Sure, for everybody else,
you can do whatever you want,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.420
but please don't muck
with these purchasers.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.430
So this is what AdMob does
automatically on your behalf.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:17.360
We're able to figure
out who the buyers are.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.300
You heard [? Sumnder ?]
on stage--

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.930
we have incredible computer
scientists, massive sets

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:26.440
of machines, of computers,
and some of the best machine

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.630
learning systems in the world.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:32.980
We're employing these to help
us predict those users that we

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.060
believe are likely to be
purchasers, both aggregately

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.830
and inside your app.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.350
And we can wall
those off for you,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.550
and we can make sure that
those users that we think

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.910
are bound to purchase
in your app only see

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.240
your IAP promotions.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.000
And for everybody else,
we're happy to help

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.210
you show them ads.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.810
The right ads at
the right time that

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:57.080
are going to monetize
best for those users.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.930
This is one of these
hybrid business models

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.060
that we've talked about.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.560
You're no longer just doing
IAP, you're no longer just doing

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.094
ads, but now you're doing a
hybrid of the two of them.

00:25:05.094 --> 00:25:06.510
And when we started
running trials

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.630
with some of our partners
earlier this year,

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.109
the results that we saw
were quite stunning.

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:13.400
This is an example that's
going to walk you through one

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.590
of those sets of results.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.720
This is with LunaSoft, who
is a developer down in Korea.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.560
Now, these numbers
aren't the exact numbers,

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.580
but they were benchmarked
against those numbers

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.290
to represent the
uplift that we saw.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.200
In the initial experiment,
they ran for six days,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.700
and they just used their
traditional IAP business model.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:37.800
They showed 145,000 impressions
to all of their users.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.830
But remember, only a
small slice of those users

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.637
will actually engage
with these purchases.

00:25:42.637 --> 00:25:45.220
So what that means is that your
monetization rate in aggregate

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.803
isn't that good, but they still
netted with the slightly north

00:25:47.803 --> 00:25:50.130
of $100.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.640
Their second
go-through here, they

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.520
took advantage of our
[? IP ?] house ads product.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.430
And what they saw is that we
winnowed down those IAP offer

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.810
walls to the 6,000 users
that we expected to purchase.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:09.930
And as a result, they made just
about $24 CPM on those users.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.415
And that's cool, but that's
roughly the same rate

00:26:12.415 --> 00:26:13.790
that they made in
the first case.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.850
What excites me, my team, and
everybody I talk to about this,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:22.160
is we have now freed up
139,000 impressions for folks

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.480
who weren't going to
engage in the first place,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.460
and we can do all kinds
of other great things

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.870
with this, like show them ads.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.460
And that's what LunaSoft did.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.827
And as a result, they
made even more money

00:26:33.827 --> 00:26:35.410
from these hybridized
business models,

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:40.090
while still protecting
those in-app purchase users.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.120
Analytics has been the
key to really enabling

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.130
these kinds of use cases.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.980
And this is why AdMob and Google
Analytics have been partnered

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.880
at the hip for the better
part, oh I don't know,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.060
Russ-- the last two
and half, three years.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.750
It's one of things
that I'm proudest of,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.310
is this really strong,
tight connection

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.740
that these two teams have built.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.020
And anybody out there
who's using AdMob

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.160
should understand
that underneath AdMob

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.390
is the full fledged version of
Google App Analytics-- it's not

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.150
just like a thin shim.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:17.590
You really get this package with
both of them fully integrated.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.650
Which enables things like
custom audience targeting.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.320
Because once you have app
data flowing through AdMob,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.710
we can open up a whole
slew of new opportunities.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.570
You can take action on your own
data based on your own insights

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.872
and the things that you know.

00:27:29.872 --> 00:27:32.230
And this begins with
a new tool that we

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.160
call audience builder,
which enables you to segment

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.120
users based on their behavior.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.900
For example, the one
that I have behind me

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.090
segments between
those casual users,

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.750
and those highly engaged users.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.410
Because often, we see
that app developers

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.130
want to do different things for
these different types of users.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.630
Another great
example that I hear

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.190
is for users who are
brand new to an app,

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.440
maybe for the first
week or two weeks, let's

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.612
cut back on monetization,
we can ratchet it up

00:28:01.612 --> 00:28:03.570
a little bit after they've
gotten fully engaged

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.306
in the game.

00:28:04.306 --> 00:28:05.680
All of these things
are the kinds

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.900
of things that are possible
with Audience Builder.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.550
Play the video here
for me, if you would.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.740
And this is walking
you through a demo

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.340
of how this works inside AdMob.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.500
So you're going to see
that we select our app,

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.720
we've already
segmented our audience,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.270
and now we can target what to
do with those two segments.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.980
So your casual, non-purchaser
is seeing ads at the top,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.650
and your more engaged
user in a second

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.400
will see an in-app purchase
in just a few minutes.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.100
All of this is
automatic, all of this

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.060
can happen thanks to the
data that you're pulling in,

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.760
the segmentations
that you're using,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.855
and truly the opportunities
here are unlimited.

00:28:50.855 --> 00:28:53.230
We're really excited to see
what you guys are going to do

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.980
with these tools in your hand.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.050
So showing the right
ad at the right time

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.880
is an important part of running
one of these smart businesses.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.400
And I mentioned
mediation earlier,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.410
I want to talk a little
bit more about that now.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.190
We've really invested
in our mediation product

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.410
over the last year,
because we know

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.680
that it is absolutely
critical to you that,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.275
regardless of where you're
based and where your users are,

00:29:17.275 --> 00:29:20.740
that you can get the best ads
and the best demand possible.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.160
So today we mediate lots
of different types of ads

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.720
from banners to videos
to interstitials,

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.750
and we're working hard to
bring rewards-based mediation

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.010
to the AdMob platform in
the back half of this year.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.420
Over the last year, we've
introduced 15 more networks

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.760
to the AdMob mediation
product, bringing us now

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.820
to 40 networks overall in 2015.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.520
And you saw this at I/O-- our
most recent and most exciting

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:54.240
announcement is bringing
Tencent's Network, Tencent GDT,

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.720
to the AdMob platform, to
help all of our partners

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.230
in China monetize even better.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:05.100
So I want to talk a little
bit more about mediation.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.670
And I think most of you
know that mediation is not

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.950
the world's most
optimal ad product.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.470
Ultimately, moving to a
single auction, things

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.280
like advertising exchanges
and real-time bidding,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.010
have actually pooled
all of this demand

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.385
together to run
a single auction.

00:30:21.385 --> 00:30:23.240
That's not how mediation works.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.290
Mediation actually brings me
back to something like 1997,

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.860
with all of these callbacks.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.450
We're going to try
ad network one.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.620
If that doesn't work,
we'll try network two.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.740
If that doesn't-- eventually,
I will find an ad.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.410
The challenge is, if you don't
stack those networks correctly,

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.820
and if you don't change
the stack ranking based

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.440
on locale and user
and everything else,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.780
you're likely not optimized.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.305
And I don't mean change
these networks once a day-- I

00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:49.680
mean, to really
get it optimized,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.250
you're probably changing this
whole stack rank once an hour.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:56.690
And that's simply impossible
for any developer to do.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.170
So we've developed a
technology called Ad Network

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.360
Optimization-- it's available
to all of our AdMob publishers.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.180
And what we do is
that we analyze

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.620
the performance of these
networks over time,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:11.060
so that we can predict, for each
impression, which network will

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.200
perform best given
things like the region

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.140
of the user, the time
of day, the day of week.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.820
And we believe that with
features like Ad Network

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.460
Optimization, we can
optimize mediation

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.460
as much as possible until the
industry eventually shifts

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.070
to things like ad exchanges
and real-time bidding,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.140
sort of integrating
that single auction.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.480
This is an example showing
how we found that right slot.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.280
Lastly, I want to talk
about how we scale.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.480
And at Google, we bring
you truly global demand.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.510
Any AdMob customer has access
to millions of advertisers

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.380
through AdWords.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.020
You also have access to the
DoubleClick ad exchange, which

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.600
brings millions more ads in
through 1,400 certified ad

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.100
networks in over 400 DSPs.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.690
And all of these, as I
was hinting at earlier,

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.420
run in a single,
real-time auction.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.440
And that demand flows
directly into AdMob,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.562
you can use it in the mediation
ad network optimization stacks

00:32:12.562 --> 00:32:13.520
that you saw behind me.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.910
I'm incredibly
excited to announce

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.240
that large partners
around the world

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.970
are understanding what
we're building with AdMob,

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.920
and really latching
onto the demand

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.950
that we're able to provide with
our extremely high fill rates.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.580
And as such, I
couldn't be happier

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.110
to announce that Etermax and
their hit game, Trivia Crack,

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:44.900
has, as of June 1,
I think, going live

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.200
exclusively with AdMob.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.190
It's an incredible,
positive proof point

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.990
that the tools that
we're building in AdMob

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.500
work for all developers of
all scale around the world.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.270
One of the other pieces that
most large developers ask

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.820
us about is reservations
or direct sales.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.600
As you grow up, some
businesses end up

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.160
having their own
sales organization--

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.245
they want to be able
to sell their own ads.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.880
Well, it often doesn't make up
the lion's share of revenue,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.610
it is a nice way to
differentiate your brand.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.330
So our team is working
incredibly hard

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.450
to bring AdMob reservations to
all of our AdMob publishers,

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.320
some of whom are running
a beta with us right now.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.840
We're going to enable you to
run these campaigns, delivered

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.360
based on either clicks
or impression goals,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.730
to paste the campaigns
using some of Google

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.750
and DoubleClick's
world class pacing

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.590
and throttling technology,
ultimately to empower

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.020
all of your sales teams.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.950
We've got more to announce
on this later this year.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.900
We're really, really excited
about how this is shaping up.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.090
Google Web Designer
is a fantastic tool

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.000
that we brought into the display
family about three years ago.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.200
This is an incredible
team who's worked

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.430
on things like Macromedia
Flash in the past,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.270
and they have brought a
fully featured WYSIWYG HTML5

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.100
rich media editing tool
to the desktop, that

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.420
connects beautifully into AdMob
as well as our DoubleClick

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.219
products.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.080
And what you see
here is an example

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.630
of how folks have used
Google Web Designer to create

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:29.590
a rich media HTML5
app install ad,

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.069
and one that could be served
directly from Google's

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.860
reservation system.

00:34:36.571 --> 00:34:39.070
The last thing that we're going
to talk about is simplicity.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.750
Integration becomes
absolutely critical,

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.780
and our launch of native
ads has been incredibly

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.810
successful with many publishers
and app developers adopting

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:53.949
this already.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.790
In fact, you see a great
example behind me--

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.280
our friends at
Atari are utilizing

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.390
AdMob in Roller
Coaster Tycoon 4,

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.250
and they're showing off
these native ads there.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.240
Native ads are
great for developers

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.600
with the sophistication to
take in these various bundles

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.730
of assets and lay
them out in ways

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.690
that make sense for their apps.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.570
It truly makes these
ads experiences

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.790
integrative, native, and flow
within the rest of the app.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.945
But it is a fair amount of work.

00:35:21.945 --> 00:35:24.320
And this is what we're starting
to hear from some of you,

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.081
as we're rolling this out.

00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:27.580
And so we've been
thinking about how

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.788
we can make this even easier.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.480
So we're introducing Native Ads
Express, and this is in beta.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.280
This is a pretty
cool feature, and you

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.310
see it animated behind me.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.360
The idea here is
that we should be

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.830
able to create these
creatives on your behalf,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:50.020
based on the uniqueness of your
app, the stylings of your app,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.770
the colors, the font
choices, et cetera.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:57.630
And we do this very
simply-- all you have to do

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.880
is give us a template.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.980
Upload a CSS file,
and based on that,

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.410
we can render an entire
set of our demand

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.950
in ways that fit
within your app.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.000
And the only thing
you need to do,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.360
if you want to change the look
and feel of those native ads,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.200
is send us a new CSS sheet.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:19.560
And you see it basically
animating here behind me,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.660
so you get a feel
for how easy that is.

00:36:24.445 --> 00:36:25.320
Really proud of this.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.080
So the growth of AdMob
interstitial impressions

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.540
over the last year or
so has been phenomenal.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.687
It has roughly doubled.

00:36:33.687 --> 00:36:36.020
We've seen more and more use
of interstitial impressions

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.030
on the network driving
more and more demand

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.020
to all of our partners.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.436
And again, we
believe that this is

00:36:40.436 --> 00:36:43.002
a great experience for users,
publishers, and advertisers

00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:43.502
alike.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.180
But ultimately, we want to make
sure it is as easy as possible

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.910
to integrate AdMob
into all of your apps,

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.800
so that even if you don't
want to monetize from day one,

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.740
you can monetize
three months later.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.660
And this is why we're
announcing a new feature--

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.420
AdMob in the Android
Developer Studio.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.720
So you'll be able to add AdMob
as an activity in your app,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.300
just by making some simple
selections within Studio.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.750
You can actually
define the type of ads

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.822
that you want to show in
your app, as you see here.

00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:19.780
And then later, once you
have an AdMob account,

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:26.830
you can drop your AdMob
count ID into the dev studio.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:30.530
And when your app is
published, you will show ads,

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:32.060
and you will make money.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:33.161
It is really that simple.

00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:34.910
Certainly you're going
to want to do more,

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:35.970
you're going to want
to customize this,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:37.886
you're going to want to
optimize it over time,

00:37:37.886 --> 00:37:40.570
but certainly think about taking
the initial steps to integrate

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.182
AdMob with all of your apps
before you launch them,

00:37:43.182 --> 00:37:45.390
even if you're not thinking
about monetization today.

00:37:49.503 --> 00:37:52.536
It's incredibly simple.

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.410
And for the game developers
in the audience--

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.900
I think you know this,
but as a quick reminder--

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:00.350
we're already integrated
within Unity and Coco's 2D,

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.309
so that's a great way to
take advantage of AdMob

00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:04.725
from a game developer
perspective.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:14.350
To summarize-- we are incredibly
committed to helping all of you

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:18.245
on Android and iOS not
just build the best apps

00:38:18.245 --> 00:38:23.840
that you can, but build
businesses out of those apps

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.970
in ways that are scalable,
in ways that are global.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.690
By taking advantage
of our tools,

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.390
you're going to be able to
build smart monetization

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.570
opportunities, new
business models that

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.970
will help you differentiate
and stand out from the crowd.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.270
We will provide you
the tools to scale.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:42.700
So if you start
with 100,000 users,

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.630
it will work great if you
grow to 20 million or 100

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.790
million users-- all of this
stuff will continue to scale.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.880
And last, we're trying to
make it as easy as possible.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.170
Because I've been in the
online advertising space

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.930
for probably the better
part of the last 15 years,

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.220
and this stuff is even
complicated to me.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.230
You guys have to
focus on what you

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.620
do best, which is
designing and building

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.140
the very best mobile apps
and mobile games out there.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.260
So we are working
our butts off to make

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.050
ad integration as simple and
painless as possible for all

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.002
of you.

00:39:17.002 --> 00:39:19.460
With that, I'd like to thank
you guys so much for your time

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.540
and enjoy the rest of I/O.
