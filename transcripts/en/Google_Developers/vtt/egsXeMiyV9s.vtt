MIKE DENNY: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.900
And welcome to the
Design Fireside Chat

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.690
at Google I/O 2016.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.850
My name is Mike Denny.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.930
I am a Design Advocate on
the Google Design team.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.720
And today, we
really want to have

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.280
an informal, casual
conversation.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.480
We've gathered five Design
leaders from across Google,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.875
from different disciplines,
different teams.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:28.500
And we really want
to have this session

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.810
be a cross-section of what it
looks like to design at Google,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.350
the processes, how we
think about things,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.810
and really hoping that you
enjoy the conversation.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.302
We've solicited questions
on social media.

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.760
We've come up with
some of our own.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.280
And we're really looking for
that kind of holistic design

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.390
at Google feeling.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.895
So we're going to start
with some introductions.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.520
We're just going to kind of give
each panelist a couple minutes

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.379
to introduce themselves,
their background,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.820
where they came
from before Google,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.110
and what they do at Google.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.272
And then we'll get
into some questions.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.480
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: I'll start.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.385
I'm Nicholas Jitkoff.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.860
I am a sort of
Design and Eng lead

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.150
on the Material Design team.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.440
I actually started out
like out of college

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.220
working for a financial firm
and started writing software

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.160
on the side and parlayed that
into coming here as a software

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.040
engineer, originally.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.440
I've been at Google for
eight or nine years or so but

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.356
have moved over time
from software engineering

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.541
into doing more
of a design role,

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.540
but still working pretty
actively with engineers

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.554
and also with product
and marketing people.

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:46.220
A lot of the work the
Material team does

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.469
tends to span across a lot
of those different efforts.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:49.410
We touch branding.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.770
We touch the products
that are being built.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.850
MARTA REY-BABARRO: Hi, I'm
Marta, the lead researcher

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.070
for CorpEng UX, which
is an internal team that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.240
work on internal websites and
applications for Googlers world

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.930
wide.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.540
I also started my UX
career in finance,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.950
in a bank in Spain at the
beginning of the 2000s, when

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.910
all the companies were going
crazy into having presence

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.420
online.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.620
And we didn't know
what we were doing yet

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.150
at the end of the 90s.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
So I started, and it
became a passion of mine.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.020
And I came to the US
from Spain 13 years ago,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.150
and loving being here.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.440
KEVIN DAME: Hello, I'm Kevin.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.590
And I have been at Google
for 3 and 1/2 years.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.670
I work in YouTube.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.810
And my background is
sort of a combination

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.070
of a few different
mini careers-- part

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.840
engineer, part designer,
part marketer slash MBA.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.630
And all of that sort
of led me to Google.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.500
I worked at IDEO.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.670
That was my last-- the
company I worked at before.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.480
I was there for a very
long time, 11 years.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.150
And when I decided
to join Google,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.360
I was really
curious about trying

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.770
to blend the best of what
I'd learned at IDEO, which,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.332
to me, felt like a great
company to learn at, and then

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:14.790
blend that with Google, which
is another great company that

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.664
does a lot of things.

00:03:15.664 --> 00:03:17.670
And in some ways, the
companies are similar,

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.794
some ways the companies
are a little bit different.

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:21.970
And so what I've been doing
over the last few years

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.640
is I created a group at YouTube
called the Visioning Team which

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.300
is an attempt from me to sort
of blend these different methods

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.765
together to identify areas
for innovation for YouTube

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:40.895
and help teams define a clear
path forward for their product.

00:03:40.895 --> 00:03:41.770
KATHERINE WALKER: Hi.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.510
I'm Katherine.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.650
I work on Google's Brand Studio.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.617
Brand Studio is actually on
the marketing side of Google.

00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:49.200
And we're sort of
in a unique position

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.460
where we work with all different
product teams and marketing

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.520
teams across Google.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.100
So we try to connect the dots.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.770
We are comprised of strategists,
filmmakers, designers,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.580
developers.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.800
And most of our
projects range in size

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.430
from creating new identities
to Chrome extensions

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.030
to even worrying
about packaging tape,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.150
I mean, all sorts of things.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.190
I, originally, my background,
I wanted to be a cartoonist.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.410
So it really wasn't so much
in the technology sphere.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.860
I wanted to do
political cartooning.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.276
But then when I
got to art school,

00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:21.529
I really fell in love with
brand design and typography.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.600
I am obsessed with typography
and systems of brand design,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.060
so with anything
that has like a font

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.385
stint to it, that's
where I like to be.

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:31.010
ALEX COOK: Hey.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.820
So I'm Alex.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.110
And I've worked at Google
for almost 11 years now.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.780
It still feels
like I'm relatively

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.070
new to Google because everything
changes every day there.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.290
I'm really excited to be
working on the Google Assistant.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.260
So I'm a Design Lead
on that project.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.619
And I'm also working on a
bunch of new initiatives

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.660
that we have in and around
Search and Maps, which

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.816
is my home base.

00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:52.940
And one of the things that
I'm really excited about

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.760
is bringing in some
new roles into UX,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.880
such as motion design
and UX Engineering,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.713
which are some things
we've been building up

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:00.697
over the last few years.

00:05:00.697 --> 00:05:01.530
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.404
Thank you, everybody.

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:05.840
So to get started, I
think the first question

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.006
I'd like to have
us talk about is

00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:14.810
more on the process side of
things, how we approach things.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.000
And I think we'll
start with Kevin.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.420
But I think maybe
multiple people

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.860
will be able to weigh
in just because Google's

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.560
a large company, different
teams do things different ways.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.470
How do teams at
Google decide what

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.629
to build before
actually building it?

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.170
KEVIN DAME: Yeah, so I can talk
a little bit about what we're

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.300
doing on the
Visioning team and how

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.860
we're trying to enhance our
process at YouTube to do that.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.270
It's a little daunting, because
when I joined Google and joined

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.260
YouTube, I was
interested in evolving

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.880
our processes to be better.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.210
But you have to come in with
a little bit of humility

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.490
because it's a very,
very successful company.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.865
So you don't want to come in
and say, well, that's wrong.

00:05:52.865 --> 00:05:53.760
What are we doing?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.240
So had to kind of
think about ways

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.370
to address-- but
also at Google, we

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.937
want to-- I think
part of our culture

00:05:59.937 --> 00:06:01.020
is to keep getting better.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.340
So people are very open
to, how can we be better?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.320
So I'll talk about
three things that we

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.830
try to do in the
Visioning team to help.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.020
And again, we're working
on kind of the early stage.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.700
So if you think about product
development, which is designing

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.930
and developing and
building a product,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.980
product vision is kind of the
step before that which is well,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.360
what should we build before
we start going and building?

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.250
How do we figure out what
the right thing to build is?

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.833
We could build 1,000
different things,

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.520
but what's the
right thing to do?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.510
So I'd say that from
a process perspective

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.140
there's a few things
that we're trying

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.370
to do that are a little bit
different maybe than what

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.170
the norm is in
the tech industry.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.370
So the first one is we
try to think about-- some

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.234
of this probably sounds obvious.

00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:45.150
But I think when you're
in the thick of things

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.600
it can be very
difficult to do, which

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.400
is-- what we try to
do is focus on what's

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.380
the ideal product that we
could get to in a couple years.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.577
Not four or five years out
because the tech industry

00:06:54.577 --> 00:06:55.160
changes a lot.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.350
But what's the ideal
experience we can get to.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.850
That's a little bit
different that I

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.440
think may be more of a lean
approach, which the tech

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.080
industry often uses, which
is let's just build something

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.210
as quickly as possible, get
it out there, and then learn.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.942
I think that's still
a great philosophy.

00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:10.900
But we want to put just
a little bit more rigor

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.441
in thinking about
what's the thing we

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.440
want to shoot for before
we put something out there.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.091
Second thing is this
idea of-- and it really

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.590
relates to the first
thing as well--

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.389
which is we want to
feel like we have--

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.680
if we are going to put
something out in the marketplace

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.170
and then learn, we feel like
that's kind of an expensive way

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.100
to learn.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.760
So how can we fail
faster and more often

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.100
internally with rough
prototypes, really quick ways

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.900
to explore many
different things so

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.540
that when we do
converge on something,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.900
probably take a
little bit longer.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.066
But then when we converge
on it, our odds of success

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:42.806
are much higher.

00:07:42.806 --> 00:07:45.430
And the third thing that we try
to do from a process standpoint

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.040
is this idea of Visioning.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.770
You know, I think that
traditionally, sometimes people

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.864
think that it's either like the
leader of the organization who

00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:56.030
creates the vision and then
kind of tells everybody.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.180
Or sometimes people think, well,
that's a product manager's job.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.724
What we try to do is
democratize product vision.

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:03.140
What we try to do
is get everybody

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.114
on the team to participate
in that process

00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:07.030
so that instead of someone
telling them, well,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.180
here's the vision, now
go design against it,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.850
everybody on the
team has participated

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.430
and feel like they own
and buy the vision.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.500
So that's what we try to do on
the Visioning team at YouTube.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.905
MIKE DENNY: I'm wondering,
Marta, maybe you

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:22.975
could chime in on
design sprints.

00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:24.350
MARTA REY-BABARRO:
Yeah, totally.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.630
So I arrived to Google
around three years ago.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.750
CorpEng UX was a very tiny team.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.330
We were only four
people in the team.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.230
And we were redesigning a very
big product, internal product,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.850
which is the Performance
Evaluation tool.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.580
The deadlines were crazy.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.230
And there was no time for
design, no time for research.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.620
And at the time, we had a ton
of meetings, ton of meetings,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.090
half decisions were
made here, then

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.470
another decision was
made in another meeting.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.290
So it was a very
difficult process.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.100
So one of the things
that I thought was,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.060
why don't we bring
everyone to a room,

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.260
and we make the decisions
that we need to make?

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.910
Let's clear our
agendas for five days.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.750
And let's give everyone a
voice, engineering-- whoops,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.280
and it did fall.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:15.780
OK.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.030
MIKE DENNY: We can
still hear you.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.600
MARTA REY-BABARRO:
You can still hear me?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.890
OK, great.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.640
So let's give
Engineering a voice.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.560
There are a lot of engineering
constraints around these tools.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.680
We are migrating from
old code to a new code,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.010
so what are the
constraints that we have?

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.240
That designers, as well.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.670
We had a ton of research done.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.020
We had business needs.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.450
So let's give everyone
in the room a voice.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.810
And once we all know what
is the space in which we

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.220
are designing, then
let's make decisions.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.270
And it was a gigantic success.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.320
So from a team of
people in which we

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.790
had a very tight deadline,
we were working crazy hours,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.750
to a process that ended up
being much more organized,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.300
where features ended up being
built within only five days.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.330
And everyone was more
in the same page.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.750
So after that, design
sprinting became a thing--

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.750
like one of the ways,
one of the processes

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.880
that we have internally
to re-design tools,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.960
come up with new tools, come
up with visions for tools,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.850
think about completely new tools
that don't exist right now.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.720
And it all starts by
understanding the space

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.771
from everyone's point of view.

00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:27.520
And it's exciting.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.410
It's a very exciting
way of working.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.180
Because everyone
feels very energized.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.670
People don't feel that they
are in just like one space,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.910
either designing or coding.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.457
But everyone is in the same
room, making these decisions.

00:10:39.457 --> 00:10:40.290
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.450
Awesome.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:47.745
So anyone jump into this.

00:10:47.745 --> 00:10:49.940
This is a broad question
that probably we all

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.760
have an experience with.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.790
What defines a good
relationship between you

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.860
as a designer and
another discipline?

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.402
I know that we're
all kind of cross--

00:11:01.402 --> 00:11:03.276
There's a lot of
disciplines represented here

00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:04.120
in our backgrounds.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.870
We're all doing design-y
stuff now, right?

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:12.020
So How do you approach that
kind of work flow collaboration

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.710
between someone who might
not understand your skill

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.952
set, and you might
not understand theirs?

00:11:17.952 --> 00:11:20.160
ALEX COOK: I think it's a
combination of conversation

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.760
and mutual respect.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.040
So the end of the day, everybody
wants to do the same thing.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.690
We want to ship
something really great.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.290
We want to get that
out to our users.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.873
And we want the
feature or the product

00:11:29.873 --> 00:11:31.950
that we're working on
to be really successful.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.408
The difference
comes down to people

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:35.630
have differences of opinion
of what that should be,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.230
and how you should get there.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.770
And so you solve those
through conversation.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.350
And having a closer loop
between Design and Engineering

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.040
makes it possible
to work out things

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.692
as they arise on the fly, and
to have the conversations.

00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:48.900
Oh, we can't do this, what
can we do as an alternate?

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.850
Or, hey, I thought of this idea.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.080
Maybe Eng's bringing
about some design ideas.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.746
They should be part
of the conversation,

00:11:54.746 --> 00:11:57.180
too, because in the end,
they're responsible for the user

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.309
experience of the
product as well.

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:01.100
And the mutual respect
thing comes down to,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.649
at the end of the day,
designers have to do design

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:05.190
and engineers have
to do engineering.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.606
So at some point,
you have to say,

00:12:06.606 --> 00:12:10.009
you know what, I trust this
person to do what they do.

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:11.550
I know they're making
good decisions.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.091
And I'm going to
let them run with it

00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.585
and empower them to make the
decisions they need to make.

00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:17.210
KATHERINE WALKER:
I'm with you on that.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.890
Trust is huge.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.780
And I ask a million questions.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.560
I work with engineers on a
lot of the brand identities

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.150
that we do.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.420
And I, frankly, I don't know
how they do what they do.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.582
So I ask all the time.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.040
And I've kind of
explained to them,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.670
since [INAUDIBLE] had this
waterfall approach, where I'll

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.090
say, OK, move the
design, make it

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.020
look like that, with no context,
when you're not giving context

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.560
to the decisions you
make, you kind of feel

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.460
like you're at odds.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.310
But one thing that's
really been useful,

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.850
especially with collaborations
with other disciplines,

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.300
is that everyone is at the
table at the very beginning

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.390
of the project.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.020
So we all know what
the common goal is.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.650
We all know what the
user expectation is.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.524
And we all know what
success might look like,

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.440
and what the expectations
for the project are.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.550
I think that when not
everyone's in the room

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.440
to hear when things kick
off or get the entire brief,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.977
it's much harder for everyone
to be on the same page.

00:13:07.977 --> 00:13:08.810
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:09.020
Yeah.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.810
I mean, with both
of those questions,

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.760
we've been talking about
kind of getting people

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.030
from all the different
disciplines together--

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.940
the decision makers, the
designers, the developers--

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.072
in the same room before you
invest in actual product

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:24.030
design and development.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.850
What's the best way to get
engineers and decision makers

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.570
involved early on in the
design process-- in particular,

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.590
with research, with things
that we do as designers

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.690
at the early stages.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.181
How can we better involve
engineers in that process?

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.260
ALEX COOK: Scotch tape.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.540
Scotch tape is the answer.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.400
KEVIN DAME: I was
going to answer.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.066
And then I was like
well, I'm not ready.

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:55.820
So hopefully he'll lengthen the
question a little bit longer

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.790
so I'll be ready.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.150
I do have a thought on that.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.124
Because I think
that's-- First of all,

00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:02.540
I want to underscore this idea
of getting people in a room

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.630
together for maybe a
day or two to work.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.250
It sounds, again, so basic.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.580
But when I joined Google, what
I noticed-- and this is probably

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.030
true of most of tech
world and even corporate

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.820
America-- is people actually
don't get a lot of time

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.750
together to actually
collaborate.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.000
They'll have a status meeting.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.200
But there's a lot of
these tiny little shards

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.780
of communication and comments
in docs and email threads.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.805
And it's just,
there's so much power

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:29.180
in just this basic concept of
getting people in the room,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.240
getting the right
people in the room.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.910
But one thing that we do
to get people involved.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.970
So in our Visioning
projects, like I said,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.230
we want this to be a
democratic process.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.220
One of the things
that is required

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.540
to do that is
actually to rethink

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.310
the relationships a little
bit that we talked about just

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.370
a minute ago, which is that for
most of product development,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.555
it makes sense to
have researchers

00:14:51.555 --> 00:14:53.430
who have spent their
whole career-- they have

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.960
a Ph.D in research--
and engineers

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.380
who are good at engineering
to have that specialization.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.900
But in the Visioning
process, we actually

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.590
take a very different
approach, which is

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.500
take your functional hat off.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.917
Because now, at
the very beginning

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:05.500
of this Visioning
project, we're going

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.840
to go learn about our user.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.610
So you're all researchers today.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:14.042
In my first year at Google,
I sent 15 people out

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:15.750
to different schools
around the Bay Area.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.870
Because we were looking at the
classroom, the whole education

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.504
area.

00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:21.170
And I told them,
you're all researchers.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.850
And they were, what?

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.490
I've never been a
researcher before.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.670
Where's my discussion guide?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.230
What do I do?

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.340
I don't have a Ph.D.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.400
It's basically like look,
you can go to a school.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.441
And you can have a
conversation with the teacher.

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:32.415
And you can be curious
and listen and just

00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:34.470
be curious about what
it's like to be a teacher.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.220
And so the philosophy
is like today,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.750
we're all going to
be a researcher.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.499
Tomorrow, we're all
going to be designers.

00:15:39.499 --> 00:15:40.670
We're going to create ideas.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.770
Now we're going
to bring users in.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.490
We're all going to be
researchers, again.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.960
So the way we get involvement
is to kind of take

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.890
the functional hats
on and really back up

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.460
the words, which is no, we
really want you to be involved.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.960
Here's your notebook, you're
going to go learn about a user.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.220
We're relying on you to
come back with good insight.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.526
So that's how we do it
on the Visioning team.

00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:00.470
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.760
To build on that,
Marta, how do we

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.305
select-- how do you
choose the right people?

00:16:06.305 --> 00:16:08.680
I mean, you don't want it to
be too big of a team, right?

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.010
How do you pick the
right people from all

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.520
these different disciplines?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.895
MARTA REY-BABARRO:
It's so funny.

00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:14.700
When I teach the
Academy with Kai,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.720
who's another co-founder
of the Design Sprint

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.860
Academy at Google, we tell
people a good number of people

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.080
is between like five
and eight people.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.810
Like a very small team you
can work together five days,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.790
very, very focused.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.010
So that's what I teach.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.960
The reality, now, in CorpEng
is that the last sprint, I

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.290
had 31 people.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.980
And I started that
meeting saying,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.490
you guys, I know
everyone likes sprinting.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.350
We need to be talking, everyone.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.650
And they started adding
people, this director

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.580
and that director.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.210
And then at the end, we
couldn't cut a single person.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.805
So we ended up
making it happen--

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:54.940
a very, very successful sprint
with 30 people sprinting

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.910
at the same time,
communicating with each other

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.550
during several
moments of the day.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.040
So that was quite fun.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.500
So I would say, ideally,
between five and eight people,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.210
have the right
people in the room,

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.670
the people that are
decision makers.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:13.619
So you definitely need
Engineering there.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.800
You definitely need Design.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.440
You need UX there.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.130
You need the user.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.750
Being in a room, thinking
about how something

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.550
could be for a user and not
getting that user input,

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.329
it's a beautiful exercise
that it might not work.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.330
So having that, and
then also having

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.406
the business perspective.

00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:33.530
There is a lot of knowledge
about the space, right?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.340
If we're designing a
new product that it's

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.450
going to be launching in two
years, what's our competition?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.580
What is the landscape?

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.736
So all that knowledge
needs to be in that room.

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:44.610
And the right people.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.818
And then the decision makers.

00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:48.630
So it's a very good idea
to invite directors or VPs

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.650
to kick off that sprint or
come to the last presentation

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.660
or participate.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.500
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.790
Yeah.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.690
Yeah, definitely.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.326
I mean, you've mentioned a
couple times kind of this--

00:17:58.326 --> 00:17:59.450
you've mentioned five days.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.950
You mentioned a specific
range, five to eight people.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.137
But at the end of the day,
these design processes

00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:06.970
need to be flexible.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:07.950
MARTA REY-BABARRO: Yeah.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.380
MIKE DENNY: And you mentioned
Kai Haley, actually,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.921
another designer at Google who
works a lot on design sprints.

00:18:11.921 --> 00:18:13.970
And she gave a talk
earlier at Google I/O

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.210
about using this
design sprint approach,

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.400
and being able to
feel comfortable

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.290
being flexible with that.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.450
So if you didn't
get that session,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.750
check it out on YouTube.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:32.070
And we want to shift
gears, now, into kind

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.852
of beyond the initial process
and into actual, collaborative

00:18:35.852 --> 00:18:36.810
design and development.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.420
And maybe Nicholas, you
can take this first.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.730
How do you handle large scale?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:50.220
I mean Google is a fairly large
company with some big ideas

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.360
and some big projects.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.290
How do you handle these
large scale design or brand

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.190
deployments things?

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.000
I mean, lots of new
announcements, recently

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.400
did a big logo redesign,
the Assistant, right?

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.900
NICHOLAS JITKOFF:
A lot of the stuff

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.180
that-- the small problems that
you sort of face within a team,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.887
you see in larger form across
a larger company-- trying

00:19:11.887 --> 00:19:13.970
to get sort of tight
iteration loops between teams

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.553
becomes a challenge
rather than trying

00:19:15.553 --> 00:19:18.210
to get it between just
design and engineering.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.460
In many cases, for things
like logo redesigns

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.020
or anything where it's going
to touch multiple products,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.840
you need feedback
from those products.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.780
The material system,
a lot of it was

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.980
developed with the G-mail
team or the Calendar

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.610
team of the Search team.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.244
We took time to visit
concepts with them,

00:19:35.244 --> 00:19:37.160
iterate on them with
them, and then bring them

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:43.390
back together into sort of a
coherent documented system.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.220
And trying to establish the
relationships between teams

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.320
that don't really speak
to each other frequently

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.720
is sort of the larger challenge.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.470
But once those are
sort of up and running,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.750
you get that same sort
of camaraderie and drive

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.026
towards a common goal.

00:19:56.026 --> 00:19:57.900
Like Alex and I worked
together a fair amount

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.596
on the branding stuff
as we were-- him

00:20:00.596 --> 00:20:02.720
from the Search side and
me from the Material side.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.420
And it's really just
sort of passing back,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.628
like what is the problem
that you're trying to solve?

00:20:06.628 --> 00:20:10.260
How can we adjust the solution
to be appropriate for it?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.219
And what else is not even
being considered yet?

00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:12.884
ALEX COOK: Yeah.

00:20:12.884 --> 00:20:15.510
I think one of the interesting
things about Google-- I mean,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.920
maybe all of the industry,
now-- is that everyone

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.200
is designing at scale.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.310
So when you think
about the impact

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.500
of like the sheer numbers
of usage that Google has.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.710
But also when we think about
Search and what's that like,

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.640
we can't just think
about one search query.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.430
OK, what happens when someone
searches for Barack Obama.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.130
So even something
like the logo change,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.880
we really have to test that
with just tons and tons

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.070
of different queries,
put in different contexts

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.570
to make sure that
it's going to work

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.190
across all the
different situations

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.520
that we need it to do.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.460
And that makes the design
much more iterative.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.220
Because you start out
with some good ideas,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.460
you mock a couple of them up.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.043
You start finding
more and more places

00:20:49.043 --> 00:20:52.120
that you need to stitch up
the design or fix it up later.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.325
And that leads to the
conversation with Engineering

00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:56.670
or and sometimes
changes downstream.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.227
But the conversation
always helps.

00:20:59.227 --> 00:21:00.060
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.566
And kind of on that topic
of branding, Katherine,

00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:06.270
how would you describe
your team, Brand Studio,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.460
within Google?

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.980
What do you guys do and how do
you approach branding products?

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.330
KATHERINE WALKER: Yeah.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.999
Well, we do a lot of things.

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:16.540
But I think one thing that we
think about a lot with branding

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.950
is how different it's
become nowadays, especially

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.150
in the digital era.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.450
Branding used to be, here
is your big tome, bible book

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.990
of brand guidelines.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.080
And the brand is telling
the user how to react to it.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.180
And now, it's very different
where people actually adapt.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.292
Or brands actually
adapt to people.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.000
We're kind of in an
interesting tech time

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.367
where we know behaviors
and what people want

00:21:37.367 --> 00:21:38.450
and what they want to see.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.310
And I think what's important
is that the brand is

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:48.580
very much like a fluid thing
and very much nimble to where--

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.190
I'm thinking of a
really good example

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.187
I've seen recently is I saw
this Norwegian brand design--

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:55.520
and, again, I'm going to get
a little nerdy here-- where

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.120
it was for a shipping company.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.830
And the logo itself would
always evolve depending

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.385
on temperature or
wind that was around

00:22:03.385 --> 00:22:04.670
in that particular space.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.461
I thought that was just
really, really cool

00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:10.560
that the brand could adapt to
surroundings outside of it.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.259
But I think that it's important
that brands do evolve.

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:15.300
And then Netflix is a
great example of that, too.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.360
It used to be DVDs in the mail.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.450
And because of user triggers
that they're saying now

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.000
they stream.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.083
They're doing really well.

00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:24.712
And HBO's offering a
streaming now, too, for free

00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:26.170
so we could be all
be cord cutters.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.980
And I think it's
just really important

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.350
that you understand that
users are so much more

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.660
influence on brands now.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.145
That's how we have to think.

00:22:35.145 --> 00:22:37.270
MIKE DENNY: I already know
the answer to this but--

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.530
KATHERINE WALKER: Yeah.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.238
MIKE DENNY: --it would
be fun to discuss.

00:22:39.238 --> 00:22:42.320
So how did that kind of--
the evolution of the world

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.880
and users, the population of the
world, all of Google's users--

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.850
how did the world
changing influence

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:57.982
our recent Google,
company-wide rebrand.

00:22:57.982 --> 00:23:00.440
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: So I think
a lot of the different mediums

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.770
that we expect people to
see things in, like the move

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.430
to mobile or needing to
be able handle things

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.340
like watches and
TVs, that was largely

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.420
what led to the brand redesign.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.930
Also, just sort of the need to
be able to adapt to context.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.010
I think that Search,
as you move to mobile,

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.670
becomes something more around
like what is around me?

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.600
What is relevant right now?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.940
And being able to indicate
sort of the state of that,

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.148
being able to modify your
brand based on temperature,

00:23:26.148 --> 00:23:29.680
other things, to show sort
of relevancy and relatedness

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.610
to the current situation.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.280
You need a slightly more
flexible approach in order

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.021
to handle that and
even handle things

00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:39.520
you haven't considered yet that
will come up over the coming

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.350
years.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.090
The new system is an
evolution of the brand stuff

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.250
that was done a year ago.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.790
And it's building
upon it and adding

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.544
more character that's unique
to that specific use case.

00:23:49.544 --> 00:23:50.210
ALEX COOK: Yeah.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.400
I think in this day
and age, we have

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.030
to think of brand
as an experience.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.040
It's not just a mark.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.250
It's not a set of guidelines.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.580
It's the feeling that users
get when they experience

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.270
your brand, your products.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.150
And with the
Assistant, we're trying

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.011
to take Google from being
this destination, Google.com,

00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.510
or this app on your
phone and really

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.690
bring it to all the other
places that you need

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.190
and find information
in your life

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:11.606
so that it can be that constant
experience that's with you

00:24:11.606 --> 00:24:12.737
all the time.

00:24:12.737 --> 00:24:13.570
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.070
Yeah.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:19.080
I mean, we've talked a lot
about how we don't necessarily

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.498
want to be bound by, you use
the word "tome" of guidelines,

00:24:22.498 --> 00:24:22.998
right?

00:24:22.998 --> 00:24:24.275
KATHERINE WALKER: Yeah.

00:24:24.275 --> 00:24:25.650
MIKE DENNY: And
at the same time,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.210
we've developed material design.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.830
I want to preface by saying that
the goal with material design

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.660
was to create a
cross-platform design system,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.960
not just for Google,
but for everybody.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.370
But I think a lot of
developers and designers,

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.880
they feel still in that kind
of old mentality of they

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.160
feel bound by this large set of
recommendations and guidelines.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.770
So how do designers
and developers

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.790
make the best use
of material design

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.314
without feeling
restricted by it?

00:25:02.314 --> 00:25:03.980
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: I
think the main thing

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.340
is to approach it as
a foundational set

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.140
of recommendations.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.029
If you are starting out,
and you don't really

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:12.320
have a good sense of how
things are going to build out,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.060
it's a pretty good structure
to start looking at stuff.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.080
It's critical, though,
that you don't become so

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.700
tied down by those
recommendations

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.080
that you lose all character.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.950
This falls in the brand
as well-- making sure

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.340
that the applications that
you are designing or building

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.830
reflect the character of
your company, the thing

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.010
that you're trying
to convey to users,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:37.860
and ensuring that it doesn't
become so simple or so focused

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.660
on just the content in it that
it's not identifiable and not

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.710
unique.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.210
Things like the FAB that we
identified for material design,

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.872
they're intended
to make people ask

00:25:49.872 --> 00:25:51.580
the right kind of
questions, like what is

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.871
the purpose of the application?

00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:54.480
What do I want to
focus people on?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.313
It doesn't mean that
the incarnation of that

00:25:56.313 --> 00:25:59.850
has to be a red circle
with a white icon on it.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:00.770
It can take any form.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.145
It's really just
sort of a desire

00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:05.350
to have focus and move towards
the right kind of patterns.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.230
So for material, looking
at sort of the broader

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.550
set of guidelines as
this is a starting point.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.925
What you're really
supposed to do

00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:15.660
is take this and build something
that's unique and appropriate

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.510
for your product and that makes
your product really stand out.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.974
KEVIN DAME: I
think we're kind of

00:26:20.974 --> 00:26:23.140
going through that a little
bit even within YouTube.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:27.065
Because we have a number of
apps within YouTube, now.

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:27.940
We have our main app.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.130
We have a kid's app.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.200
We have a gaming app.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.040
We have a music app.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.154
And since we started to launch
these apps in the last year,

00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:37.320
there have been a lot of
questions about consistency

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.820
across the apps.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.600
Do we have too much
inconsistency across the apps?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.790
How much consistency
do we want to have?

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.740
And it's a tough one.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.940
On the one hand, it
should feel like it's

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.898
coming from-- they should
all feel like they're

00:26:47.898 --> 00:26:48.810
coming from YouTube.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.250
But there's a reason why
we made separate apps.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:54.540
There's a reason why we
had the brilliant insight

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.840
that a three-year-old
might be different

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.030
than a 27-year-old gamer.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.530
But that's the real
trick is like it

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.970
pushes us to think
really hard about how

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.020
are these apps different?

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.103
And how are they the same?

00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:07.800
And it's an ongoing
conversation I

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.840
think we're going to have as
these apps evolve over time.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.290
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.110
Yeah.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.440
I agree 100%.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.790
So there's kind of an internal
debate in the design community

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.640
about whether or not designers
should learn to code.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.310
And I know we have a mixed group
up here with some of us have

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:34.600
engineering background,
some of us don't.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.470
In my experience,
understanding at least

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.930
the technical feasibility helps
inform the design quite a bit.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.700
And I know that
designers out there would

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.620
love to have that benefit.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.840
Is there an easy way
to get that benefit

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.550
without necessarily going and
getting a computer science

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:53.140
degree?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.960
KATHERINE WALKER: I'm staring
at my creative engineer

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.474
in the crowd right now.

00:27:58.474 --> 00:27:59.890
He's looking at
me, he's like, I'm

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:02.030
ready for you to answer this.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.970
I don't code.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.280
But I sit next to
it every single day.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.190
And I understand
what's possible.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.730
And I think that that's
what's important.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.520
I think the most fun
part of being-- I

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.770
was recently a print designer.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.936
And what's coming to Google
and testing these things

00:28:16.936 --> 00:28:20.180
in a digital way is sitting next
to a developer, asking them,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.940
is it possible to do this?

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.667
And they're like,
absolutely not.

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.500
But then they come back
to you an hour later

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.010
and they're like, well
yeah, it's possible

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.218
if we look at it this way
and it's done in this term.

00:28:29.218 --> 00:28:33.030
So all of my work has gotten
exponentially better sitting

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.850
next to a creative technologist.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.097
So for me, they're
going to know it better

00:28:39.097 --> 00:28:40.180
than I'm going to know it.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.130
I'm always going to be
an expert at the design.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.340
I let them be an expert at dev.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.423
But if you understand it,
you have a great working

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:48.660
relationship, then I
think that that is just as

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.335
useful as being great at both.

00:28:51.335 --> 00:28:54.250
MIKE DENNY: Post-collaboration,
learning through osmosis.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.950
KATHERINE WALKER: Exactly.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.340
MIKE DENNY: Anyone else?

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.380
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: The
other thing is not-- well,

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.796
having a sense of
what's possible,

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:02.620
both from the engineering
and design side.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.220
And either doing that
by having knowledge

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.795
of the other discipline or just
by working closely is great.

00:29:07.795 --> 00:29:10.170
The other thing is just, for
both design and engineering,

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.260
the ability to convey an idea.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.440
For designers to convey
an idea, sometimes that

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.116
shows up as being able to code,
sometimes it's motion design.

00:29:18.116 --> 00:29:19.490
A lot of it's
about storytelling.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.031
The same thing's
true of engineering.

00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:24.162
Like prototypes often are one
of the most convincing things

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:26.620
that we can use in a discussion
because people can actually

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.210
evaluate stuff
versus just guessing

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.810
about how it will work.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.864
So people on any side
in any discipline

00:29:34.864 --> 00:29:37.030
by thinking about how best
to tell the story of this

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.675
or how best to
convey the idea, you

00:29:39.675 --> 00:29:41.400
end up being far more effective.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.000
And often that's
done in collaboration

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.860
with others and by fusing sort
of those different talents

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.930
of design engineering.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.570
ALEX COOK: We use prototyping
for storytelling all the time

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.670
on Search and Maps.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.210
Pretty much every one
of our last big releases

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.055
has been prototyped
in some form,

00:29:55.055 --> 00:29:57.180
and that's what gets
presented to the stakeholders,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.540
the VPs when they make
the design decisions.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.120
When we made a
decision on the logo,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.450
we brought in prototypes
that my team made to the SVP

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.884
and was like, this is what
Search is going to look like.

00:30:06.884 --> 00:30:08.550
And he played with
it for a few minutes.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.680
And said, OK, this
is the search I want.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.225
Let's do it.

00:30:11.225 --> 00:30:13.350
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: One point
about prototyping, too,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.630
is that in many cases,
you cannot make a decision

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.800
by looking at fake data.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.300
The work we did
on Chrome History,

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.960
like any time we did a
design for Chrome History,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.220
if you showed it to
somebody and it was just

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.761
sort of a random set of links
that they've never even thought

00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:27.790
of, it's not useful.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.800
You can't evaluate it.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.500
If you see your own data
presented in any way

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.850
and you can evaluate
those designs,

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.087
you make a better decision.

KEVIN DAME: Oh, go ahead.

00:30:37.592 --> 00:30:37.892
MARTA REY BABARRO: No, no, no.

Go.

I've been talking.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.190
MARTA REY-BABARRO: No, you made
me think of a very cool story.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.680
I love working very, very
closely with engineering

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.490
all the time, daily.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:51.600
I don't code.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.250
I don't know how I got an A
in Java in my master's degree.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.552
I loved it but I
couldn't believe it

00:30:58.552 --> 00:31:00.010
that I ended up
getting that grade.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:04.783
Like the most undeserved grade
in the history of a Java class,

00:31:04.783 --> 00:31:05.770
ever.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.430
Anyway, I remember at one time
we had these great findings

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.460
around how HRBS, who
are HR here at Google,

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.360
were using this tools that
we use internally, right?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.740
And I had this very great
insight about a tool

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:27.170
that we could do that would
improve their lives by a ton.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.950
So I remember explaining that
after getting these results

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.630
from several testing of
surveying several HRBPs and so

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:35.440
on.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.450
So it was great.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.770
And then we were going
to go-- like the business

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.590
side was going to take
it, present it all up

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.000
the chain in HR.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.290
It was going to be this
like several weeks process

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.500
until, yes, we can do it.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.450
And Brendan, who was
one of the developers,

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.920
was in this meeting.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.670
So after the meeting
he's like, hey Marta,

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.127
what are you doing later?

00:31:55.127 --> 00:31:56.710
And I'm like, I'm
going to be working.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.010
He's like, just come to my
desk and tell me what to do.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.110
Let's do it.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.320
And I'm like, serious?

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.360
He's like, let's just build it.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.200
And we did.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.220
And it was amazing.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.910
Because I was like
sitting with him.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.410
We were looking at the
UI, making the changes.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.720
And then we just
showed it to everyone.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.730
And they were blown away.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.464
Like it wasn't like these like
series of several meetings

00:32:18.464 --> 00:32:20.130
and let's see if it
works or it doesn't.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.950
Like we had it there.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.280
We presented it to the HRBPs.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.460
They loved it.

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.230
They adopted it.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.130
I got to do more research,
which is what I love doing.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.830
And it's one of the features
that we have right now

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.440
in one of our internal tools.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.860
So stories like that happen.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.280
I encourage you to sit
with your designer,

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.371
sit with your researcher
and make things happen.

00:32:42.371 --> 00:32:43.870
KEVIN DAME: Can I
take your question

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.362
and steer it in a slightly
different direction?

00:32:46.362 --> 00:32:47.070
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.120
KEVIN DAME: OK.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.960
I think this question
of should you--

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.251
if I were to change the
question a little-- like if you

00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:54.290
are x should you also do y.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.580
And at least on
the Visioning team,

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.780
the folks that
I've tried to hire

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:03.990
are people who you might
call hybrid type Googlers who

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.410
have a combination of a little
bit of a researcher in them

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.570
and a little bit of
a designer in them.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.111
And it's funny
because a lot of times

00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:13.940
when they join the company
people will say, hi, I'm Joe.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.650
What are you, a designer?

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.150
No.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.990
Oh, are you researcher?

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.490
No.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.270
And the answer often is both.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.300
And the reason why I
think it kind of relates

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:26.392
to your question is I
think there's power in--

00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:28.850
I don't know if you've heard
of the term "T-shaped" people?

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.225
It's kind of a concept that's
been out there for a while.

00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:32.892
But the concept of
a T-shaped person

00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:34.350
is that they have
an area of depth,

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.000
so they're an engineer,
of they're a designer,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.960
they're a researcher.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.950
And then this T is
meant to represent

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:42.880
sort of a breadth of knowledge
or interest in other areas.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.820
So for example maybe
you're a designer by trade,

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.190
but you have a little
bit of an appreciation

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:50.642
or a knowledge of
the business side.

00:33:50.642 --> 00:33:52.600
Or you have a little bit
of a researcher in you

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.064
or you like to code.

00:33:54.064 --> 00:33:55.980
I feel like, especially
in the Visioning team,

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.146
we look for T-shaped people.

00:33:57.146 --> 00:33:59.777
But I feel like in general,
it's really healthy and good

00:33:59.777 --> 00:34:02.110
to have some secondary things
that you're interested in.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.610
Because I think it makes you
a little bit more versatile.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.401
I think it allows you
to collaborate better

00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:08.590
with other people, gives
you more perspectives

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.326
to work with at your job.

00:34:10.326 --> 00:34:11.159
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:12.239
Yeah.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.965
One common theme that
has been coming out

00:34:14.965 --> 00:34:16.989
in multiple questions
in this discussion

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.770
has been the importance
of collaboration

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.520
between these disciplines,
sitting down--

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.080
designer, engineer, researcher,
designer, researcher,

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:30.739
engineer-- and spending
that time together.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.870
At the same time,
though, everybody has--

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.820
or I mean, even
on bigger, larger

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.552
cross-organization efforts,
like having lots of meetings

00:34:39.552 --> 00:34:41.260
to make sure everyone's
on the same page,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.270
and establishing that
working relationship,

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.969
and then actually having the
meetings to facilitate and kind

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:49.409
of maintain that relationship.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.719
How do you strike a good
balance between what's

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:57.030
on your own plate, personally,
and this collaboration, which

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.400
we all agree is very important?

00:35:01.694 --> 00:35:02.860
A brave person can go first.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.235
MARTA REY BABARRO:
I can take it.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.000
So I'm a researcher by trade.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.260
There are, well, many
schools of thought.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.180
But a couple of
schools of thought

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.390
in the research community.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.270
One is, we are researchers.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.660
We have the knowledge of
speaking with the user,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.380
making sense of all these data.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.340
This is a skill that you don't
learn within a day or a month.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.550
We are the ones that need
to be involved in this.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.150
We are the ones
leading the research.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.480
Great.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.190
You know, that's one
school of thought.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.240
And I agree with many things.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.323
And another one which is
the one that I think it's

00:35:38.323 --> 00:35:41.740
like, I want to open up
research to everyone.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.540
In every single
sprint, I tell people

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.330
I'm going to teach you how to
be a researcher in 15 minutes.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.700
And I'm going to give you tips.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.950
And we're going to have users.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.010
And I'm going to show you
how you can speak with users.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:57.790
Because what that does is
that it opens up the value

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.150
that research is bringing to a
team, the value that research

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.750
is bringing to an engineer.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.310
And they have a
better appreciation.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.350
They realize, wow.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.280
Like one of the
things that we teach

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.890
them is try not to
ask leading questions,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.850
like very neutral questions when
you're interviewing someone.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.690
Then they realize, wow it's much
more difficult than it seems,

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.190
right?

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.856
Because we're in love
with this product.

00:36:17.856 --> 00:36:20.180
And we want to hear
great things about it.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.870
So then they realize that
it's definitely a skill.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.250
It's very important.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.200
I just finished a
sprint on Wednesday.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.980
And we were thinking
about these type of user

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:34.560
as really needing a lot of data
about how their program would

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.870
work.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.180
And then what we
realized through rounds

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.010
of research is that
what they really,

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.400
really, really care is
to create a new program.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.150
And there is no tool
to do that at Google

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.140
for one specific area.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.340
So it completely
shifted the way that we

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.460
were looking at the space.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.800
And it shifted what we're
going to be end up coding.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.160
And the calls came, actually,
from one engineer at 1:00 PM

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.124
that we're doing this research.

00:37:01.124 --> 00:37:02.790
So I'm of the school
of thought of like,

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.420
let's have everyone do research.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.490
Speak with your users.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.430
No matter where you're working,
you can get a hold of a user

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.160
and just like have
a conversation.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.050
Like you said before,
have a conversation

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:15.800
and listen to your user.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.250
Oftentimes, what you
have in your head,

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.790
it's not what the user needs.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.300
Like you convince yourself
that what you want to build

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.710
or what we want to build
is what the user needs

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.960
or what the user wants.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.120
And sometimes, the
reality is very different.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.880
So having that
conversation allows

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.100
us to be more
aligned with the user

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.395
needs to build great products.

00:37:35.467 --> 00:37:36.175
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:37:36.175 --> 00:37:38.830
So I mean your comment
really goes back

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.090
to Kevin was saying about
T-shaped people, right?

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.270
So you take your deep
area of expertise.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.360
And you, through
collaboration, share that.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.816
And you help other people
broaden the top of their T.

00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:55.910
But we still have
this problem of we

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.050
all have our own set of
personal tasks, right?

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.410
And what's the
best way to strike

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.610
a balance between
collaboration and lots

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.876
of meetings versus actually
getting stuff done?

00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:07.500
KEVIN DAME: I could
speak to one angle.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.390
But I think it's a-- I mean
it's a very hard problem.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:14.050
Like I think even just meetings
needs to be rethought across

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.360
like all of business world.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.430
Because there's a lot there
to rethink and redesign.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.750
But I will say one
thing, that I think

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.230
there's a time and place
for everybody to be

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.440
like uber collaborative.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.640
And then there's a
time and place where

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.380
we know what we want to do.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.150
And we execute.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.580
And then we trust one another.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.870
And we rely on the depth
that everybody has.

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.980
And I feel like, coming
back to Visioning,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.646
I think that's one
of the things that we

00:38:36.646 --> 00:38:39.050
try to do by helping a
team create a clearer

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.524
vision for themselves,
is once they-- you know,

00:38:41.524 --> 00:38:42.690
we talked about trust a lot.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.060
There's definitely
the importance

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.060
of trusting one another.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.832
But when they all trust in the
same vision that they created,

00:38:47.832 --> 00:38:49.665
then I think it's time
for people to execute

00:38:49.665 --> 00:38:50.969
and there isn't a lot of churn.

00:38:50.969 --> 00:38:52.760
Because I think a lot
of times what happens

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.360
is when people don't feel clear
on what they're doing or don't

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.350
agree or don't have confidence,
there's a lot of churn

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.150
and a lot of meeting,
second guessing.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.350
When there's a clear
vision and people

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.570
feel like we know
what we're building,

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.000
we know why we're doing
it, we're confident in it,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.720
then I think people can execute
with like less of a requirement

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.542
for this uber collaboration.

00:39:12.002 --> 00:39:12.710
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.190
I mean we've also talked
a bit about prototyping.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:22.160
And it's been said, fairly
famously in the design world,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.505
that a prototype is worth
a thousand meetings.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.970
So I mean, what does
that process look

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.740
like across Google?

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.940
How does prototyping
help us save time,

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.299
but also actually
create better products?

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:40.090
ALEX COOK: So what we
do on Search and Maps

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.260
is we have a UX Engineering team
that's about 17 people, now.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.390
And they're partnered
up with Design partners.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.500
And so as soon as designers
start doing design,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.100
we have people in the room who
are actually going and building

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.981
these things out.

00:39:52.981 --> 00:39:55.230
And we're starting to build
up a culture more and more

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.190
that as we go and
present our ideas,

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.850
we're bringing them
in prototype form.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.030
So people can play with
them with real data

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.500
and see what the actual
experience looks like.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.750
And we want to make sure
that the prototyping is

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.470
thought of as part of the
design, not a hand off.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:11.650
Because when it comes
too late, then you

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.281
don't have people who are good
UX engineers bringing ideas

00:40:14.281 --> 00:40:14.780
back.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.030
And you don't have
that same situation.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.160
You may only get rushed.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.060
But when you have people who are
right there thinking about it

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.950
as the design evolves, then the
prototype can evolve with it

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.859
and be that design deliverable.

00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:27.900
KEVIN DAME: Is this
phenomenon of guess-a-thons--

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.108
I don't know if anyone's
heard the term guess-a-thon,

00:40:30.108 --> 00:40:32.280
but I heard it
recently-- but it's

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.860
like I remember when we were
working on YouTube Kids.

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.315
We would be in meetings,
so a bunch of people

00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:38.523
were in a meeting-- and by
the way, like none of them

00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:39.230
were parents.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.830
And then they're all speculating
on what a parent would like

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.075
and speculating on like what a
four-year-old would do or like.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:47.450
And then you'll even have
someone like, well, my daughter

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:48.510
can do such and such.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.740
And it's like, yeah, but
you're like a VP at YouTube.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.840
And your daughter's probably
not representative of kids.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.370
And so I think the
value of the prototyping

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:00.150
is like we can waste a lot of
time having these guess-a-thons

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.250
or we can just build something
and get a reality check

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:03.990
very quickly.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.390
So I think that's the
value of prototypes

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.540
is fewer guess-a-thons,
which are

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.360
frustrating to be
in, usually don't

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.224
result in the right answer,
and take too much time.

00:41:13.224 --> 00:41:15.640
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: And even the
act of creating a prototype

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.501
is it's kind of
rooted in empathy.

00:41:18.501 --> 00:41:20.750
It forces you to think through
how somebody else might

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.782
encounter the thing.

00:41:22.782 --> 00:41:24.490
One thing that might
be worth encouraging

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.910
is just prototyping in
any form is valuable,

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.120
even if it's like a
series of static images

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.840
that you can flip through really
quickly and get a sense for.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.490
It doesn't have to be like
a complex code-based thing

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.770
or a perfectly
polished motion design.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.160
Anything that allows you
to show it to other people

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.910
and have them evaluate
it and give you

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:46.814
their feelings about how
it works is effective.

00:41:46.814 --> 00:41:48.158
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:41:48.158 --> 00:41:53.570
So kind of to wrap up, we
have a broad representation

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.320
of all the different UX roles.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.120
There are lots of different
design disciplines at Google.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.190
And there's lots of overlap
with engineering as we've seen.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.070
What do you look for in a
candidate or in their portfolio

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.875
when you're looking at designers
who are applying to Google?

00:42:10.875 --> 00:42:13.012
And maybe Katherine to start?

00:42:13.012 --> 00:42:13.970
KATHERINE WALKER: Sure.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.700
MIKE DENNY: You look
like you were thinking

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.710
really hard about this one.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.113
KATHERINE WALKER: Yeah.

00:42:16.113 --> 00:42:18.030
I'm like, so what
answer do I give here?

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.940
No.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.750
For me, for the
visual design role,

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.080
for what I would hire
for at Brand Studio

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:30.330
I just like a good
way to see concepts,

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.530
that they get their ideas down.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.790
If there's a strong concept
behind a lot of work

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:37.180
that they do, that it
was a good idea there.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.407
I think style is something
that you can learn.

00:42:39.407 --> 00:42:41.490
I think expression is
something that you can hone.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.780
But like having that initial
idea is really important.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.830
Then also I really am a
stickler for typography.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.640
If someone has good
type in their book,

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.250
I am like, yep, hire them.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.890
Get them in today.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.835
And then the last part is
just someone that you can--

00:42:55.835 --> 00:42:57.710
you're probably going
to see this person more

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.260
than you see your family, quite
frankly, the A that you work

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.480
with all day, day in and out.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.397
Are they a good human?

00:43:02.397 --> 00:43:03.730
Do you want to sit next to them?

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.355
Do you want to go
get a beer with them?

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:07.002
That is another huge plus.

00:43:07.002 --> 00:43:07.710
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.520
That's definitely
a general thing

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.190
that we look for at Google.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.669
Nicholas, I mean you look
at a lot of different roles.

00:43:15.669 --> 00:43:18.210
NICHOLAS JITKOFF: Across any of
them like, again, the ability

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:20.130
to tell a story in any form.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.630
For engineers or others,
like engineers or designers,

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.700
is just when have
they taken something

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.090
they're passionate about and
conveyed it to other people?

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:30.167
And it doesn't really matter
how they go about doing that.

00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:31.000
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.340
Awesome.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.260
Anyone else have any?

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.830
KEVIN DAME: I think
in the Visioning work,

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.229
we're kind of looking
for all those attributes.

00:43:39.229 --> 00:43:41.270
But there are a few that
we look for that I think

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.990
are a little bit different.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.240
Because a lot of times what
we're doing on a Visioning

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.620
project is we're taking
something that's either

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.580
really vague and undefined
or something that's

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.240
kind of all sort of
messed up, we're stuck,

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.300
we can't figure it out.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.566
And I think there
are many folks who

00:43:57.566 --> 00:43:59.940
would like someone else to
kind of clean that up for them

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.731
and say, OK, you've
got a good clean brief.

00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:02.800
We know what we're doing.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.230
Now, go be a great designer,
go be a great researcher.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:09.280
On our team, we've got to
turn clarity out of ambiguity.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.520
We've got to untangle things.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.500
So the number one thing
I look for is people

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.340
who are comfortable with
ambiguity, optimistic,

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.360
are good leaders, can
make sense of messy stuff.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.157
So you know that's kind of the
number one thing we look for.

00:44:22.157 --> 00:44:24.740
ALEX COOK: The storytelling is
really important to me as well.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.580
But I love attention to
detail and fundamentals

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.840
in a designer or an engineer.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:33.150
I love seeing people design
forms when they apply.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.980
It sounds so
rudimentary, like who

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.230
wants to look at another form?

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.290
But a form is such a
telling piece of design

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.369
if someone is a good
interaction designer or not.

00:44:40.369 --> 00:44:42.160
You can really see the
thought and the care

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.160
that they've put into how a user
will move between the fields

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.990
and ultimately hit that Submit
button and complete their task.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.010
MIKE DENNY: Awesome.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.480
Well, that's all the time we
have for our Design Fireside

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.980
Chat.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.080
I want to take the
opportunity to thank everybody

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:55.660
on the panel.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.535
I think we covered a
lot of different topics.

00:44:57.535 --> 00:45:00.000
I hope it was useful
to everyone watching.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.927
And yeah.

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:01.760
Thank you very much.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.760
