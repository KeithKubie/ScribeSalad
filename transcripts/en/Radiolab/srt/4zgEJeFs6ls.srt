00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,790
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W N.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,213
Y. S. T. E. Yep.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,740
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,240
This is Radiolab and today a story that
we've been working on for close to two

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:22,290
years, but just before you're about
to put on the air, this happened

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,520
[inaudible]

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,420
the next story in perspective, it's
as if someone had killed last seat.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,210
As you probably know,
over this past summer,

9
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:37,211
a Minnesota dentist named Walter Palmer
paid 55 grand to get permission today,

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,650
Tom Hunt and kill a
lion, a lion named Cecil,

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,650
an African lion considered
to be a national treasure
in the country of Zimbabwe.

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,070
This is a pretty famous lion,

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,580
sort of the star of that park
and been in a few studies.

14
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:54,050
So immediately there were allegations
of poaching Zimbabwe where Cecil was

15
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,820
killed, open up an investigation.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,210
But what really caught our eye was the
reaction from the public lion killer.

17
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,700
The words painted on the
home of Dr. Walter Palmer.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,170
People found out his home address
started sharing it online.

19
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,810
John Dam down the backlash,
threatening his livelihood.

20
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:15,250
Now protest Jews gathered outside his
office, posting signs on the lock doors,

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,890
branding him a coward and a killer.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,910
He was forced to temporarily close his
business, vilified across the Internet.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,440
There were attacks all over
social media and Youtube.

24
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:28,070
And warning this next minute
contained some pretty strong language.

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,323
You are truly

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,610
scrambled. The Earth wrote one Walter
fucker call no fucking demented.

27
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:37,330
This motherfucker is, may
you fucking burn to death?

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,170
I want somebody to take fucking drop dead.

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,093
What would happen?

30
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,650
[inaudible]

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,483
today

32
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,120
we bring you a story that we hope will
be a little bit of signal in all that

33
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:54,511
noise.

34
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:58,830
This is a story about the
strange relationship between
wanting to hunt and kill

35
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,140
an animal and wanting to save it

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,150
and it comes from my producers, Simon
Adler, one, two, three, four, five one,

37
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,770
two, three, four, five. All right,

38
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:12,370
so this story really started
from me in Salt Lake City.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,310
This past February I went to the
western hunting and conservation expo,

40
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,070
sometimes referred to as
the super bowl of hunting.

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Some walking through a this
airplane hanger sized a room set.

42
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:31,470
This massive convention center called the
Salt Palace. Over 40,000 people there,

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,180
gun manufacturers that were bowmakers.

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
There were call makers in the
single reed camouflage clothing,

45
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:41,410
apparel companies.

46
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,601
Well,

47
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:45,230
this place is rocking and I hope you're
having a good time and if you're having

48
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,170
a good time, I want to hear a big ie hall.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,770
How

50
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,790
did the expo off this main floor?

51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,210
There was a banquet hall where there
was an mc who is working in the crowd.

52
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,910
Well tonight, I want to
continue on a couple of

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,920
that we touched on last night, you know,

54
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,921
our greatest conservation
President Theodore Roosevelt
said the wildlife and its

55
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,680
habitat cannot speak for itself.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,910
So we must, well, let me tell you,

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,870
we have and we will continue to speak,

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,420
but we've got to go further than speaking.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,890
We're going to have to suit up in our
armor to go into battle to protect our

60
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,310
wildlife on our way of
life. Well, let me tell you,

61
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,840
we are at war brought on by the
extreme radical environmental movement.

62
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,630
If we're not vigilant, engage this enemy.

63
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,290
The most endangered species in
America could be the American hunter.

64
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,770
One of the things that surprised me
kind of right off the bat was talking to

65
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:49,041
people.

66
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,610
Everybody kept coming back to this idea
in hitting on this idea that like if it

67
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,710
weren't for us, if it
weren't for the hunters,

68
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,090
the animals would not be alive without
us onto them. They would go extinct.

69
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,290
I got that line over and over again.
There would be no animals other than hunt.

70
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,550
Basically what they mean by this is they
are the ones that are paying to keep

71
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,420
these animals around.

72
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,450
They are the ones who are
funding conservation and I
saw what that looked like

73
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,950
on the final night of the
expo Saturday night, uh,

74
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,950
when the organizers held this auction

75
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,600
and now's the time to open your
Wallets, Get out your checkbooks,

76
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,160
your credit cards. In fact,

77
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:27,490
we'll even take IOUs written
on the back of a Napkin.

78
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,150
Let's make some money for
wildlife. Let's do it.

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,500
Our first doctrine item tonight presented

80
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,470
the first couple of items,
they were just like guns.

81
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,240
It's an American made Ruger
rifle. But then item number three,

82
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,790
we're going to full curl stone.

83
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,990
A picture of the sheep pops up on
this jumbo screen up on the stage.

84
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,920
Big stone sheep, as you can
see right there. Big ones,

85
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,680
huge curling horns, thick brown coat,

86
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,390
beautiful color beauty that's
on the bucket list, brother.

87
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,670
That's all on the bucket list. So
the winner of this auction item,

88
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,671
what they're actually buying is the
chance to go up to Canada on this very

89
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,850
specific area and to shoot one
of these sheep to get a tag.

90
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,840
To shoot one of these sheets,

91
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,950
I have an opening bid of $30,000
that's what I'm talking about.

92
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:16,350
Let's go 32 and a half, 32 and a half,

93
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,210
one nine but I'm going to have to
get to an editor and I do that now,

94
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:21,210
but I've been unable to get 32 and a half
for one of the best stone units there

95
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:24,630
is. I'm 32 and a half down the
middle. Need 35 one time but about,

96
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,170
and nobody can find
35,001 diamond last call.

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Sold them right over here
as $35,000 few items later.

98
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,750
Keep it rolling. We're a number six a
picture of a mooth comes on the screen.

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,690
Are All of you moose hunters
want a great Sharis Moose,

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,050
the kind of Moose that you know their
antlers ban out like giant wings.

101
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,890
Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got
$10,000 somebody can me 12 and a half,

102
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,560
12 and a half one down. But up until
now, but if I haven't had 12 and a half,

103
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,610
15 one time, but I'm going an have to
give anybody 1517 to half 17 and a half,

104
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:59,900
2022 a high of one when to put him
under 25 and hundred 25 and 31 down.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,210
But I go now to get 35 on
time, but about an hour 40

106
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,910
wait, so how, how does the
conservation angle work?

107
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,390
Basically how this works is each state
has an agency that's responsible for

108
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,720
managing its wildlife.
And so if you're a hunter,

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,090
you basically have to buy a tag from
that state agency in order to shoot just

110
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:22,370
about any animal. For example, in Arizona,

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,810
Arizona is this grid of hunting
areas and you apply to a lottery.

112
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,670
For Zone B, I would really like
to be able to shoot a movie.

113
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,100
You put your $20 in,

114
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,600
this is typical and 60,000
if your name comes up,

115
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,230
you get your tag for $20 but it's possible
that you're not going to get one and

116
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,150
sometimes you have to wait 10 or 20 years.

117
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,560
Especially for these big game
animals. So what these agencies do,

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,930
they set aside a certain number
of these tags every year,

119
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,430
which are called conservation techniques
and what these conservation tags are is

120
00:06:55,431 --> 00:07:00,040
like if you just give a bunch of money
right now, I did not see this common.

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,410
You have free range to do
what you want, hop the line,

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,900
shoot the animal you want. No Way.

123
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
$80,000 eight dead freaking dead and
then all that money goes back to those

124
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,940
state agencies for a land
management habitat restoration,

125
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,300
like we're talking millions of
dollars that get raised this way.

126
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,420
One auction item that I saw sold that
next special big game enhancement package,

127
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,340
which basically gave whoever wanted the
right to shoot just about any animal in

128
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,600
the entire state of New Mexico.
For a year. I'm 175 bucks.

129
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,700
No, 81 down, but I'm going
to have it of ADHD and avid.

130
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,090
I've been an avid 180 180 now able to
get 91 downloadable to navigate 90 90 90

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,540
yeah.

132
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Sold it $230,000 one gentleman as close
to one so you can do a sound fair levels

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,850
and in fact the whole reason I hadn't
come to this convention was to talk to a

134
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,980
guy who had done an auction like this,

135
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,200
but in his case it kind of
blew up on it. Honestly,

136
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:08,440
did not expect to be in a position that
I am today. My name is Corey Knowlton,

137
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,730
c o r e y. K n.

138
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,370
O. W. L. T. O. N. Is that how you're going
to set, you're going to lead back? I,

139
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,150
you know I'll probably move
around a lot. Yeah. Okay.

140
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,280
Cornell has become kind of the poster
child of this idea of hunter conservation.

141
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,630
He's a Texas millionaire.

142
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,230
I met him in his hotel room right
across the street from the expo.

143
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,890
He was in a white tee shirt, blue jeans,
a little bit of stubble on his face.

144
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,850
And story goes back in January
of 2014 he was at next post,

145
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,790
super similar to this one put
on by the Dallas Safari Club.

146
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,590
I had my wife with me.

147
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,460
He was just walking the floor when he
bumped into a friend of his gentleman by

148
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,560
the name of John Jackson. Okay.

149
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:52,270
And John Jackson heads up a
group called conservation force.

150
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,261
So anyway,

151
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:58,080
John came to me and he told Corey that
he was worried that the Dallas Fart club,

152
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
they were auctioning off as an opportunity
to hunt a black rhino in Namibia.

153
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,670
The Namibian Ministry of Environment and
tourism had given them one tag to hunt

154
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,880
one black rhino and they were going
to auction it off what had to get old.

155
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,930
Now the black rhino is a critically
endangered species and are about 5,000 of

156
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,000
them in the world, about 2000 in Namibia.

157
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,190
And what the Namibian government does
is they auction off the older males.

158
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,480
What happens is the black round
gets older, it sees other rhinos,

159
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,720
it wants to attack them
oftentimes and kill them.

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,340
So the government will offer up those
problem rhinos for trophy hunting and then

161
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,730
use the money to protect
the others from poachers.

162
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,310
Is Poaching of the Black Ryan as a real
issue. Huge issue. Rhino Horn right now,

163
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,980
it goes, what's the number of
$60,000 a pound? Oh my God. Yeah.

164
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,060
It's worth like three times as much
as gold per ounce down. In any case,

165
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,630
Corey says, the reason that John
was so worried, John said, Corey,

166
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,110
there's been a, a,

167
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,210
a giant push of people
coming out against this.

168
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,410
It's literally a license to kill.
People don't want it to happen.

169
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,640
A permit to hunt down and kill one of
the world's most endangered animals.

170
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,340
You said, I'm really worried that um,

171
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,390
we're not gonna have someone
to bid this minimum bid.

172
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,210
His friend was worried that there were
going to be these Namibian ministers

173
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:23,660
there and they, they just didn't want
to be embarrassed. So John asked me,

174
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:23,841
he said,

175
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:27,410
would you at least bid the minimum
bid just to sorta like get the auction

176
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,640
rolling and as a friend,

177
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,170
if somebody that had been friends
with for over a decade, I said,

178
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,960
yes, I will do that. So

179
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,970
now to the auction, they started this
auction just like any other auction.

180
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,440
Eventually Corey makes this bid $350,000
thinking that would just go to the

181
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,300
other bidders. That's right.
I was like, you know what?

182
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,470
I'm going to do what I told you.

183
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm going to follow through with my
commitment to when all of a sudden go once

184
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:55,850
going twice, boom. It happens. You know,
I'm just me. I'm just going old money,

185
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,320
Mr God, take people hunting.

186
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,790
But immediately I've got people
surrounding me, you know,

187
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,660
a giant line of people
congratulating me. He's like,

188
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,670
I didn't expect to be the
guy who'd get it by. Okay,

189
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,590
but next 48 hours, we now know who pay

190
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,370
$350,000 for a hunting permit to kill
an endangered black rhino and none

191
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,890
Namibia. A barrage of
threats started coming.

192
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,330
He's being bombarded with death threats

193
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,510
among the thousands of postings. I
hope the rhino rips you and half.

194
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:32,040
Do your children know what
a monster their father is?

195
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,810
I hope you get what you deserve or
short and painful existence. Corey says,

196
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:40,170
people threatened to murder his
parents to rape his wife to death.

197
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,690
I'm coming to your house.
I'm going to burn it down.

198
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,350
I'm going to put your kids
in a woodchipper. I'm going
to do it in front of you.

199
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,470
At any point in this, have you
been super enthralled by the idea?

200
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,280
Have you always wanted to
shoot a black rhino? Yes. Yeah.

201
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,820
You're gonna have to now
we're gonna have to be quiet.

202
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,240
I definitely haven't always
wanted to shoot a black rhino.

203
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:05,740
Have I always wanted to hunt for as
long as my, I remember. Yes. Okay.

204
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,000
Matter big journey in
life. When I was born,

205
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,190
we had literally nothing.

206
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,630
He told me he grew up in rural Missouri
in a small house, then trailer home.

207
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,680
His mom raised the family, his dad
loaded trucks at Safeway. Okay.

208
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,220
And we're trying to survive as a
family. So when Corey was eight,

209
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,170
we left Missouri in a,

210
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,940
in a Monte Carlo with $2,500 in the bank
and a dream to make it in this world.

211
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,650
Okay. So by the time I was 15, we
had moved all over the United States.

212
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,290
His Dad picked up jobs in Arizona, Texas.

213
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,970
I'm going from school to school to school.

214
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,570
I didn't really have the benefit of
getting in any sports teams or whatever.

215
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:48,430
But the one thing I did is I had a dad
that worked his butt off every day and I

216
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,870
didn't get to spend much time with him.

217
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,130
So then when we would go want to go do
things, Hey dad, let's go dove hunting.

218
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:56,920
It's duck season. You
know, and he loved that.

219
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,010
He mentioned this one time
when he was 11, we'd go out,

220
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,110
I have shotgun in my hand to doves fly
up and I shooting in both of them died.

221
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:09,250
One shot fell right there. Okay.
I went over there, got the doves,

222
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,890
went through cleaning them. Okay.

223
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:16,180
And preparing the cook them and just
being in that moment and not worrying

224
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:18,250
about, um, you know,

225
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:21,550
other problems that you met that we all
go through in life and just having a

226
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:26,170
nice quiet town. And my dad, I looked
at it as a privilege to go hunting.

227
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,580
I didn't look at it like, Hey,

228
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:30,670
it's my right to go out
and take some animals live.

229
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:33,340
I look at it like this is
an awesome opportunity.

230
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:36,820
I get to go spend with
my dad outside. Now.

231
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,170
As I became older, I became
more interested in hunting
or learned about Bose.

232
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,160
I want to learn about hunting.

233
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,190
I was ate up with it by the time he
was in his mid twenties. He says,

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,580
and this was right around the time his
dad hit it big in the oil industry.

235
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,530
He was leading hunts all around the world
from the North Pole to as far south as

236
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:57,680
you could hunt in New Zealand,
Nepal, Papa New Guinea.

237
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,540
So I've seen the whole world and he says
somewhere in the middle of all of those

238
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,840
trips, he realized that
there's a big fight out there.

239
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
This large bio mass of humanity is taking
over the world and wildlife doesn't

240
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,750
exist by accident anymore,

241
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,770
and so he started thinking about not
just hunting these animals but preserving

242
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:20,900
them and keeping them here.

243
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,790
All of which is to say when he won that
auction without meaning to and started

244
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,610
getting all those death
threats, he didn't turn back.

245
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,260
What on earth is keeping you so
steadfast and going ahead and doing this?

246
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,530
I think I would've thought
I shouldn't have done this.

247
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,740
I was willing to do this and it may have
not been what I planned on that I was

248
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:44,510
willing to do this based on a
commitment to I may do a friend.

249
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,160
I made a commitment to my family.

250
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,400
I made a commitment to
conservation as a whole. Look,

251
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,670
this was never about me going over
and taking a black rhinos live.

252
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,940
Like finally I get to achieve the xen
at of life and killing this black rhino.

253
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,840
Give me a break.

254
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,960
It was about method of conservation to
keep black rhinos on the face of this

255
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,040
earth. You are saying that you're
doing this for conservation.

256
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,250
Your detractors will say, they will say,

257
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,380
you say you are only doing
it for conservation when
you are really doing it for

258
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,400
no, I'm not saying
that's what you've said.

259
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm saying that this is what they
will throw at you. You are only,

260
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,110
you were saying you're only
doing it for conservation.

261
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,410
Well all you are actually getting out
of it is some sort of satisfaction.

262
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,490
And can you talk for a minute about God
for more than a minute about it? Okay.

263
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,870
All right. Sure. I enjoy the act
of hunting. Can I tell you why?

264
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,040
Could I wrap that up in a real pretty
burrito for you to be able to eat and

265
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,810
understand and it tastes good? No,

266
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:46,580
but I can tell you that I care
about the survival of these pcs.

267
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,670
And do you understand why people have
a hard time wrapping their mind around

268
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:57,221
that you believing that and simultaneously
wanting to kill an animal or does

269
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,750
that just does not compute to you at all?

270
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,440
I mean at what point were
we're getting redundant.

271
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:08,000
They're missing the whole boat. We
don't have one without the other.

272
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,283
Okay.

273
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,500
If we want wildlife to be
around for future generations,

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
we have to understand that that
wildlife has to have a value.

275
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,360
If it doesn't have a value,
especially in the continent of Africa,

276
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,620
it's going to be gone. And here he
made a sort of economic argument.

277
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,460
He said you've got to keep in mind
that living next to a black rhino,

278
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,300
not just talking about it, but
actually living next to a black rhino,

279
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,770
it's a nightmare.

280
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,750
I mean who wants to live next door
to a raging psychopathic beast?

281
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,650
It's killing things. No one. So in
just very purely economic terms,

282
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,210
it has a negative value.

283
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,160
But what Corey will tell you and what
conservation organizations like World

284
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,600
Wildlife Fund and various others will
tell you is by him paying $350,000 to

285
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,800
shoot one, he is creating a
positive value for that animal.

286
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:04,220
He's creating jobs for game wardens.
He's creating jobs for trackers.

287
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,090
So you've got to look at the net
benefit. It's there. And so what,

288
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,650
what is the common ground here?

289
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:14,460
Because you guys want the same things
and yet there's somehow this, no,

290
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,550
we don't want the same conservationist
in general to be common ground has to be,

291
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,800
do you or do you not want to see
black rhinos on the face of the earth?

292
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,600
And I think everyone agrees that
they do, but I think even, no,

293
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:33,170
I think they do. I, I as their actions
are speaking louder than their words,

294
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,860
they're all, I think to
a lot of people there,

295
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,870
these neo-colonial sentiments here that
you are this guy who has a lot of money

296
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,990
and you are paying a lot of money to
go to Africa to shoot this thing and I

297
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:50,070
think that that causes

298
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,570
a reaction in certain people.

299
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,660
Do you think the amount of money plays
into it or no, to take a break for ones.

300
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,553
Okay.

301
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,373
Okay.

302
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,520
Okay. When did you, you, you can say you
don't want to answer anything or that.

303
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,730
No, I want to give you the best possible
answer. Do you understand that? No,

304
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,950
I didn't get, try it. Okay.

305
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,230
I'm really trying to an emotional
level where I'm like, God Dang Man,

306
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,330
I want these people to
get some fucking fat.

307
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,340
I just don't know if I'm going
to be able to, we can stop. No,

308
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,060
you don't have to stop.
Just give me a second.

309
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,020
And I know that the words
I put out mean something

310
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,390
and I don't want to do to service.

311
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,520
I don't feel like I'm letting people
down and I'm not a radical psychopath.

312
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:44,690
You can see that. Okay.
Just something I believe in.

313
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,230
I can believe in these animals and
I believe that I want them here.

314
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,000
But I also understand
that death is inevitable.

315
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,190
Okay.

316
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,250
But the depth of this
bcs doesn't have to be.

317
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,133
And so

318
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm putting myself through this because
I believe that it's right because I've

319
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:10,330
seen that it's right. And I'll go down
and I will sit next to people in Africa,

320
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,990
both indigenous and non indigenous
that have the exact same belief.

321
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,980
And they want these animals, they love
them, they want their kids to see it.

322
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,250
They know that one night when the stars
are above and they're sitting there with

323
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:39,051
their family and lion roars and a distance
that they feel that they feel what it

324
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,780
means to be afraid of it. They
feel what it means to respect it.

325
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,110
They feel what it means to love
it and they want that to continue.

326
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,190
And I want that to continue
in in a realistic view,

327
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,360
a realist view.

328
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,520
I believe I have a grasp on what
it takes for that to continue.

329
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,403
[inaudible]

330
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,280
thank you for being showing it.
I don't have any guns. Okay.

331
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,450
So that conversation happened over
six months ago. At that point, the,

332
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,860
the hunt was totally in limbo. He was
still receiving death threats. Uh,

333
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,760
animal welfare organizations like
Humane Society of the United States were

334
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,880
lobbying and petitioning
to try to stop the hunt.

335
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,100
And what it all really hinged on was
a decision to be made by us fish and

336
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,470
wildlife under the endangered species act.

337
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,500
It's illegal to import the carcass of
an endangered species into the United

338
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,810
States unless you can prove that by
killing and importing that animal,

339
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,570
you are helping the species. As a whole,

340
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,670
so that's what us fish and
wildlife had to decide.

341
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,600
Would Cory killing and importing that one?

342
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,880
Black Rhino help black rhinos as a whole.

343
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,910
March went by April and then

344
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,650
in early May I got a text from Corey
that just read. Let's talk tomorrow.

We take a trip.

Pleasure. Bye Bye.

374
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,950
All right, we are off the
plane walking into the airport.

375
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:29,670
I suppose this would be the first time
we've actually stepped foot in Namibia.

376
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,300
The uh, the destination. I'm Jen.
I'm Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich.

377
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:39,020
Back to our board. Simon Adler. Okay,
so days after getting that text message,

378
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,060
I land in Namibia. Meet back up with
court. Today we're in Windhoek, Namibia,

379
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:46,310
so 13th of May Thousand 15.

380
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,820
This is Simon's big day to
interview local officials,

381
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:52,340
professional hunters in
any bum on the street.

382
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,310
That once the comment and how
long have we been traveling for?

383
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,420
Probably like closer to 48 hours. Now
you're feeling all right at this point?

384
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,850
Well a lot better now. I'm just getting
off the plane and fill in the wind.

385
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,793
Yeah,

386
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,950
the airport is tiny. We get through
customs and everything and immediately,

387
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,270
I'm Simon Simon, I'm 18
nice to meet you man.

388
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,340
We're met by the Ph
Hindi van here, the p h.

389
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,930
I am a professional hunter,

390
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,550
the professional hunter requested by
Cody Knowlton to assist him on his hunt.

391
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,560
He's sort of the manager of this entire
project. Big Dude, scraggly beard,

392
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,990
short shorts. We need to
go and pick up our stuff.

393
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,950
He leaves us out of the airport. So
what does the day's agenda hold for us?

394
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,180
Sort chaos out. Throw it in chaos.

395
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,380
Your chaos just started my
friend. So we get in his truck,

396
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,663
start driving.

397
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,730
Do you mind if I ask you some questions
while we drive here but ain't going on?

398
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,850
And I immediately just realize what a
headache putting all this together has

399
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:53,170
been for him. Oh

400
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,540
10 million phone calls,

401
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,800
meetings after meetings with the
Minister of Environment and tourism.

402
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,860
Adolfous checking with local offices
all to help them figure out which is the

403
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,140
best rhino for Corey to
shoot. So they had their list,

404
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,220
but so how many at this point you know
exactly which one you'll be going after

405
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,690
or are there a couple? The main base
we've identified that is two rhinos.

406
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:20,740
We can then remove from that area,
both male aggressive post reproductive.

407
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,530
We gonna try to get on one of
these two animals and try to run,

408
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,230
move it as professionally as
we can possibly do. Right.

409
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,200
So we're at the a ministry
of Environment and tourism.

410
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,000
This is apparently a meet and greet.

411
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,130
Later that day we stopped to shake hands
with the permanent secretary, Simeon.

412
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,220
Nick Gumbo.

413
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,370
Okay. I want to welcome you all.

414
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,050
He gave this kind of prepared speech
about how trophy hunting is a big part of

415
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:51,560
why Namibia is considered the gold
standard of conservation in Africa.

416
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,060
This program, as he says,

417
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,970
to have a wildlife groin.

418
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,660
Previously our wildlife
was almost say declining,

419
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,970
could like an elephant with less than
1000 but now we have plenty of them.

420
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,470
We don't know where to put in

421
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,150
in descending thousand. So Amini now.

422
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,270
So you've been so successful that
you have to deal with the surplus.

423
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,410
Yeah, the lower type of species,
we heavy dead. They green classmen.

424
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,250
Fast forward to the next morning.

425
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,280
It's 4:46 AM I doubt that Simon nor I got
any sleep last night despite all that.

426
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,010
So Moon's going to get
her before you through.

427
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,160
He was in high spirits.
Yeah. I woke up this morning.

428
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,910
It was drizzling rain around the curb.

429
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:40,680
Came a passenger train

430
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,350
first thing and bring it down to
the his firearm and the ammunition.

431
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,120
Big Knives and things. So we can scan
a little rhino Monday morning. Oh,

432
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,920
you think he was on the phone taking
care of final details and much to my

433
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:59,280
chagrin that there was this crew
of CNN reporters hanging around

434
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,930
once everything was loaded.
We took off for the airport.

435
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,130
Should I leave you here Corey?
Yeah. And I waved them off. Okay.

436
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,980
I'm happy hunting. Good
luck. Thanks ma'am.

437
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,810
You what? What was that again? You're
wave. I don't understand. I uh,

438
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,710
I wasn't able to go on the
rhino hunt itself. What? I know,

439
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,830
I know you're seem
disappointed, but in number one,

440
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,180
a hunting party can only be so large in
Namibia and with these three CNN guys,

441
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,530
they're the, the party was just full.
Um, but you also have to understand CNN,

442
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,210
I was in the country illegally.
Um, I had no press pass.

443
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:42,530
I had no pressing visa. So this was
like, oh, I've got to keep my head down.

444
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:44,800
Okay, this is this. Yeah,
that is our fault. Um,

445
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,270
so are you telling me the story is over?
Is that what you're basically saying?

446
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,830
No, no, don't worry.
Cory's personal camera man.

447
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,390
He promised to give me all of his audio.

448
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,130
So we do have the audio
and we'll get to that.

449
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,080
But while they were headed up north,

450
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:00,170
I actually ended up going east and where
I went totally unexpectedly made this

451
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,320
model of conservation and how it works,

452
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:07,610
like really finally clicked
into place for me. Uh,

453
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,080
do you mind just telling me your
name and where we are at? Oh,

454
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:13,370
my name is [inaudible]. My
name is Estelle [inaudible].

455
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,250
I'm a sort of the owner of these
concerns. I'm going to keep you company.

456
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,810
All right. Sounds good Andre.

457
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:21,900
And it's still swan and
pull own the Aro game farms,

458
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
which are a series of huge slots of
land that they've fenced in in total.

459
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:31,260
They have like over 200 square miles
of land that actually used to be filled

460
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,940
with cattle end know 15,

461
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:36,810
16 years ago we converted
into a game farm.

462
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,260
Basically they decided to get rid of
all the cattle and bringing all these

463
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,940
animals. They've got your rafts,

464
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:46,500
they've got two different species of
Zebra Willdabeast our two beast in all.

465
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,410
They've got 29 different
species, including how many black

466
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,980
running around the property here.
Uh, up until about three weeks ago,

467
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,850
they within the, now we, uh, we've got
11. So one of the hunting guides, Steph,

468
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,340
a statue bear at the Aro
game lodge is in Namibia,

469
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,230
told me that they actually just
had a rhino born on the property.

470
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,800
And in fact they've had several throughout
the years born on this property.

471
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,370
And he took me out to find what were
you gonna look for signs and keep always

472
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,520
building. So what should I be looking for?

473
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,610
If I'm going to be of any
help here on the distance,

474
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:21,450
it'll just look like a big gray
rock pit. You really got over Kenai.

475
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,090
You're driving through this really tall,

476
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:27,450
thick grass that kind of envelop the car.

477
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,880
It was almost like we were
driving through a cloud. It's,

478
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,400
this is the Kolari sour
grass. It's a real thick,

479
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,380
it's almost like the mice
can run on top of it.

480
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,940
Yeah, and after searching
and searching and searching.

481
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,590
Yeah.

482
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,150
Have, we've just spotted the
own. Oh Shit. There it is.

483
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,400
Like a hundred yards away. Oh Man. Okay
one. Okay. Shit. It's pointing at us.

484
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,540
So he's noticed us now. He's probably
heard the vehicle. So you know,

485
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,760
we're still at a very
safe distance. I'm just,

486
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:01,250
I want to get us into the shade and then
we can have a closer look and you can

487
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,080
put the binoculars up from taking
a real good look at it. Oh Man.

488
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,980
Looking through the binoculars and
he's just pointed straight at us.

489
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:12,410
His head's moving left
to right. Left to right.

490
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,730
I think this is a bull boy
that looks at things. God,

491
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,170
it looks like a dinosaur. It doesn't,
it is a very prehistoric looking animal.

492
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,793
He didn't, you were there.

493
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,610
Oh yeah. He was totally looking at us.

494
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,970
I'm going to put the binoculars on
and seat. He's trotting away from us.

495
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,900
He started moving away from us
to cut these tiny looking legs.

496
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,600
So when they run they have
to kind of shuffle along.

497
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,960
I think if the grass was in
that youth would laugh at him.

498
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,560
The way they move it's,
and he's quite comical,

499
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,550
very lucky to, to found one Jesus
that we were tailing behind it.

500
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:52,050
And the crazy thing is this huge
animal that weighs like over it ton.

501
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,780
Oh and it is on the move. It's
thinking move like 30 miles per hour.

502
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,500
We are currently driving at about 15
kilometers an hour and he's getting away

503
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:03,400
from us, kind of left us behind.
So he wants nothing to do with us.

504
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,970
He's moving off the, at one
point before it took off. Um,

505
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,750
we actually got close enough
that with the binoculars on,

506
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,260
Steph was able to get
a good look at its ear.

507
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,650
The Blues of the project initially have
all got earmarks and this one doesn't

508
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:22,120
actually have an earmark in it. So perhaps
this one was born on this property.

509
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,430
What's the, how does that work? How did,

510
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,700
how did the rhinos get to be
on this property? Uh, the, the,

511
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,760
the Ministry of Environment Tourism, uh,

512
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,990
had been in touch with the owner of
outer game nudges. Government said, hey,

513
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,040
you've got all this land,

514
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,600
will you take a couple of these rhinos
and protect them for us? And they said,

515
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:42,580
sure. You know, we
started off with a couple,

516
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,500
three rhino and the numbers grew and it
becomes this like strange foster care

517
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:48,370
type situation.

518
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,180
Each year we have to take photos of them
and we build up a portfolio and then we

519
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,470
can send it into met.

520
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,730
It's interesting that like
they are breeding here.

521
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,480
So there are more of them now than there
would have been if they hadn't been

522
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:06,120
moved here. Yeah. Yes,
exactly. And another thing, uh,

523
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,800
we were unlucky last year. We
actually, we lost two runners.

524
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,910
Steph said he wanted to show me
something, uh, drove for about 10 minutes.

525
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,250
Then he stopped the car at this small
clearing, almost no grass, one lone tree,

526
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,870
kind of an eerie Phineas. So I sort of
feel when I stumbled across this place.

527
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,293
Oh Man.

528
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,310
And can you just describe what
we're looking at right here?

529
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,750
Boone's just got that all over the
red sand of the calorie bleach.

530
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:36,800
White bones against red,
red sand. See a FEMA.

531
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:41,020
We can see some positive spine as
well. Is that a rhino? Yeah, this,

532
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,020
it's always, it's just unreal. Wow.

533
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,523
Can you see that there?

534
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,470
We got out of the car and like
actually like held these bones. Oh God.

535
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:57,260
Wow. How did that happen?

536
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,020
That it was the dominant bu I
was fighting with a younger bull,

537
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,320
the two squared off and the older one
ended up goring the younger one with its

538
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:06,344
horn,

539
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,590
or at least we think fortunately the
young old passed away so it killed it.

540
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,620
Then this, this older bull that
had just killed the younger one,

541
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,900
Steph told me it then went up to this
female wanting to reproduce and the young

542
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,540
female wasn't ready. She
wasn't mature enough yet.

543
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,980
He kept forcing himself on
her over and over until,

544
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,960
till she couldn't any longer.

545
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,730
I guess it would happen in nature as well.

546
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,880
It's just unfortunate that
they had to be. Yeah. Um,

547
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,430
so yeah, they would have been even
more, but, uh, nature took this course.

548
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:46,280
We didn't get involved. And so it is,

549
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,840
Steph explained to me that it
was these type of black rhinos,

550
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,710
these older aggressive bowls that get
auctioned up for guys like Corey to come

551
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:59,711
over and shoot and then all the money
that's been paid for it is going back or

552
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:05,030
going back into a anti-poaching
unit is going back into conserving,

553
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,440
uh, rhinos.

554
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,030
And it's nice to see such a large sum
of money coming in for a good cause.

555
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,730
So he believes in this
program. But personally I,

556
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,300
I'd never be able to, to shoot the

557
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,063
a black rhino.

558
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,800
I don't know. And why, what,

559
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:26,370
what about your personally wouldn't
shoot her rhino eyes for me.

560
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,160
Let me have Konrad
explain why. Well, no, I,

561
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,410
they know it's difficult to say, but the

562
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,743
doesn't tickle me.

563
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,300
Who's catching visit the [inaudible] over
the next couple of days at the lodge.

564
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,620
As I was hanging out with kind of these
tourists from all over the world who had

565
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:54,621
come here to be wined and dined and then
go out and shoot stuff in the morning

566
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,520
and afternoon Steffes ambivalence
started to make a deep sort of sense to

567
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,710
donate. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, for instance.

568
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,370
I spent a lot of time with this guy,
Stefan Lindstrom. I'm from Sweden,

569
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,710
middle-aged there with
his family on vacation.

570
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:11,580
We decided six years ago
that we will go to Africa,

571
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,720
so I'm very happy to be here today.
This is six years in the making for you?

572
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah, you can see,

573
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,520
so it works in Volvo's corporate
office and he's a big trophy hunter.

574
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,040
Maybe you actually, to show
you some picture from my home,

575
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,890
do you have laps on the wall
already? Start to show him?

576
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:30,450
It's far too and after the
camp we have at least 50 Mars.

577
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,570
I got to follow him on a few
hunts. Him and his guide.

578
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,450
My name is Benjamin scrubber
scrape. It is my pseudonym.

579
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,373
Okay.

580
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,410
One of the hunts we spent about two and
a half hours searching for different

581
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:44,711
animals,

582
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:49,090
stocking different animals and then in
the distance so we still have very nice.

583
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,410
What about Buddha? We finally
found a waterbuck, which is what?

584
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,360
It's kind of like a reindeer, but uh,

585
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,000
it has these two big long horns
that kind of shoot backwards.

586
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:03,360
Almost like spears. Big Animal. Yup.

587
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,020
I guess don't [inaudible]. We're
just going to close and see.

588
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,470
We hopped down from the car and just
start kind of slowly moving towards it

589
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:14,620
through the grass type of
element is the top for me.

590
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,540
This weekend or this holiday,

591
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,500
Steven told me he had a list of animals
he was hoping to shoot and this was at

592
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:22,900
the top of this one. I think it's
just such a beautiful big animal.

593
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,880
That's why the game lodge charges $2,800
to shoot one. Okay. They went above us.

594
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:31,240
Yes sir. He said, okay,
okay, let's go and see.

595
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,873
Okay.

596
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,290
There's light wind or walking through

597
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,560
Shin length grass there, shrubs to the
left and the ride every like 10 minutes.

598
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:48,220
We'd stopped to measure how far away
it was. It's about two, 600 meters.

599
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,900
Take about the, tried to manage to
call, but all the close to that.

600
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,433
Okay.

601
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,140
Eventually we got just a couple
hundred feet away from it.

602
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,320
The animals off in the distance.

603
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,570
It's just kind of pacing that
then pulls out this tripod,

604
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:20,600
sets it up and Stephan
gets into positions.

605
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,473
Yup.

606
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,280
The buck stumbled a few paces and
he's done. [inaudible] falls down,

607
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,190
but then it gets right back
up and stumbled forward.

608
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,340
Put another bulletin one in this one,
one in the first shot. Didn't kill it.

609
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,720
Shoot rather high because to
a lot of girls at this point,

610
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,040
Ben seems tense.

611
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,050
He doesn't like that because it's like
he knows that the animal is suffering.

612
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,260
Uh, so the dog takes off,

613
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:06,280
runs after it and just keeps it at bay
by kind of circling it and we start

614
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:10,980
moving towards it. Let's
go closer. Let's try

615
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,313
[inaudible] next.

616
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,513
Okay.

617
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,440
Again, second shot doesn't kill it. Falls
down, gets back up, falls down again.

618
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,330
At least on the, just

619
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,980
it's arriving in the grass.
Ben Now seems pretty upset.

620
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,070
I Dunno what

621
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,290
you showed the the first
time, but rather high

622
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,680
school came up the fried. Yep.

623
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,120
And the third shot, wheat doesn't
kill it. Sweet. Don't fuck

624
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,640
shit. This is no fun. Is this

625
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,453
[inaudible]

626
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,150
finally fourth shot.

627
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,170
It goes limp dem [inaudible] shots.

628
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,660
It's like on the ground and the
leg is still kicking a little bit.

629
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:19,110
But if it's done well, it's a nice,

630
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,840
I am so happy. I'm so happy. This was
the top of the list for me this weekend.

631
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,290
So this artist perfect
is very nice feelings.

632
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,843
So

633
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,310
seeing it up close,

634
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,000
it can be emotionally difficult.

635
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,870
But when you pan out, it's pretty clear.

636
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,880
The numbers showed that this
Namibian model is working. Um,

637
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,660
wildlife numbers on private land have
gone up by almost 80% since the government

638
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:02,890
allowed people to buy, sell and
shoot wildlife on their land.

639
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,400
And since trophy hunting of
the black rhino was legalized,

640
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,640
that population has grown by like 30%.

641
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,180
But from my face, not all African
conservation is they're on board.

642
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,890
I talked to a guy named Richard Leakey,

643
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:22,950
super famous anthropologist who also
directed Kenya's wildlife program for

644
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,330
awhile. And I asked,

645
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,660
what is your stance on this
idea of sustainable use

646
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,840
a of wine? Listen to me, I think it's
utterly ridiculous. Well, you know,

647
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,520
w w w if a father cannot afford to
pay school fees for his children,

648
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,870
does he say to somebody,
you can rape my daughters,

649
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,310
I can get the money to pay
for school fees. I mean,

650
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:47,520
I think we've got to set some standards
in life and I think this is nonsense.

651
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:48,090
What,

652
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,890
what this argument is about killing
wild animals so that they can be looked

653
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:56,250
after. Absolutely said the wrong message.

654
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,300
This was the big issue he took with
Namibia strategy. Yes, you can.

655
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,660
You can afford to lose five runners
from a breeding perspective,

656
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,820
but does that send the right message?

657
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,910
He then told me a story about when he
took over Kenya Wildlife Service in 1989

658
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,020
at the time, things were dire.

659
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,720
Elephants were being killed at an
alarming number and we will get to lose.

660
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:17,860
I elephants totally

661
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:22,930
poaching was on the rise
and his predecessors had
actually confiscated a huge

662
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:25,460
number of elephant tusks
from these poachers

663
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,490
12 times, 12 times. Once you saw it,
you thought that's a lot of ivory.

664
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,800
And they recommended to him,
sell designery make about $3

665
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,480
and then use that money to help fight
poaching the patient. But leaky said no.

666
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,670
What he did instead was he built a giant
tower out of that ivory [inaudible]

667
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,523
project,

668
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:50,090
millions of dollars in ivory taken by
poachers burned more than 12 tons of

669
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,920
contraband, lol, tons of illegally poached
ivory worth several million dollars

670
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,180
fun for three days. Punk
television, newspapers,

671
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,101
magazines, radio.

672
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:06,600
It was this massive PR stuff to draw
the world's attention to the plight of

673
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,030
elephants. And part of what he
was saying in that was like,

674
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:12,330
we have to value these things
beyond their dollar value.

675
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,900
We have to respect the intrinsic value
of these creatures. Well, wait a second.

676
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,210
If you're burning a bunch of ivory,

677
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:21,840
aren't you in effect increasing the
value of the ivory cause now there's just

678
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:24,630
less of it out there. Let's say you're
looking at the supply end of it, right?

679
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,020
Um, yes. By reducing supply
that would push up price.

680
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,770
Leaky was attacking the demand side.
What an impact it had around the world.

681
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,310
Pinion changed overnight. He
said it woke the public up.

682
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:40,140
People stopped buying ivory and the
market for ivory. It just crashed.

683
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,160
Up to that time we'd been losing about
three and a half thousand elephants to

684
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:49,161
4,000 elephants a year and a year later
we were losing at most 60 really it has

685
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,490
an enormous impact.

686
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:57,960
My friend getting a public that
supports conservation of wildlife,

687
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,920
that's a huge challenge
and we just can't afford,

688
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,380
I think just send up the wrong messages,

689
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:11,810
but the problem with that is finding
the right message is getting harder and

690
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:13,584
harder.

691
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I called various conservation
organizations and one guy
who I talked to told me

692
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:22,020
that their average age of
donor is getting older.

693
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,710
More and more people are
just living in cities.

694
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,180
Less people are having
positive experiences in the
natural world at a young age

695
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,410
and so he said that they're going to
have to continue focusing on people

696
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:39,360
focusing on us. This message
of what does wild life give us?

697
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,070
What does it do for people?

698
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,060
This is our third day up in the area.

699
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,460
Still no luck and we're
just going to keep at it.

700
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,320
Back in Namibia,

701
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,420
after three days of bushwhacking through
this dense vegetation up in the north

702
00:43:56,421 --> 00:43:59,380
of the country, Corey and
his crew finally got on the

703
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,980
tracks of the right rhino. The local guy
says, we found a rhino that had guild,

704
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:08,060
another rhino that had killed another
rhino. So we're gonna follow this one,

705
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,310
make a hundred percent sure
that it's the Ryan one,

706
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,240
and then we'll try to take it if we can.

707
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,940
So for the next couple of hours they
track the animal looking for basically

708
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:20,330
footprints anywhere that
has marked its territory.

709
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,230
So we're not dragging this like probably
a couple hours now bumped at least

710
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:25,710
twice.

711
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:29,610
We were, had walked at this point
just about 12 miles. It was very hot.

712
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,040
You can see how pick it right here. Pretty

713
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,640
intense.

714
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,000
The grass was so thick that they really
couldn't see more than about 30 feet in

715
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:39,600
front of them. And eventually they
find, you can see this as the rhinos,

716
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,820
a pile of rhino feces that still
warrants, still very moist,

717
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,890
doesn't mean it's fright. This is,

718
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,480
we're not more than an hour behind that
animal right there and you can see the

719
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:51,970
Dung beetles and everything in
it. And so this nmos with Ada.

720
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,050
We sat there for a few minutes,
right, gathered our thoughts.

721
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,580
So it lets you line it out.
We're going to do what you say.

722
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,920
And then about two hours later

723
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,170
we've heard some noise from my left all
by t is running fees with a giant saber

724
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:10,744
on its head.

725
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,000
It was like lightning.

726
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,760
So we also didn't get
it with the first shot.

727
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,760
The first several shots
did not kill this thing.

728
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,730
It ran off and then they had to start
tracking it again and it just wounded.

729
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,180
Yes, we followed it. I would
say 10 minutes. I don't
know. I looked over there,

730
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:35,840
I saw it. It wasn't lying down at
this point. It was standing up,

731
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:38,480
but it had already fallen
down twice. It was dying.

732
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,213
And then

733
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,410
I shot it a few more times.

734
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,250
The last thing you do is once
you are really assured it's dead,

735
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,650
you can touch its eye and if
it doesn't blink, it's gone.

736
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,900
So did you go touch your tie?
Absolutely. In a moment like that,

737
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:00,790
is there some sort of,

738
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,510
is there a conversation going on now
that the animal is dead and you're not?

739
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,350
No,

740
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,900
we just kind of looked at everybody
looked at each other and made sure we were

741
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:11,960
okay. There wasn't a whole lot
of talk right then in this case,

742
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,870
but it was an emotional moment for me.

743
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,300
So the mate,

744
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,020
we've been sitting here skin in this
animal so far this morning and now we're

745
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:25,440
about to roll it over skin the other
side and then just take the quarters off

746
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:28,440
just like any other animal that you
would if you were on a hunting trip.

747
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,270
They loaded up all the meat to be shipped
off to a local village and they kept a

748
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:40,190
little bit of it for themselves.

749
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:40,940
Cook.

750
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,000
And my first piece of black rhino me
here on the coals next to the CarGurus,

751
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,720
right? Here's the moment when we've,

752
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:51,270
everybody here has started
eating some of this black rhino.

753
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,690
So it's just a part of a part of
hunting and a part of being a human.

754
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,620
So it's a pretty unique and
awesome moment right here.

755
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,190
I'm not really morally outraged
by it. I'm, maybe I'm a little,

756
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,430
but I think you might be vulnerable
if you insist that your enthusiasm for

757
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:14,130
hunting is part of the balance of
nature, but I think it's perfectly,

758
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,650
you don't have those canine
teeth for eating salad,

759
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,520
and I understand that people don't like
it any more than they wouldn't like

760
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:23,960
going and killing the lamb of
the lamb shots they eat. Well,

761
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,990
what about that doesn't mean that it's
wrong hunting. It's part of who we are.

762
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,070
Now it may be a bigger part of who
I am than you are and that's fine,

763
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,280
but when wildlife populations abound is
when they're managed by humans beings.

764
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:44,300
The alternate model might be a view
of humans that's different from yours.

765
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:49,301
I think you assume that because we are
smart and because there are so many of us

766
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,850
that inevitably we will bump into
them and when we do we will win.

767
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,100
And thus your calculations,

768
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:04,790
the alternate model might be
that because we are smart,

769
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:09,560
we might create a space where
we won't bump into them.

770
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,200
Now you're now, you're not in the real
world. We're dealing not in reality.

771
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,130
Okay, I'm, I'm living in a world that
matters. And that's real. So it's not,

772
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,310
it's not a dream scenario.
And it's not saying, okay,

773
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:24,030
well let's just create this. Unfortunately
these animals don't have that time.

774
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,120
So I'm not trying to outsmart anybody.

775
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,950
It's just a traditional
method that's worked.

776
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:34,550
And until somebody comes up with a
methodology that we could look at and say,

777
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:37,110
this is a better way,

778
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,220
I'm going to continue to fight and
believe in the traditional model.

779
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,450
So now we're going to ask
ourselves these questions.

780
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,350
How do we really on an individual basis,

781
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,730
value this animal's survival on earth?

782
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,980
Do you really value it?

783
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,840
Do you value it past making 75 characters
into your iPhone and tweeting about

784
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:05,190
it? Do you value it passed
watching animal planet? To me,

785
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,590
I know, and I care,

786
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,690
and I placed an extreme value financially,

787
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:16,410
physically, emotionally on the
survival of the black rhino.
