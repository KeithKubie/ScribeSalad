Ilia adds i deal with this that things

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460
Ilia adds i deal with this that things
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.070
Ilia adds i deal with this that things
fall apart of their own accord merely

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
fall apart of their own accord merely
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.079
fall apart of their own accord merely
because they age that that's the first

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089
because they age that that's the first
 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.210
because they age that that's the first
motif in the flood story and that's only

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220
motif in the flood story and that's only
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.709
motif in the flood story and that's only
to say that if you build something it

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
to say that if you build something it
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.780
to say that if you build something it
decays if you build something and you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
decays if you build something and you
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.100
decays if you build something and you
just leave it the hell alone

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
just leave it the hell alone
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.680
just leave it the hell alone
it will soon not work right and that's

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
it will soon not work right and that's
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.109
it will soon not work right and that's
entropy so one of the reasons that the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
entropy so one of the reasons that the
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450
entropy so one of the reasons that the
flood always threatens is merely because

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
flood always threatens is merely because
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359
flood always threatens is merely because
of entropy and you see that reflected in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
of entropy and you see that reflected in
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890
of entropy and you see that reflected in
the Egyptian story because one of the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
the Egyptian story because one of the
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.849
the Egyptian story because one of the
reasons that Osiris falls prey to Seth

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
reasons that Osiris falls prey to Seth
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.849
reasons that Osiris falls prey to Seth
is because he's old you know he was a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
is because he's old you know he was a
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.160
is because he's old you know he was a
great hero when he was young and created

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
great hero when he was young and created
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660
great hero when he was young and created
the Egyptian state like the men of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
the Egyptian state like the men of
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270
the Egyptian state like the men of
renown but now he's old and it's worse

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
renown but now he's old and it's worse
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220
renown but now he's old and it's worse
he's be willfully blind but that's the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
he's be willfully blind but that's the
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260
he's be willfully blind but that's the
next thing but the fact that he's all is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
next thing but the fact that he's all is
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750
next thing but the fact that he's all is
just to start things fall apart of their

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
just to start things fall apart of their
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.729
just to start things fall apart of their
own accord so once something is given to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
own accord so once something is given to
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.279
own accord so once something is given to
you you have to maintain it just to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
you you have to maintain it just to
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010
you you have to maintain it just to
ensure its continued existence and so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
ensure its continued existence and so
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689
ensure its continued existence and so
you actually you actually have a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
you actually you actually have a
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400
you actually you actually have a
contract with most of the things that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
contract with most of the things that
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950
contract with most of the things that
you own it's like a it's like a moral

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960
you own it's like a it's like a moral
 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930
you own it's like a it's like a moral
contract let's say you have a car

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
contract let's say you have a car
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.549
contract let's say you have a car
well you've decided that you're going to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
well you've decided that you're going to
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.390
well you've decided that you're going to
sacrifice to have the car and so you you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
sacrifice to have the car and so you you
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120
sacrifice to have the car and so you you
performed an ethical calculation but the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
performed an ethical calculation but the
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820
performed an ethical calculation but the
car was only worth the sacrifice as long

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
car was only worth the sacrifice as long
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070
car was only worth the sacrifice as long
as it functions as a car and so what

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
as it functions as a car and so what
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.750
as it functions as a car and so what
that means is that to justify the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
that means is that to justify the
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670
that means is that to justify the
sacrifice you've made to have the car

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
sacrifice you've made to have the car
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.010
sacrifice you've made to have the car
you have to maintain the car because

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
you have to maintain the car because
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.810
you have to maintain the car because
otherwise you're acting out the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
otherwise you're acting out the
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.160
otherwise you're acting out the
proposition that the thing you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
proposition that the thing you
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990
proposition that the thing you
sacrificed for actually didn't have any

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
sacrificed for actually didn't have any
 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820
sacrificed for actually didn't have any
value and so you're obliterating that as

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
value and so you're obliterating that as
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520
value and so you're obliterating that as
a useful contract and you run into the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
a useful contract and you run into the
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.899
a useful contract and you run into the
situation where the car will just

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
situation where the car will just
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749
situation where the car will just
deteriorate of its own accord and then

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
deteriorate of its own accord and then
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.580
deteriorate of its own accord and then
you won't have a car at all well so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
you won't have a car at all well so
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.069
you won't have a car at all well so
let's say how do you speed the process

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
let's say how do you speed the process
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.010
let's say how do you speed the process
by which your car deteriorates well

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
by which your car deteriorates well
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.580
by which your car deteriorates well
that's easy

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
that's easy
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740
that's easy
you're driving it along the road and it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
you're driving it along the road and it
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480
you're driving it along the road and it
starts to make a ticking noise tick tick

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490
starts to make a ticking noise tick tick
 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.370
starts to make a ticking noise tick tick
tick tick tick and you think I should go

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
tick tick tick and you think I should go
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.960
tick tick tick and you think I should go
have that ticking noise checked because

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
have that ticking noise checked because
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639
have that ticking noise checked because
you've heard it and then you think nah

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
you've heard it and then you think nah
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.240
you've heard it and then you think nah
it won't matter it's like yeah probably

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
it won't matter it's like yeah probably
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130
it won't matter it's like yeah probably
it'll matter and what does matter mean

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
it'll matter and what does matter mean
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620
it'll matter and what does matter mean
well matter is mother that's chaos to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
well matter is mother that's chaos to
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.899
well matter is mother that's chaos to
you no matter but what it means is that

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909
you no matter but what it means is that
 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030
you no matter but what it means is that
that little ticking noise is the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
that little ticking noise is the
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249
that little ticking noise is the
birthplace of time at in your car that's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
birthplace of time at in your car that's
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.660
birthplace of time at in your car that's
a good way of thinking about it is that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
a good way of thinking about it is that
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969
a good way of thinking about it is that
it's your first indication that the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
it's your first indication that the
 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.650
it's your first indication that the
dragon of chaos is going to manifest

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
dragon of chaos is going to manifest
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.100
dragon of chaos is going to manifest
itself in your car that happens when you

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
itself in your car that happens when you
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.730
itself in your car that happens when you
I've got a funny story about that so I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740
I've got a funny story about that so I
 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.530
I've got a funny story about that so I
had a friend in in graduate school

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540
had a friend in in graduate school
 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.570
had a friend in in graduate school
someone I really liked but I wouldn't

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580
someone I really liked but I wouldn't
 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.730
someone I really liked but I wouldn't
call her mikela mechanically inclined

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740
call her mikela mechanically inclined
 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.980
call her mikela mechanically inclined
let's put it that way and she had an old

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990
let's put it that way and she had an old
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.080
let's put it that way and she had an old
Honda and those things were notorious

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
Honda and those things were notorious
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.880
Honda and those things were notorious
for rusting out this is 30 years ago

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890
for rusting out this is 30 years ago
 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.410
for rusting out this is 30 years ago
when they were first produced they

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
when they were first produced they
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
when they were first produced they
weren't adapted well to Canadian winters

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190
weren't adapted well to Canadian winters
 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.550
weren't adapted well to Canadian winters
and we used to go in her car in her

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
and we used to go in her car in her
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.260
and we used to go in her car in her
Honda and it got a little on the scary

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270
Honda and it got a little on the scary
 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.090
Honda and it got a little on the scary
side because it was so rusty underneath

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100
side because it was so rusty underneath
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.430
side because it was so rusty underneath
that you can actually see through the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440
that you can actually see through the
 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.200
that you can actually see through the
floorboards and that actually made me

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210
floorboards and that actually made me
 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.970
floorboards and that actually made me
nervous because if you can see through

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
nervous because if you can see through
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.430
nervous because if you can see through
the floorboards that means that they're

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440
the floorboards that means that they're
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.230
the floorboards that means that they're
not really floorboards what they are is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
not really floorboards what they are is
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.490
not really floorboards what they are is
like rust and so I mentioned the fact

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500
like rust and so I mentioned the fact
 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.810
like rust and so I mentioned the fact
that that might be a problem to her a

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820
that that might be a problem to her a
 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.010
that that might be a problem to her a
couple of times but she was sort of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020
couple of times but she was sort of
 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.260
couple of times but she was sort of
blithe about it and one day she was

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270
blithe about it and one day she was
 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.970
blithe about it and one day she was
driving down st. Lawrence Street in

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980
driving down st. Lawrence Street in
 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.230
driving down st. Lawrence Street in
Montreal which is the main street

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240
Montreal which is the main street
 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.810
Montreal which is the main street
running roughly north and south and her

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820
running roughly north and south and her
 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.730
running roughly north and south and her
hood popped up it bent and popped up

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740
hood popped up it bent and popped up
 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.220
hood popped up it bent and popped up
spontaneously and so she was pretty

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
spontaneously and so she was pretty
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.290
spontaneously and so she was pretty
curious about that and so she was with

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300
curious about that and so she was with
 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.449
curious about that and so she was with
this friend of hers who was just as

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459
this friend of hers who was just as
 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.310
this friend of hers who was just as
clueless mechanically as she was which

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320
clueless mechanically as she was which
 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.440
clueless mechanically as she was which
is really quite remarkably clueless and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
is really quite remarkably clueless and
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.080
is really quite remarkably clueless and
so they pulled off into a service

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090
so they pulled off into a service
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.729
so they pulled off into a service
station and had the guy come out look at

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739
station and had the guy come out look at
 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.100
station and had the guy come out look at
it and well he he opened the hood

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110
it and well he he opened the hood
 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630
it and well he he opened the hood
obviously and what had happened was the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640
obviously and what had happened was the
 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.440
obviously and what had happened was the
body had fallen off the frame so and

body had fallen off the frame so and
 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.030
body had fallen off the frame so and
what had could happen was the shock

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040
what had could happen was the shock
 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.740
what had could happen was the shock
which is like supposed to be attached to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
which is like supposed to be attached to

the car had pushed up through the
 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.940
the car had pushed up through the
through the hood so literally the car

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950
through the hood so literally the car
 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.070
through the hood so literally the car
body had like fallen onto the ground and

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080
body had like fallen onto the ground and
 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410
body had like fallen onto the ground and
but she was she managed to drive the car

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
but she was she managed to drive the car
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.900

okay so look that's I wouldn't exactly

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910
okay so look that's I wouldn't exactly
 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.940
okay so look that's I wouldn't exactly
call that willful blindness because

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950
call that willful blindness because
 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250
call that willful blindness because
perhaps there was an element of willful

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260
perhaps there was an element of willful
 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.420

blindness she didn't know anything about
 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.310
blindness she didn't know anything about
mechanics but you get the point right

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320
mechanics but you get the point right
 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.979
mechanics but you get the point right
it's like let's say she would have been

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989
it's like let's say she would have been
 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.050
it's like let's say she would have been
in a fatal accident you might say well

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
in a fatal accident you might say well
 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.400
in a fatal accident you might say well
you can shake your fist at God for

the fact that you could see through the

the fact that you could see through the
 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.949
the fact that you could see through the
floorboards that's probably something

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959
floorboards that's probably something
 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.259
floorboards that's probably something
that you might have paid attention to

and so it's always the question is if
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.610
and so it's always the question is if
things fall apart around you to what

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
things fall apart around you to what
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.710
things fall apart around you to what
degree is it the mere tendency of things

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720
