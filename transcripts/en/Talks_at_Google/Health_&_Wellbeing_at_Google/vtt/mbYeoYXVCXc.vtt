[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.400
RAFAEL: Welcome, everyone
to this another episode

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.360
of Talks at Google.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.750
We're very honored to have two
fantastic speakers here today.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.570
I want to start with
Marianne, Marianne Kent-Stoll.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.590
She is the president and founder
of the Karimu International

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.030
Help Foundation.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.060
She's also the assistant
head of the Idyllwind Arts

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.070
Academy in the States.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.860
She has been an educator
for more than 30 years.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.180
And she's a mother of four.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.260
So welcome here at
the Google office.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.480
And then I have the pleasure
to actually announce

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.240
my old boss who used to be
VP at Google and at IBM.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.550
And he has a long fantastic
career in the IT space,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.410
in the tech space.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.940
He comes back today in
a different function.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.750
So he has since
left Google and has

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.380
made a career as an advisor,
as a member of, I think,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.960
six boards.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.480
But he also has, and he always
had that even back at Google,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.900
he was very involved with NGOs.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.840
This is one of them.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.256
So we're going to
be very excited.

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:12.950
We're excited about the
talk and the story here.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.710
He's an avid world traveler.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.740
I know this firsthand.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.710
He's visited more than
50% of all countries.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.290
And he is also a
family-oriented person.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.140
He's a role model
for many Googlers

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.630
here, so welcome back at Google.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.550
Please, both, take
it away from here.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.126
NELSON MATTOS: All right.

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.750
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL: Thank you,
everyone, for inviting me here.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.470
It's really my honor to be here.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.820
As Rafael said, I am
the founder of Karimu.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.980
And I work at an
arts boarding school.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.920
And my passion is for
Karimu Foundation,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.190
which my husband and
I founded in 2007.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.150
And I'm thrilled that Nelson
is now part of the Karimu team

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.390
and invited me here today.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.720
Thank you very much.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.250
NELSON MATTOS:
Thank you, Marianne.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
I'm going to skip the
little bit of my background.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.970
You already heard
enough from Rafael.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.300
Let me get right into the topic
of the presentation, which

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.550
is to give you a sense of what
is wrong with existing NGOs.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.040
And what is an
approach that I believe

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.260
is successful to do
social development.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.340
As some of you know, about one
third of the world's population

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.330
continues to live in poverty,
which is about people

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.350
that earn less than $2 a day.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.100
From this 2.4 billion
people, 70% of them

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.880
live in rural areas,
with a large majority

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.670
in sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.810
Obviously, these folks
live in these situations.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.310
Some of you have
seen these pictures

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.500
when I was here two years ago.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
All of these pictures,
including all the pictures

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.480
that you're going to see
in this presentation,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.350
are pictures that either
I took in my world travels

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.140
or that Marianne and her
volunteers took from the work

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.440
in Tanzania.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.260
So you have lack of sanitation.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.120
You can see what
this kid is doing.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.960
The other one down the
river is drinking the water.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.155
This is a typical house in the
interior of sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:21.910
or here's another one.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.570
Or this is a typical
village in some places.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.990
You also have issues
with transportation.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.810
This is a fancy
transportation in many parts

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.170
of sub-Saharan Africa with
people even on the top

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.070
or something like this.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.680
This is a feeding
station in Somalia.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.120
This girl is four
and 1/2 years old.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.410
And this is the whole hospital
where there is no nurses.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.900
The mothers or grandmothers
that take the kids there

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.930
to get fed so they
don't starve, basically

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.650
have to take care of them.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.390
So this is a situation that
actually a lot of people

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.680
live even as of today.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.840
When you look at what
are all the big issues,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.020
the big challenges
that the poor faces,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.630
you could actually
categorize the challenges

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.089
in three classes,
in three categories.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.740
And in order for you to really
take people out of poverty,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.660
you have to address
these three issues.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.560
The first one, given
that the majority of them

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.980
are living from
agriculture, they

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.700
live in the interior
of these countries,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.410
it's super important to
increase their productivity

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.360
and increase their income.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.560
Most of them have very
small pieces of land.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.870
They don't have money to buy
fertilizers and pesticides,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.410
et cetera, so their
production is very small.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.650
And consequently, their
profit is also very small.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.500
On top of that, they are
dependent on a middle man that

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.570
comes to the village
to buy their goods

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.570
and go sell in a larger market.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.820
And that middle man
is, in most cases,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.690
basically getting the
biggest profits because they

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.490
know how to handle.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.050
The second major
category is health.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.170
You have the issue of
some of these folks

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.620
not having access to
good health services

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.330
or not having the money to
pay for health services.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.470
Or if they have
an emergency, they

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.730
may not even have the means
to pay for somebody to drive

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.150
or take them into a hospital.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.820
And the third issue
is related to access

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.181
to financial services.

00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:35.680
Right?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.560
In our society,
if you need money,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.390
you actually will take a loan.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.740
We all have credit history.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.740
And it's easy for
us to get to money.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.330
However, for all of these guys
that live in the countryside

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.820
there is no banking
system available for them.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.490
They don't have credit history.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.430
And so if an emergency
happens, and they

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.910
don't have means to borrow
money or get from somebody else,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.700
they basically need to sell the
little things that they have.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.080
They may need to sell the cow
that feeds and provides milk

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.800
to the kids in the family.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.560
And now, they basically
go deeper and deeper

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.810
into this hole.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.181
And as you can see, all of
these issues are interconnected.

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:17.680
Right?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.080
If I don't have access
to financial systems,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.670
I cannot take a loan at the
beginning of my agriculture

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.180
phase and buy the necessary
fertilizer and pesticides

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.790
to increase my productivity.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.770
Similarly, if I don't
have this, and now I

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.360
have a family emergency,
I have to sell

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.330
things that are super important
for me to be able to survive.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.940
I have seen people
selling the seeds in order

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.992
to pay for the
visit to a doctor.

00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:45.450
Well, and now you
don't have seeds,

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.060
how do you produce your income?

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.040
I get asked this
question quite often.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.370
And that's why I decided to
put explicitly on the slides.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.350
Education is not a challenge.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.400
The lack of education is
really or education is really

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.830
a means to address
some of these issues.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.590
In particularly, how to
improve your own income

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.110
and how to become healthier.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.330
So while a lot of NGOs, and
including the work that Karimu

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.710
does, does focus on education,
it's really not the challenge

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.210
itself.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.930
The three biggest challenges
you really need to focus on

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.800
is income, health, and
access to financial systems.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.040
So as some of you know that
know a little bit of my history,

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.360
I have been involved in
NGOs for over 10 years

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.140
in different ways.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.720
I'm on the board
of some of them.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.250
I advise other NGOs.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.480
And I work as a
volunteer as well.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.950
And while I think it's wonderful
the work that they do, and it's

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.370
super gratifying to see the
positive impact of a project,

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.760
sometimes it's
really aggravating

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.482
when you see failures
happening on the ground.

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:59.400
And these failures are
related to a few problems that

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.640
are highly connected with the
way NGOs have been operating

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.590
until very recently.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.680
The first major problem, and
that requires a little bit

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.980
of explaining, has
to do with the fact

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.930
that there is a vacuum
between NGOs that

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.320
do the execution on the
ground and the big donors.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.440
So in the past, you
usually would have

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.450
kind of two types of NGOs--

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.150
those that are small
doing execution

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.100
on a specific country.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.140
They only focus on
a specific region.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.960
Or they focus on
a specific topic.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.961
Somebody builds schools.

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:32.919
Somebody build bridges.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.230
Somebody does hospital.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.900
Somebody helps with vaccination.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.130
And then you had middleman
NGOs, so large NGOs

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.140
that don't do the
execution, but they

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.020
build comprehensive
projects that

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.150
together brings
many NGOs together

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.750
to address all
those three issues.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.610
And somebody will
focus on health.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:54.840
Somebody will help income.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.650
Somebody will do
financial services.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.850
The NGOs define a comprehensive
project for all of them.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.340
And then work, and as
occurred in these projects

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.650
across the globe with
different NGOs that

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.000
are physically represented
in the different countries.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.322
Unfortunately, these
middlemen NGOs,

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:13.530
and Karumi Foundation is
are a good example of those,

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.520
are dying.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.620
And the main reason
is because technology

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.640
has enabled the donors
to communicate directly

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.910
with the small
NGOs on the ground.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.660
And obviously, they
also want to make sure

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.730
that every penny
that they donate

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.970
goes directly to the
impact of the projects.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.790
And for them, these
middlemen NGOs

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:38.490
are almost like a tax
on the project itself.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.100
That has created a
vacuum because even when

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.800
you do manage to
create a solution,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.480
beautiful on some country,
there is nobody now

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.660
to generalize that solution
and replicate across the globe.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.190
And what we are starting
to see is lots of one-offs.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.277
So either you see a
solution that work here,

00:09:55.277 --> 00:09:57.360
and there is nobody else
to replicate and bring it

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.800
to a different country, or
you have the issue of yes,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.370
I solved the education
problem in some place

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.110
or the financial systems
problem someplace,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.420
but there is nobody else
active in this region

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.810
to deal with health or to
deal with the income issue.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.970
And so consequences
of this problem

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.360
is you are starting to see lots
and lots of one-off solutions

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.610
that are obviously
successful, but they are not

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.040
scalable or sustainable
to really address

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.930
the problem worldwide.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.370
Or you have as point solutions
they are really not addressing

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.640
all the three challenges
that I described before.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.450
The second problem is that
the smaller NGOs do not

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.280
have the time to spend
interacting with the community

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.460
and ensuring that they
understand the peculiarities

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.260
of their culture.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.600
And also obtaining their
buy-in to different projects.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.980
The donors give them money.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.470
They want the results
as soon as possible.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.250
They don't give any money
that is not directly related

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.390
to the project.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.756
And consequently,
these guys come in.

00:10:59.756 --> 00:11:00.630
They want to execute.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.280
Then they want to move out.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.890
And obviously, if you don't
interact with the community,

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.830
if you don't involve them, if
you don't get their buy-in,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.390
the consequence
is, yeah, you may

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.350
get fantastic short-term
results, but the NGO leaves,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.800
and then everything falls apart.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.600
So midterm to long-term,
the value is gone.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.060
The positive impact disappears.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.110
Or if the long-term
impact remains,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.450
usually it happens
because now there

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.450
is a dependence on the presence
of that NGO on the ground.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.300
So as long as the NGO
is there supporting,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.130
leading, driving the
project, then you

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.370
continue to see the impact.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.825
But the moment they
leave, it will fall apart.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:40.950
So you create a dependency.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.845
And this is really bad because
if you create dependency,

00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:48.700
you really don't have
a sustainable solution.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.360
Similar to the previous
one, the smaller NGOs

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.370
don't have time to really
work with the communities

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.740
so that they have
skin in the game,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.450
so that they own the project.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.130
So they come in, usually they
bring people from the outside,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.650
execute the project,
and they move out.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.170
And so the community
is not involved,

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.130
doesn't understand the project,
does not know how to drive it,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.230
how to continue to execute.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.760
And then you have
similar issues--

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.290
lack of sustainability.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.350
Once the project is
completed, the NGO's

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.870
disconnected because
you really did not

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.170
get the community to feel
that this is their project.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.590
It is their responsibility
to maintain.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.630
You don't sustain it.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.600
Or similar to the
previous point,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.730
you do have positive
impact long-term,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.760
but now it's because
of the NGO is there

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.410
and you create a dependency.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.270
And similar to the
previous one, they also

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.300
don't have the
time and the money

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.690
to obtain trust
from the community.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.420
And this is
particularly important

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.951
when you want to change
people's behavior.

00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:01.450
Right?

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.730
If somebody for their whole life
has been working or reacting

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.490
in a certain way, and
you want to change

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.270
the way these people
operate or behave,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.940
in order for you to
help them change,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.990
they really need to trust you.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.990
They really need to
believe you know better.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.670
They really need
to know you have

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.520
good intentions, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.470
And to build trust and strong
relationships with people

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.760
take time.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.970
And that investment is
not funded by the donors

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.390
because it's not dollar that
goes directly into a project.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.630
Consequently, you see that
donors come in, but not,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.190
as you see in this
picture, spending

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.880
enough time with the
community to gain their trust.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.720
And you have exactly
the same points.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.220
Right?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.690
You may get positive results,
short-term but not long-term.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.620
Or if you do see long-term
positive results,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.900
it's because you have created
a dependency on the NGO.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.910
So summarizing, the
problems are the vacuum

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.550
that exist in terms
of replicating

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.510
the solutions because the
middle managers have disappear.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.750
And the fact that the smaller
NGOs are under the gun

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.780
to show results, and
they don't have the time

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.140
to understand the
peculiarities and the culture

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.410
of the community,
gain their buy-in,

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.140
make sure that they feel
ownership of the projects

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.120
and really trust you.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.610
And the consequences,
as I have mentioned,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.270
you end up with solutions
that don't address all three

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.400
key challenges.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.830
So you may fix health
issues, but you

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.080
didn't address the other ones.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.170
So people remain poor.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.670
Or you do fix the income
issue, but they still

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.700
don't have enough good health.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.420
Obviously, lack of scalable
and sustainable solutions.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.640
The dependency on the NGOs
to maintain long-term results

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:03.490
or the lack of long-term results
because the NGOs disappear.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.400
There is no ownership
from the community.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.610
So I have been, even though
I love the work of NGOs,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.790
I have been quite frustrated for
a long time with exactly that.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.610
And so my wife and
I were seriously

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.840
considering creating our
own NGO so that we actually

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.730
don't make those mistakes.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.920
We probably would
make other mistakes,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.360
like nobody's perfect, but at
least we would not do those.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.080
And talking to different
people that ran NGOs,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.270
and particularly talking
to an organization called

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.800
Inspire World that does organize
volunteer trips to Africa

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.120
and Asia, they
introduced me to Karimu.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.230
And by talking to
Marianne, she convinced me

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.150
to go last year to Africa as
part of the volunteer team.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.880
And when I went
there, my wife and I,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.190
and we saw the
way they operated,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.920
I was amazed to see that
none of these problems

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.210
existed with the
way Karimu operated.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.500
And that's how the
partnership started.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.860
But before I get
into that, let me

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.289
let Marianne give you a little
bit of the history of Karimu.

00:16:12.289 --> 00:16:13.580
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL: Thank you.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.260
And thank you, Nelson.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.450
I did not anticipate that
Nelson would be so taken

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.020
by the village that he would
want to join us and continue

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.920
to go to the village.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.520
Because I knew that he had been
involved with so many NGOs,

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.500
I thought, why would he
want to be involved with us?

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.140
We are relatively small.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.720
My husband and I
have full-time jobs.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.070
And we only go to this village
two weeks out of every year.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.280
But we have been going
there for 10 years.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.040
And you will be hearing
throughout my talk

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.460
kind of a mantra over and
over that without trust,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.770
without relationship,
and without learning

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.509
from the people,
nothing can happen.

00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:56.300
You know, how many of
you-- you've probably

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.020
heard this saying before, if
you give a man a fish for a day,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.210
he'll eat for a day.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.440
If you teach a man how to
fish, then he can eat for life.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.569
Well, I've kind of
added on to this,

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.569
which is I truly
believe after spending

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.510
10 years with the people
of Dareda, many of them

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.890
already know how to fish.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.839
They don't need to
learn how to fish.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.510
They just need the resources.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.510
And the model that
we ended up doing

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.020
was not something specifically
that we masterminded.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.560
We just were dropped in
this village on vacation

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.567
and realized that we
had to do something.

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:35.150
So I'm going to
backtrack a little bit

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.160
and tell you the story
of what happened.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.050
We were tourists in
Tanzania in 2007.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.050
And we did a cultural stay
in the village of Dareda.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.580
We lived with 11 children
in a kind of a brick hut

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.430
kind of structure with no
electricity and no running

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.480
water.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.150
And before we arrived
on this cultural stay,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.140
I kept getting emails from our
cultural tour operator, who

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.110
is now our director and guy on
the ground in Tanzania, saying,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.040
do you want to participate
in a school project?

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.630
And we were saying,
yeah, that sounds great.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.200
So we were envisioning
that there would

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.830
be an NGO in this village.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.180
And that Don and I would happily
come and shovel some dirt

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.070
and give a couple of hundred
dollars and be on our way.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.180
But when we arrived
at the school

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.990
and saw the deplorable
condition of the classrooms,

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:32.660
there was no windows, no doors,
200 students at this school,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.000
only two usable classrooms.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.450
So that means all different
age levels in a classroom.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.170
Right?

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.400
There were two other classrooms
that had walls but no roof

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.040
because the government
says to the villagers

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.340
if you build the walls,
we will provide the roof.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.480
Well, they'd been waiting
for years for the roof.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.620
And so the walls were
already starting to crumble.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.490
The worst of it is--

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.330
the worst of it was the toilet.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.370
There was a shallow
hole in the ground,

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.180
literally, not even a cement pit
latrine or anything like that.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.370
It looked like somebody
had taken a shovel

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.340
and dug a big hole
in it and put sticks

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.310
in some burlap sacks around it.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:19.520
And this hole in the ground was
supposed to serve 200 people.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.000
The government was going
to close the school

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.350
because, even by rural African
standards, it was not sanitary.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.730
So I looked across the yard, and
I saw this half built latrine.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.950
There were, it looked
like the possibility

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.894
of maybe having six latrines.

00:19:34.894 --> 00:19:36.560
And I said, well,
what's going on there?

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.500
And they said,
well, the villagers

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.300
started making it years ago,
but they ran out of money.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.240
And I said, well, how
much money do you need?

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.900
He said $500.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.790
And my husband and I
looked at each other.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.430
And we thought, well,
this is a no-brainer.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.030
We can give them $500
to fix the latrine.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.200
And then the school
will stay open.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.230
So we only had
$200 in our pocket

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.240
because we were very naive.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.550
We thought we could
cash travelers checks

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.020
in rural Tanzania.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.570
And it turned out that
we were just like, OK,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.250
we only have is $200 here.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:11.990
But will this do?

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.740
And we'll wire you
money when we get home.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.470
And they were just
singing and dancing.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.136
You'd think, this was
the greatest thing

00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:18.060
that ever happened.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.130
The toilet, the
toilet was mentioned--

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.140
I couldn't understand
Swahili, but the toilet

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.570
was mentioned in every
song that they made up.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.230
And so we were
getting ready to leave

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.960
and my husband tends to be
very direct because he doesn't

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.730
like to get people's hopes up.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.150
And he said to the head
teacher, Paul Yoronimo, Paul,

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.750
we have enjoyed our stay,
but we are teachers.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.184
And we have to go back to work.

00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:43.350
And we're probably not going
to come to this village

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.210
again, because this was
a trip of a lifetime

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.950
that we'd been saving for.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.560
But we will do
fundraisers at school.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.760
And we'll send the
money back to you.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.410
Well, Paul looked to my husband
with these big brown liquid

00:20:55.410 --> 00:21:00.660
eyes, grabbed his arm, and said
Mr. Don, we need your money,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.030
but you are part
of our family now.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.050
And you must come back.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.100
And so, of course, he
tugged at our heartstrings.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:14.520
And we went home and started
creating a nonprofit called

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.510
Karimu.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.120
When I look back at
that moment with Paul,

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.820
I think that was our guiding
light from the very beginning

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.850
because Paul along
with the other teachers

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.970
could have easily taken
advantage of Don and me.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.110
We were naive.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.300
We had not done any
development work.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.520
He could have said
sure, send the money.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.950
And this happens
so often in Africa

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.720
where money gets absconded with.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.280
And then the projects
don't get done.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.320
We could have been
easily taken in.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.950
But what he wanted was an
ongoing relationship with us.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.810
He didn't want just the money.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.960
And just this past
week or so ago when

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.910
we were in the
village, I was talking

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.370
to our longtime friend
Mr. [? Kayia, ?]

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.190
who's also the assistant
project manager.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.700
And I asked him about
this first visit.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.390
And I said, why were you so
insistent that we return?

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.650
And he's very adamant
and very strong.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.130
And he said if you
are not friends

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.920
and you just bring money,
if there is no relationship,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.420
you throw money in the pit.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.350
We don't want that.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.046
We don't want that.

00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:19.050
And so we went back, as I said,
and we started the nonprofit.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.410
And also being in
education we were

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.140
able to recruit 28 volunteers.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:33.210
So in the summer of 2008, we
arrived at this Ufani School

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.280
and started building the
first four classrooms.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.690
And it was there that we learned
the importance of working side

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.240
by side, of working
with the villagers,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.500
getting our hands dirty,
partnering on the construction.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.850
And not only that,
I was overwhelmed

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.740
with the amount of people that
wanted to meet with Don and me.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.440
We met with the village council.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.500
We met with doctors,
nurses, school leaders.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.950
We were invited to sit
in huts and have meals,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.710
walk the long red dirt roads.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.766
And wherever you walk, I
mean, Nelson knows this,

00:23:06.766 --> 00:23:08.640
wherever you walk,
there's a meeting going on

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.990
because you have
to go to one school

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.448
to the next there's five people
that say can I talk to you,

00:23:12.448 --> 00:23:13.440
can I talk to you.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.760
But it was through this putting
time into the relationship

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.700
and learning from them
what their life was

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.810
like, Don and I have been
coming there for 10 years.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.970
I could go there
for 20 years and not

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.910
really understand the struggles
that these people have

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.200
in their daily lives.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.220
So who am I or anybody else
to come in here and say here's

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.160
a solution to your problem
when you don't even

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.820
live there and have to deal with
the struggles that they have.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:48.000
So we continued doing this
volunteer work every summer.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.640
And over the period
of five years, ta-da!

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.980
This is Ufani School.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.930
Now, after many years,
there are 10 classrooms,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.340
two teachers' offices, three
teachers' houses, 12 pit

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.510
latrines.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:07.590
And then through going
slow on this project,

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.300
and not feeling like we have
to, as they say in Swahili,

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.890
[SWAHILI],, hurry, hurry,
hurry, not doing that,

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.230
we developed a really
strong relationship

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.990
with the teachers and
a friendship with them.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.360
And then we started supporting
professional development.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.220
Then we started buying books.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.940
Then we started hearing
about their daily challenges.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.160
We started hearing that
some of the teachers

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:33.480
couldn't get to school because
there was a little footbridge

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.630
was washed out.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.430
So they needed a bridge.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.240
So we said, OK, well, I guess
we better find a way to do that.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.330
So we partnered
with an NGO in Kenya

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.410
called Bridging the Gap
Africa and built a suspension

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.850
walking bridge.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:53.420
And what people might think
is wow, this is a small NGO

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.880
and it sounds like Marianne
and Don are all over the map.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.380
You know?

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.370
Why don't they just
focus on one thing?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.970
But again, if we go back
to we asked the villagers

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.110
to come up with a list of needs.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.930
We look at their priorities.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.680
And then we also think about the
children going to that school.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.190
If we only had focused on the
renovation of this school,

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:17.360
the attendance would not
have increased by 250%.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.410
And we also would not be
able to boast of the fact

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.620
that Ufani School now
usually goes between one

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.230
and fourth out of 150 schools.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.900
It is number one school in
terms of school environment

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.490
in a rural area.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.120
And also they're competing
with other schools in the city.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.707
So you know, if we had said
let's just do the classrooms,

00:25:38.707 --> 00:25:40.790
we wouldn't have had the
buy-in from the teachers.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.910
We wouldn't have had the
parents who we got to now

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.040
and who started wanting their
kids to come to the school.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.300
So what we realized is
this holistic approach

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.320
was all we could do.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.090
And little by
little by little we

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.820
are trying to lift the
community and create

00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.664
a sustainable empowering model
for the people that live there.

00:26:00.664 --> 00:26:02.080
NELSON MATTOS: So
let me step back

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.980
and give you a little bit of a
sense of how Karimu operates.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.570
Right?

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.740
There are three principles that
defines the model of Karimu.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.030
The first one Marianne already
pointed to is the belief

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.280
that we as outsiders
don't really

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.540
understand as deep as
we would have to what

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.840
are the needs of the villagers.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.240
And also, what would be the best
solution for those challenges?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.750
And you will see actually
some examples of that.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.000
The second is that all
projects that Karimu does

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.060
are selected together
with the village.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.860
The village councils, midwives,
the leaders in the community,

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.780
key influencers, et cetera.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.750
And so by doing that, you
are getting their buy-in

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.440
from the beginning.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.632
As part of that, they also have
to be involved in the projects.

00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:56.090
They have to get
their hands dirty.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.750
They have to work on it.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.580
And third is, obviously,
we focus on projects

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.830
and designing the
projects in such a way

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.730
that they are actually
self-sustained once completed.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.250
These three principles
are implemented

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.540
in basically three different
ways, three different points.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.460
The first one is all the
ideas, all the requests

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.890
comes from everyone.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.340
So like the Google motto,
bottoms up, all of that

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.330
gets collected.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.410
And then jointly with
the village councils,

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.340
the structure in the
community in Tanzania

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.710
is such that every village
has a village council.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.740
The village council
is basically members

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.080
from the different families
that represent those families.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.900
And there is a leader of that.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.510
So anything that the
village council decides

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.910
gets the buy-in of
all the families.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.030
And so, consequently, you have
the whole community behind it.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.300
So the priorities are
decided with them.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.810
And then Karimu
requires the community

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.300
to have three major tasks.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.877
The first one is they
need to get the commitment

00:28:02.877 --> 00:28:03.710
from the government.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.210
If we're going to
build a school,

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.180
the government has to commit
to pay for the teachers

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.850
to maintain the school
afterwards, provide

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.160
school material, et cetera.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.730
The local community has
to pay approximately 10%

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.130
of the total cost
of the construction.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.140
This is a lot of money.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.510
The Bancha School that
we are building this year

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.690
is going to cost $90,000.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:32.090
$9,000 for the couple hundred
families that are there it

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.040
is a lot of money, a lot,
a lot, a lot of money.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.250
To have you a sense, we
visit a school this year.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:44.600
And the community decided to
build toilets for the school.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.800
So they are collecting
$7 per family.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.970
There are 535 families
in this village.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.172
So $7 per family.

00:28:53.172 --> 00:28:55.130
When I talk to the head
of the village council,

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.956
he says how many of these
families are going to pay.

00:28:57.956 --> 00:29:00.080
He says, oh, I believe
there are about 300 families

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.110
can pay the $7 right away.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.470
And I ask him, what
about the other 200?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.540
He says, well, from the
other 200, there is about 100

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.410
that I'm just going
to have to go there

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.805
and nag and nag and nag.

00:29:10.805 --> 00:29:13.880
And at some point,
they will pay the $7.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.830
What about the remaining 100?

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.524
Says, they're going to run away.

00:29:17.524 --> 00:29:19.190
They're going to move
out of the village

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.890
because they don't have
enough money to pay for $7.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.430
So now you can imagine
$9,000 is really

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.580
a lot of money, which
basically means they really

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.271
need to want this.

00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:30.770
Right?

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.780
And so you get their commitment.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.970
You get their
involvement from day one.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.430
And they will treat these
projects as a jewel.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.120
Right?

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.290
They will take care.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.505
They will make sure that
this never disappears.

00:29:43.505 --> 00:29:45.767
They also need to
work on the project.

00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:47.350
So they need to get
their hands dirty.

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.230
In general for constructions,
the community-- because

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.660
of the time of the year that
we start the construction,

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.280
they usually start the project.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.950
They clean the land, and
they do all the foundations

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.910
on their own.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.640
After that, we give
the money to hire

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.630
workers that will do the rest.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.900
And then the volunteers
will come and do work

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.560
on some phase of the project.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.500
And once the projects
are complete,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.660
it's their job to
maintain and run.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.220
You go to [INAUDIBLE]
schools, you

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.260
will see parents
cleaning the corridors

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.100
and washing the floor
of the classrooms.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.080
You will see kids
and teachers working

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.990
in the field of the school.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:29.240
So it's really-- they really
have a strong ownership.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.270
So let me give you some
examples of these principles

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.470
with existing projects.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.260
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL: Well, as I
said before, there were issues

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.520
and there were barriers that
I did not even know existed.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.810
And one of them was
teachers' housing.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.000
So once we renovated
the classrooms

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.790
and we started going from
school to school renovating

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.540
classrooms, the teachers had
us meet with them and said,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.560
we are not going to be able to
attract teachers unless they

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.300
have adequate housing.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.560
The government had agreed that
they would give more teachers

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.930
to these overcrowded schools.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.400
They're really overcrowded.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.710
For example, the
kindergartens are only

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.710
supposed to have 20
students in there.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.020
There are 60 in each
kindergarten session.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:21.340
In the fifth grade, there
are 75 students in a class

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.850
in one of the schools
that I visited.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.170
So then we thought,
OK, well, again, we

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.320
got the village buy-in.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.440
And this was what a
teacher was living in.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.670
Now, if you are living in
Arusha or Dar es Salaam,

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.670
you're a
university-educated person.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.100
Do you think you want to
come and live in a mud hut?

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.010
It would be like one of
you saying, oh, yeah,

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.285
I'll go to Switzerland.

00:31:46.285 --> 00:31:49.060
Oh, here's a trailer
for you to live in.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.860
And you wouldn't
want to do that.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.190
So we honored their
professionalism

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.490
by renovating the
teachers' houses.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.450
At Ayalagaya Secondary School,
there are three two-and-ones.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.700
That means a family
can live here,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.310
and a family can live there.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.870
And again, they had to come
and help build that house.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.290
And the other thing
that we learned about--

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.810
this is a very
interesting project.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.830
In 2009, we did a
survey, and we discovered

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:25.960
that actually, the number one
killer in that village area

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.450
was respiratory disease
for adults, not malaria.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.240
That's generally children
that have that issue.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.550
But respiratory disease.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:38.260
And the reason is that
the villagers are cooking

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.840
over open fires,
or they're often

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.910
cooking in shacks
like this where

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.400
they're breathing in the smoke.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.690
And when we got the
results of that survey,

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.830
we asked them what's
going on here.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.880
And they said, well,
if we had a kitchen

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.340
with fuel-efficient
stoves-- they're big,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.489
aluminum cylinders,
and you can put

00:32:59.489 --> 00:33:01.030
in a quarter of an
amount of the wood

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.520
that you would for an open fire.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.920
And they're not
breathing that smoke.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.700
And also, you can cook more
food with these fuel-efficient

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.480
cylinders so the children
can not only have lunch,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.610
but they can also
have breakfast.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.940
And what I didn't
realize is just

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.760
by doing this
fuel-efficient stove,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.740
it could not only
provide more food

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.130
for the students,
less firewood, which

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.110
means they're buying
less firewood,

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.990
and that money can go towards
buying books and pencils

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.940
and repairing classrooms.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.950
And then also, the
health of the cooks

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.820
would be greatly improved.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.880
It broke my husband's
heart every year

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.490
when he would see Faustino
and Peter, the same cooks that

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.440
had been there for
10 years, cooking

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.400
in a black shack with their
eyes red and coughing.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.770
The other thing that
we came to realize--

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.000
that in the village already,
there was a woman named Tumaini

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.300
who was building these small
fuel-efficient stoves--

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.040
not really because
she was thinking

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.370
about respiratory disease, but
because this is an efficient

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.560
way, if you're boiling
a pot of beans,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.230
just to have some coals
or a little bit of wood.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.570
And then you don't have
to start a big fire.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.880
But she was running
this stove operation

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.260
where the profits were
going to her women's group.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.650
But also, a small percentage
was going to the orphans.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.070
And then she is also
training students

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.110
that may not be able to
go to secondary school,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.290
because that's incredibly
difficult for students

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.290
sometimes who are
very poor not to be

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.100
able to get to school often,
and they have to stay home.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:39.460
So she's training them to
make these stoves so that they

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.929
can have a profession.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.110
So as you see, what was
great about this project--

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.750
it took a few years,
because it took

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.780
a while, as Nelson was saying,
to change that behavior.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.590
Peter and Faustina, they
were in that black shack.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.441
And I said, why aren't you
cooking in the kitchen?

00:34:56.441 --> 00:34:58.690
And they said, well, we do
the tea in the black shack.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.010
And I said no, no, no.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.730
We'll get you a smaller stove.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.810
We know you have those big ones.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.940
We'll give you a little
one so you can do the tea.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.040
So while we were
changing that behavior

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.140
and working on the
kitchen, we also

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.590
were supporting this more
comprehensive project, which

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.340
the two are coming together.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.410
So not only were we learning
to see the situation in a more

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.220
broad, comprehensive
way, but Tumaini now

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.110
is helping the village
and the school students.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.280
So I love the interconnectivity.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.160
The other thing
about the school is

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.430
that the schools don't receive
any government funding.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.750
Or what they do is so small,
as the head of Ayalagaya said,

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.040
it's a joke.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.630
It's something like $5 a month
to maintain the school and all

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.350
the repairs and everything.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:51.220
And so the teachers
have to find a way

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.990
to maintain the school on their
own and do their own repairs.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:36:00.460
So what they told us is that if
we built a water irrigation--

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.660
this is not--

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.130
when people think
of Africa, they

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.530
think it's very arid and dry.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:09.130
But this area actually
has a lot of water,

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.810
this particular school area.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:11.920
Not all areas.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.800
But they had too much water,
so they needed an irrigation

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.350
channel to be able
to redirect that.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.320
That's something that Don and
I would not have thought of.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:26.140
And for the cost of $1,500,
this enabled the school

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.670
to start producing crops which
then would mean that it would

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.460
provide school lunches,
which then means

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.360
they could sell the crops and
then buy their school supplies.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.410
So for me and Don and for Nelson
and anybody else who joins us,

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.700
I feel like I'm learning
things all the time.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.880
I think it's very
exciting to learn

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.640
how resilient these people are
and the solutions that they

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.870
come up with.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.500
NELSON MATTOS: So as you
can see, in terms of--

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.400
it's super important to work
together with the community.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.560
Almost nobody will
come up with the idea

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.130
of building an irrigation
system to a school.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:07.180
So unless you are spending
enough time there and listening

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.640
to the locals, you
will come up with ideas

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.960
that actually don't work.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.322
Similarly, you come
in and say, oh,

00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:15.280
I'm going to rebuild the
school, you will never

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.660
think that unless you have
reasonable teachers' houses,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.966
you're not going to
attract good teachers.

00:37:21.966 --> 00:37:23.590
And if you don't
attract good teachers,

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.470
OK, you have a nice building,
but the quality of the studies

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.170
remain extremely bad.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.750
And similarly, as
Marianne talked about,

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.150
it's super important for
you to spend enough time

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.680
and build a trust
so that you can

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.200
force them to change behavior.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.170
All of us, actually, that
don't cook in open fire

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.990
probably think it's stupid
to be cooking in an open fire

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.030
and burn your eyes.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.109
But many of you
have grandparents,

00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:52.900
and probably you're
never going to convince

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.640
them to use a microwave.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.030
Because they have
learned to cook

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.200
on a stove for their whole life.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.280
Why would they use a microwave?

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.130
Similarly, these
people have cooked

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.930
in open fire their whole life.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.270
They have never seen a stove.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.520
So how do you convince them?

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.340
How do you get them to
change the way they operate?

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.240
So that takes time, and
it's a lot of hand-holding

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.790
that you have to do.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.210
And unless you spend enough time
and build that strong trust,

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.740
you really don't
accomplish that.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.220
So obviously, Karimu has done
many, many, many projects

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:28.720
there.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.590
So let me very quickly
run through some examples.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.960
Since 2008 to 2015,
they built and renovated

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.550
four different schools.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:44.800
The enrollment has
increased by more than 250%.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.220
So that gives you a sense
of the number of students

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.590
that were not attending
school, because their parents

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:51.950
felt it's not worth it.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:53.690
This building is falling apart.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.850
There is no food.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.740
The quality of the
teacher is pretty bad.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.750
So why should I waste my time?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:03.760
This kid can help me
increase my income

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.070
through producing more crops.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.250
Here are some of the
examples of the schools.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.820
This is very
typical, and we have

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.380
seen two more schools
this year that

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.690
are exactly in this situation.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:17.920
This is a classroom.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.260
In addition to that, they
have built a gazillion school

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.280
toilets from something like
this to something like this.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.600
There has been,
as Marianne said,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.960
kitchens built in
several schools.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.220
We have seen as a
consequence of that

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.940
the performance of the
students improve dramatically.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.130
Obviously, these
guys come to school

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.020
without having eaten anything.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.020
So the fact that the school
provides breakfast and lunch,

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.520
they now can pay
attention to what

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.470
is being said in the classroom.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.500
Attendance significantly
higher, because there

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.600
is high motivation
for the parents

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.340
to send their kids to school.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.440
And obviously, with
that, the enrollment

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.920
also has been increased
significantly.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.250
Teachers' housing, huge impact.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.770
On average, teachers
in that region

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.650
would spend two, maximum
three years in the school

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.300
and obviously run away.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.780
Now the average is
going up to 10 years.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.320
Because they have nice houses,
the environment is great,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.730
they don't want to leave.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:25.210
And obviously, the best
teachers then end up remaining.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.360
What is most impressive
is in Tanzania,

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.120
kids in their fourth
grade and seventh grade

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.510
have to take a national exam.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.910
If you don't pass, you cannot
progress in your study.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.180
So if you don't pass
in the fourth grade,

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.040
you can not go to fifth grade.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.260
If you don't pass the
7th grade, you will not

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.720
go into secondary school.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.290
Before the houses were
built, the schools

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.940
in this area, the success rate
on this exam was below 50%.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.490
It's now above 85%.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.610
And the school that we
rebuilt this year, it's 95%.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:04.850
This is really impressive
for a rural school.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.390
And this is a teacher.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.730
This is what his
house used to be.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.250
And now he lives in this house.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.950
So now you can imagine that
this guy is highly motivated

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.690
to stay in this area and
help improve the school.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.610
They have done lots of
projects around education,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:26.390
providing textbooks, sending
volunteers to teach at schools.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.470
I gave some classes last year.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.460
They have also funded for their
development for the teachers.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.460
They pay 75% of the cost.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.940
The teachers have to
pay 25% on their own.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.150
And obviously, this has not
only helped the retention

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.400
of the teachers,
but also increased

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.530
the performance of the school.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:52.220
Several projects around bringing
clean water into the villages

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.930
as well as into schools.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.440
This is very typical
what you see.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.930
This year, we visit a village--

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.480
very, very poor, dry.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:06.590
There are places where the kids
and the families can get water.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.910
The closest from the village is
two kilometers going downhill.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:16.460
I saw an 8-year-old girl with
her five-year-old brother

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.760
carrying a bucket of
this size on her head.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.430
I ask her how often
she does that,

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.110
and she very
casually said, oh, I

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.490
do it three times
in the morning,

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:29.630
four times during the day,
and two times in the evening.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.330
So walking that
distance with this water

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.170
means this girl has no
way of going to school.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.690
What is also interesting
is the moment you bring

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.560
clean water into the
school, the absence rates

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.910
gets reduced dramatically.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:48.110
Because obviously, kids are
not drinking unsanitary water.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.880
And consequently, they are not
as sick as they were before.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.650
The clean stoves that
Marianne already talked about.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.000
Lots of infrastructure projects.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.260
This bridge was particularly
important in the rainy season.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.240
This river floods.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.120
And so instead of taking
two hours for people

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.520
to walk to school, with the
bridge, it takes 15 minutes.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:18.870
The attendance rate in the rainy
season went up from 35% to 91%.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.040
So imagine during three
months of the year,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.140
you have the attendance at 35%.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.780
These kids cannot catch up.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.290
In addition to that,
there is traffic of goods

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.700
that goes through this bridge.

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.170
And if the river is flooded,
the families that have harvest

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.690
during that time of the
year, they cannot sell.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:44.810
Or they have to pay somebody
to go around the river.

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:48.950
Help with creating a room
for people to give birth,

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:54.620
bring a solar panel for that,
many projects around health

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.710
in terms of trying to
reduce the mortality

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:03.110
rate in the region, also
education in general

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:07.850
about hygiene and
sanitation and diseases

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.900
that are easy to avoid,
like diarrhea, et cetera.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:19.160
Also, distribution of
donations and material.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.970
Another very important
project in the financial area

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.360
was the support for
creation of savings groups.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.870
Savings groups are
self-organized organizations.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:32.680
As you can see here, I'm meeting
with different villagers.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.330
They meet on a regular basis.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:37.450
Everybody contributes
a certain amount.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:41.960
That becomes a part that people
then can use to borrow money.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.290
And so if I need to buy
fertilizer or somebody got

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.570
sick, that will be my bank.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:48.940
I can go to that, and I
will then obtain the loan.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.740
And by doing that,
the families basically

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.590
are helping each other
address their financial needs.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:58.120
This is actually quite common
in the developing world.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.940
What is interesting--
just to see this.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.610
The fact that they now
have access to finance,

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.100
the members of this community
that have been there

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.690
for three years triple their
income because of the access

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.940
to financial means.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.450
The last year, that I
joined as a volunteer,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.540
in addition to education and
training for the midwives,

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.710
we built the maternity clinic.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.520
This is extremely important,
because mortality rate

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.370
in these parts of the
world are very high.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.030
Infant mortality is seven
times higher than in the US,

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:36.280
and maternal mortality is
28 times higher than the US.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.120
So by now, having
this maternity clinic,

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.370
39,000 people are being served.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:46.300
And women can come
here to give birth.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.370
And this is the
maternity clinic today.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:53.350
We just saw it operating
with a little hospital, kids

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.930
taking vaccination.

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.560
There is doctors
and nurses there.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.980
This year, we had 27
volunteers that went with us.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.280
We had several projects
running in parallel.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.160
A teacher from California
organized classes

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.350
in all schools
for arts, science,

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:15.610
and interactive learning
with different subjects.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:20.200
A family from California that
owns a solar panel company

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.080
came and actually installed
solar panels in all schools

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.500
and in the maternity clinic.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.140
So the maternity clinic
now is fully equipped,

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:31.180
can run the equipments that
are necessary, et cetera.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.520
My brother, who
is a sports freak,

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.720
organized a sports
competition with 120 kids.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.770
This was a huge success.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:43.870
We taught IT to all
of the teachers,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:48.670
taught them Google Docs,
registered everybody in Gmail,

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.050
also on Facebook.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.960
So now we can continue
remotely bringing

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.680
new information and new
educational material for them.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.500
And we set up a learning
center in the secondary school

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.370
that all the teachers will
be able to access the news.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.130
The biggest project
was the reconstruction

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:07.420
of the Bacho Primary School.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.510
This is how the
school looked before.

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:13.630
This is a classroom
with no electricity.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.700
How can you actually
even see what the teacher

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.330
is writing on the blackboard?

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.550
And this is the
third of the school.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:23.260
The school is being built in--

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:24.580
there are three buildings.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.240
The first one has
just completed.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.210
We as volunteers finished this.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:31.450
We have just to do the painting.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:36.070
And these are three classrooms
and the teacher's office.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:40.010
And in the rest, we worked
on the second building.

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:44.500
We set the foundations
as well as the walls.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.900
So in summary, as
I had mentioned,

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.340
the traditional development
is having a lot of challenges.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.020
Because the way they used to
operate with middlemen NGOs

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.420
that allow them to
spend enough time

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.450
and create comprehensive
solutions are dying out.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:03.340
And consequently,
you are not being

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:08.170
able to have the impact that you
used to have with nonprofits.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.422
Karimu avoids that
by, as I said,

00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:12.880
believing that the
villagers really

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.340
understand their problems
and working with them,

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.200
forcing them to not only
define the projects,

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.630
but having a skin in the
game and contributing

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.640
to the projects,
working on them,

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.050
maintaining them, getting
the government support,

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.520
and ensuring that the
projects are self-sustainable.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:39.490
Moving forward, now that I
joined forces with Marianne,

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:42.370
we are going to
really be expanding.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.740
Those of you that
know me, I tend

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.940
to do multiple
things in parallel.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:50.380
So we're going to be running
multiple large projects

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.120
at the same time.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.970
We have just hired
another person

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:56.380
that is going to
be on the ground

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.640
so that we can execute these
projects throughout the year.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.480
We are going to be also
expanding beyond the district

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.960
that we are currently operating.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.420
When we were there, we met
with the head of the region.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:11.280
It's like the state in Tanzania.

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.380
They are super committed
in support to us.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.870
They were super impressed
with the projects.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.430
And they are going to help.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.650
The government is going
to help us give us

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:21.900
the priority of what
should be the next two

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.150
districts for us to operate.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.270
And we are, in parallel,
building a three

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:29.220
to five-year strategic plan.

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.710
After we do a complete
assessment of the area,

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.940
identifying what are all the
places needing water, what

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:36.870
are all the schools that
need bathrooms, what

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.690
are all the schools that
need teacher's housing,

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:41.490
et cetera, so that we
can comprehensively

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.370
start addressing all these
problems at the same time.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:49.650
And I already mentioned the
support from the government.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:55.060
Let me skip the
projects for next year.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.170
And in addition to
finishing the school,

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.730
we are going to be
focusing heavily

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.800
on bringing clean water to two
villages that have no water.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.780
I told you the story
about the girl,

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.570
and also the schools
on these villages

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:12.270
trying to rebuild them.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:15.090
There is many opportunities
for you guys to get involved.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:18.360
I hope I have touched the
hearts of some of you.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.090
If you would like
to experience what

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.080
it is to do some really hands-on
volunteer work, join us.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.490
We go to Africa, to Tanzania
every year between mid June

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.350
to early July.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:33.740
And you're going to work side
by side with the villagers.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.070
It's going to be a wonderful
cultural experience.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.790
If you feel insecure,
don't worry about it.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.240
We use an organization
I had mentioned before,

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.570
Inspire Worldwide.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.440
They are specialized in
organizing volunteer tours

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.420
for Africa and Asia.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.120
They handle your
safety, transportation,

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.060
all the logistics, where we
stay, et cetera, et cetera.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.950
If you have any questions,
you can ping me,

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:02.670
or you can send an email
directly to Karimu Foundation.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.750
Obviously, if you don't feel
like joining as a volunteer,

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:06.750
help us.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:11.760
You can donate by going to
www.karimufoundation.org.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.620
And one thing I would
like to emphasize

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.230
is that every single
penny you will donate

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.980
is going to go to the projects.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.700
Dawn, Marianne, as
well as the folks

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.120
that she has on the ground
work for free, like me.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.920
We don't get a single penny.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.650
The volunteers that
also go once a year,

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:30.330
they pay all their expenses.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.190
So every dollar you
donate are going

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:34.890
to be used for the projects.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.910
I want to use this opportunity
to thank many, many Googlers

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.250
that actually have contributed
to the reconstruction

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:42.550
of [INAUDIBLE] School.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:47.770
I was really touched by the
fact that we had 181 Googlers

00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:50.460
and ex-Googlers that
came forward and actually

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.720
helped us collect enough
money to really reconstruct

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.040
the school.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.620
And I hope people will
continue to help us,

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.570
because there is a
lot more to be done.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:01.865
Thank you very, very much.

00:52:01.865 --> 00:52:03.240
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL:
And I'd like

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.750
to say thank you to all of you.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.820
You've been a
wonderful audience.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.130
And I want to thank Nelson.

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:10.680
As many of you know,
he's a powerhouse.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.680
And I really admire that in him.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.650
But what I admire most of all
is that Don and I welcomed him

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:18.280
to this project.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.070
We are pretty picky,
because we want

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.980
people that have
cultural sensitivity

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.960
and that are really
compassionate.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.060
Being smart is
fantastic, but you've

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.180
got to have the heart
as well as the brain.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.370
And you also have
to have patience

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:33.690
and be willing to listen.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.110
And he's all of those things.

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.590
So thank you very much.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:37.410
And thank you.

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:38.890
This is wonderful being here.

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:39.780
Thank you very much.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.724
RAFAEL: Thank you so much
for the inspiring talk.

00:52:41.724 --> 00:52:42.210
Thank you.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.501
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL: Thank you.

00:52:43.501 --> 00:52:45.126
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:50.810
RAFAEL: So maybe have time
for one or two questions.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:53.240
And since I know
Nelson personally,

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.360
I actually want to ask you a
personal question if I may.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.830
You look back to a very
successful tech career.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:03.170
You retired from Google.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:05.870
You could be sitting on a
sailing boat in the Caribbean

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.940
and enjoy retirement.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.390
Maybe you do this.

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:10.640
NELSON MATTOS: I do that, too.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.930
RAFAEL: Exactly.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.730
I saw you on a couple
of those pictures

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:17.810
with really dirty hands,
like literally dirty hands.

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:21.680
How does that feel, and what
does it give you personally?

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.840
NELSON MATTOS: It's
extremely difficult

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.480
to describe what
you feel when you

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.540
are doing volunteer work,
particularly hands-on volunteer

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.150
work in this area.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:35.450
All I can tell you is
it's extremely gratifying.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.970
It's extremely satisfying.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.480
The eyes of the
people there, the way

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:46.190
they thank you, the way they
show gratitude for what you do,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.810
is so fulfilling.

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:53.180
It's impossible to walk away.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.030
I came to Tanzania this
year for the second time.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.460
So there was a lot of
people that I have met.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.250
And it was an
incredible feeling.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.650
The moment I was
arriving in the village,

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.470
I was feeling like
I'm back home.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.080
And people were coming to
me, and how's your son,

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.390
and how's your wife,
and what about this,

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:12.100
and what about that.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.920
We are fortunate.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.890
We in the developed
countries have grown in a way

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:22.240
that we have distanced
ourselves from our communities.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.230
And they are extremely tight.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:26.730
And the moment you
arrive there, you

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.000
are part of their community.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.310
You are part of their family.

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:36.540
We tend to focus on us
first, second the family,

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.990
third the community.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.140
They are exactly the
opposite-- community first,

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.170
my family second, me
as a person third.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:49.120
And it's incredible to see
somebody making a decision that

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.650
is not the best for
them personally,

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.110
but it's the right thing
to do for the community.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.650
We would never do that.

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:59.510
When we arrived this year-- and
last year was the same thing--

00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:02.940
you get to the institute where
we actually stay overnight.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.220
About 300 meters
from the institute,

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:08.790
there were probably 1,000
people waiting for you.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.080
And you get out of this bus.

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.490
Everybody is dancing.

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:15.080
Everybody is singing,
welcoming you.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.280
And you are walking
along this path.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.800
There is the traditional
dancers dancing

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.510
their traditional things.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.470
You walk a little bit.

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.570
There is the choir
from the church,

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:26.520
and then the choir
from the school,

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.560
and then the midwives all
thanking you and welcoming you

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.420
back home.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:36.060
So you really feel like you
are the sun that is coming back

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.850
home for five to six years.

00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:40.200
It's impossible.

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.744
I don't want to talk some more
because I will start crying.

00:55:42.744 --> 00:55:43.410
RAFAEL: Exactly.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.493
I think it's very telling.

00:55:44.493 --> 00:55:45.750
That's exactly why I asked.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.610
It sounds like it's
very rewarding for you.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.130
And that's very impressive, and
I think touches a lot of us.

00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.213
Thank you so much, Nelson.

00:55:51.213 --> 00:55:53.610
Maybe the final question
to you, Marianne.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.110
So from listening
to all of this,

00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:57.990
it sounds like you
established maybe a best

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:00.870
practice in how to do this.

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.090
That's how I understood
what you're saying here.

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:05.230
I wonder, in terms
of vision and future,

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.130
do you personally think
you want to stay at that,

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.590
and you maybe want to grow
Karimu as it is today,

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.050
or would you even
see potentially maybe

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:16.440
to roll out those best
practices for other NGOs

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.410
and maybe grow, in
a sense, the method?

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.990
MARIANNE KENT-STOLL: I think
that's an excellent question.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.250
There's a company
called Quantify

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:29.400
in Santa Cruz that has been
giving us a $20,000 matching

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.990
grant every year.

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:34.170
And they have
endorsed this model.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.080
But the owner, Ken
Terry, always says

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.800
you should mentor other
people, because you

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.350
could have replicated
models in other villages.

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.720
And it does take
time, because you

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.330
have to stay in this
same community--

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:54.300
not creating dependency because
you don't stay in one school,

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.380
but you move from
school to school,

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.770
from medical center to
other medical center.

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:02.380
But you have to stay
in that community.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:07.080
So I would like to
expand, but like this.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:11.580
And also, I would like to be
able to mentor other people.

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.180
And this summer, we had the
opportunity to mentor David

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:18.060
Newman and his wife,
Laura, who came and stayed

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.140
some time in the village.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.410
Because they just started an
NGO, and they want to know how

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:23.040
we do it.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.630
And they watched us
for about five days.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:28.290
And it was very, very
gratifying to have

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:32.080
them ask us questions, to walk
with us through the village.

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.610
So I'd like to continue
replicating that model,

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:40.680
with the idea with small
things, with concentrated work,

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.130
you can do really,
really great things.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.130
NELSON MATTOS: Let me add
to what Marianne said.

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.280
I think Karimu has two goals.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.730
In addition to increase
the impact in this region

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:54.467
and slowly expand graphically,
the second big role--

00:57:54.467 --> 00:57:56.550
and I think this is probably
what will be the most

00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:57.500
powerful--

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.090
is to create a new model
for social development.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.930
Given that the existing
model is falling apart,

00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:08.460
become a showcase of how you can
be doing successful development

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.360
work and hopefully have
many, many other NGOs falling

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.770
exactly the same principle.

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:15.690
RAFAEL: Wonderful.

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.719
Thanks again so much for
sharing this with us,

00:58:17.719 --> 00:58:19.260
and the trust, and
everything you do.

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.030
Thank you so much.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.780
