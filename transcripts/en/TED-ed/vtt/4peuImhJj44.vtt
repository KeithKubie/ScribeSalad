00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:10.239
A shooting star crashes on Earth,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.139
and a hideous blob emerges.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.025
It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.185
It’s also unstoppable:

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.645
weapons, fire, extreme temperatures…

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.385
no matter what you throw at it,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.275
it just regrows and continues its rampage.

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.475
Its expansion is breathtaking;

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.135
it doubles in size every hour.

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:34.215
But there’s one opportunity:

00:00:34.215 --> 00:00:37.135
after each hour, it goes to sleep,

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:39.635
forming itself into a flat triangle

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.705
and resting for a few minutes

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:45.415
before it begins eating and growing again.

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:47.415
Your only chance to save the planet

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:53.395
involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission
ray that can cut through the blob.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:54.871
When the blog is active

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.101
it heals itself within seconds.

00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:00.881
However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles,

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.011
you make a critical discovery.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:05.421
The acute triangle portion,

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:09.751
with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.589
It never “wakes up.”

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:12.959
The obtuse triangle,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.539
which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees,

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.219
wakes up as usual and keeps growing.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.519
Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles,

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.136
including right triangles, 
will also wake up.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:27.506
For the next few minutes,

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:31.466
the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.126
You can make clean, straight-line cuts

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.696
between any two points 
on or inside the triangle.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:42.356
But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:45.266
By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.216
the blob will have consumed 
the entire world,

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:52.756
if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains.

00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:56.454
How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.084
and stop it from destroying the planet?

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.274
Pause the video now 
to figure out for yourself

00:02:01.274 --> 00:02:02.607
Answer in 3

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:05.307
Answer in 2

00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:07.467
Answer in 1

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.595
While this seems doable at first,

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:14.505
there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles.

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:17.825
Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge,

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:22.785
it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles.

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:27.675
That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:30.355
But as with so many of life’s problems,

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:33.485
we can look to pizza for inspiration.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.835
Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza,

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:39.975
so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon.

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:41.805
When we cut it into slices,

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.345
each of the eight triangles is acute.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.695
This works with larger polygons too.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:51.655
Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides,

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.785
including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.792
That’s good news,

00:02:56.792 --> 00:03:00.742
because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle,

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:04.392
a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.232
And just like a pizza,

00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:10.782
you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles.

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.808
That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert.

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:17.308
You’ve saved the day!

00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.318
Now you just need to figure out what to do

00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:22.948
with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.
