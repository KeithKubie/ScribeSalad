Hi, my name is Steve Souders.

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:09.067
I work at Google, and I'll be
speaking at Google I/O

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:10.901
which is happening
at the end of May,

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.901
the 27th and 28th
up in San Francisco.

00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:17.267
And I work in Web performance.
I'm the creator of YSlow.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.067
I wrote a book
a couple years ago

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.234
called
"High Performance Web Sites,"

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:25.067
and I'm actually
just finishing up a second book.

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.400
And writing a book
is a long process.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
This one took over a year,
a lot of research.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.234
There's a lot of moving parts.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.734
And luckily,
most of that is behind me,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:37.067
and I'm entering one of the last
phases of getting a book out,

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:39.067
which is called
"pimping the book."

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.400
So I'll be honest,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
I'm here partly
to pimp the book.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.067
I also want to spread these
performance best practices.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.067
But the way I do that
is by going around

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:51.901
and talking about the best
practices in my next book,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.901
"Even Faster Web Sites."

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.234
So what I typically do
is I'll go to--

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:58.567
You know, I write blog posts.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.834
I release software
related to the book.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.400
But I also go to conferences,
and I do talks.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.234
I don't want to do the same talk
over and over and over again.

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:09.400
So this book,
just like my previous one,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.901
is a collection of about a dozen
performance best practices.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.567
And I'll pick three or four
of those to talk about

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:18.567
at any given conference
and mix it up a little bit.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.901
And I'm happy to say
I've been holding off

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.901
on talking about one of these
performance best practices

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.901
until Google I/O,

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.400
and that one is called
"Going Beyond Gzipping."

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.400
And the key behind this one
is an observation.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.567
So this rule
is actually written.

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.067
The chapter is authored by my
office mate here at Google,

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:39.400
Tony Gentilcore.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.734
And what he discovered is,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.067
we know that compression
is really important,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:45.734
the compression
of text responses,

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.734
like HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:53.234
But it turns out that about 15%
of the world's population

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:55.567
does not get
compressed responses,

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.434
even though
their browsers support that.

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.400
So come out to Google I/O.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.901
Come to my talk,
"Even Faster Web Sites,"

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.567
and find out why 15%
of the world

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:08.734
doesn't get compressed responses
and what you can do about it.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:09.667
Thanks.
