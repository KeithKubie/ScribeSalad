00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.050
AMRE MOUSSA &gt;&gt; I am Amre Moussa, the Secretary
General of the Emirate of Arab States. I wish

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.420
to respond to the issue pertaining to the
change in the world under the assumption by

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.759
Mr. Obama of the office of the President of
the United States. I believe that there will

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:32.509
be a lot of change by Mr. Obama as he promised
in-ah-before his election and as he has shown

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.500
that he acted, he moved quickly after-ah-getting
to the white house.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:49.690
The change has to come first through the system
that was based on the feeding-the hatred between

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.190
the western Islam, according to the theories
of the new conservatives that has moved a

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.100
lot of the diplomatic moves of the previous
American administration. This has-has to come

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.430
to an end to be affected by the change conformed
by President Obama. Not a question of clash

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.180
of civilizations. It's not a question of the
priority given to the so-called terrorism

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:25.119
so that everything now is being-you can accuse
any policy of being supporting-supporting-ah-terrorism

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.049
just because they oppose the policy of Israel
or the policy of the United States under the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.880
last administration.
So, a lot of change will have to be effective

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.770
in the way, in the philosophy, in the concept
behind the policy that's involved.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.500
Number two, they have to make good of the
promises given by the-ah-person of the United

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.229
States. We have lost it in 2008. There was
no-ah-fulfillment of the promises given that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.200
2009-the end of 2008 a panacea seemed to be
established alongside the _____. Nothing of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.630
this happened, and not only that nothing-that
we have failed in this-but there was no work.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.291
The work was to procrastinate, to delay and
perhaps to the Arabs that there be-that there

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.500
is some work and some meetings and people
are talking to each other, kissing each other,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.100
etc. But there was no substantive work, none.
Therefore we need to have serious work in

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.400
order to put an end to the miserable situation
of the Palestinian question and the situation

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.750
in Europe.
A Palestinian state will have to be established.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.830
Let us make the year 2009 a year of action
and a year of progress and a year of success

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.450
after 2008 has been the year of procrastination,
of delay and of failure.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.650
Now, in addition to the political side, the
economic side. There was a failure in the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.970
economic system, a failure in the international
system that serves the-the economic-ah-international

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:11.820
communications. And in changing that system
and in working together to deal with the may-the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.580
calamity-of the financial crisis I have to
believe we might and I believe that change

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.640
has to go in this direction, that is, third
world countries, poor countries, least available

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.010
countries will have to be put in the picture.
Their interests will have to be borne in mind.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.090
The system, the world is not only a world
of the rich, but a world of the rich, of the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.430
poor and individuals.
