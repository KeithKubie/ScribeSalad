00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.203
Human scrotum stretched over
a T-shirt cannon Donald Trump...

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:06.706
(laughter and groaning)

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.941
...swept to victory in his home
state of New York this week,

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:10.977
and Boing Boing celebrated
by posting a video

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.279
of one of his speeches
that they... This is amazing.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.515
They altered this just enough
to make it funnier.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.283
So, comedians,
did they slow it down

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.052
by 50%
to make him sound drunk,

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.255
or replace every mention
of the phrase "build a wall"

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:24.757
-with "Build-a-Bear?" Adam.
-(laughter)

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.693
Uh, it definitely replaced
every mention of the phrase

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.429
"build a wall"
with "Build-a-Bear.”

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.431
-'Cause he already seems drunk
all the time. -WETTERLUND: Yeah.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.698
It takes no work.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.400
HARDWICK: Well,
that's not the correct answer,

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.702
but I'm about to show you
how amazing,

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.340
if you'd just slow him down
by 50%, how this turns out.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.643
(slowed-down):
These are guys that study...

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.044
You know what?

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:46.979
They're so close to it.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:51.050
Did you ever get
so close to a deal...

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.220
or a job that you don't...

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.888
You see it.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:58.624
-(laughter, applause, cheering)
-I don't care!

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:02.195
I don't care.
I no longer care.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.364
(laughter)

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:07.100
-Yay.
-Wow.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.068
That is why drunk uncles
love Donald Trump--

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.636
they make fun of them.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.506
It's like, "Go home, Uncle
Donald-- Thanksgiving is over.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.441
-HARDWICK: Why?
-It's 1:00 a. m.

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.611
Then I'll build the wall myself.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.244
I don't (bleep) need it.
