00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 align:start position:0%
what you guys did for them right so if
 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
what you guys did for them right so if
we<00:07:09.580><c> take</c><00:07:10.150><c> a</c><00:07:10.210><c> step</c><00:07:10.330><c> back</c><00:07:10.659><c> um</c><00:07:10.870><c> first</c><00:07:11.680><c> of</c><00:07:11.830><c> all</c><00:07:11.949><c> we</c>

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 align:start position:0%
we take a step back um first of all we
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
we take a step back um first of all we
could<00:07:13.030><c> see</c><00:07:13.300><c> the</c><00:07:13.449><c> difference</c>

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
could see the difference
 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
could see the difference
so<00:07:14.259><c> obviously</c><00:07:14.889><c> web</c><00:07:15.190><c> view</c><00:07:15.430><c> is</c><00:07:15.580><c> slower</c><00:07:15.879><c> the</c>

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:16.629 align:start position:0%
so obviously web view is slower the
 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
so obviously web view is slower the

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the internet world you need to give
 

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
in the internet world you need to give

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.450 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more information so the
 

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more information so the

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:00.670 align:start position:0%
fix here was we had to switch to using a

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:02.890 align:start position:0%
four parameter version and that fourth
 

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.710 align:start position:0%
four parameter version and that fourth

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
parameter was one that took in the
 

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.410 align:start position:0%
parameter was one that took in the
display<00:15:05.170><c> metrics</c><00:15:05.710><c> and</c><00:15:05.890><c> that</c><00:15:05.950><c> gave</c><00:15:06.850><c> us</c><00:15:07.090><c> the</c>

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:07.420 align:start position:0%

refactor on Android studio removed on
these<00:17:04.720><c> resources</c><00:17:05.020><c> and</c><00:17:05.320><c> that'll</c><00:17:05.530><c> kill</c><00:17:05.740><c> things</c>

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:05.950 align:start position:0%
these resources and that'll kill things
 

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
these resources and that'll kill things
like<00:17:06.810><c> layout</c><00:17:07.810><c> files</c><00:17:08.110><c> that</c><00:17:08.320><c> aren't</c><00:17:08.470><c> being</c>

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:08.650 align:start position:0%

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:10.660 align:start position:0%
referenced anymore and then because of
 

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.150 align:start position:0%
referenced anymore and then because of
that<00:17:10.900><c> it</c><00:17:11.020><c> will</c><00:17:11.110><c> remove</c><00:17:11.230><c> any</c><00:17:11.350><c> pngs</c><00:17:11.890><c> and</c><00:17:12.100><c> are</c>

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
that it will remove any pngs and are
 

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
that it will remove any pngs and are
being<00:17:12.310><c> used</c><00:17:12.400><c> anymore</c>

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.150 align:start position:0%
being used anymore
 

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.580 align:start position:0%

so<00:17:13.480><c> that's</c><00:17:13.660><c> a</c><00:17:13.720><c> really</c><00:17:13.960><c> good</c><00:17:14.110><c> place</c><00:17:14.380><c> to</c><00:17:14.410><c> start</c>

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:14.590 align:start position:0%
so that's a really good place to start
 

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
so that's a really good place to start
that's<00:17:15.130><c> kind</c><00:17:15.460><c> of</c><00:17:15.490><c> where</c><00:17:15.640><c> we</c><00:17:15.730><c> began</c><00:17:16.980><c> the</c><00:17:17.980><c> next</c>

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.190 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we began the next
 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.190 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we began the next
piece<00:17:18.310><c> is</c><00:17:18.340><c> actually</c><00:17:18.640><c> little</c><00:17:18.940><c> bit</c><00:17:19.030><c> meteor</c><00:17:19.510><c> and</c>

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
piece is actually little bit meteor and
 

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
piece is actually little bit meteor and
more<00:17:20.350><c> technical</c><00:17:20.800><c> and</c><00:17:20.980><c> I</c><00:17:21.670><c> guess</c><00:17:21.850><c> that</c><00:17:22.000><c> advice</c>

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:22.270 align:start position:0%
more technical and I guess that advice
 

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
more technical and I guess that advice
is<00:17:22.450><c> basically</c><00:17:22.950><c> trying</c><00:17:23.950><c> to</c><00:17:24.130><c> look</c><00:17:24.850><c> and</c><00:17:25.090><c> draw</c><00:17:25.300><c> out</c>

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:25.570 align:start position:0%
is basically trying to look and draw out
 

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.650 align:start position:0%
is basically trying to look and draw out
a<00:17:25.600><c> dependency</c><00:17:26.440><c> tree</c><00:17:26.770><c> for</c><00:17:27.490><c> whatever</c><00:17:28.360><c> feature</c>

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:28.660 align:start position:0%
a dependency tree for whatever feature
 

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.270 align:start position:0%
a dependency tree for whatever feature
you're<00:17:28.930><c> trying</c><00:17:29.230><c> to</c><00:17:29.380><c> turn</c><00:17:29.680><c> into</c><00:17:29.860><c> an</c><00:17:30.010><c> instant</c>

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to turn into an instant
 

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
you're trying to turn into an instant
app<00:17:30.370><c> so</c><00:17:30.970><c> for</c><00:17:31.660><c> look</c><00:17:32.140><c> what</c><00:17:32.740><c> would</c><00:17:32.830><c> that</c><00:17:32.950><c> end</c><00:17:33.070><c> up</c>

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.190 align:start position:0%
app so for look what would that end up
 

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.410 align:start position:0%
app so for look what would that end up
looking<00:17:33.430><c> like</c><00:17:33.460><c> is</c><00:17:33.730><c> basically</c><00:17:33.970><c> taking</c><00:17:34.330><c> the</c>

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.420 align:start position:0%
looking like is basically taking the
 

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
looking like is basically taking the
activity<00:17:34.870><c> or</c><00:17:35.050><c> fragment</c><00:17:35.230><c> and</c><00:17:35.740><c> then</c><00:17:36.250><c> look</c><00:17:36.700><c> at</c>

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:36.790 align:start position:0%
activity or fragment and then look at
 

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.660 align:start position:0%
activity or fragment and then look at
all<00:17:36.880><c> the</c><00:17:36.970><c> imports</c>

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:37.670 align:start position:0%
all the imports

all the imports
the<00:17:37.790><c> file</c><00:17:38.000><c> and</c><00:17:38.330><c> then</c><00:17:38.840><c> see</c><00:17:39.050><c> what</c><00:17:39.680><c> those</c>

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:39.770 align:start position:0%
the file and then see what those

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:43.490 align:start position:0%
their dependencies are and it actually
 

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
their dependencies are and it actually
helps<00:17:43.730><c> us</c><00:17:43.850><c> to</c><00:17:43.940><c> draw</c><00:17:44.150><c> this</c><00:17:44.330><c> out</c><00:17:44.540><c> just</c><00:17:45.440><c> you</c><00:17:45.590><c> can</c>

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.770 align:start position:0%
helps us to draw this out just you can
 

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.580 align:start position:0%
helps us to draw this out just you can
see<00:17:45.800><c> exactly</c><00:17:46.370><c> what</c><00:17:47.060><c> classes</c><00:17:47.720><c> this</c><00:17:48.290><c> feature</c>

see exactly what classes this feature
 

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.730 align:start position:0%
see exactly what classes this feature
will<00:17:48.830><c> depend</c><00:17:49.100><c> on</c><00:17:49.990><c> so</c><00:17:50.990><c> in</c><00:17:51.260><c> our</c><00:17:51.320><c> case</c><00:17:51.560><c> we</c>

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:51.740 align:start position:0%
will depend on so in our case we
 

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.590 align:start position:0%
will depend on so in our case we
actually<00:17:51.830><c> started</c><00:17:52.280><c> by</c><00:17:52.430><c> you</c><00:17:53.210><c> know</c><00:17:53.330><c> we</c><00:17:53.450><c> thought</c>

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
actually started by you know we thought
 

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
actually started by you know we thought
all<00:17:53.780><c> along</c><00:17:54.080><c> that</c><00:17:54.470><c> we</c><00:17:54.680><c> had</c><00:17:54.890><c> then</c><00:17:55.280><c> modular</c><00:17:55.970><c> izing</c>

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.210 align:start position:0%
all along that we had then modular izing
 

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.210 align:start position:0%
all along that we had then modular izing
our<00:17:56.300><c> code</c><00:17:56.510><c> making</c><00:17:56.960><c> it</c><00:17:57.080><c> super</c><00:17:57.470><c> easy</c><00:17:57.620><c> to</c><00:17:57.920><c> just</c>

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.220 align:start position:0%
our code making it super easy to just
 

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.610 align:start position:0%
our code making it super easy to just
pull<00:17:58.490><c> out</c><00:17:58.520><c> all</c><00:17:58.940><c> like</c><00:17:59.540><c> our</c><00:17:59.690><c> player</c><00:18:00.110><c> activity</c>

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:00.620 align:start position:0%
pull out all like our player activity
 

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.590 align:start position:0%
pull out all like our player activity
was<00:18:00.800><c> inside</c><00:18:01.070><c> of</c><00:18:01.100><c> our</c><00:18:01.250><c> player</c><00:18:01.460><c> package</c><00:18:02.030><c> so</c><00:18:02.540><c> we</c>

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
was inside of our player package so we
 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
was inside of our player package so we
started<00:18:02.900><c> out</c><00:18:02.960><c> by</c><00:18:03.050><c> just</c><00:18:03.080><c> trying</c><00:18:03.350><c> to</c><00:18:03.620><c> cut</c><00:18:04.430><c> that</c>

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.610 align:start position:0%
started out by just trying to cut that
 

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.470 align:start position:0%
started out by just trying to cut that
and<00:18:04.910><c> paste</c><00:18:05.480><c> it</c><00:18:05.630><c> into</c><00:18:05.750><c> a</c><00:18:05.870><c> module</c><00:18:07.090><c> so</c><00:18:08.090><c> in</c><00:18:08.240><c> doing</c>

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
and paste it into a module so in doing
 

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.910 align:start position:0%
and paste it into a module so in doing
so<00:18:08.660><c> we</c><00:18:08.810><c> were</c><00:18:08.900><c> like</c><00:18:08.990><c> oh</c><00:18:09.230><c> hopefully</c><00:18:09.620><c> this</c><00:18:09.860><c> is</c>

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
so we were like oh hopefully this is
 

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
so we were like oh hopefully this is

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:11.930 align:start position:0%

is actually a pretty large library it's

is actually a pretty large library it's

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
great because it's super performing but
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.170 align:start position:0%
great because it's super performing but
it's<00:18:36.530><c> around</c><00:18:37.040><c> two</c><00:18:37.250><c> megabytes</c><00:18:37.640><c> which</c><00:18:37.940><c> in</c><00:18:38.120><c> the</c>

I<00:18:41.000><c> mean</c><00:18:41.720><c> it's</c><00:18:41.840><c> half</c><00:18:42.020><c> of</c><00:18:42.140><c> your</c><00:18:42.320><c> requirement</c><00:18:42.830><c> for</c>

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it's half of your requirement for
 

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.300 align:start position:0%
I mean it's half of your requirement for
a<00:18:42.980><c> feature</c><00:18:43.540><c> so</c><00:18:44.540><c> we</c><00:18:45.080><c> basically</c><00:18:45.740><c> had</c><00:18:45.950><c> to</c><00:18:45.980><c> find</c><00:18:46.220><c> a</c>

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.310 align:start position:0%
a feature so we basically had to find a
 

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.790 align:start position:0%
a feature so we basically had to find a
way<00:18:46.400><c> to</c><00:18:46.430><c> pull</c><00:18:47.030><c> out</c><00:18:47.210><c> fresco</c><00:18:47.870><c> and</c><00:18:48.110><c> then</c><00:18:48.230><c> swap</c><00:18:48.620><c> in</c>

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
way to pull out fresco and then swap in
 

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
way to pull out fresco and then swap in
some<00:18:49.010><c> other</c><00:18:49.130><c> form</c><00:18:49.400><c> of</c><00:18:49.490><c> image</c><00:18:49.700><c> caching</c><00:18:50.120><c> so</c><00:18:50.600><c> what</c>

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:50.690 align:start position:0%
some other form of image caching so what
 

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
some other form of image caching so what
that<00:18:50.780><c> end</c><00:18:50.960><c> up</c><00:18:51.020><c> looking</c><00:18:51.290><c> like</c><00:18:51.320><c> was</c><00:18:51.770><c> we</c><00:18:52.460><c> created</c>

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:52.610 align:start position:0%
that end up looking like was we created
 

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.430 align:start position:0%
that end up looking like was we created
this<00:18:52.910><c> interface</c><00:18:53.360><c> which</c><00:18:53.630><c> handles</c><00:18:54.020><c> all</c><00:18:54.260><c> of</c><00:18:54.290><c> our</c>

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
image caching for us which you then can
 

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
image caching for us which you then can
basically<00:18:57.500><c> stub</c><00:18:57.980><c> in</c><00:18:58.160><c> and</c><00:18:58.400><c> inject</c><00:18:58.790><c> which</c>

00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.210 align:start position:0%
basically stub in and inject which
 

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
basically stub in and inject which
different<00:18:59.600><c> implementations</c><00:19:00.140><c> like</c><00:19:00.320><c> to</c><00:19:00.440><c> use</c><00:19:00.620><c> so</c>

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.250 align:start position:0%
different implementations like to use so
 

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.340 align:start position:0%
different implementations like to use so
the<00:19:01.910><c> way</c><00:19:02.000><c> that</c><00:19:02.180><c> we</c><00:19:02.240><c> use</c><00:19:02.390><c> so</c><00:19:02.870><c> basically</c><00:19:03.170><c> for</c><00:19:03.320><c> our</c>

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
the way that we use so basically for our
 

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
the way that we use so basically for our
full<00:19:03.650><c> app</c><00:19:03.830><c> we</c><00:19:04.160><c> use</c><00:19:04.460><c> fresco</c><00:19:05.120><c> because</c><00:19:05.480><c> we</c><00:19:05.570><c> like</c>

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.690 align:start position:0%
full app we use fresco because we like

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:08.060 align:start position:0%

the performance but then for the instant
app<00:19:08.150><c> we</c><00:19:08.300><c> use</c><00:19:08.420><c> Picasso</c><00:19:08.780><c> which</c><00:19:09.200><c> is</c><00:19:09.320><c> only</c><00:19:09.470><c> a</c>

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:09.560 align:start position:0%

we<00:19:12.260><c> still</c><00:19:12.440><c> get</c><00:19:12.560><c> image</c><00:19:12.740><c> caching</c><00:19:12.980><c> may</c><00:19:13.640><c> not</c><00:19:13.760><c> be</c><00:19:13.820><c> as</c>

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:13.910 align:start position:0%
we still get image caching may not be as
 

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:17.140 align:start position:0%
we still get image caching may not be as

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.150 align:start position:0%

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.870 align:start position:0%
fast but it still works so that was a

because then for our instant app we

because then for our instant app we

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually don't need to have 360 we don't
need<00:20:08.870><c> chromecast</c>

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.770 align:start position:0%
need chromecast
 

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:10.990 align:start position:0%

we<00:20:09.830><c> don't</c><00:20:09.950><c> need</c><00:20:10.010><c> offline</c><00:20:10.340><c> playback</c><00:20:10.580><c> because</c>

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need offline playback because
 

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
we don't need offline playback because
it's<00:20:11.090><c> not</c><00:20:11.210><c> currently</c><00:20:11.510><c> supported</c><00:20:11.930><c> by</c><00:20:12.050><c> in</c>

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.170 align:start position:0%
it's not currently supported by in
 

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.810 align:start position:0%
it's not currently supported by in

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:13.820 align:start position:0%

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.940 align:start position:0%

just<00:20:14.150><c> to</c><00:20:14.270><c> remove</c><00:20:14.630><c> these</c><00:20:15.200><c> large</c><00:20:15.440><c> dependencies</c>

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:15.950 align:start position:0%
just to remove these large dependencies
 

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.890 align:start position:0%
just to remove these large dependencies
so<00:20:16.190><c> with</c><00:20:16.430><c> 360</c><00:20:17.030><c> you</c><00:20:17.180><c> get</c><00:20:17.330><c> things</c><00:20:17.570><c> like</c><00:20:17.690><c> the</c>

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900 align:start position:0%
so with 360 you get things like the
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.230 align:start position:0%
so with 360 you get things like the
cardboard<00:20:18.140><c> SDK</c><00:20:18.380><c> which</c><00:20:19.250><c> is</c><00:20:19.370><c> pretty</c><00:20:19.580><c> large</c><00:20:19.820><c> or</c>

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
cardboard SDK which is pretty large or
 

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.820 align:start position:0%
cardboard SDK which is pretty large or
with<00:20:20.390><c> chromecast</c><00:20:20.660><c> you</c><00:20:21.080><c> have</c><00:20:21.170><c> Play</c><00:20:21.350><c> services</c>

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
with chromecast you have Play services
 

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.950 align:start position:0%
with chromecast you have Play services
which<00:20:21.860><c> is</c><00:20:22.280><c> also</c><00:20:22.760><c> pretty</c><00:20:22.910><c> large</c><00:20:23.179><c> offline</c>

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
which is also pretty large offline
 

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.970 align:start position:0%
which is also pretty large offline
playback<00:20:24.170><c> cut</c><00:20:24.410><c> a</c><00:20:24.440><c> whole</c><00:20:24.590><c> bunch</c><00:20:24.710><c> of</c><00:20:24.800><c> like</c>

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:24.980 align:start position:0%
playback cut a whole bunch of like
 

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.130 align:start position:0%
playback cut a whole bunch of like
encrypt<00:20:25.309><c> your</c><00:20:25.400><c> files</c>

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.140 align:start position:0%
encrypt your files
 

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.150 align:start position:0%
encrypt your files
so<00:20:27.140><c> basically</c><00:20:27.380><c> we're</c><00:20:27.530><c> able</c><00:20:27.590><c> to</c><00:20:27.740><c> remove</c><00:20:27.890><c> those</c>

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
so basically we're able to remove those
 

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
so basically we're able to remove those
right<00:20:28.400><c> off</c><00:20:28.429><c> the</c><00:20:28.670><c> bat</c><00:20:28.790><c> and</c><00:20:29.030><c> that</c><00:20:29.210><c> saves</c><00:20:29.450><c> us</c><00:20:29.600><c> a</c>

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
right off the bat and that saves us a
 

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
right off the bat and that saves us a
ton<00:20:30.080><c> of</c><00:20:30.290><c> space</c><00:20:30.500><c> so</c><00:20:31.309><c> I</c><00:20:31.340><c> guess</c><00:20:31.670><c> basically</c><00:20:31.880><c> just</c>

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.210 align:start position:0%
ton of space so I guess basically just
 

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.930 align:start position:0%

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:34.940 align:start position:0%
to sum up all that stuff it's it's
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.010 align:start position:0%
to sum up all that stuff it's it's

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:21:29.990><c> I</c><00:21:30.260><c> think</c><00:21:30.350><c> that</c><00:21:30.680><c> that's</c><00:21:30.950><c> a</c><00:21:31.310><c> good</c><00:21:31.520><c> segue</c><00:21:31.940><c> into</c>

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:31.970 align:start position:0%
so I think that that's a good segue into
 

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that that's a good segue into
the<00:21:32.240><c> next</c><00:21:32.270><c> question</c>

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.090 align:start position:0%
the next question
 

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.300 align:start position:0%
the next question
doing<00:21:35.090><c> some</c><00:21:35.270><c> of</c><00:21:35.360><c> this</c><00:21:35.510><c> work</c><00:21:35.950><c> that</c><00:21:36.950><c> you</c><00:21:37.130><c> do</c><00:21:37.280><c> for</c>

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.310 align:start position:0%
doing some of this work that you do for
 

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
doing some of this work that you do for
your<00:21:37.580><c> instant</c><00:21:38.060><c> app</c><00:21:38.210><c> may</c><00:21:38.540><c> result</c><00:21:38.870><c> in</c><00:21:39.110><c> benefits</c>

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.530 align:start position:0%
your instant app may result in benefits
 

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.890 align:start position:0%
your instant app may result in benefits
for<00:21:39.950><c> your</c><00:21:40.340><c> installed</c><00:21:40.850><c> up</c><00:21:41.030><c> or</c><00:21:41.330><c> you</c><00:21:41.420><c> installable</c>

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:41.900 align:start position:0%
for your installed up or you installable
 

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.210 align:start position:0%
for your installed up or you installable
up<00:21:42.250><c> so</c><00:21:43.250><c> that's</c><00:21:43.430><c> like</c><00:21:43.760><c> free</c><00:21:44.330><c> a</c><00:21:44.870><c> free</c><00:21:45.710><c> wing</c><00:21:45.980><c> that</c>

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:46.220 align:start position:0%
up so that's like free a free wing that

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
from your application and this means it
 

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
from your application and this means it
