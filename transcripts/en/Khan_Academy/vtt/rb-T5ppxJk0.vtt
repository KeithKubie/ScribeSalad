00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.750
- [Instructor] We are told
researchers scored 31 athletes

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.340
on an agility test.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.160
Here are their scores.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.860
It's in this histogram.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.710
And what I'm going to ask you is,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.249
which of these intervals,
interval A, B, or C,

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.520
which one contains the
median of the scores,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.890
and which one, or give an
estimate which one contains

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.250
the mean of the scores.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.310
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.870
So let's just start with the median.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.140
Remember, the median you could
view as the middle number,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.750
or if you have an even
number of data points,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.970
it would be the average of the middle two.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.330
Here we have an odd number of data points,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.440
so it would be the middle number.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.060
So what would be the middle number

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.897
if you were to order them
from least to greatest?

00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:50.540
Well, it would be the one
that has 15 on either side,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.490
so it would be the 16th data point.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.110
16th data point.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.350
And so we could just think
about which interval here

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.640
contains the 16th data point.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.590
You could view it for
the 16th from the highest

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.100
or the 16th from the lowest.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.830
It is the middle one.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350
All right, so let's
start from the highest.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.350
So this interval C contains
the 13 highest data points

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.860
and then interval B goes
from the 14th highest

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.160
all the way to the 18th highest.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.860
So this B contains the median.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.780
It contains the 16th highest data point,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.040
or if you started from the left,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370
it would also be the
16th lowest data point.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.680
So that's where the median is.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.260
The median.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.590
Now what about an estimate for the mean?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.300
Well, you have calculated
the mean in the past,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.590
but when you're looking at
a distribution like this,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.400
when you're looking at a histogram,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.470
one way to think about the mean is

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.230
it would be the balancing point.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.460
If you imagine that this
histogram was made out of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.000
some material of, let's
say, uniform density,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.876
where would you put a fulcrum
in order to balance it?

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:03.337
If you put the fulcrum right over here,

00:02:03.337 --> 00:02:08.214
it feels like you would
tip over to the left

00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:11.320
because this is a
left-skewed distribution.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.890
You have this long tail to the left.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.960
If you really wanted to balance it out,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.631
it seems like you would
have to move your fulcrum

00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:22.090
in that direction of that left skew,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.720
in the direction of the tail.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.900
And so I would estimate to balance it out,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.920
it would actually be closer to that,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.840
which would be interval A.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.934
Interval A would contain the mean.

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:35.040
The intention of this type of exercise

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.900
isn't for you to try to
calculate every data point,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.150
in fact, they don't give you
all of the information here,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.760
and add them all up and then divide by 31.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.126
It's really to estimate and
to also get the intuition

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:49.460
that when you have a left-skewed
distribution like this,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.070
you will often see a
situation where your mean

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430
is to the left of the median.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.050
If you have a right-skewed distribution,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.240
it would be the other way around.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.219
And as we will see, when we
see a symmetric distribution,

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.670
the mean and the median will
be awfully close to each other,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.600
or when you have a roughly
symmetric distribution.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.440
If you have a perfectly
symmetric distribution,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.260
they might be exactly in the same place.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.155
So let's do another example.

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:18.155
So here it says we have
the ages of 14 coworkers,

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:23.243
and I want you to do is say
roughly where is the mean

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.540
and roughly where is the median?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.410
Is it roughly at A, is it roughly at B,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.560
or its it roughly at C?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.660
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.093
So let's first start off with the median.

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:38.710
We have 14 data points.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.250
So this would be the average
of the middle two data points.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.210
It would be the average of the seventh

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.880
and eighth data point.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.020
Well, you could say one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.290
and then the eighth one is here.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.670
So the seventh data point is a 30.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.250
The eighth one is in the 31 bucket.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.420
So the average of the
two would get you to B.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.301
Another way that you
could think about it is

00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:03.670
you can just eyeball it and see you have

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.200
just as many data points below B

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.270
as you do have above B,
and so that also gives you

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.150
a good indication that B
would be where the median is.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.340
So that is where the median is.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.773
Now what about the mean?

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.719
Well, this is a perfectly
symmetric distribution.

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.370
If I wanted to balance it,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.328
I would put the fulcrum
right in the middle.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.317
So I would say that the mean would also,

00:04:29.317 --> 00:04:33.973
the mean would also be
at B, and we are done.
