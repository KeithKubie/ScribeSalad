Library of Congress

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:38.647
Drawn to Purpose

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:56.573
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me in the back 
of the room?

00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.574
All right.

00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:02.934
There's still a few folks 
trickling in.  I hope everyone 

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.992
has had the opportunity to enjoy
the preview of the illustrations

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:08.876
on the PowerPoint loops.  What 
do you think?  It blows you 

00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:12.122
away, right?
From the 1800s to the present 

00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:15.419
day, all kinds of topics, very 
exciting.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:20.562
I'd like to welcome you to the 
Library of Congress this 

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:22.797
afternoon on auspicious day in 
March.

00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:30.254
I'm Helena, director of 
collections and prince in chief 

00:05:30.255 --> 00:05:35.453
of the photographs division.
I have a stake in the 

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:38.096
proceedings today cheering 
Martha on.  The prints and 

00:05:38.097 --> 00:05:40.097
photographs division is home to 
a rapidly growing of work by 

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:42.344
women artists.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.118
We are very grateful to the 
Carolyn and Erwin Swan 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:50.385
Foundation, which supported 
these new acquisitions and also 

00:05:50.386 --> 00:05:52.386
sponsoring today's event.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.716
Our program features a 
conversation with three 

00:05:57.717 --> 00:05:59.717
acclaimed women artists.  How 
about that?

00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:04.634
Have you been called "acclaimed"
before?  I'm hoping.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.160
We are celebrating both Women's 
History 

00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:13.491
Month and the brand-new 
publication 

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:17.815
called "drawn To Purpose" by 
colleague 

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.550
Martha Kennedy, your moderator 
today, curator of applied 

00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.551
graphic arts.

00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:27.477
The opening slide show loop gave
you a glimpse of the art created

00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:29.952
by women now represented all of 
it in the Library's 

00:06:33.451 --> 00:06:35.498
collection from vibrant drawings
by our panelists back into the 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.499
1800s.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.579
Often we think women whose names
you 

00:06:41.852 --> 00:06:43.053
may never have heard of, but 
well worth becoming acquainted.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:49.393
Because the range of topics that
women address and explore has 

00:06:49.394 --> 00:06:51.394
broadened 

00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:56.159
greatly across this last 150 
years, a big point in the book, 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.817
to watch how women and art have 
been able to interact 

00:07:02.743 --> 00:07:04.979
and be published, be known to 
the world far more publicly.

00:07:07.678 --> 00:07:09.678
The fact that work by so many 
women has 

00:07:10.752 --> 00:07:13.215
been overlooked and 
under-recognized was the very 

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.882
thing that motivated Martha 
Kennedy to dive deep into 

00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:17.883
research, 

00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:21.561
starting almost a decade ago.

00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:25.724
She wrote the book, Drawn to 
Purpose with terrific support 

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.766
from publishing office well 
represented today, and also 

00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:32.050
prepared the companion 
exhibition currently on view in 

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.286
the graphic arts gallery.  And 
I'll take a moment to mention 

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:39.266
that we hope you'll have time to
visit the show after the panel 

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.303
presentations, and it is 
conveniently located next to the

00:07:43.538 --> 00:07:46.378
gift shop where you'll all be 
able to acquire your very own 

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.225
copy of Drawn to Purpose signed 
by the author.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.814
I was told what a special 
privilege it has been to 

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:57.046
undertake these dual projects, 
that celebrate women's 

00:07:58.876 --> 00:08:00.536
remarkable contributions to both
art forms, illustration and 

00:08:00.537 --> 00:08:02.537
cartoon.

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:05.612
She wants to thank her many 
colleagues across the library 

00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:09.315
who have supported and helped 
her complete this work.

00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:19.699
It is now my honor to introduce 
our speakers.  Barbara 

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.386
Brandon-Croft, would you mind 
just standing briefly so we can 

00:08:21.387 --> 00:08:24.030
all...
[Applause]

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.816
Barbara created the 
groundbreaking comic "where I'm 

00:08:33.817 --> 00:08:37.917
coming from" which ran from 
fifteen years 1990 to 2005.  The

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:40.767
first African American woman to 
have a nationally syndicated 

00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:46.299
strip, she introduced an 
engaging cast of black women 

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.300
whose conversations brought 
topical themes into the comics.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:52.813
Historical and contemporary race
and gender issues.

00:08:56.334 --> 00:08:58.385
She has also published two 
well-received comic collections 

00:08:58.386 --> 00:09:00.386
and continues using artistic 
talent by illustrating 

00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:03.852
publications that promote 
activism.

00:09:05.535 --> 00:09:07.535
These include a guide for black 
teen 

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:10.435
girls and recent anthology 
called APB, artists against 

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:12.436
police brutality.

00:09:17.004 --> 00:09:19.004
Whitney Sherman -- we're moving 
alphabetically.

00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.854
[Applause]

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:26.237
Whitney is director of the MFA 
illustration practice program at

00:09:26.238 --> 00:09:28.911
the Maryland institute college 
of art in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:09:32.565 --> 00:09:34.457
As a multi-facetted 
award-winning illustrated she 

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:39.769
created artwork for national 
magazines, corporations and book

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.420
projects, some featuring 
narrative content, others 

00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:44.421
focused on aspects of 
illustration itself.

00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:48.769
Whitney recently co-authored and
edited a monumental new book.  

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.047
Listen to this topic.  History 
of illustration.

00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:58.153
Sweeping, covering the range of 
image making and print history 

00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:02.616
from around the world spanning 
ancient to modern times.  We owe

00:10:02.617 --> 00:10:05.911
you a debt there, I think.
Jillian Tamaki.

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:10.398
[Applause]

00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:13.949
In a short span of years, 
Jillian has produced an 

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.427
impressive volume and variety of
work that includes two 

00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:20.249
award-winning graphic novels in 

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.586
collaboration with cousin Mariko
a short story collection, 

00:10:24.587 --> 00:10:26.587
award-winning web 

00:10:27.908 --> 00:10:30.130
congresswoman milk and 
illustrations for newspapers and

00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:32.131
magazines, book covers 

00:10:33.214 --> 00:10:35.214
and her first children's book, 
"They Say Blue."

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.539
Authors grace The New York Times
book review include a wonderful 

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.593
portrait of Librarian of 
Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, so 

00:10:42.594 --> 00:10:44.594
we're particularly grateful in 
that area too.

00:10:46.518 --> 00:10:51.016
Unfortunately, Dr. Hayden is not
able to join us today.  She 

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.017
sends her regrets.

00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:56.706
This is one of her favorite 
topics, 

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.457
books and illustrations, but 
she's been called away.  Martha 

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:06.139
Kennedy is stepping in as the 
panel moderator and Dr. Hayden's

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.550
message to the foreward of the 
book is what I have been asked 

00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:11.024
to read to you to represent her.
Dr.

00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:16.327
Hayden recalled being a kid who 
read everything, and personally 

00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:18.328
I believe her.

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:22.861
She poured over the 
illustrations just as much as 

00:11:22.862 --> 00:11:24.862
the accompanying words.  That's 
the key part.

00:11:29.249 --> 00:11:31.249
She wrote, in the foreward, " 
Images 

00:11:32.297 --> 00:11:34.297
make reading more meaningful and
more memorable."

00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:38.205
I think at this point I'm going 
to say take it away, Martha.

00:11:40.097 --> 00:11:41.711
Please come to the stage and 
we'll help you get to the 

00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:43.712
graphic arts gallery at the end 
of the program.

00:11:43.998 --> 00:11:46.037
Thank you.

00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:15.679
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Thank you all so much
for being here.  Can you hear 

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.908
me?
Sort of?

00:12:18.106 --> 00:12:22.041
Okay.  Okay, great.
Thanks so much.

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:27.346
And thank you Helena for your 
opening remarks and 

00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:29.347
introduction.

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:38.206
I would also like to take this 
moment to express my thanks to 

00:12:38.207 --> 00:12:40.207
my colleagues 

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:43.884
across the library who have 
helped and 

00:12:45.986 --> 00:12:47.986
supported me in completing these
wonderful projects.

00:12:49.446 --> 00:12:51.446
I feel so privileged to have 
worked on 

00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:54.512
the book and the exhibits Drawn 
to Purpose.

00:12:58.246 --> 00:13:00.246
Turning to our panelists, it is 
an honor 

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.910
and privilege for me to moderate
today's conversation.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.036
We look forward to hearing your 

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.757
perspectives and your insights 
into the arts of illustration 

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.758
and cartooning.

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:16.875
As wonderful creators in these 
art forms.

00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:24.455
I would like to begin by asking 
each of 

00:13:25.749 --> 00:13:27.583
you, what is it like to be an 
illustrator and/or a cartoonist 

00:13:27.584 --> 00:13:29.856
today?  Do you think the playing
field is equal?

00:13:32.969 --> 00:13:35.209
Who would like to start?

00:13:43.383 --> 00:13:45.383
&gt;&gt;  With the new administration,
we have women here.

00:13:48.704 --> 00:13:50.704
No,, we're not equal, and a long
time when we really aren't.

00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:56.721
I think about how women are 
born, we come here and only to 

00:13:56.722 --> 00:13:58.722
find out as we get 

00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.821
older that we're considered 
lesser, you 

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:06.499
know, our points of view aren't 
-- we 

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:09.579
start to understand that our 
points of 

00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:13.483
view aren't taken as seriously 
for...

00:14:13.484 --> 00:14:18.802
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Can you hear?
&gt;&gt;  Holy moly.  Hello?  Can you 

00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:21.249
hear me?
Okay.  Sorry.

00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:26.757
My point is that women are born 
and we come here and then we 

00:14:26.758 --> 00:14:28.758
start to find out 

00:14:30.022 --> 00:14:31.253
that we are considered lesser, 
and we're not taken as 

00:14:31.254 --> 00:14:35.972
seriously.  The older you get, 
the more you find out, it's -- 

00:14:35.973 --> 00:14:38.194
as a kid, you know, the boys are
like suddenly like, no, we're 

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:44.757
going to play football, but you 
can be the cheerleader.  What!? 

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.202
you know, you're ready to play. 
And you fainted out if you want 

00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:51.550
to be -- you find out if you 
want to be heard, your point of 

00:14:51.551 --> 00:14:53.551
view to be heard, you have 

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:56.621
to make yourself heard and you 
have to 

00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:00.281
be loud and nobody likes a loud 
woman, it seems.

00:15:03.161 --> 00:15:05.161
So there's a lot of -- you come 
to 

00:15:06.432 --> 00:15:08.261
that realization, and honestly, 
being a black woman, you're less

00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:10.262
than lesser, 

00:15:11.346 --> 00:15:12.805
you know, you're like least, you
know, you're not only not heard 

00:15:12.806 --> 00:15:14.806
or you could 

00:15:17.501 --> 00:15:18.939
be ignored, you could be a 
suspect, you know, there's still

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940
many things that happen.

00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:26.338
So the playing field isn't 
level.  I don't know when that 

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:28.339
is going to happen.
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Okay.

00:15:29.013 --> 00:15:33.526
&gt;&gt;  Hello, can you hear me?
I'll hold this in case.

00:15:37.423 --> 00:15:39.423
So illustration does not -- it 
does not exist in a vacuum.

00:15:41.356 --> 00:15:43.811
It's a part of society, and to 
sort of answer why women are 

00:15:43.812 --> 00:15:49.327
de-valued in society is like a 
whole other round table, I 

00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:52.195
think, but, yeah, I feel like 
it's very complicated, 

00:15:52.196 --> 00:15:54.196
illustration, for 

00:15:55.863 --> 00:15:58.301
me, the way I conducted my 
career has been very linked to 

00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:00.989
the industry of illustration and
mainstream publishing, 

00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:08.363
and the publishing industry, and
that can be really complicated. 

00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:10.364
Especially when I'm working in 
-- I 

00:16:12.916 --> 00:16:15.159
work in comics, which is 
famously a very male-dominated 

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.195
little niche of drawing, but 
then now I'm in picture -- doing

00:16:19.836 --> 00:16:22.275
stuff with picture books, where 
that industry is, you know, 90% 

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:26.954
female in terms of the creators 
and the gate keepers and the 

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:28.955
book sellers and librarians and 
parents buying the books 

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.492
and all this stuff, yet still 
the issues persist with who gets

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.551
the awards and who gets the 
acclaim and money and all these 

00:16:36.188 --> 00:16:38.188
things that trickle down.

00:16:39.268 --> 00:16:41.268
So it's like it's even more 

00:16:43.558 --> 00:16:45.412
complicated than it seems on the
space sometimes, but, yeah, I 

00:16:45.413 --> 00:16:47.413
think identity 

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:52.129
has become a very big part of 
publishing 

00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:56.581
and culture at large now and so

00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:01.111
it's an evolving thing.

00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:04.522
I feel strange -- I can feel -- 
I actually don't do a lot of 

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:06.523
women in 

00:17:09.032 --> 00:17:11.273
comics and women in 
blankety-blank panels, because I

00:17:11.274 --> 00:17:13.274
feel that it's uttering, you 
know, it can feel like we 

00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:21.001
talk about we're okay with this 
stuff as this sort of, like, 

00:17:21.002 --> 00:17:23.308
separate thing, or it's safe to 
analyze it within this 

00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:29.856
closed sealed-off context, but I
always want to -- until the day 

00:17:29.857 --> 00:17:31.857
comes where I'm 

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.290
looking forward to when it 
becomes more integrated and we 

00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:36.342
don't have to have special days 
and that would seem weird 

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.241
because we're integrated on a 
more daily level.

00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:45.155
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Thank you.  Very 
thoughtful.

00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:50.531
&gt;&gt;  Pass the baton.
A lot of what I wanted to say 

00:17:50.532 --> 00:17:54.849
has already been said, but I 
wanted to really start, if I had

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.987
been the first person to speak, 
I would have said I was so glad 

00:17:59.988 --> 00:18:01.988
that you didn't say, is there a 

00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:06.417
level playing field for women 
illustrators.  Because I think 

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:11.220
when we continue to label us as 
women illustrators, rather than 

00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:13.221
illustrators, we already create 
a division there.

00:18:15.584 --> 00:18:17.587
We create a separate category 
that is problematic, and it 

00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:19.588
becomes something hard.

00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:23.585
It's not that we're not women, 
but we have to crawl out of this

00:18:23.586 --> 00:18:26.252
hole that has been developed by 
ost sizing that, by 

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:31.521
labeling it that way, like an 
asterisk.

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:36.477
And what is really curious, too,
is as an educator, I've been 

00:18:36.478 --> 00:18:38.745
teaching part-time and full-time
for almost 30 

00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:43.886
years and the majority of my 
students are women.

00:18:45.752 --> 00:18:47.752
So when I look out into the 
world, I 

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.512
see more men that are out there 
that are nameable, that become 

00:18:52.513 --> 00:18:54.513
the names in the industry, and I
think a lot of it does 

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.897
come out of not having people 
that are women that are 

00:18:59.898 --> 00:19:05.433
illustrators but by having art 
directors or judges on panels or

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.434
whatever, those are the ar 
bitters of 

00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:09.942
who is going to become a name or
whose work is going to be seen 

00:19:09.943 --> 00:19:13.815
in a publication or in an 
annual.  So because of that I 

00:19:13.816 --> 00:19:16.484
think that has to shift a little
bit.  I think there is more of 

00:19:16.485 --> 00:19:18.485
an awareness of that now.

00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:22.576
I think people are being 
sensitive, maybe we have to go 

00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:24.577
through this period 

00:19:25.806 --> 00:19:27.859
of identifying women and talking
about women for -- I mean, 

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.154
they're only -- it's like half 
the planet, right?  I don't know

00:19:32.155 --> 00:19:35.654
why it's been so invisible, but 
maybe we have to go through this

00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:39.337
little phase in order for us to 
not have to do it this way.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160
&gt;&gt;  These are just very 
thoughtful answers.

00:19:46.923 --> 00:19:48.955
Would you be willing to say that
there's been some progress in 

00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:50.956
the last 

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.269
20 years at all in certain areas
for women?

00:19:55.877 --> 00:19:59.722
&gt;&gt; WHITNEY: I would.  I would 
say there's some progress.  We 

00:19:59.723 --> 00:20:02.445
can look at things like the 
director of the society of 

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:04.446
illustrators is a woman.

00:20:07.768 --> 00:20:09.795
The majority of the presidents 
of the illustration conference, 

00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:14.678
which is the only conference 
that is national that is for 

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:16.679
illustration, the majority of 
the presidents have been women.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.006
So there are people that are in 
leadership roles that in these 

00:20:20.007 --> 00:20:22.007
things that are -- it's 
contemporary.

00:20:25.295 --> 00:20:27.295
It's in the last 15, maybe even 
10 years that it's different.

00:20:29.803 --> 00:20:32.096
So there are role models for 
women that are coming up that 

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:34.097
can look at that 

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:36.599
and say, well, that's possible 
to do.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.600
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Yeah, there are a 
few.

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:41.105
&gt;&gt; WHITNEY: There are other 
precedents to be a woman.

00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:43.666
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: That's interesting.

00:20:44.832 --> 00:20:47.532
We have the art editor of The 
New Yorker is a woman and 

00:20:47.533 --> 00:20:49.533
cartoon editor.

00:20:53.412 --> 00:20:55.412
So there are some -- a few 
encouraging signs.

00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.548
&gt;&gt;  I mostly travel independent,
but 

00:21:03.066 --> 00:21:05.582
when I started 15 years ago, it 
was just like so different in 

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.583
terms of -- well, 

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:14.771
now it's like the market for, 
like, YA 

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.895
comics and kid comics and stuff 
like that has burst forward and 

00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:19.896
I think the 

00:21:21.575 --> 00:21:23.575
most prominent people doing that
are -- 

00:21:24.665 --> 00:21:27.514
like Randy feltmeyer is the apex
of all of that, and loved by 

00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:31.201
girls and boys, and that's 
encouraging, of course, and then

00:21:31.202 --> 00:21:33.202
you have other issues how 
identity 

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.922
becomes a marketable thing and 
all these other things, but that

00:21:36.923 --> 00:21:38.923
has changed so 

00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:42.427
much since I started.

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:45.678
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: And look at the 
comics pages 

00:21:47.343 --> 00:21:49.343
in newspapers and it's better 
online.

00:21:51.374 --> 00:21:53.831
&gt;&gt;  I mean, for me, you know, so
many years ago, to be the first 

00:21:53.832 --> 00:21:57.147
black woman in the mainstream 
press in the newspapers, that 

00:21:57.148 --> 00:22:02.176
was big.  But also by me being 
the first black woman in the 

00:22:02.177 --> 00:22:04.681
mainstream press in newspapers, 
I was the only one, and I 

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:10.607
was kind of -- you think you're 
breaking the door down, so more 

00:22:10.608 --> 00:22:12.861
can come in, but you're really 
clogging the door, you know, 

00:22:12.862 --> 00:22:14.862
because you're there.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.110
And it's like, okay, hold on to 
this...

00:22:18.148 --> 00:22:20.148
[ Laughter ]

00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:24.006
&gt;&gt;  But I haven't done it since 
2005, 

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.890
and there has not been somebody 
who has 

00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.596
recognized a black woman 
cartoonist for the newspaper.

00:22:33.273 --> 00:22:35.273
The newspapers are dying, 
clearly, but it's true.

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:38.651
So it's hard for me in my 
specific area of doing this to 

00:22:38.652 --> 00:22:41.537
see progress.  So that's a 
downer.

00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:46.462
&gt;&gt;  I think that as a result, 
like web comics have been so 

00:22:46.463 --> 00:22:48.926
embraced by women because 
there's -- you can just skip 

00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:52.161
directly to your audience, 
right?

00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:56.046
And I think that that's now, if 
you go 

00:22:58.147 --> 00:23:00.175
to the Expo here outside of -- 
in Bethesda, Maryland, you see 

00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:04.210
that gradually change, like more
women and they build their 

00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:06.649
audience -- clearly there is an 
appetite for it, and for 

00:23:07.042 --> 00:23:09.042
racialized women as well.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.621
And so you don't have to 
necessarily go through these 

00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:15.622
mainstream channels to, like, 
get your work out, and then 

00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:18.355
there's a reverse thing of, 
like, now the mainstream wants 

00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:20.356
that thing.

00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:25.950
It's like a turn-around.
&gt;&gt; MARTHA: Great.  Good point.

00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:31.219
And this leads me to another 
question.

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:35.786
Could you comment on the impact 
of social media on work in both 

00:23:35.787 --> 00:23:37.787
fields?

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.366
What do you think about that?
&gt;&gt;  I think about --

00:23:43.178 --> 00:23:46.320
&gt;&gt;  Positive and negative.
&gt;&gt;  Me?

00:23:47.776 --> 00:23:49.776
&gt;&gt;  Yes, all three of you.  I 
would love to hear what...

00:23:52.262 --> 00:23:54.262
&gt;&gt;  You know, social media is a 
strange bird.

00:23:56.154 --> 00:23:57.986
And I am older, so it's even 
stranger to me, because it's 

00:23:57.987 --> 00:24:01.022
new.  So it's not all good, but 
there are some good points.

00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:06.687
It does help create communities 
that 

00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:10.243
are supportive, you know, you 
can -- I can -- every once in a 

00:24:10.244 --> 00:24:14.585
while I can feel compelled to do
a strip and I can put it on my 

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:16.586
Facebook page.  I actually have 
one.

00:24:19.897 --> 00:24:21.897
And I can get such a positive 
response.

00:24:22.966 --> 00:24:26.663
Like, do it again, Barbara! We 
need to hear these girls.  Let's

00:24:26.664 --> 00:24:28.700
hear these black women talk.  
And it's just very encouraging.

00:24:34.102 --> 00:24:36.293
So while it is a weird kind of 
thing, it does create certain 

00:24:36.294 --> 00:24:38.294
communities, and 

00:24:41.365 --> 00:24:44.861
it does help bring like-minded 
people together to make points. 

00:24:44.862 --> 00:24:47.699
Even if we're just patting each 
other on our backs, you know, it

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.435
kind of feels good.  It's a 
community.

00:24:55.935 --> 00:24:57.559
&gt;&gt;  Well, I was going to say 
that most illustrators -- I 

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.310
can't speak for cartoonists, but
I imagine it's very similar, we 

00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:07.222
work by ourselves.  So unless 
you're going out and teaching 

00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:09.278
and getting yourself exposed to 
people in a work situations, the

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:14.599
mar jort of your time you spend 
by yourself, and so social media

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
adds a layer of connectivity 
that is really helpful.

00:25:19.632 --> 00:25:21.591
You get to see what other people
are doing or tell them what you 

00:25:21.592 --> 00:25:23.592
think about what they're doing.

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:27.899
The other side of it, too, is 
that there 

00:25:29.974 --> 00:25:31.974
have been quite a few places 
where women 

00:25:33.661 --> 00:25:35.661
have gotten beaten up in social 
media, 

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.151
and other places where they can 
find refuge.  There are some 

00:25:39.152 --> 00:25:41.202
private Facebook groups where 
people can -- women can talk 

00:25:41.203 --> 00:25:45.469
about what is happening with 
them.  They can talk about 

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.470
whether they think 

00:25:48.528 --> 00:25:50.972
they're getting paid less or 
whether somebody is bullying 

00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:55.464
them or other, you know, topics 
that are distressful and you 

00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:57.944
need to find support somewhere.

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.261
So it's like everything, it's 
got otwo sides.

00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:07.744
&gt;&gt;  I think that social media 
has brought a lot of different 

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.798
kinds of people to illustration 
and comics, and 

00:26:13.297 --> 00:26:15.297
it was very, very much needed, 
because 

00:26:16.596 --> 00:26:19.089
it is -- I feel like when I 
started, very predominantly 

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.298
white male and straight and, 
like, now I feel like it's 

00:26:21.512 --> 00:26:23.512
really expanded.

00:26:25.177 --> 00:26:26.861
And I used to -- when I started,
I really linked illustration 

00:26:26.862 --> 00:26:29.911
with this commercial aspect.  
It's like, you're not an artist,

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:34.193
you're working with a client, 
you know what I mean?  And 

00:26:34.194 --> 00:26:36.194
you're creating a product.

00:26:39.477 --> 00:26:41.720
And now I feel like I can't -- I
feel it's a much more nebulous 

00:26:41.721 --> 00:26:45.195
thing that actually because it's
brought in all these different 

00:26:45.196 --> 00:26:47.196
people, really question some of 
the power structures around it 

00:26:49.094 --> 00:26:51.106
and, like, how it moves and 
they're not necessarily -- they 

00:26:51.107 --> 00:26:53.107
think about it in a 

00:26:54.122 --> 00:26:56.762
really, really different way, 
and it's -- but it can be really

00:26:56.763 --> 00:26:58.763
scary, some of 

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.329
this stuff with the being a 
woman on the Internet is like 

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.170
just kind of a scary place 
sometimes.  But I can't imagine 

00:27:06.171 --> 00:27:09.017
my career without it.  I 
graduated in 2003, like right at

00:27:09.018 --> 00:27:11.274
the start of it, and I just 
don't think I 

00:27:14.534 --> 00:27:16.534
would be where I am without 
continually 

00:27:17.795 --> 00:27:19.795
sharing online and you're never 
supposed 

00:27:21.242 --> 00:27:23.099
to say that audience reaction, 
or whatever, but I feel totally 

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.799
-- because I know a lot of my 
audience is women, that's where 

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.235
you can connect, especially with
young women, teenagers, right?  

00:27:30.236 --> 00:27:32.236
That's where they are.

00:27:33.895 --> 00:27:35.964
So I found it like a very -- I 
can't separate the two.  I 

00:27:35.965 --> 00:27:38.201
wouldn't want to either.  
There's the good and the bad.

00:27:38.801 --> 00:27:44.129
&gt;&gt;  There's a little bit of a 
democracy, too, in someone can 

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.599
have connection to the Internet 
and look at things on social 

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.600
media and not have to have the 
money to buy a book.

00:27:52.706 --> 00:27:54.131
So they might like Jillian's 
work or Barbara's work and they 

00:27:54.132 --> 00:27:58.034
might not be able to afford that
book or get that book, but they 

00:27:58.035 --> 00:28:00.035
can appreciate their work 

00:28:01.493 --> 00:28:03.493
through social media that 
they're on anyway.

00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:06.622
&gt;&gt;  And we haven't figured out 
how to get paid either.  Like 

00:28:06.623 --> 00:28:08.257
you don't know how to make money
from --

00:28:08.258 --> 00:28:09.273
&gt;&gt;  I hear ya.
&gt;&gt;  Putting your stuff out 

00:28:09.274 --> 00:28:13.390
there.  It's not a clear road.
&gt;&gt;  And illustration, because of

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.391
this, 

00:28:16.573 --> 00:28:17.995
it has become so incredibly 
popular.  Like when I started, I

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:19.996
feel like it 

00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:23.591
was for nerds that wanted to 
like air 

00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:26.682
brush like shiny metal and 
stuff, but 

00:28:30.111 --> 00:28:31.269
it's like completely, like, 
evolved to this other -- I can't

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.593
remember what I was going to 
say, but...

00:28:34.406 --> 00:28:37.323
[chuckles]
I got distracted talking about 

00:28:37.324 --> 00:28:40.600
nerds for a second.
&gt;&gt;  Not getting paid.

00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:44.811
&gt;&gt;  About not getting paid.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you from the audience,

00:28:44.812 --> 00:28:48.461
not getting paid.
That you end up -- there's like 

00:28:48.462 --> 00:28:53.156
an economy of, like, "likes" and
stuff like that and I think that

00:28:53.157 --> 00:28:56.215
-- one thing I heard about this 
is sort of directly to women on 

00:28:56.216 --> 00:29:01.133
the Internet. I kind of feel 
like sometimes you need to 

00:29:01.134 --> 00:29:02.359
present an image, and that 
really values the young woman, 

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.360
the woman that 

00:29:05.648 --> 00:29:07.648
is willing to sort of put her 
appearance online.

00:29:09.312 --> 00:29:11.762
And I'm always very -- when I 
was sorting out, I really felt 

00:29:11.763 --> 00:29:16.303
like I tried very hard to keep 
all my images -- like all images

00:29:16.304 --> 00:29:18.972
of myself off the Internet, 
because I didn't want my image 

00:29:18.973 --> 00:29:22.595
linked to my work.  I wanted my 
work to just stand on its own, 

00:29:22.596 --> 00:29:24.596
and stuff like that.

00:29:26.506 --> 00:29:27.939
And I have heard that recently 
some young women feel that's not

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.940
a possibility.

00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.639
You need an attached image to 
it, an attached persona and 

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.640
personality and, like, brand.

00:29:37.503 --> 00:29:39.503
And I feel like is really 
complicated.

00:29:40.459 --> 00:29:42.460
&gt;&gt;  That's fascinating.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.

00:29:44.719 --> 00:29:46.719
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;  All right.

00:29:52.544 --> 00:29:55.437
Turning to a slightly different 
but related topic, could you 

00:29:55.438 --> 00:29:57.438
share 

00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:00.693
observations or insights about 
women in 

00:30:01.706 --> 00:30:03.706
these

00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:07.467
fields from your experiences as 

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.058
teachers or being on panels or 
have you benefited from 

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:14.059
teaching?

00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:17.949
And doing...
[chuckles]

00:30:20.262 --> 00:30:22.262
I know two of you have taught, I
know that.

00:30:23.174 --> 00:30:25.812
&gt;&gt;  I have been teaching for a 
long time and when I first 

00:30:25.813 --> 00:30:27.813
started -- well, I'll go back 
just a little bit more and give 

00:30:28.461 --> 00:30:30.719
you a little bit of a story.  
When I graduated college, 

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.571
somebody said to me, oh, do you 
think, you know, you want to 

00:30:33.572 --> 00:30:36.819
teach?  And I said, there's no 
way I want to teach.  Why would 

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.820
I want to teach?  I want to do 
stuff.

00:30:45.107 --> 00:30:46.123
And I think at that time, too, 
it was... you wanted to get out 

00:30:46.124 --> 00:30:49.526
there.  You wanted to build your
portfolio, you wanted to get 

00:30:49.527 --> 00:30:53.402
more clients.  That's what you 
wanted to do if you wanted to be

00:30:53.403 --> 00:30:55.403
an illustrator, so that's what I
wanted to do too.

00:30:58.512 --> 00:31:00.530
But over time, what I found was 
that it gets a little lonely 

00:31:00.531 --> 00:31:04.227
sometimes, so you have to find 
diversion, get away from the 

00:31:04.228 --> 00:31:06.707
four walls that you're in, and I
think a lot of women do have 

00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:09.155
studios in their homes for 
whatever reason.

00:31:14.238 --> 00:31:16.707
I did because I was a parent and
I had a small child and I wanted

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:20.996
to be able to do that and do my 
work.  But I also wanted to kind

00:31:20.997 --> 00:31:22.997
of connect 

00:31:25.285 --> 00:31:27.285
out with other people, and so 
someone I 

00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:29.991
knew asked me to do a workshop 
on putting -- and this is when I

00:31:29.992 --> 00:31:32.873
was actually doing graphic 
design as well.

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:41.057
To show how to make 
comprehensive -- these are put 

00:31:41.058 --> 00:31:46.601
together -- this is pre-digital 
world, for anybody that is under

00:31:46.602 --> 00:31:48.230
30, pre-digital world, where if 
you were going to do a design, 

00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:52.325
you put it together, you mocked 
it up to show your client what 

00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:54.761
it was going to look like, and 
so I did this workshop and I 

00:31:57.671 --> 00:32:00.113
was, like, really charged up 
over this idea that I had stuff 

00:32:00.114 --> 00:32:04.790
that I had done and I could put 
that together in an organized 

00:32:04.791 --> 00:32:07.262
way and I could transmit it to a
bunch of students that were 

00:32:07.263 --> 00:32:09.263
eager to 

00:32:10.327 --> 00:32:13.192
get that information, and it 
made me feel like I had this 

00:32:13.193 --> 00:32:16.273
other value beyond what I was 
generating.  So I'm building my 

00:32:16.274 --> 00:32:18.274
career, right?

00:32:19.742 --> 00:32:21.989
But I'm also able to push back 
some things, push back some 

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.917
value to others.  And so that 
kind of got me hooked on doing 

00:32:26.918 --> 00:32:28.918
it, and then over the years I 
was 

00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:32.809
picking up part-time work just 
as a dimension to my studio 

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.810
work.

00:32:41.242 --> 00:32:43.242
And then in 2000 I was recruited
to 

00:32:48.648 --> 00:32:50.648
lead the undergraduate at MICA 
in illustration.

00:32:51.978 --> 00:32:53.978
I had a really vital studio 
business.

00:32:55.445 --> 00:32:57.893
It was something that I really 
had to think long and hard 

00:32:57.894 --> 00:32:59.894
about, but I felt like there 
were some -- it was a challenge.

00:33:01.564 --> 00:33:03.564
It was a good challenge for me.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.102
So I did that for 10 years and 
started a master's program and 

00:33:08.103 --> 00:33:10.103
we're in year eight.  I think 
it's successful.

00:33:12.822 --> 00:33:14.822
So what do I get out of teaching
is I 

00:33:16.277 --> 00:33:18.277
get to get out of my house and 
my studio.

00:33:19.741 --> 00:33:22.590
But beyond that, it's the same 
exchange.  It's that same 

00:33:22.591 --> 00:33:24.591
bringing value to other people's
lives, sharing things that I do 

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.994
and that I love that are 
meaningful to me, and to raise 

00:33:30.995 --> 00:33:32.995
up people that are interested in
learning.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.522
I think there's nothing better 
than this relationship of you 

00:33:37.523 --> 00:33:40.801
giving something to someone 
else, them valuing it, and then 

00:33:40.802 --> 00:33:43.653
doing something with that.  And 
that to me, that's what teaching

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:45.654
is.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:50.160
&gt;&gt;  You can see what's cool...
[ Laughter ]

00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:54.208
&gt;&gt;  I don't teach right now, but
I 

00:33:55.258 --> 00:33:57.069
taught for a long time in New 
York and you would see stuff 

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.731
percolating in them and then it 
would be like in the broader 

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:03.495
culture, like, two years later 
or something like that, because 

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:05.496
they're cool art students.

00:34:10.317 --> 00:34:12.317
But, yeah, I don't teach now, 
all the same.

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.451
I mean, it's incredibly 
gratifying to 

00:34:16.709 --> 00:34:18.152
see them grow as people, such a 
formative time, they're like 

00:34:18.153 --> 00:34:22.037
little babies when they start 
and by the end they're like 

00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:24.071
adults and it's really a 
privilege to help somebody on 

00:34:24.072 --> 00:34:26.072
that.

00:34:28.635 --> 00:34:31.106
I did feel like in the end it 
can get tricky because it's -- 

00:34:31.107 --> 00:34:33.107
especially New 

00:34:34.108 --> 00:34:37.093
York art schools are very 
expensive and then this realm of

00:34:37.094 --> 00:34:38.688
student loans and it becomes 
this very incredibly rarefied 

00:34:38.689 --> 00:34:40.689
experience.

00:34:44.024 --> 00:34:45.895
So that -- we haven't talked 
about intersectionality a lot in

00:34:45.896 --> 00:34:48.135
this discussion, but that 
becomes a lot of it 

00:34:51.182 --> 00:34:53.182
too, with accessibility, and 
that was, like...

00:34:54.688 --> 00:34:57.350
that's a changing thing that -- 
the process or the time that I 

00:34:57.351 --> 00:35:00.412
was teaching I saw more and more
of that stratification.

00:35:01.845 --> 00:35:03.922
&gt;&gt;  That's a very good point.  
Yeah.  That's great.

00:35:09.636 --> 00:35:11.700
&gt;&gt;  I did -- I was able to do 
some workshops.  When you said 

00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:13.701
that, yeah, I did do that.

00:35:17.229 --> 00:35:20.069
And it was the Queens Library.  
I was very popular in February 

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.114
and March.
[ Laughter ]

00:35:25.807 --> 00:35:28.291
I would get calls, say we have a
black cartoonist coming in, a 

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:31.412
woman cartoonist coming in, and 
all the time it would be young 

00:35:31.413 --> 00:35:33.463
kids that would come.  I 
shouldn't say that, because 

00:35:35.502 --> 00:35:37.502
sometimes there were older 
people, you 

00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:41.228
know, retired people who wanted 
to sit among the 

00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:44.118
eight-year-olds, because they 
also wanted to have this fun 

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:46.119
little cartooning class.

00:35:48.198 --> 00:35:51.061
And it was really basic, you 
know, how you can make faces out

00:35:51.062 --> 00:35:53.062
of shapes and, you know, really,
really basic.

00:35:56.168 --> 00:35:58.168
And then I would give them all 
like a 

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:01.670
line, just a little sentence and
have them create a script to go 

00:36:01.671 --> 00:36:03.671
along with it.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.154
They came up with some really 
crazy and incredible things, 

00:36:07.155 --> 00:36:09.821
these little kids.  So I think 
what I got from it was also 

00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:14.477
being able to encourage these 
little ones and also you 

00:36:14.478 --> 00:36:17.765
recognize that you can learn 
from everybody, you know.  It 

00:36:17.766 --> 00:36:19.803
doesn't matter who it is.  You 
know, it could be the older 

00:36:21.244 --> 00:36:23.244
gentleman who is a little 
embarrassed to 

00:36:25.339 --> 00:36:27.188
be sitting there with all these 
kids, makes a comment about, you

00:36:27.189 --> 00:36:30.702
know, I think... and I'm like, 
that's a good point.  You really

00:36:30.703 --> 00:36:33.355
can learn from everyone.  So I 
think that's what I get out of 

00:36:33.356 --> 00:36:36.847
I.
&gt;&gt;  Great.  Wonderful.  Thank 

00:36:36.848 --> 00:36:38.848
you.
All right.

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:44.159
Here is another sort of general 
question.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680
How or why does surveying work 
by 

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.940
women illustrators and 
cartoonists matter?

00:36:55.017 --> 00:36:57.017
Do you think a sense of shared 
history 

00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:00.499
in these fields can help 
motivate and inspire established

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.738
and rising artists?  Especially 
women.

00:37:05.798 --> 00:37:08.086
&gt;&gt;  I'm going to start talking 
again.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:12.784
&gt;&gt;  Okay.
&gt;&gt;  Because I thought about 

00:37:12.785 --> 00:37:16.493
these questions and I felt that 
was particularly a good one 

00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:18.494
because that's kind of what we 
do.

00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:23.880
You know, it's like as 
illustrators, as cartoonists, as

00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:25.881
artists, as singers, 

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:28.623
whatever we do, we are kind of 
-- you observe what is going on,

00:37:28.624 --> 00:37:32.551
you interpret it and then you 
record it, you know, and that's 

00:37:32.552 --> 00:37:35.422
-- I got that from my dad.  
That's a good point, Dad.  

00:37:35.423 --> 00:37:38.464
That's what we do.  And in a 
certain sense we are recording 

00:37:38.465 --> 00:37:40.465
history.

00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:44.343
So for folks down the line who 
come 

00:37:45.455 --> 00:37:47.704
back and look at what we've done
-- because all of our work is 

00:37:47.705 --> 00:37:49.705
informed by 

00:37:53.016 --> 00:37:54.874
our experiences, and so you have
a way of putting down what was 

00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:56.875
happening 

00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:00.125
during this time, and I was 
fortunate 

00:38:03.256 --> 00:38:05.256
enough to have my first book -- 
have the 

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:08.965
Davis do the foreward for my 
book and one of the things they 

00:38:08.966 --> 00:38:13.052
mentioned is my strip should go 
in a time capsule and years from

00:38:13.053 --> 00:38:15.053
now folks can open it up and 

00:38:16.948 --> 00:38:18.784
get a real understanding of what
the experience of being a black 

00:38:18.785 --> 00:38:23.668
woman in America was.  I was 
like, wow, that's heavy.  And, 

00:38:23.669 --> 00:38:25.334
you know, it's like it really is
kind of -- it's good and it's 

00:38:25.335 --> 00:38:27.335
true.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.905
So it's being able to take a 
look at what is going on and 

00:38:32.906 --> 00:38:35.183
being able to understand that 
this is the -- everybody 

00:38:39.685 --> 00:38:41.685
who expresses themselves or from
their 

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.580
experiences, and it's a very 
important to keep track of and 

00:38:44.581 --> 00:38:46.581
get a chance to 

00:38:47.852 --> 00:38:49.887
look at it and understand, 
because that will inform later 

00:38:49.888 --> 00:38:52.743
generations with their lives, 
you know?  What our experiences 

00:38:52.744 --> 00:38:56.197
have been.
&gt;&gt;  I think, like, history is 

00:38:56.198 --> 00:38:58.476
not like what happens, like how 
it's told, or something like 

00:38:58.477 --> 00:39:03.220
that.  I'm sure there's a more 
elegant way of saying that, but,

00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:05.221
I mean, there's a 

00:39:09.135 --> 00:39:11.392
reason why we it is the way it 
is and it looks the way it does,

00:39:11.393 --> 00:39:13.427
and that's conscious and 
unconscious how it's shaped.

00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:20.145
So I think, like, you need to, 
like, aggressively reach it as 

00:39:20.146 --> 00:39:22.146
much as I can't 

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:25.428
wait for the day that, like, 
it's -- it 

00:39:26.522 --> 00:39:27.330
feels like embedded and 
ingrained in it, in a more 

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.572
natural way.  I think you have 
to actually put 

00:39:34.089 --> 00:39:36.734
effort into it and, like... and 
be more intentional, you know, 

00:39:36.735 --> 00:39:39.200
and aware.  And I think people 
are demanding that 

00:39:42.451 --> 00:39:44.451
and people see that now and the 

00:39:46.594 --> 00:39:48.626
consciousness has, like, a 
rhythm, like grown so much in 

00:39:48.627 --> 00:39:50.874
the last five years or something
like that.

00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:57.020
Even just like the younger 
students and younger creators 

00:39:57.021 --> 00:39:59.277
are so much -- they see it as a 
whole now and they see the way 

00:40:02.552 --> 00:40:04.617
it all works in a way that I was
completely naïve to when I 

00:40:04.618 --> 00:40:06.672
started.  So there's a lot more 
questioning of those structures.

00:40:08.527 --> 00:40:11.376
And I think it's very powerful. 
Like I have to remember being 

00:40:11.377 --> 00:40:13.377
younger 

00:40:14.425 --> 00:40:16.425
and, like, I -- looking around 
myself 

00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:20.946
and seeing, like, a mix, but 
identify as Asian-American, and 

00:40:20.947 --> 00:40:24.249
you're looking around constantly
you know what I mean?  And 

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:27.080
you're looking for evidence of 
yourself and your self-reflected

00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:31.356
back and it's very powerful when
you find that, especially when 

00:40:31.357 --> 00:40:35.690
you're a young person.  So I'm 
aware of that too.  Sometimes 

00:40:35.691 --> 00:40:37.764
that is more intentional effort,
if that's what it results in, 

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:40.159
then, you know...

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:45.738
&gt;&gt;  I completely agree with 
that.  There's been a great 

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:47.954
turnaround in more recent years.
Because if you look at what 

00:40:47.955 --> 00:40:51.448
women were doing at the 
beginning of the 20th Century 

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.449
and the type of work they were 

00:40:55.526 --> 00:40:57.526
doing, they were stratified into
women's 

00:40:58.574 --> 00:41:00.574
subjects, whatever those might 
be, and 

00:41:01.665 --> 00:41:04.307
that they were reflecting out 
the magazines, the magazines 

00:41:04.308 --> 00:41:06.308
were emerging, magazines that 
were coming out for women 

00:41:09.418 --> 00:41:11.663
were reflecting a kind of life 
that was supposed to happen, 

00:41:11.664 --> 00:41:13.962
this ideal life of what a woman 
should be doing and how she 

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.841
should be a home maker or a good
mother and whatnot.

00:41:20.325 --> 00:41:22.999
And think those reflections, 
those images that are made are 

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.645
reflecting out to not just women
but to the world what 

00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:31.745
is expected, and if that's 
changing, if that's different, 

00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:33.746
and it's reflecting out these 
different ideas and different 

00:41:37.298 --> 00:41:39.298
ways of living and thinking and 
being, that can change society.

00:41:42.641 --> 00:41:44.641
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.

00:41:47.314 --> 00:41:49.173
This really, I think, leads well
into my next question, which 

00:41:49.174 --> 00:41:53.712
is...
Women have made contributions to

00:41:53.713 --> 00:41:58.616
these art forms that men 
probably would not have.  In 

00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:00.617
fact, probably definitely would 
not have.

00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:04.777
Can you imagine a male 
counterpart creating some of the

00:42:04.778 --> 00:42:06.820
work that you and other female 
artists have made?

00:42:09.885 --> 00:42:11.885
Again, give a few examples.

00:42:16.651 --> 00:42:18.651
Just briefly, you know, describe
or mention...

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.420
&gt;&gt;  Margine Setropy wrote about 
her experience being a woman in 

00:42:24.421 --> 00:42:28.103
the Middle East I think would 
have been impossible for a man 

00:42:28.104 --> 00:42:30.561
to do.

00:42:34.423 --> 00:42:36.245
&gt;&gt;  Because my strip was a 
collection of women, and that's 

00:42:36.246 --> 00:42:38.246
all that was in the 

00:42:39.325 --> 00:42:41.368
strip, women, and black women in
particular.  Can I imagine a man

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:44.229
doing what I did?  Nah...
[ Laughter ]

00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:47.467
Nah.

00:42:50.344 --> 00:42:52.388
As a matter of fact, my -- I was
in a bunch of papers, but I 

00:42:52.389 --> 00:42:54.389
wasn't in my New York area.

00:42:56.272 --> 00:42:58.523
I think the closest paper may 
have been the Baltimore Sun or 

00:42:58.524 --> 00:43:00.524
maybe Philadelphia or something.

00:43:03.003 --> 00:43:05.003
But I live in book Brooklyn.

00:43:06.678 --> 00:43:08.325
So nobody knew -- I would say 
I'm a cartoonist, but nobody 

00:43:08.326 --> 00:43:11.621
knew what my strip was.  So I 
would explain.  I have a strip, 

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:15.144
a weekly strip, it's all women, 
talking heads, all black women. 

00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:17.989
Oh, man! Just take another 
opportunity to put the black man

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.990
down.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.204
I'm like, wait... wait...

00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:30.311
My point of view, just because 
it's a black woman, a woman 

00:43:30.312 --> 00:43:32.312
speaking, means that it's 
anti-men?

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:38.107
And likewise, how is being 
pro-Black being anti-White in 

00:43:38.108 --> 00:43:40.108
it's not.

00:43:43.015 --> 00:43:44.843
And if a guy were to see it -- 
and I got letters that they have

00:43:44.844 --> 00:43:46.844
a problem with a 

00:43:50.593 --> 00:43:52.822
strip that I have done, my point
to guy would be -- let's see, 

00:43:52.823 --> 00:43:54.823
you probably have 

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.158
more of a problem with your 
mirror, and if you have trouble 

00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:01.159
with her 

00:44:02.215 --> 00:44:04.690
observations and what she has to
say, then look into yourself, 

00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:08.543
because it's her observations of
your life, and if that's -- if 

00:44:08.544 --> 00:44:10.386
you see yourself and you're 
getting upset, that's not my 

00:44:10.387 --> 00:44:12.387
issue, you know.

00:44:17.301 --> 00:44:18.928
But to see a man do specifically
what I did, that couldn't 

00:44:18.929 --> 00:44:20.929
happen.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.891
&gt;&gt;  That's like part of the 
thing also of, like, you can't 

00:44:25.892 --> 00:44:27.892
be a whole person, 

00:44:29.165 --> 00:44:31.862
you need to be, like, woman or 
Asian woman or whatever, and 

00:44:31.863 --> 00:44:33.897
like you're just supposed to, 
like, exist in that sort of 

00:44:38.052 --> 00:44:38.453
static identity and not have, 
like, complex feelings about 

00:44:38.454 --> 00:44:40.454
stuff.  So, yeah, I don't know.

00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:45.159
I mean, I guess -- my work has 
always 

00:44:46.876 --> 00:44:48.927
been sort of, like, even when it
started, I know I had ha lot of 

00:44:48.928 --> 00:44:50.928
female topics.

00:44:53.034 --> 00:44:54.905
You got pigeonholed into -- 
she's really great -- like 

00:44:54.906 --> 00:45:00.234
that's her topic, is girls and 
women, and like anytime -- I 

00:45:00.235 --> 00:45:02.495
feel like for a while, if 
anything horrible happened to a 

00:45:02.496 --> 00:45:06.588
woman in the newspapers, like 
some story that was horrible to 

00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:09.456
a girl, I was like, call 
Jillian.  She's really good with

00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:11.457
that kind of topic.

00:45:12.569 --> 00:45:15.003
So it's interesting that you're 
glad you can, like, present that

00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:17.004
really empathetic point of view,
but then it's 

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.550
like you can get pigeonholed.  
Yeah, for sure.

00:45:24.026 --> 00:45:26.026
&gt;&gt;  And I think all of you show 
that in your work.

00:45:27.289 --> 00:45:29.289
I mean, really the range of 
subjects 

00:45:33.655 --> 00:45:35.655
that you cover and issues, it's 
-- to me that shows progress.

00:45:37.572 --> 00:45:39.572
And did you -- I'm sorry.

00:45:40.631 --> 00:45:42.631
&gt;&gt;  I don't think I ever got 
pigeonholed 

00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:45.711
on women's topics, per se, but I
got 

00:45:46.769 --> 00:45:48.769
pigeonholed in depressing 
topics, like 

00:45:50.456 --> 00:45:52.543
depression or divorce or, you 
know murder.  I was really good 

00:45:52.544 --> 00:45:54.544
at that.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.547
But it gave me an opportunity to
put women in there, you know.

00:46:05.227 --> 00:46:07.227
The more interesting to draw.  
Women.

00:46:13.176 --> 00:46:17.247
&gt;&gt;  I feel like one more thing 
on the race thing, too, like 

00:46:17.248 --> 00:46:19.248
sometimes it can feel like when 
you're working in some of 

00:46:22.775 --> 00:46:24.775
these spaces that, like, the 
pubbishers 

00:46:26.853 --> 00:46:28.853
or editors, you're a person of 
color, it 

00:46:30.327 --> 00:46:32.796
can feel that you were okay, 
like up to this boundary line 

00:46:32.797 --> 00:46:36.124
of, like, your experience, and 
as long as you don't cross that 

00:46:36.125 --> 00:46:38.125
experience, then, like, we're 

00:46:39.194 --> 00:46:41.641
all good and we love it and we 
love you, and then like -- but, 

00:46:41.642 --> 00:46:43.642
like, don't push that.
&gt;&gt;  Don't go too far.

00:46:46.746 --> 00:46:48.746
&gt;&gt;  And for me -- again, it was 
when 

00:46:50.047 --> 00:46:51.678
newspapers were doing well, when
I started, and all the editors 

00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:56.184
who were going to be white men 
who were either going to pick up

00:46:56.185 --> 00:46:58.185
your strip or not, and 

00:47:00.104 --> 00:47:02.104
I would get "we already have 
Kathy.

00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:05.189
"  We don't need "where I'm 
coming from."

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:07.190
What?

00:47:08.667 --> 00:47:10.715
But similarly, my dad, 30 years 
before, had a strip "Luther.

00:47:15.629 --> 00:47:17.483
"  They said, we already have 
"we Pals."  We don't need 

00:47:17.484 --> 00:47:19.484
Luther.

00:47:21.569 --> 00:47:24.020
But you can have Heathcliff and 
Garfield.  How is that?  You 

00:47:24.021 --> 00:47:27.741
know, cats.
But you've got black 

00:47:27.742 --> 00:47:29.742
representation, a woman 
represented, and that's all.

00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:36.960
We've done our -- so we're in 
goodstanding, yeah.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.216
&gt;&gt;  And how many dog strips...
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.  Exactly.

00:47:48.633 --> 00:47:50.633
&gt;&gt;  Okay.

00:47:55.984 --> 00:47:57.984
We...

00:48:02.331 --> 00:48:04.378
I think you've done a great job 
answering all these questions 

00:48:04.379 --> 00:48:06.379
that I 

00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.689
have, and I think it's time to 
open up --

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:13.566
&gt;&gt;  Exactly right.  We have one 
small reminder.  We welcome your

00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:15.567
questions.

00:48:17.072 --> 00:48:19.109
So please join the conversation,
but realize that if you do ask a

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.169
question, you will automatically
become part of 

00:48:25.047 --> 00:48:27.047
the webcast, which we will place
in 

00:48:28.733 --> 00:48:30.582
YouTube and make publicly 
available as possible, because 

00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:32.583
libraries are all about sharing 
information widely and widely.

00:48:33.269 --> 00:48:35.714
So, yes, we open it to the 
floor.  Thank you.

00:48:40.826 --> 00:48:42.826
There are microphones on either 
side that will come around.

00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:46.971
&gt;&gt;  Hi, my name is Megan.  I'm a
librarian here at the Library of

00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:50.609
Congress, particularly 
interested in 

00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:54.773
making sure that the Library 
collects materials by women and 

00:48:54.774 --> 00:48:56.774
about women for the collection.

00:48:59.708 --> 00:49:01.708
So I'm just wondering if you 
have 

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:05.251
anything on what librarians like
me can do to make sure that your

00:49:05.252 --> 00:49:10.136
voices are represented or that 
things that are important to you

00:49:10.137 --> 00:49:12.137
are represented moving forward, 
because I want to make sure 

00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:18.948
that those gaps that we have 
previously don't exist anymore. 

00:49:18.949 --> 00:49:20.778
So if you have any thoughts on 
that, I would like to hear that.

00:49:20.779 --> 00:49:24.281
&gt;&gt;  And I am totally in concert 
with Megan on that.

00:49:25.509 --> 00:49:26.530
&gt;&gt;  You approve of that 
question.

00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.554
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;  Totally...

00:49:29.188 --> 00:49:31.188
&gt;&gt;  Please.  Sure.

00:49:32.484 --> 00:49:34.484
&gt;&gt;  What would be really 
interesting is 

00:49:36.576 --> 00:49:37.598
for you to maybe talk about what
the -- what the collections does

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:41.871
collect.  Like what is the 
collection?  What does the 

00:49:41.872 --> 00:49:45.351
Library of Congress interested 
in collecting?  Just prints?

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.155
Or are you interested in -- you 
and I and Martha have talked 

00:49:51.156 --> 00:49:53.156
about the difficulty of digital 
prints and how they are --

00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:56.018
&gt;&gt;  Yes.
&gt;&gt;  How they're original but not

00:49:56.019 --> 00:49:59.677
really original.  The original 
is the digital file, and how do 

00:49:59.678 --> 00:50:01.678
you maintain digital files?

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.390
Do you keep a print in there -- 
I 

00:50:06.907 --> 00:50:08.955
think one of the pieces you've 
got is a digital print because 

00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:10.956
it was made on a computer.
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.290
No, that is definitely an area 
that we're working on right now.

00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.765
I would say we're in sort of a 
state of transition.

00:50:24.523 --> 00:50:26.523
We do have a web archive that 
Megan 

00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:29.623
has been very active in 
building, developing, but I...

00:50:29.624 --> 00:50:31.624
&gt;&gt;  Sorry to interrupt.

00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:38.852
What about semes.
&gt;&gt;  What is a zeme?

00:50:43.162 --> 00:50:44.597
&gt;&gt;  A small photocopy book, like
a hand made mini comic strip.

00:50:48.487 --> 00:50:50.528
&gt;&gt;  Just to add to that, through
our Expo collection we are 

00:50:50.529 --> 00:50:52.971
actually working with some of 
the smaller self-published 

00:50:54.821 --> 00:50:57.303
cartoonists and illustrators 
working now but we are also 

00:50:57.304 --> 00:51:00.176
working to build out an 
cartoonist chiewm zeme 

00:51:00.177 --> 00:51:04.299
collection which broadens the 
scope not just to comics and 

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.300
illustration but more literature
and criticism and other things.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.471
So that is a work in progress.
&gt;&gt;  I was going to say the same 

00:51:12.472 --> 00:51:14.472
thing.

00:51:15.943 --> 00:51:18.182
I think that, like, even apart 
from digital print -- the stuff 

00:51:18.183 --> 00:51:21.925
just lives on -- so much lives 
online, and that's all where it 

00:51:21.926 --> 00:51:23.926
lives, you know what I mean?

00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:28.213
And so it's tough because you 
have 

00:51:30.943 --> 00:51:32.943
this -- for example, LGBTQ plus,
a lot 

00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:37.506
of content is on Tumblr, and if 
they decide to shut down and not

00:51:37.507 --> 00:51:41.404
host that stuff anymore, that 
stuff is totally gone.  So I 

00:51:41.405 --> 00:51:43.405
think these digital collections 

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:46.702
-- I know they do it with SBX 
too, by 

00:51:50.427 --> 00:51:52.443
read a little what Rhizome does,
the new museum in New York, 

00:51:52.444 --> 00:51:54.444
they're like 

00:51:55.939 --> 00:51:58.181
geocities thing, I think that's 
really where the grassroots of, 

00:51:58.182 --> 00:52:02.692
like, comics is, and increasing 
illustration as well.  Like 

00:52:02.693 --> 00:52:04.521
Instagram is just this -- that's
where it is happening, you know 

00:52:04.522 --> 00:52:09.454
what I mean?  And I think a lot 
of those people will not end up 

00:52:09.455 --> 00:52:12.146
going to be famous.  Some will 
but most of them -- the vast 

00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:16.001
majority are not going to, but I
think 

00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:18.901
that is really the pulse of, 
like, where people are creating 

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.902
now.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.474
And it's more accessible space 
than printed published work too.

00:52:26.517 --> 00:52:28.517
&gt;&gt;  All right.

00:52:29.964 --> 00:52:32.824
So a certain amount of web 
crawling and acquiring digital 

00:52:32.825 --> 00:52:34.825
files, I mean, 

00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:38.104
that's something that we're 
working on 

00:52:39.217 --> 00:52:42.094
and, you know, we've got the 
beginnings going, good 

00:52:42.095 --> 00:52:44.095
beginnings in web comics, 
especially.

00:52:44.332 --> 00:52:46.332
&gt;&gt;  And talking to other 
illustrators, I 

00:52:47.785 --> 00:52:50.428
mean, I know some black women, 
you know, cartoonists and 

00:52:50.429 --> 00:52:55.343
illustrators, and, you know, 
perhaps, just talking, I talk.  

00:52:55.344 --> 00:52:57.344
But just talking to people who 
are in 

00:53:00.224 --> 00:53:01.035
the field, they can get to 
somebody else who is also doing 

00:53:01.036 --> 00:53:03.275
it.
&gt;&gt;  There are also I would say 

00:53:03.276 --> 00:53:05.918
some artists working in these 
fields and kind 

00:53:10.816 --> 00:53:13.071
of a hybrid way, too, and 
collecting their work, it's not 

00:53:13.072 --> 00:53:15.334
always straightforward.

00:53:18.597 --> 00:53:20.597
Political cartoonists, for 
example, a 

00:53:23.686 --> 00:53:25.718
lot of them still do drawings, 
add color digitally, abandon 

00:53:25.719 --> 00:53:27.719
that.

00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:31.459
We have a couple of editorial --
or political cartoonists in the 

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:35.351
audience here.
So, yeah, there's a lot still.

00:53:35.762 --> 00:53:38.213
&gt;&gt;  Even right now, especially 
-- 

00:53:42.503 --> 00:53:44.336
because, like, the way to make a
book, either make a printed 

00:53:44.337 --> 00:53:47.844
T-shirt or a button or whatever,
all this stuff is just -- it's 

00:53:47.845 --> 00:53:50.515
this whole different way of 
being an illustrator now and 

00:53:50.516 --> 00:53:52.537
selling your stuff directly 
online and do you 

00:53:55.592 --> 00:53:59.130
have to then collect objects you
know, of all these tote bags?  

00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:02.215
Like maybe... maybe that's a big
part of illustration now.

00:54:05.886 --> 00:54:07.720
&gt;&gt;  And on the other hand, it's 
nice to have high quality 

00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:09.721
prints, archival 

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.020
prints of -- they give you a 
sense of a 

00:54:14.712 --> 00:54:16.542
sampling of a, you know, 
up-and-coming or award-winning 

00:54:16.543 --> 00:54:18.785
illustrator now.
Other questions?

00:54:19.191 --> 00:54:24.093
Yeah?
&gt;&gt;  This question is for 

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.094
Barbara.

00:54:27.136 --> 00:54:29.820
Barbara, I really enjoyed your 
strip when it was being 

00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:31.452
syndicated and I just wonder, 
could you talk about why you 

00:54:31.453 --> 00:54:33.453
gave it up?

00:54:37.979 --> 00:54:39.638
&gt;&gt;  Because that stuff didn't 
pay, basically, basically with a

00:54:39.639 --> 00:54:41.639
newspaper 

00:54:43.722 --> 00:54:45.780
comic strip, the way it works is
you -- the newspapers pay the 

00:54:45.781 --> 00:54:48.021
syndicate and the syndicate 
gives you a portion to get paid.

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:52.136
So you'll have a contract with a
syndicate that will say, if you 

00:54:52.137 --> 00:54:54.975
go below a certain number of 
papers, you have -- 

00:54:58.238 --> 00:55:01.120
you can say, I'm done, or we can
say, we're done.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.065
Universal Press's credit, they 
kept me on a long time when they

00:55:06.066 --> 00:55:08.066
could have dropped me.

00:55:09.344 --> 00:55:12.808
I think they felt a certain kind
of, you know -- they needed me. 

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.892
You know, so they could say, we 
have the black woman, you know. 

00:55:15.893 --> 00:55:17.893
And that's really good, because 
they 

00:55:19.995 --> 00:55:22.220
needed to be able to say that, 
and so... but as newspapers 

00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:25.082
started declining -- and when I 
first started in, you know, 

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:31.690
the early

00:55:33.414 --> 00:55:35.450
'90s, universal Press sent a 
letter to all the creators and 

00:55:35.451 --> 00:55:39.947
said you know, newspapers are on
the decline, and so not only -- 

00:55:39.948 --> 00:55:41.976
it's the same strip that goes 
out to every newspaper, but if 

00:55:41.977 --> 00:55:43.977
the circulation is larger for 
newspaper, you get paid more.

00:55:48.733 --> 00:55:51.404
So when circulations go down and
newspapers start dropping off, 

00:55:51.405 --> 00:55:54.959
then paychecks get smaller, and 
then they think, oh, it's not 

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.994
worth it, you know, all the work
and energy to keep this.

00:56:01.126 --> 00:56:03.204
So it was a certain time when I 
was doing the strip that I 

00:56:03.205 --> 00:56:08.114
started also doing other gigs, 
you know, I've got to do other 

00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.349
things to keep my life going.  
So I worked in other areas.

00:56:11.172 --> 00:56:13.172
&gt;&gt;  What did you do?

00:56:15.457 --> 00:56:17.303
&gt;&gt;  Many things, but it seems 
like I stayed in publishing for 

00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:19.304
a lot of it.

00:56:20.571 --> 00:56:22.571
But also I did fashion stuff.

00:56:25.246 --> 00:56:28.515
But like I've been at Parents 
magazine for 100 years now.  I 

00:56:28.516 --> 00:56:30.516
see somebody I used to work 
with.

00:56:31.607 --> 00:56:34.503
And for so long.  And I'm the 
research director there.  How 

00:56:34.504 --> 00:56:40.009
did that happen?  And they don't
know I'm a cartoonist.  Oh, you 

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.010
have such nice handwriting.  
Thank you!

00:56:42.475 --> 00:56:44.475
[ Laughter ]
Thanks.

00:56:44.515 --> 00:56:46.756
So that's how it goes.

00:56:56.369 --> 00:56:58.369
&gt;&gt;  Hi, I am Denise Slaughter, 
long-time 

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.416
friend of Barbara's, but I 
wanted to ask 

00:57:05.916 --> 00:57:06.942
all of you if today's climate, 
especially -- we'll start with 

00:57:06.943 --> 00:57:11.449
the younger generation here, but
someone who is using the online 

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.450
medium, and I really 

00:57:14.707 --> 00:57:15.519
think you could go back, 
Barbara, and do what you do 

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.884
online.  There are business 
models for something like that. 

00:57:20.885 --> 00:57:23.749
My son is making money, and I 
don't know what in the heck he 

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:25.750
is doing.
[ Laughter ]

00:57:25.982 --> 00:57:28.228
I'm off topic...
[ Laughter ]

00:57:31.532 --> 00:57:33.532
Today's climate, you know, pom 
ticks and 

00:57:35.724 --> 00:57:37.724
the vitriol -- today's politics 
and the 

00:57:40.876 --> 00:57:43.139
vitriol on the Internet, whether
or not on the Internet, affect 

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:46.624
the work and the words, the 
pictures that you want to draw 

00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:48.886
and what you want to say?  Does 
it diminish it or does it fire 

00:57:49.088 --> 00:57:51.088
you up?

00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:55.742
&gt;&gt;  I think that it totally has,
and I 

00:57:58.803 --> 00:58:00.020
think that there's this -- well,
I think that it is impacted for 

00:58:00.021 --> 00:58:02.021
sure.

00:58:03.478 --> 00:58:05.510
I think that now illustrators, 
especially because you're 

00:58:05.511 --> 00:58:09.736
responding in realtime and it 
feels almost like discordant to 

00:58:09.737 --> 00:58:12.582
then post a nice picture of a 
flower when a school shooting 

00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.583
has happened, right?

00:58:16.284 --> 00:58:18.561
So I think that because the 
illustrators and cartoonists are

00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:21.835
so much in dialogue with their 
audience, it's an intimate 

00:58:21.836 --> 00:58:26.117
relationship.  In a weird way, 
you're kind of -- it can be 

00:58:26.118 --> 00:58:28.118
tough because you end up being 
like -- you feel like you're 

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:30.990
entertaining for free or you're 
some 

00:58:32.091 --> 00:58:34.091
sort of online buddy to, like, 
30,000 

00:58:36.402 --> 00:58:38.716
people or whatever, and so -- 
and I think that now because a 

00:58:38.717 --> 00:58:42.797
lot of the people that have 
really infused this new energy 

00:58:42.798 --> 00:58:44.719
into illustration are younger 
and more political and more 

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.720
diverse, I think 

00:58:51.468 --> 00:58:53.911
there is a demand to question 
and comment and it doesn't exist

00:58:53.912 --> 00:58:58.385
in a vacuum, and I think that 
increasingly it feels very out 

00:58:58.386 --> 00:59:00.422
of touch if somebody thinks 
their work is not connected to 

00:59:02.514 --> 00:59:05.350
the world and it doesn't respond
to the world.  And I think some 

00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:07.351
of that is the 

00:59:09.052 --> 00:59:10.706
current fashion of thinking as 
well, but I don't -- I kind of 

00:59:10.707 --> 00:59:16.207
agree.  You know what I mean?  
It doesn't exist in a vacuum.  

00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:17.862
And if you don't respond that 
means that you're privileged 

00:59:17.863 --> 00:59:20.529
enough to not have to respond.  
So, yeah.

00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:24.011
&gt;&gt;  Or maybe you just want to be
a little more thoughtful before 

00:59:24.012 --> 00:59:26.012
you respond.
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.

00:59:26.485 --> 00:59:28.485
&gt;&gt;  That would be novel.
[chuckles]

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:31.379
&gt;&gt;  We have time for one more 
question.  We've got a gentleman

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.380
here.
&gt;&gt;  Hi.

00:59:35.521 --> 00:59:37.378
So there's some really great 
hash tags trending on Twitter 

00:59:37.379 --> 00:59:39.379
right now for women 

00:59:41.254 --> 00:59:43.254
in illustration, and part of 
that is a 

00:59:45.568 --> 00:59:47.202
big conversation about you know,
the kid let industries, there's 

00:59:47.203 --> 00:59:51.478
a lot of women working in that 
industry and at very, very high 

00:59:51.479 --> 00:59:53.479
levels but still some inequality
in terms of the awards, 

00:59:55.147 --> 00:59:56.977
especially on the illustration 
side, and I'm wondering if you 

00:59:56.978 --> 00:59:58.978
have particular thoughts about 
that conversation and 

01:00:01.924 --> 01:00:03.954
make sure people know about 
those hashtags, because there's 

01:00:03.955 --> 01:00:05.955
a lot of great stuff promoted.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.220
Kidlet women and women in 
illustration.

01:00:12.122 --> 01:00:13.534
&gt;&gt;  I have a new picture book 
out, so I'm thinking about that 

01:00:13.535 --> 01:00:16.406
and running in that circle a lot
now.  Again, like I said at the 

01:00:16.407 --> 01:00:18.407
beginning, 

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:23.534
it's fascinating because it's a 
may 

01:00:25.328 --> 01:00:26.769
triarkey in some ways, but some 
persistence problems exist when 

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.219
power comes into it, for 
example, I'm super-interested to

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.220
know that, you know, 

01:00:37.359 --> 01:00:39.011
a lot of young hot, attractive 
men are perceived to get ahead 

01:00:39.012 --> 01:00:41.012
in this way.

01:00:42.265 --> 01:00:44.265
And you're just like, that's so 
disappointing.

01:00:45.347 --> 01:00:47.347
That is just a flip of, like, 
this 

01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:51.101
power thing, but again a lot of 
it is tied 

01:00:54.562 --> 01:00:56.562
into any other industry, like of
"me 

01:00:58.589 --> 01:01:00.589
too" it's kid electric kid lit 
is having an industry money.

01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:07.294
It's power, influence, fame.  
All these things.  And once you 

01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:11.358
put that into the mix, all those
patterns just recur.  But I 

01:01:11.359 --> 01:01:13.359
don't know.

01:01:16.657 --> 01:01:18.283
It's -- I think that sometimes 
this is a very, like, nebulous 

01:01:18.284 --> 01:01:20.284
industry.

01:01:22.158 --> 01:01:24.158
It's like, how do you become 
popular?

01:01:26.233 --> 01:01:28.233
How do you get -- how do you get
a book deal?

01:01:29.913 --> 01:01:31.134
How do you become book to do 
speaking?  Where do you get 

01:01:31.135 --> 01:01:33.135
invited?

01:01:34.634 --> 01:01:36.861
And it's like there's a lot of 
inter-socializing.  And that's 

01:01:36.862 --> 01:01:39.322
how the industry of publishing 
kind of works, and that can 

01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:42.534
favor certain types of people.

01:01:44.444 --> 01:01:46.491
And then it all gets, like, kind
of gray zoned and there's a lot 

01:01:46.492 --> 01:01:50.550
of gray zone in a lot of 
publishing.  Maybe that's 

01:01:50.551 --> 01:01:52.783
industry, but gray zone can be 
frustrating because you have to 

01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:00.271
be able to navigate it to 
thrive, but also to stay sane.

01:02:00.315 --> 01:02:02.789
&gt;&gt;  I was going to say hashtags 
are great.

01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:09.391
It's a great way to find stuff 
if you're looking on the web.  

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.392
Or on social media.

01:02:15.104 --> 01:02:16.120
But in a way, it's endemic of 
where we are right now 

01:02:16.121 --> 01:02:18.121
politically.

01:02:23.297 --> 01:02:25.162
It's the spur the burgeoning way
of recognizing women in a way, 

01:02:25.163 --> 01:02:29.845
it's like a thing to do, and I 
hope that we get past that, that

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.846
we survive this trend.  I don't 
want to be a trend.

01:02:34.136 --> 01:02:36.136
I want to be just part of the 
whole.

01:02:39.327 --> 01:02:41.167
And so the hashtagging is great 
if you want to send to the 

01:02:41.168 --> 01:02:45.043
community, right?  Because you 
can see how many other people 

01:02:45.044 --> 01:02:47.044
are using that same hashtag.

01:02:49.526 --> 01:02:51.526
It's a way to connect in with 
certain 

01:02:52.787 --> 01:02:54.251
very specific topics, whether 
it's children's literature or 

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:56.898
generally women in illustration.
They're kind of two different 

01:02:56.899 --> 01:02:58.899
things.

01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:05.905
But I just have this great hope 
for a future that doesn't need a

01:03:05.906 --> 01:03:09.197
hashtag like that for it to be 
vital.

01:03:11.648 --> 01:03:13.648
I think the kid lit women in 
particular 

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.540
is a response to some of the 
recent 

01:03:20.199 --> 01:03:22.263
YouTube stuff -- the #metoo 
stuff.  I think it does serve as

01:03:22.264 --> 01:03:25.735
an educational tool for people 
that are starting -- I don't 

01:03:25.736 --> 01:03:30.205
know the way it works and now 
they're quickly -- so maybe 

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.248
that's good in that it helps 
people prevent falling into 

01:03:32.249 --> 01:03:34.249
these traps 

01:03:35.314 --> 01:03:36.321
or bad situations before their 
career is at that point.  So I 

01:03:36.322 --> 01:03:38.986
don't know.
&gt;&gt;  It's terrific.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.202
I mean, over 100 -- this sort of
is a good ending point, I think,

01:03:46.203 --> 01:03:48.203
perhaps.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720
From hashtags to, you know...

01:03:54.672 --> 01:03:57.322
over 100 years ago, Celia Boat 
dreamed of a time when the 

01:03:57.323 --> 01:04:00.410
notion of women in art would 
become as strange as mentioning 

01:04:00.411 --> 01:04:04.888
men in art.
So we're moving toward that.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.344
&gt;&gt;  How about we all agree 
today, it's 

01:04:12.256 --> 01:04:12.885
been a terrific panel and we 
have been privileged to hear...

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:15.373
[Applause]

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.460
We've been privileged to hear 
from 

01:04:28.522 --> 01:04:29.551
terrific artists, terrific 
illustrators, terrific 

01:04:29.552 --> 01:04:33.076
cartoonists, period.
&gt;&gt;  Thank you.

01:04:33.487 --> 01:04:35.487
[Applause]

01:04:36.851 --> 01:04:39.283
&gt;&gt;  All right.  I'm going to 
call on some of my 

01:04:42.892 --> 01:04:45.995
colleagues from the prints and 
photograph division.  As you 

01:04:45.996 --> 01:04:47.825
head out the door in groups, if 
you have time to go to the 

01:04:47.826 --> 01:04:50.708
graphic arts gallery and see 
some of the original artwork, 

01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:52.709
it's a fantastic experience.

01:04:55.406 --> 01:04:57.239
And conveniently located next to
the library's gift shop, filled 

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.379
with souvenirs, but most 
specifically the book Drawn to 

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.380
Purpose.  Thank you for your 
time today.

01:05:04.809 --> 01:05:06.809
[Applause]
