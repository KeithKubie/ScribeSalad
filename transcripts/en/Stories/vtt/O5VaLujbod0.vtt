00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.190
NARRATOR: Five years ago,
Julie and Andrew Puckett

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.560
were working in the
theater industry in Chicago

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.140
when they realized that
working in the theater industry

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.060
just wasn't providing
them with the salaries

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.505
they needed to live in Chicago.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:12.880
JULIE PUCKETT:
The cost of living

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.830
was so high that
Andrew and I both had

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.107
to work about 60 hours a week
to sort of pay the bills.

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:19.690
NARRATOR: Even though
Julie and Andrew

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.940
both took on multiple
side jobs, they still

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.065
weren't feeling any relief.

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:24.814
JULIE PUCKETT: It was
like, we're so young

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:27.370
and we're wasting all of the
best years of our life cooped

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.120
up in an office.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.950
So we decided to look into
alternative living situations,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.090
where we wouldn't be beholden to
a landlord or neck deep in rent

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.640
or a mortgage or
anything like that.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.230
We found this bus.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.650
It was not really our cup
of tea aesthetic-wise,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.260
but it was $9000.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.670
And so we were like, we
could definitely afford that.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.870
We got all of our savings,
which was $10,000.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.580
That's all we had, literally,
all we had in the whole world.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.700
The bus is 30 feet long.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.879
It is seven feet wide, so it's
around the 200 square feet-ish.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.662
We got rid of all
of our furniture,

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:08.120
literally every
piece of furniture.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.690
I don't think we kept anything.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.747
It just wasn't practical.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:13.330
NARRATOR: The couple
spent four months

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.210
renovating and building custom
furniture for their new home.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.918
JULIE PUCKETT: For
electricity and water,

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:20.775
we both have external hookups
like an RV-style hookup.

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:21.400
We have a sink.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.150
We have a shower.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.367
It's pretty typical.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.200
I think people are
usually really surprised.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.750
They're like, you have
shower in your bus?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.220
Yes, I live in it.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.040
NARRATOR: While wages in the US
have largely remained stagnant,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.490
the cost of basic necessities
such as food, gas, and housing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.070
have been increasing leading
more and more young people

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.010
to seek out creative,
affordable, living solutions.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.160
Just search a van life
or tiny home on Instagram

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.080
and you'll find growing
communities in search

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.820
of a simpler way of life.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.270
JULIE PUCKETT: The transition
was really hard at first.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.060
For the first six
months, adjusting

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.930
to being in this tight
residence with another person,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560
you're just like, you're
in my space all the time.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.910
I'm very controlling about that
this has to be done this way,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.444
and this has to
be done this way.

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:08.360
And you wipe off the
counter when you're done.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
But you can't be like that here,
because you'll just go crazy.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.490
So you just have to
kind of be a lot more

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.890
accommodating to each
other and understanding.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.500
NARRATOR: Julie and Andrew
settled into a campground space

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.420
at Stone Mountain
Park in Georgia.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.730
Because Andrew also
works at the state park,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.612
they get a reduced rate
to rent a campsite.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.115
JULIE PUCKETT: We live
right next to the lake,

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:33.630
and the mountains
are right there.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.830
All of these hiking,
outdoor nature trails,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.390
it sort of fulfills this amazing
thing in us where we're like,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.884
this is what we needed.

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:45.050
We don't have to work as
much, because we don't have

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.020
to pay so much
money towards rent

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.130
and all these other
things, which is amazing.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180
So we've gotten to really
focus on our personal goals,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.230
our career goals,
our relationship

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.610
as a married couple.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.080
It's really great.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.270
And I think that is
what I would definitely

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.950
offer to people
whenever they're like,

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.408
why would you guys
want to do that?

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.130
I say, there's so
much more to life

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.840
than just paying for stuff.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.880
And if you can take
some of that time

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150
that you would put
towards working

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.970
and put it towards stuff that
really needs your attention,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.230
so many good things
will come from that.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.120
NARRATOR: From living in a
bus to living on a tiny boat,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.490
watch this next episode
about Louis Bird

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.670
as he rowed from California
to Hawaii to reconnect

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.210
with the memory of his father.
