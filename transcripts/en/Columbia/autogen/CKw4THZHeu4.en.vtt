wonderful gifted young people and we
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.259
wonderful gifted young people and we
know they're going to be the people who

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
know they're going to be the people who
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.050

the future and it's important to know
 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.569
the future and it's important to know
something about them and and we can ask

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
something about them and and we can ask
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490
something about them and and we can ask
them but you know they don't always tell

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
them but you know they don't always tell
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.990
them but you know they don't always tell
us what's really going on in their minds

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000
us what's really going on in their minds
 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.459
us what's really going on in their minds
how if it is true that the ways in which

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
how if it is true that the ways in which

the great questions of the time or what
they perceive to be the great questions

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
they perceive to be the great questions
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.580
they perceive to be the great questions
of the time and I think for Judy's in my

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
of the time and I think for Judy's in my
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189
of the time and I think for Judy's in my
generation it would be it was going to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
generation it would be it was going to
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349
generation it would be it was going to
start with civil rights and then it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
start with civil rights and then it
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.170
start with civil rights and then it
spread to the to the Vietnam War and I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
spread to the to the Vietnam War and I
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.429
spread to the to the Vietnam War and I
mean this animated an enormous amount of

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439
mean this animated an enormous amount of
 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.859
mean this animated an enormous amount of
human action at among the younger

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
human action at among the younger
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990
human action at among the younger
generation and spread over into the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
generation and spread over into the
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.899
generation and spread over into the
environmental movement and this and that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909
environmental movement and this and that
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.219
environmental movement and this and that
how would you describe how would you

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
how would you describe how would you
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.219
how would you describe how would you
characterize that now that is what are

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
characterize that now that is what are
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.609
characterize that now that is what are
the great issues that are sort of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
the great issues that are sort of
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.050
the great issues that are sort of
capturing people's motivations damn well

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
capturing people's motivations damn well
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300
capturing people's motivations damn well
I definitely have here we go again I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310
I definitely have here we go again I
 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940
I definitely have here we go again I
definitely have a stencil of this issue

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950
definitely have a stencil of this issue
 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.330
definitely have a stencil of this issue
prior to being with NYC service working

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
prior to being with NYC service working
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219
prior to being with NYC service working
at the mayor's office I was with an

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
at the mayor's office I was with an
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.219
at the mayor's office I was with an
organization city year and before that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
organization city year and before that
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170
organization city year and before that
achievement first I would say one of the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
achievement first I would say one of the
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260
achievement first I would say one of the
things i think this generation i do

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
things i think this generation i do
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.789
things i think this generation i do
think one important question is how are

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
think one important question is how are
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700
think one important question is how are
we defining generations yeah i would say

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
we defining generations yeah i would say
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.760
we defining generations yeah i would say
a lot of what we are seeing the larger

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
a lot of what we are seeing the larger
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.069
a lot of what we are seeing the larger
service organizations the city years the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
service organizations the city years the
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.100
service organizations the city years the
teach for America's they didn't come out

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
teach for America's they didn't come out
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.289
teach for America's they didn't come out
of this current generation and so we

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
of this current generation and so we
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.929
of this current generation and so we
actually are seeing the work I think a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
actually are seeing the work I think a
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969
actually are seeing the work I think a
past generation and we're seeing how the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
past generation and we're seeing how the
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.520
past generation and we're seeing how the
current generation is responding to that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
current generation is responding to that
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.300
current generation is responding to that
call but I think one thing that has

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
call but I think one thing that has
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.790
call but I think one thing that has
become clear to me is that we

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
become clear to me is that we
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.730
become clear to me is that we
do think the social many of us think the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740
do think the social many of us think the
 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.680
do think the social many of us think the
social the civil rights issue of our

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690
social the civil rights issue of our
 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.260
social the civil rights issue of our
time is manifesting itself in the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270
time is manifesting itself in the
 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.530
time is manifesting itself in the
achievement gap and I and I think we're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540
achievement gap and I and I think we're
 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.060
achievement gap and I and I think we're
seeing that in different arenas so I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070
seeing that in different arenas so I
 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.310
seeing that in different arenas so I
think the one that people point to often

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320
think the one that people point to often
 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.230
think the one that people point to often
is the achievement gap and how we're

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
is the achievement gap and how we're
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.950
is the achievement gap and how we're
seeing it in students academic

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960
seeing it in students academic
 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.110
seeing it in students academic
achievement based on their color and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
achievement based on their color and
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.720
achievement based on their color and
their socioeconomic status but I would

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730
their socioeconomic status but I would
 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.490
their socioeconomic status but I would
also say that we are beginning to see a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500
also say that we are beginning to see a
 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.070
also say that we are beginning to see a
gap in in just standard quality of life

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080
gap in in just standard quality of life
 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.680
gap in in just standard quality of life
issues health what type of insurance can

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690
issues health what type of insurance can
 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.050
issues health what type of insurance can
you actually have or you have no

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
you actually have or you have no
 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.520
you actually have or you have no
insurance and so what type of medical

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
insurance and so what type of medical
 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.920
insurance and so what type of medical
care do you have I think this need for

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
care do you have I think this need for
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.280
care do you have I think this need for
equality is something that has been the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290
equality is something that has been the
 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.800
equality is something that has been the
same across the generations but I think

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810
same across the generations but I think
 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.140
same across the generations but I think
we're focusing largely now on education

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150
we're focusing largely now on education
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.010
we're focusing largely now on education
and health okay that's very important

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020
and health okay that's very important
 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.180
and health okay that's very important
yep would add a third I think that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190
yep would add a third I think that
 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.670
yep would add a third I think that
students today young people today are

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
students today young people today are
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.230
students today young people today are
deeply focused on the environment yeah

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240
deeply focused on the environment yeah
 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.900
deeply focused on the environment yeah
and if there is real action in

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
and if there is real action in
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.960
and if there is real action in
Washington I honestly believe it will

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970
Washington I honestly believe it will
 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.750
Washington I honestly believe it will
largely come from the kind of advocacy

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
largely come from the kind of advocacy
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.750
largely come from the kind of advocacy
that many people but younger people in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760
that many people but younger people in
 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.630
that many people but younger people in
particular or showing and and and people

particular or showing and and and people
 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.000
particular or showing and and and people
are really saying we're doing this for

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
are really saying we're doing this for
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.580
are really saying we're doing this for
our children and our grandchildren when

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590
our children and our grandchildren when
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.949
our children and our grandchildren when
they talk about wanting to mitigate

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
they talk about wanting to mitigate
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.750
they talk about wanting to mitigate
against climate change think about

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
against climate change think about
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.600
against climate change think about
resilience and adaptation to the current

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610
resilience and adaptation to the current
 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490
resilience and adaptation to the current
changes it's an equity issue and of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500
changes it's an equity issue and of
 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.430
changes it's an equity issue and of
course it's a health issue and a poverty

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440
course it's a health issue and a poverty
 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.590
course it's a health issue and a poverty
issue certainly the face of it couldn't

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600
issue certainly the face of it couldn't
 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.350

have been more clear after Katrina so
 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.530
have been more clear after Katrina so
what what environmental issues often do

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540
what what environmental issues often do
 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.620
what what environmental issues often do
is make more evident what the face of

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630
is make more evident what the face of
 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.710
is make more evident what the face of
poverty looks like in a particular place

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720
poverty looks like in a particular place
 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.699
poverty looks like in a particular place

I am convinced that young people are are

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850
I am convinced that young people are are
 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.780
I am convinced that young people are are
captured by that notion they really do

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790
captured by that notion they really do
 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.590
captured by that notion they really do
understand that their planet and where

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600
