00:00:02.576 --> 00:00:03.316
&gt;&gt;Matt: Seventy-five percent

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:05.336
of last year's graduating
class participated

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:06.596
in community-based learning.

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:10.096
It's not required, it's not
anything that they have to do

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:13.496
for graduation, but I think the
numbers speak for themselves,

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.296
an important quality of
living is to be curious.

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.636
Students have an opportunity

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:22.386
to take the community-based
learning program,

00:00:22.386 --> 00:00:26.736
and that encompasses a number of
elements, including internships.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:31.976
They enter into a discussion
with myself or my two colleagues

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:33.396
about some of their interests,

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:35.836
which they may have already
developed and they're walking

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.296
through the door with like,
hey I'm really interested in,

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:42.826
international affairs, how can
I access that sort of curiosity

00:00:42.826 --> 00:00:44.236
in the small town of Montpelier?

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:47.186
And so we just begin a dialogue
about what that would look like,

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:48.946
why they're interested in that.

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:51.586
And I think that that
discussion, on the front end,

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:54.396
helps craft the right
experience,

00:00:54.726 --> 00:00:57.586
with the right mentor
and the right pieces

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:58.836
of any sort of internship.

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.336
&gt;&gt;Adam: We're trying
to break down this idea

00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:05.006
that learning is contained in
a classroom for some reason.

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:07.706
&gt;&gt;Rachel: So I went to Matt
McLane around Thanksgiving

00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:10.646
and I was like Matt, I want to
do something fraud prevention

00:01:10.646 --> 00:01:12.156
and he goes, you what?

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:15.976
And we found DFR, the Department
of Financial Regulation.

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:17.536
&gt;&gt;Sarah: We were
thrilled to get her,

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.876
not only is she just
a real go-getter

00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:22.416
but she gives us a really
valuable perspective

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.736
from young people, which
we are missing around here.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:26.976
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I really
like having the chance

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.956
to actually learn
things hands-on

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.426
and not just be in a classroom.

00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:33.906
In the first few weeks I
just got a kind of taste

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:35.846
of what everyone does,
I shadowed a bunch

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.756
of different people, and then I
settled in on my project

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:39.526
that I'm working on now.

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:42.996
&gt;&gt;Understanding credit cards
and loans, identify theft

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:44.366
and then sort of a pretext.

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:49.006
&gt;&gt;I am creating an app that
is going to teach the basics

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:49.976
of financial literacy.

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:51.083
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Yeah, maybe it would
be cool to have some interaction

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:51.976
in there so you don't see it all
at once and you actually have--

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:53.886
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:55.876
&gt;&gt;To like dig deeper.

00:01:57.076 --> 00:01:58.456
&gt;&gt;Matt: On the front end there's
a number of different pieces

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.526
that the students
are expected to do.

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:00.936
A letter of interest,

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.736
cover letter certainly is an
expectation, it's just a way

00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:04.846
to say I'm interested
in your work.

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.206
And then there's kind of
interpersonal oral communication

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:09.126
in the site interview.

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:10.806
They're meeting with
the community partner,

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:14.336
not only to learn about what
the site possibilities are,

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:18.866
but to figure out
is it the right fit.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:22.176
&gt;&gt;Garrett: I'm not quite
sure yet of what I want to do

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.556
after high school, but
I have been looking

00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:26.606
into the whole forestry
business.

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:29.526
I do my internship twice a week.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:32.346
&gt;&gt;Marc: We try to have him
do a little bit of hands-on

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.456
on all the different
aspects that we do here,

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:38.986
from the very beginning, to the
correspondence with the client,

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:40.566
to the end with the kiln.

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.206
&gt;&gt;Garrett: He's taught me
all about the different ways

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.026
to calculate and
measure the pricing

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:48.916
and the different species.

00:02:49.596 --> 00:02:51.666
&gt;&gt;Marc: When you have to stop
and you explain to somebody

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.736
versus doing it repetitively,
you get a whole different feel

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:56.076
of what actually you are doing.

00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:58.396
So it's been a good
experience for me.

00:02:58.576 --> 00:02:59.996
&gt;&gt;Sarah: The main thing
that we wanted to make sure

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.896
that we helped accommodate
was the learning goals,

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.346
so it was a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:07.696
&gt;&gt;Adam: We have seven learning
expectations in this school.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:11.946
We focus on reading, writing,
communication, problem solving,

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:15.786
habits of learning,
creativity, and citizenship.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.956
&gt;&gt;Rachel: We have to pick
one or two and be like,

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:19.246
this is how I'm going
to fulfill this,

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:20.726
and then prove that at the end.

00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:22.906
&gt;&gt;Adam: So it's not
just a cool experience,

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:24.916
there's that really
kind of clear connection

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.196
between what they're
doing and the values

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:28.386
that the school community has.

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:31.226
And many of the projects
that they do are developed

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.386
in conjunction with
their community partner.

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:36.656
And we want to honor all those
possibilities for students

00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:38.666
in terms of what the product is.

00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:40.716
The end product, from
the school's end,

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:44.456
could be a reflective paper that
incorporates a lot of the pieces

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:47.396
that they observed
or took part in,

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:49.586
so awareness certainly
could be an end product.

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:53.226
&gt;&gt;Matt: What I'm not willing
to do is to allow students

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:57.126
to not think about
their experience.

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:01.076
And so we're realizing,
with 60 to 70 students

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:04.236
who are independently
working out in the community,

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:06.876
that it's important
to bring them together

00:04:06.976 --> 00:04:10.366
so that they have some sort
of reflective cohesion.

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:13.866
The seminars are small groups
that come together once a month

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:16.536
to connect up with each
other and to kind of talk

00:04:16.536 --> 00:04:17.446
about their experiences.

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:20.576
It's also a really
practical time for them

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:23.306
to develop their resume,
write a thank you letter.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.586
We have an evaluation that we
share with community partners

00:04:27.586 --> 00:04:29.636
and it identifies
areas that a lot

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.776
of employment evaluations
would involve, persistence,

00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:34.816
responsibility, attention
to detail.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:37.846
It's a way for us to align
our learning expectations

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:40.076
with real life employer
expectations.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:44.266
Throughout the experience my
role is to really help students

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:46.096
to say why did you
approach it that way?

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:49.796
What is it that motivated
you to either go after it

00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:53.336
or to really retract from
your enthusiasm for it?

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:56.966
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I want to help
people and I feel like working

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:58.556
with financial regulation

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:01.196
and fraud prevention can help
the whole of the country.

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:03.846
&gt;&gt; Garrett: Doing this
internship is a commitment

00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:06.366
and I'm devoted to doing that.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.906
I've actually been
looking at colleges

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:09.976
in the forestry program.
