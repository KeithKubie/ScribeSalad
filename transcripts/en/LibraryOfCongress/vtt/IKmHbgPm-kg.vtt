&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.720
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: I remember the
first time I encountered a poem

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.260
by Marilyn Hacker in the 1992
volume of "Best American Poetry".

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.310
I was a college junior, newly in
love with poetry and eager to take

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.740
in all its contemporary versions.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.190
And, the annual series
seemed a good place to start.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.230
I was introduced to much
in that year's volume,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.090
guest edited by Charles Simic,
including many free-wheeling,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.180
free-versed poems by
friends, teachers,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.100
and even a few poets laurate I
would meet in the decades to come.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.520
But, the only poem I remember
encountering still was

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240
"Elysian Fields".

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.020
In a rhyming iambic pentameter
that is as strict talking

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.710 position:56%
as it is subtly artful, the poem
portrays any given gentrifying block

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.640
in New York City.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.110
It functions as a kind
of survey of the stories

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.080
and conflicts worth
capturing in a timeless form.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.310
Looking at "Elysian Fields" now, as
someone who has lived in Brooklyn

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.810
for the last 16 years, I'm
reminded of how this poem

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.680 position:56%
and this poet continue to
challenge me to be open to the world

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.340
and its difficult and
implicating truths.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.430
I was happy to see "Elysian Fields"
in Marilyn Hacker's newest book,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.370
"A Stranger's Mirror: New and
Selected Poems, 1994-2014",

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.830
published last year by
W.W. Norton &amp; Company.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.080
And, I'm delighted to have Marilyn
here today to honor her more

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.590
than 40 years of publishing as well

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.070
as the work she's done
in the last two decades.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.480
I'm sure there are
many, many poetry lovers

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.430
with touchtone Marilyn
Hacker poems of their own,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.350 position:56%
and in the next half hour, I
wouldn't be surprised if she, again,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.070
changed my sense of the art.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.510
Please join me in welcoming
Marilyn Hacker.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.730
&gt;&gt; Marilyn Hacker: Thank you so
much, and it's a great pleasure

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.580
to be here and with all of you and
to listen to and to follow some

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.410
of the other writer, marvelous
writers in this festival.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.330
I was at A.B. Spellman's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.240
and Joy Harjo's reading
earlier this morning, and,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.100
and they were wonderful and
this is a wonderful occasion,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.080
and I'm going to make sure one
of these water bottles is open.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.510
It is also f-ing cold in here.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.310
[ Laughter ]

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.320
Well, I coincidence, I had planned
to, I made up the little list

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.310
and the poem that you just
mentioned was on the list.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.110
So, why don't I start there?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:16.070
[ Background Conversation ]

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.430
Elysian Fields, and this is a poem

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.930
about the Upper West
Side of Manhattan.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.420
"Champs Elysees of Broadway" says
the awning of the café where,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.000
every Sunday morning young
lawyers in old jeans ripped

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.160
at the knees do crosswords.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.450
Polyglot Lebanese run it: they've
taken on two more shopfronts

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.940
and runner, run their banner
down all three at once.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.530
Four years ago, their sign "Au
Petit Beurre" was so discrete

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.940 position:56%
that meeting someone there, I'd tell
her the street corner, not the name.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.090
They were in the right
place at the right time.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
Meanwhile, the poor
are trying hard enough.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.210
Outside, on Broadway, people sell
their stuff laid out on blankets,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.040
cardboard cartons, towels.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.720 position:56%
A stout matron with lacquered auburn
curls circles the viridian throw rug

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.040
and painted plaster San
Martin to hug a thinner,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.080
darker woman who hugs her volubly
back in Spanish, a neighbor,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.720
I guess, and guess
they still have houses.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.120
The man with uncut,
browned, French paperbacks,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.350
he mans with two embroidered
gypsy blouses

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.920
and three pilled pitiful pairs
of plaid slacks folded behind him

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.600
on the pavement where there was a
Puerto Rican hardware store that's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.150
been a vacant shopfront
for three years may not.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.140
There's a young couple down
the block from our corner.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.690
She's tall, gaunt, gangly,
black; he's short, quick,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.430
voluble, unshaven, white.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.720
They sit up dry mornings
around eight.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.570
I've seen him slap her
face, jerking her thin arm

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.370
like a rag doll's - a
dollar kept from him.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.180
She moves too slow,
whore, stupid bitch...

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.380
"She's my wife," he tells a
passing man who stops and watches.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.080
If anyone did call the cops,
it would be to prevent them

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.420
and their stacks of old Vogues
and outdated science texts

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.040
from blocking access
to the "upscale bar"

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.680
where college boys
get bellicose on beer.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.970
"Leave him" would I say?

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.190
Does she have keys to
an apartment, to a room,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.350
a door to close behind her?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.120
What we meant by "poor"
when I was 20 was a tenement

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.010
with clanking pipes and roaches,
what we meant was up six flights

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.410
of grimed piss-pungent
stairs, four babies

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.910
and a baby-faced welfare worker
forbidden to say "birth control".

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.350
I was almost her, on the New
York State Employment Services,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.790
at the East 14th Street
Branch, whose job it was

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.290
to send day workers, mostly black,
to clean other people's houses.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.400
Five-fifteen, and I
walked east, south,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.710
walked up my own four flights.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.510
Poor was a neighbor, was next
door, is still a door away.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.940

behind the glass.

"Save the energy for the end."

[ Laughter ]

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.530
This, much more recently, was
written, in part in memory

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.810
of the great American poet Adrienne
Rich, who died a few years ago,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:35.850
and written during, what is going
on now in, in Iraq, in Syria,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.710
in Palestine, in so many places.

In the city my friend
has not written from,

for two weeks there was
almost enough electricity.

I wake up four times in
the night soaked with sweat

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.390
and change my shirt
and go to sleep again.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:23.760
There was almost enough electricity
to heat water, make tea, bathe,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.990
write e-mails and change her
shirt and go to sleep again.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.200

I change the greeting,
change the alphabet.

War like a stupid household
accident changes the optics

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.050
of a scene forever.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.480
I change the greeting,
change the alphabet: Hola,

morning of light, ya compañera.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.630
Change the optics of a
scene forever present,

would change for good tomorrow.

through weeping rubble.

She was our conscience, but she
died too early, after she spoke

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.820
of more than one disaster.

And, this is a more
private, not private.

It's not private at all, but a poem
about something closer to home.

It's about friendship, and
it's called "An Absent Friend".

Perched on a high stool, the
auburn sybil eats Fig Newtons,

elbows on the sink, the
other lively hand exhorting.

Think through these
words to silences.

accumulated on the scarred oak table

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.570
to some felicity of memory.

The black cat hums like a fridge.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.730
The three daughters are
asleep in different rooms.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.930
Through the steamed window

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:59.550
on the garden comes pearl
dawnlight, lovely and unremarkable.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.700
Lovely and unremarkable the
clutter of mugs and books,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:12.800
the almost empty Fig Newtons box,
thick dishes in a big tin tray,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.160
the knife still standing in the
butter, change like the color

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.690
of river water in the
delicate shift to day.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:28.610
Thin fog veils the hedges where
a neighbor dog makes rounds.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.910
"Go to bed.

It doesn't matter about
the washing-up.

Whatever it was we said
that night is gone,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.210
framed like a photograph
nobody took.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.870
Stretched out on a
camp cot with the book,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.320
I think that we will talk
all night again there,

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.780
or another where, but I am wrong.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:04.660
This was written a couple of years
ago at an international festival

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:11.740
in Konya in Turkey which was the
place where Rumi all his life

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.590
and wrote everything that he wrote,
and where, in fact, he's buried.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:22.720 position:56%
And, the, at the, at the conference,
there were people from Turkey,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.250
from the United States, from
Iran, for Pakistan, from Syria.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.830
And, from Germany.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:39.100
And, I wrote some poems, and this
one is in the, in the Hazal form

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:45.600
which we get from Urdu and from
Farsi and which was popularized or,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.910 position:56%
if that's the right word, in English

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.020
by the wonderful Kashmiri
American Poet Agha Shahid Ali

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.780
who also died much,
much, much too soon.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:04.160
And, in the Hazal, the poet, there,
it's a series of, of connect,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.680
of couplets that are often
completely unconnected except

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.990
by a rhyme and a repeated word and
you're supposed to put your name

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:19.200
or perhaps some version of it in
the last, in the very last couplet.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.630
And, this is dedicated to a young
woman from Afghanistan [inaudible]

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.000
who was at that conference

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.280
and to [inaudible] a Pakistani
novelist who's an old friend

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.900
who was there, too.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.580
Outside the door -- and
one, oh one more thing.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.390
[inaudible] who was maybe 25
years old was talking about how

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:47.580
in Afghanistan, when she was a
child, her father and her uncle

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.730 position:56%
and their friends would get together
and recite Hazals all night long,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.220 position:56%
out loud, drinking tea and, drinking
tea, smoking, and reciting poems.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.890
And she, as a child and as a girl
child, wasn't allowed to come in,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.810
but she would sit outside the
door and listen to everything

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.560
that they were, the poems they
were reciting out loud and try

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.120
to memorize as much as she could.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.820
So, that was the start of this.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.840
Laughter, music, voices singing
verses can be heard outside

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.350
the door.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:25.210
The little girl is memorizing
every word outside the door.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.000
Light in the stairwell,
seen through the judas-hole:

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.730
is that the visitor you longed for
or you feared outside the door?

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:43.340
Long hours in lamplight practicing
his scales, in counterpoint

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.170
to solfège of a bird
outside the door.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:53.530
The diplomat entering the
leader's office forgets the Copt,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:58.630
the communist, the
Kurd outside the door.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.650
Praise for the leader,
loyalty till death!

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.810
Another imprecation is
whispered outside the door.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:14.650
The first love left, the
second packs her bags.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:21.410
Are those the nervous footsteps
of the third outside the door?

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.480
Self is a mirror, poster-color
bright,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:31.250
but notice how the colors
become blurred outside the door.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.480
The revolutionaries'
nameless laundress wonders

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.070
"What happens to a dream deferred?"

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.960
outside the door.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.760
At this next poem, much
New York in it, too,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:56.150
is an elegy for my good
friend who died much too soon,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.970
the wonderful poet and writer
and teacher June Jordan.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.670
And, it's called "Elegy for
a Soldier", and those of you

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.660
who know June's work, know
that she wrote an auto --

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.670
a memoir, an autobiography called,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.680
"Soldier" because that was what
her dad who was a very strict man

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.860
from Jamaica who really wanted
her to succeed in the world.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.160
He called her Little Soldier.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.300
One. The city where
I knew you was swift.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:32.770
A lover cabbed to Brooklyn (broke,
but so what) after the night shift

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.070
in a Second Avenue diner.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:41.050
The lover was a Quaker, a
poet, an anti-war activist.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.130
Was blonde, as twenty-four.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.190
Wet snow fell on the access
road to the Manhattan Bridge.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.730
I was neither lover, slept uptown.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.820
But the arteries, streetlights,
headlines, phonelines,

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:04.540
feminine plural links ran silver
through the night city as dawn

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.090
and the yellow cab passed
on the frost-blurred bridge,

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:14.090
headed for that day's
last or first coffee.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:21.220
The city where I knew you was
rich in bookshops, potlucks,

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.390
ad hoc debates, demos,
parades and picnics.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.710
There were walks I liked to take.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.720 position:56%
I was on good terms with two rivers.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.180
You turned, burned, flame-wheel
of words lighting the page,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.510 position:56%
good neighbor on your homely street
in Park Slope, whose Russian zaydes,

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:48.570
Jamaican grocers, dyke
vegetarians, young gifted everyone,

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.290
claimed some changes -at
least a new food co-op.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:59.270
In the laundromat, ordinary
women talked revolution.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.630
We knew we wouldn't live forever
but it seemed as if we could.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:10.710
The city where I knew
you was yours and mine

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:15.240
by birthright: Harlem, the Bronx.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:21.050
Separately we left it
and came separately back.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.750
There's no afterlife for dialogue,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:30.780
divergences we never teased
apart to weave back together.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.900
Death slams down in the midst of
all your unfinished conversations.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.190
Whom do I address when I
address you, larger than life

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.940
as you always were, not alive now?

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.340
Words are not you,
poems are not you,

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.450
ashes on the Pacific
tide, you least of all.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.070
I talk to my- self to
keep the line open.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:05.370
The city where I knew you is gone.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:12.150 position:56%
Pink icing roses spelled out PASSION
on a book-shaped chocolate cake.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:19.060
The bookshop's a sushi bar now,
and PASSION is long out of print.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:25.000
Would you know the changed street
that cab swerved down toward you

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.290
through cold, white mist?

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.670
We have a Republican mayor.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:37.230
Threats keep citizens in line:
anthrax; suicide attacks.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:46.710
A scar festers where towers once
were; dissent festers unexpressed.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.140
You are dead of a woman's disease.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.670
Who gets to choose what
battle takes her down?

00:20:54.670 --> 00:21:01.360
Down to the ocean, friends mourn
you, with no time to mourn.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.160
And the second part.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.150 position:56%
You, who stood alone in the tall
bay window of a Brooklyn brownstone,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.060
conjuring morning with
free-flying words, knew the power,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.330
terror in words, in
flying; knew the high

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:24.430
of solitude while the early light
prowled Seventh Avenue, lupine,

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:29.500
hungry like you, your
spoils raisins and almonds,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.390
ballpoint pen, yellow foolscap.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.350
You, who stood alone in
your courage, never hesitant

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.880
to underline the connections
(between rape,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.810
exclusion and occupation...)

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:50.600
and separations were
alone and were not alone

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.550
when morning blotted the
last spark of you out,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.680
around you voices you
no longer had voice

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.440
to answer, eyes you were blind to.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.240
All your loves were
singular: you scorned labels.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.720
Claimed black; woman, and
for the rest eluded limits,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.290
quicksilver (Caribbean),
staked out self-definition.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:26.290
You, at once an optimist, a
Cassandra, Lilith in the wilderness

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:33.390 position:56%
of her lyric, were a black American,
born in Harlem, citizen soldier.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:39.960
If you had to die-and I don't admit
it- who dared, what time, "What if,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.310
each time they kill a
black man / we kill a cop?"

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.880
couldn't you take down with
you a few prime villains

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.960 position:56%
in the capitol, who are also mortal?

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.140
June, you should be living,
the states are bleeding.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.580
Leaden words like "Homeland"
translate abandoned

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.590
dissident discourse.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:07.570
Twenty years ago, you denounced the
war crimes still in progress now,

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:13.610
as Jenin, Rammallah dominate,
then disappear from the headlines.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.360
Palestine: your war.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.390
"To each nation, its
Jews," wrote Primo Levi.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.310 position:56%
"Palestinians are Jews to Israelis."

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:32.740
Afterwards, he died in despair,
or so we infer, despairing.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:39.890
Top each nation its Jews,
its blacks, its Arabs,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.700 position:56%
Palestinians, immigrants, its women.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:50.680 position:56%
From each nation, its poets: Mahmoud
Darwish, Kavanaugh, Shahid (who,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.560
beloved witness for
silenced Kashmir, cautioned,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.120
shift the accent, and he was
"martyr"), Audre Lorde, Neruda,

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.920
Amichai, Senghor, and
you, June Jordan.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.960
How am I doing?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.120
And, thank you, signers.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.510
You are amazing.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:25.730
[ Applause ]

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:31.830
And, well, since that
poem ended with Palestine,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:37.380
these are two monologues in the
voices which I, I don't know if,

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.830
sort of, daring to take
on the voices of people

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.150
who were actually alive
and had their own voices.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:51.310
Of, two poets, two women, one who
was Palestinian, Fadwa Tuquan,

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:56.000
and one who was Israeli, Dahlia
Ravikovitch who were friends

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.950
and allies and often argued.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:05.060
And, so one of these, the
first poem is in Fadwa,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.640
is in Fadwa Tuquan's voice,
and the second in something

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.780
like Dahlia Ravikovitch's voice.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:18.460
And, the poem, the first one called
"The Education of the Poet" talks

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.550
about something that
happened to Fadwa Tuquan

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.550
when she was a child
and taken out of school.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:31.350 position:56%
And, because of ridiculous
incident, and the second one is more

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.740
about the relationship
between the two.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.650
So, "Fadwa: The Education
of the Poet".

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.290
When I was made a prisoner
in my father's house,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.720
my mother turned away,
swallowing her words.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:53.980
The potholed path to school
became a vision of my lost future.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.210
It was not even because
of a letter- a boy

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.260
from the boys' school entrusted
a flower, an almond sprig,

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.750
for me, to my little brother.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.660
That was intercepted
by our middle brother.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.590
I was twelve.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.760
I was no longer to leave the house.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.360
If that twig in blossom
sullied an imagined flower,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.340
the metaphor wasn't mine.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.660
I had no words for my
ignorance, or innocence.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.420
I copied letter after wobbly
letter on my school slate.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.980
My vision was astigmatic, strained.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:38.150
Was their double vision god's eyes?

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:44.060 position:56%
Six months later, my eldest
brother came back, his studies done.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.410
Doctor of Letters.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.410
He shelved his books in
the attic room of the house

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.420
that became a hive, crawling
and buzzing with words

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.580
and dripping the honey of
words on a carpet of flowers.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:07.430
My days were dust and water, starch
and flour, chores, silence, shame.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.520 position:56%
I could not envision the schoolchild
I'd been, or what I would be.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.340
Words receded, I spoke so little.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.540
I brought my brother his
coffee and shaving water.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.950
The rest of the house
was dawn-silent.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:28.570
He was writing a letter - no,
something else, carefully,

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.620
hearing each letter that rounded
or plunged like the bud or the root

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.530
of a flower, and the vowels'
perfume pervaded the house

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:43.490
as he weighted the choices
that shaped his revision.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.780
"Do you still care about poetry?"

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.670
asked my brother, and
began to recite,

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.600
a mellifluous ladder of words.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.330
"Take this book.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.050
Copy this poem.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.940
Make a list of the
words you don't know.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.420
Mark the small vowel
for each letter.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.050
Learn it, and recite it
to me," said my brother.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:14.170
"We are dust and ash, and
beauty is brief as a flower.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:22.250 position:56%
But a stanza's a room; a single line
is the house you - you - can build,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.150
throw open the doors
to your vision."

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.490
I live in my own house now.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.570
In my line of vision,
an almond tree flowers.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:40.200
I live by words, and on each page
I write a letter to my brothers.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:46.680
And "Dahlia and Fadwa",
different voice.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.220
When I see her come through
the orchard toward my house,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.740
I begin composing answers
to the words

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:58.100
with which she'll challenge me,
her vision precise and focused,

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.480
as if every letter
were drawn beforehand.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.800
She stops, stoops toward
a flower she doesn't pick,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.690
and the word I'm left is "sister".

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.600 position:56%
As if she were coming to visit a
younger sister after a long absence,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.720
as if this stranger's house were

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.540
where she'd watched my awkward
gestures flower to eloquence,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.750
as if I had measured her words

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.150
from a wider world each
time a letter arrived,

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.300
message inhabited by a vision.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.420
But I was the only
messenger of my vision.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.140
My father died.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.530
There was no brother or
sister but the orphan's clan

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.700
of branching letters
I taught myself.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.580
I moved from house to house with
a dented trunk, a few books,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.980
many words, an acid fruit
proceeding its own flower.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:03.670
Am I named for a traitor
or for a flower?

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.850
Blood and fire have cindered
and stained my vision;

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:13.340
I curse their politics;
they praise my words.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.730
What answer can I give my older
sister when I open the door,

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.990
welcome her into my house,

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:26.550
and she hands me the incriminating
letter while I imagine opening a

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.500
letter after scouring the sink,
dusting a loaf with flour,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.260
that tells me my house
no longer is my house.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:42.650
Beyond the window and my field of
vision my son is shouting something

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:47.570
to his sister-and it's hard, all
at once, to make out their words.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:53.420
But in my yellow kitchen there
are only words I can't pronounce

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.890
correctly, in the letters
of my sister's language,

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.540
language that is sister to mine.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:06.850
I watched her flame and flower as
boys threw stones- spliced shots

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:12.230
on television, and felt the
leaning walls of my bright house.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:20.010 position:56%
In that threatened house, at a loss
for words my letter would be subject

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:26.210
to revision, flow or gutter,
never reach my sister.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:33.470
And, I think I can
read two more poems.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:39.200
[inaudible] This is a,
another poem in another voice.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.910
There is a, yet another,
another form that we get

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.910
from another language, the
Glosa which comes from Spain.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:53.390
Sixteenth, 17th century in which a
poet takes four line, four lines,

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:57.400
a quatrain or four consecutive
lines from a poem by somebody else

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.840
and then composes a poem of
force to stanzas each one

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.760
of which ends with
one of those lines.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:10.320
And, in this case, the
four lines are from a poem

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.400
by Anna Akhmatova called
"Willow", and the speaker

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.060
of the poem is someone
like Akhmatova who,

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.930
during the Stalinist realm was
forbidden to publish her work.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:28.570
And, would write poems which she
would, then, recite and learn

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:37.090 position:56%
by heart with a friend, very often a
young widow named Lydia Chukovskaya,

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.090
and then they burned
the poems in the ashtray

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:45.520
and just have them in their minds.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.040
So, the four lines form
Akhmatova in a translation

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.870
by Judith Hemschemeyer are "And
I grew up in pattern tranquility

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.880
in the cool nursery
of the new century.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.030
And the voice of man
was not dear to me,

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.120
but the voice of the
wind I could understand."

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:11.180
A sibilant wind presaged
a latish spring.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.130
Bare birches leaned and
whispered over the gravel path.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.180
Only the river ever left.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.150
Still, someone would bring
back a new sailor middy to wear

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.600 position:56%
in the photograph of the four of us.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.120
Sit still, stop fidgeting.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.460
-Like the still-leafless trees with
their facility for lyric prologue

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.340
and its gossipy aftermath.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.370
I liked to make up stories.

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.770
I liked to sing: I was encouraged
to cultivate that ability.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.400
And I grew up in patterned
tranquility.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:52.060
In the single room, with
a greasy stain like a scar

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.400
from the gas-fire's fumes, when any
guest might be a threat (and any

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.410
threat was a guest-from the
past or the future) at any hour

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.500
of the night, I would
put the tea things

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:09.760
out though there were scrap-leaves
of tea, but no sugar, or a lump

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.750
or two of sugar but no tea.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:19.020
Two matches, a hoarded
cigarette: my day's page ashed

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.160
on its bier in a bed-sitter.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.880
No godmother had presaged
such white nights to me

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.010
in the cool nursery
of the young century.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.940
The human voice distorted
itself in speeches,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.870
a rhetoric that locked
locks and ticked off losses.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.100
Our words were bare as that stand

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.940
of winter birches while poetasters
sugared the party bosses' edicts

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.610 position:56%
(the only sugar they could purchase)
with servile metaphor and simile.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:35:01.320
The effects were mortal,
however complex the causes.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.680
When they beat their child beyond
this thin wall, his screeches,

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.510
wails and pleas were the
gibberish of history,

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:15.460
and the voice of man
was not dear to me.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.920
Men and women, I mean.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.530
Those high-pitched voices-
how I wanted them to shut up.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.950
They sound too much like me.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:30.280
Little machines for evading
choices, little animals,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.760
selling their minds for touch.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.000
The young widow's voice
is just hers,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.540
as she memorizes the words we
read and burn, nights when we read

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.490
and burn with the words unsaid,
hers and mine, as we watch

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:52.570
and are watched, and the
river reflects what spies.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:57.770
Is the winter trees' rustling
a code to the winter land?

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.670
But the voice of the
wind I could understand.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:09.190
And, this last poem does a kind
of bookend to the very first one,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:17.600
is dedicated to Fadwa Suleiman
who is a Syrian writer and actor

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.680
who was very active with the
Syrian, in the Syrian revolution

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:29.050
when it was a peaceful uprising
folk for a change in government

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:34.640
and didn't opening out and
democracy, free speech,

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:42.200
and she left her career and cut
off all of her hair and went to

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.540
and gave talks to the
young revolutionaries

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.150
in the city, in the city of Homs.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:55.020 position:56%
And, not too soon afterwards, it was
not safe for her to stay in Syria.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.440
She's now a political exile
living in France and in Paris

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.370
which is where I met her.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:06.680
And, this comes from a
real, again, real incident.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.400
Fadwa and I were walking across,
walking across the Pont ser le

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.630
and down the street talking
in my terrible Arabic

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.800
and her improving French.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:25.100
And, we saw a man whom I had once,
a Syrian person whom she'd seen

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.550
and I had last seen
at a political meeting

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:32.060
and whom she had last seen also
speaking to the crowds in Homs.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.080
And, he, too, now in exile.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.080
So, that's what's behind this.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.230
Said the old woman who
barely spoke the language:

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:46.900
Freedom is a dream, and
we don't know whose.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:51.880
Said the insurgent
who was now an exile:

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.250
When I began to write the
story I started bleeding.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:01.280
Freedom is a dream, and
we don't know whose-

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.360
that man I last saw speaking
in front of the clock tower

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.700
when I began to write the story?

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:14.790
I started bleeding five years after
I knew I'd have no more children.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:19.470
That man I last saw
speaking in front

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:25.110
of the clock tower turned an
anonymous corner and disappeared.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:31.430
Five years after I knew I'd have
no more children my oldest son was

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:37.000
called up for the army, turned an
anonymous corner and disappeared.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:44.890 position:56%
My nephew, my best friend, my second
sister whose oldest son was called

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.870
up for the army, are looking
for work now in other countries.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:57.260
Her nephew, his best friend,
his younger sister, a doctor,

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.040
an actress, an engineer,
are looking for work now

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:06.460
in other countries stumbling,
disillusioned, in a new language.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.960
A doctor, an actress, an engineer
wrestle with the rudiments

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.500
of grammar disillusioned,
stumbling in a new language,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:23.010
hating their luck, and
knowing they are lucky.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.090
Wrestling with the rudiments
of grammar, the old woman,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.830
who barely speaks the
language, hated her luck.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:36.370
I know that I am lucky said the
insurgent who is now an exile.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.170
Thank you.
