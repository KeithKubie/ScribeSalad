PRESENTER: Please join me in
welcoming Scott Sigler.

00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:05.277
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:07.170
INTERVIEWER: Thanks,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.470
So welcome to Google, Scott.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.900
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.700
wanted to invite you here
for two reasons.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.380
One, I'm a really big fan and I
just wanted to sit down and

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.920
talk with you.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.810
And two, Google is
an innovation

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.090
and technology company.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.340
And I think maybe not in your
past career, but definitely

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.260
when it comes to writing and
publishing, you've definitely

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.060
been innovative and done some
different things in the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.740
writing world.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.550
So for all those that don't
know, can you share really how

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.880
you got started and how your
career kind of kicked off?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.550
SCOTT SIGLER: Well, I pretty
much knew I wanted to do, I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.290
think, since the third or fourth
grade, that I wanted to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.610
be a novelist.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.130
That's what I wanted
to do for a living.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.360
After reading a Stephen
King book.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.570
I read "Silver Bullet," by
Stephen King, and I was like,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.810
this is great.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.160
I want to do this.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.660
And movies were also an
influence on that.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.840
But so went to college
for journalism.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.220
Figured I would just get a lot
of repetition writing.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.720
So I tried to find a job
I could do which was--

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.780
unfortunately, it was easy.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.780
I was very lazy.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.720
Like if there's an essay,
I got that part nailed.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600
So I'll just go into something
that's all writing, and then I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.670
don't actually have to
work for a living.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.770
It didn't turn out
quite that way.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.210
Was in newspapers for a few
years, then got into a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.440
software company that did
publishing for newspapers.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
And from that point, I was fully
committed to getting an

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.460
agent, getting a publisher,
and becoming an author.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.870
And that took about 10 years.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.060
I finally got a deal with
AOL-Time Warner, who had a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.540
very early version of Reddit,
but for publishing, where you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.790
would upload three chapters of
your book, and other people

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.780
would vote on it.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.380
And it was called iPublish.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.760
And then the editors only
reviewed the top 5% of

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.400
vote-getters.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960
So it was a great way for them
to deal with the slush pile.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.030
Got a deal with them.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.775
Had a book called "Earthcore"
that was supposed to be out in

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:03.900
every store in May 2002.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.900
Then 9/11 recession--

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.320
they shut down the imprint,
and I had no print deal

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.310
whatsoever.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.789
So I was sitting

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.880
On a professionally
edited book.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.190
And from 2000 to 2005, couldn't
get any interest

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.620
going for it again.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470
And then learned about
podcasting.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.800
And for podcasting, I'm like,
oh, this is great.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.680
Serialized content.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.730
I'm going to go find some
audiobooks to listen to.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.630
Because I just assumed people
were putting out audiobooks

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.350
that way, like the radio dramas
of the '40s and '50s.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.280
And when I couldn't
find any, it took

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.630
me two days of googling.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.090
I just was convinced that I
was doing something wrong.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.810
I'm like, what am words am I
not putting together here?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.070
And then the light bulb
went off that nobody

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.560
had done that yet.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.420
And having a marketing
background, if I can learn to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.390
podcast a novel, I can spin a
big deal about this, even

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.450
though I don't actually have
a publishing deal.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.520
And then put "Earthcore" as a
free, unabridged, serialized

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.250
podcast novel, and put out a
few press releases, and was

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.160
able to get rolling
from there.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.740
And then started to build a fan
base, and after that, have

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.620
just been giving away
books ever since.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.600
That was March 2005, and
I've been doing it

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.330
every Sunday since.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.660
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.730
And so your fan base grew
pretty quickly, correct?

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.210
Once you start releasing
those podcasts?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.860
And talk about the first kind
of, all these publishers

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.740
wouldn't sign you.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.800
You thought you had a great
book, great content.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.180
When did your first book get
printed, even though you did

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.260
the podcast?

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.670
AUDIENCE: Well I was totally
convinced that I was going to

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.990
get to 10,000 subscribers and
then be able to show that to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.410
publishers, and they would be
hitting me in the face with

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.110
rolls of 20s.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.490
Just like, sign with us,
man, sign with us.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.970
So I was like, it was heads
down, let's just get to 10,000

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.440
subscribers.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.510
And I did that and I showed it
to my agent, who was already

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.020
super angry that I was giving
away the audiobook for free.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.710
He's like, that's going
to mess up everything.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.500
What are you doing?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.910
We're going to lose
the audio rights.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.180
And went ahead with
that anyways.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.000
And then when I got 10,000
subscribers, tried to show

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.370
that to the agent, and show
that to publishers.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.660
And they were like,
what is this?

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.900
We don't even know
what this is.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.630
Well, it's a podcast.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.210
What is that?

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.529
Like, well, it's this thing
on the internet.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.589
They're like, we're not so
sure about the internet.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.430
We don't know about this.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.810
It's dangerous.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.670
And so I was stumped.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.300
And then the subscriber
base kept growing.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.865
And then worked with a small
Canadian imprint called Dragon

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:31.260
Moon Press, and we put
out "Earthcore" in

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.870
print and trade paperback.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.840
Learned a lot about that, and
then I ramped up and I kind of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.820
looked at Amazon, and realized,
oh, if I can get my

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.360
10,000 fans to all go buy the
book on the same day, then all

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.650
of a sudden, I'll be
at the top of the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.820
Amazon ranks, maybe.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.920
I wasn't sure.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.440
So we put out one called
"Ancestor." And "Ancestor,"

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.840
did a big grassroots
campaign for it.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.770
Lot of free PDFs, lot
of free stuff.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.000
And then when it came out,
within a couple hours, it was

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.480
the number one book in horror,
number one book

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.320
in sci-fi in Amazon.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.760
It was the number two fiction
book overall on Amazon behind

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.910
one of the "Harry
Potter" books.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.100
So which was awesome.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.560
So all of a sudden, I'm at the
top of the Amazon charts.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.086
And at that point, Amazon wasn't
reporting to "The New

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.920
York Times." There's
no idea if we sold

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.720
enough to chart there.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.430
But I had a new agent, and
he had put a book called

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.240
"Infected" on many new desks
in New York, and there are

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.960
about 20 people who were
moderately interested in it.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.910
Then they saw that this guy had
come out of nowhere and

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.160
topped the charts on Amazon.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.160
And this is pre-ebook.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.530
So there were no ebooks
on Amazon.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.140
This is straight up, $14.95 to
get the trade paperback from

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.080
an author that nobody's
ever heard of.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.440
And then because they liked
"Infected" and saw--

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.180
they didn't know what I had
done, but they just knew I was

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.690
topping all of their books.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.820
And then "Infected" went into
auction and wound up with

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.875
Crown, wound up with a five-book
deal with Crown.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.270
Been rolling ever since.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.170
INTERVIEWER: Nice, nice.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.000
So when that all started,
there was

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.750
really no ebook industry.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.890
How has that changed your
thoughts on publishing and

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.040
getting your books
out to market?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.800
Because there's a lot of people
out there now that are

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.420
self-publishing and getting
millions and

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.390
millions of book sales.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.360
SCOTT SIGLER: Yeah, and there's
the upper crust.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.230
There's people who are
selling 500,000, a

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.820
million books a year.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.820
And the Hugh Howeys and
the Amanda Hockings--

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.860
you've heard of them, but then
there's a lot of people that

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.360
are selling 5,000, 10,000,
15,000 copies a year and are

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
really happy with the amount
of sales that they have.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.620
And that's all been fascinating
to watch.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.250
And also, it's been fascinating
to kind of be

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.270
locked out of that.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.360
Because when I signed with
Crown, they let me do a young

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.320
adult series called "Galactik
Football" series.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.320
But watching people put out
sci-fi thrillers and various

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.890
styles of books that I do, and
rack up these incredible sales

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.620
on Amazon at $5 a pop,
collecting 70% of every sale,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.510
just doing wonderful.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.310
And I can't do any of that,
because now I've got a

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.920
no-compete clause in
the contract I

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.050
signed back in 2007.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.040
So from my perspective, it's
been a little frustrating to

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.490
watch other people
play the game.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.630
Play the number system.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.200
Put out a really good product,
figure out how to get it in

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.880
front of people, and then let
Amazon's "if you like this,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.810
you'll like this" go to work.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.930
And if you can sell a certain
number of copies and Amazon

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.130
starts to do your marketing for
you, that's where those

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.780
big sales come from.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.850
The Amanda Hockings and the Hugh
Howeys didn't do anything

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.620
themselves to sell that million,
but they got to a

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.500
threshold, and Amazon's
system kicks in.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.890
Then it's a great book, and
then all of a sudden,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.160
Katy bar the door.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.250
So we haven't been
able to do that.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.060
We have been able to put out
our independent "Galactik

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.760
Football League" novels as
ebooks, and those have done

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.950
really well for us.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.930
But we've also already saturated
our audience,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.090
because we put them
out as limited

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.920
edition hardcovers first.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.510
Then we put them out as ebooks,
put them out as

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.840
paperbacks.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.300
We're just now getting into some
ebook-only novellas from

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.630
that series.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.830
And our mission right now in our
company is, we want to get

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.230
10 to 15 really good products
out there, and then

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.180
start to market it.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.460
Because we don't know a whole
lot about ebooks, other than

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.950
that more is more.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.450
And people with five, six,
seven books tend to sell

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.670
higher numbers than those
individual books.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.730
Because there's some kind of
customer perception-- it you

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.550
come in and you just see one
book, you're like, ah, she's

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.742
probably not very good.

00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:24.270
She's only got one book.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.130
Somebody you've never
heard of.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.660
If you come in and she's got
seven, you're like, whoa, man,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.630
she must be solid.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.290
She's got seven books.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.370
And the audience still hasn't
quite got the concept that

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.400
yeah, she's got seven books
because she put seven books up

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.200
all by herself.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.880
It doesn't necessarily have any
reflection on quality, but

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.539
it's still there.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.270
If you see that row of books,
those tend to sell better.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.480
So we're trying to get enough
books up there so it looks

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.070
impressive when we
do our marketing.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.640
Hopefully that'll help.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.780
INTERVIEWER: I think that's how
I discovered you, is kind

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.590
of through that Amazon
marketing machine.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.890
I read "Old Man's War." And
right after "Old Man's War,"

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.700
it said, if you liked this,
you might like this book

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.230
called "Infected." And I went
on there, and there were, I

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.290
think there were like 100
reviews at the time, and was

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.580
all four or five stars.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.750
So it was like, I'll
give it a try.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.520
And ever since, I've been
reading your books.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.980
So yeah.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.390
What I'm interested in is you
started your own publishing

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.350
company, but you had
a book deal.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.120
So how did you work that out?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.880
And then also, does your
publisher have any problem

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.375
with you continuing to release
the audiobooks for free?

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.190
SCOTT SIGLER: Well, we recently
ran into the problem

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.130
with releasing the audiobooks
for free, so I'll

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.180
answer that one first.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.890
So when your novel goes into a
bidding war, that's a crazy

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.030
experience for somebody who's
coming to work at 2:00 in the

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.950
morning so he can abuse
the printer and the

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.890
copier to send out--

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.590
I'm going to print out 300 pages
of this and send this

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.490
out, and here's 20 more
submissions to go out.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.720
So just totally commando
style, trying to get

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.290
the book out there.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.160
Then all of a sudden, people
are bidding on your book.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.460
And my only instruction to the
agent was, like, I have no

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.050
idea what's going on with
any of this, so you

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.730
take care of this.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.290
But I get to keep giving away
my audiobooks for free.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.110
Because these are the people who
got me here, so these are

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.420
the people I'm going to
continue to cater to.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.540
And that was my only
qualification.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.890
And if a publisher didn't want
to allow me to give away free

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.970
audiobooks, free serialized
audiobooks, then, like, don't

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.970
bid, because I won't sign your
contract, no matter what

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.120
you're offering.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.660
And Crown was good to go.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.760
There were three main publishers
that were in it at

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.570
the end, and Crown was like,
absolutely, whatever you did

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.660
you get this audience,
keep this audience.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.620
So that was great.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.220
Then I signed with Crown, Steve
Ross at Crown, and two

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.360
weeks later, he had moved on to
another publishing house.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.070
And when a new boss comes
in, everything changes.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.130
But they let me do it for the
first three books, for

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.830
"Infected," "Contagious," and
"Ancestor." And then we put

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:54.960
out "Nocturnal" in May of last
year, and they just flat-out

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.900
didn't put out the
audiobook at all.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.650
And we could not figure out what
was going-- and now we

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.400
know, because they are
subletting the books to

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.230
Recorded Books, and Recorded
Books is like, we're not going

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.330
to put out a book if he's
giving it away for free.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.590
So now all of a sudden, the one
contractual stipulation I

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.940
had has run into some red
tape with the publisher.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.740
So we're trying to figure out
how to get that audiobook out.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:19.180
And if you look at it,
everybody's side in the

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.900
argument makes perfect sense.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.070
It's just, we want to put out
the audiobook for free.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.390
That's not in their best
interest, so they're opting

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.010
out of that.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.110
So we're trying to get the
audiobook rights ourselves and

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.210
put that out.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.820
So that part has gotten
a little bit dicey.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.370
As far as putting out our
own books, I had--

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.870
I'm the son of a football coach
and from a football

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.860
family, and huge sci-fi nerd, so
I kind of combined the two

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.740
for this "Galactik Football
League" series, which is a

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.240
young adult series.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.380
It's an American pro football
league 700 years in the

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.440
future, with aliens playing
different positions based on

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.110
physiology.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.910
So you've got receivers and
defensive backs who can jump

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.680
20 feet in the air, and
1,200-pound linemen, and

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.770
linebackers that literally
want to eat you,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.590
that kind of thing.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.980
It's really fun.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:07.160
And the whole series is
actually, it's a metaphor for

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.330
the racial unifying power of
sports, and how in sports, no

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.810
matter what your prejudices are,
it becomes a meritocracy

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:16.840
immediately.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.810
I don't like that guy's
religion, but he's really

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.510
going at running the ball, so
I'll just let that slide.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.520
And I had this book, "The
Rookie," and offered it to

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.330
Crown when they signed me.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.150
I'm like, I got this.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.200
This is going to be--

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.160
I'm like, this is going to be
the biggest thing ever.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.850
It's going to be like "Harry
Potter" for jocks.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.490
You guys gotta sign this.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.720
And they just sort
of opted out.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.660
So I had this perfectly
good book.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.270
I'm like, do you guys mind
if I put this out myself.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.730
And they're like, well, as long
as it's not in stores,

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.010
it's not a problem.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.680
And you could tell it
was one of those

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.950
things, like, how nice.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.360
He wants to put out
his little book.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.610
You go right ahead and put
out your little book.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.820
And I was like, awesome,
thank you.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.790
INTERVIEWER: That's
cute, yeah.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.070
SCOTT SIGLER: They're like,
oh, that's cute.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.370
And they thought, once I had
"Infected" out, that I would

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.880
stop doing that and
stop giving the

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.550
podcasts away for free.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.190
So they totally honored their
word, but when they said,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.390
sure, they were like, ah,
give him two weeks.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:06.980
He'll be fine.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.260
Don't worry.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.780
After he's done with a book
tour, he won't want to do

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.320
these things anymore.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.870
But we had another idea with the
existing fan base, because

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.640
we give stuff away.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.750
We give 30 to 45 minutes of
content away, free, at least

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.310
once a week.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.890
Usually twice, sometimes even
three times a week, just

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.290
constantly keep free stuff
coming down the feed.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.276
We got this idea.

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:28.800
We're like, what if we asked
them to pay $35 for it 10

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.140
months ahead of time?

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.630
And we get all the money in,
and then we'll have all the

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.020
cash flow to put out
a hardcover book.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.530
And we did that, and we sold
3,000 copies of that book, and

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.080
had all the money in to make a
really tricked-out hardcover.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.310
And then when September comes
at the start of football

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.790
season, we send that book out.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.650
So we've done that four times
with the four books in the

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.310
series and it's been very
successful for us.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.270
And we've since then, since
we're selling out of the

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.180
hardcovers--

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.380
two of the four titles
are just sold out.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.180
We'll never reprint the
hardcovers again.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.270
Now we're putting them out in
paperback, putting them out in

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.240
ebook, and we also put out
the audiobooks for them.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.680
So we've got the four novels,
three novellas.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.270
We're actually to the point,
now, we're starting to bring

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.210
in voice talent other than
myself to record the books.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.645
Because I'm finding
out I'm not as--

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:14.900
INTERVIEWER: So talk about
that a little bit.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.670
Because you record all these
books on your own.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.450
But I feel like they're very
professionally well done.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.580
Did it start out that way?

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.970
Or have you just grown
into this audiobook

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.230
recorder over the years?

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.910
SCOTT SIGLER: Kind
of grown into it.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.340
We put out the first book,
"Earthcore," and I worked for

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.090
a company in San Francisco, SNP
Communications, that did

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.730
kind of talk radio programs
for Fortune 500 companies.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.750
So the CEO would sit down, like
Scott McNealy would sit

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.630
down, and then you'd interview
a couple sales guys, a couple

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.320
distributors.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.110
They did an amazing job of

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.060
communicating to a larger company.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.460
But they had all this recording
gear in there.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.700
So they had a full-on
recording studio.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.340
So when I find out about
podcasting for "Earthcore,"

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.600
I'm like, I gotta learn
how to record.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.940
I gotta learn, what
is this RSS?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.680
I have to figure out how
these things work.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.740
I need a website.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.735
But would go in at 2 o'clock in
the morning and record four

00:15:05.735 --> 00:15:07.400
or five chapters.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.950
And I had no idea what I was
doing, so it kind of adopted

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.990
this crazy midnight-DJ persona
to introduce all the episodes,

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.480
which maintains to this day.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.560
But then to make my
buddies laugh--

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.130
we grew up in a really small
town in Michigan, and there

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.930
was literally nothing
to do but play D&amp;D

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.540
and go to the movies.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.480
So we would play D&amp;D every
weekend, and then we would go

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.520
to the same movie four and
five times a week.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.110
And we would just do imitations
of all the

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.860
characters in the movies.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.830
So we all had our Eddie
Murphy, we all

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.120
had our Richard Pryor.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.920
We and "Saturday Night
Live," we were all

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.310
mimicking every character.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.480
And we just would
bounce these.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.790
So I was able to come in for
"Earthcore" without any acting

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.800
experience, but I knew how
to do funny voices.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.260
So I just gave every character
its own individual voice, and

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.800
then that has become
a strong suit.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.950
That I've gotten pretty good at
over the past seven years.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.920
So now that's what the audience
has come to expect.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.720
And then because I started out
in an actual recording studio,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.410
when I got booted and
they caught me--

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.210
the boss came in at 2:00
in the morning to work.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.700
She's like, what are
you doing here?

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.580
Ah, OK, I'm busted.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.250
So I got about a 600-square-foot
apartment in

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.720
San Francisco with a very small
closet, and that became

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.280
the recording studio.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.350
So I moved a Flower Power iMac
in there, put in a little

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.710
desk, and had the clothes
all around, and would

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.350
record in my closet.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.690
So that was the next two
years of the process.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.990
And then became obsessed--

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.570
when I heard the quality
difference in

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.300
sound, it drove me crazy.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.150
Drove me crazy.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.790
So I started buying gear and
learning how to record, to try

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.460
and get it to sound really
professional.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.690
And then we got an actual
audio booth

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:47.850
that went in the closet.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.630
So sneak in the closet,
have to shimmy--

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.000
I would have other people
come over, and they

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.590
were 200-pound guys.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.590
They could not get in.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.290
They could not, just
really had to

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.520
wedge your way in there.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.930
And became obsessed with
making it high-quality.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.940
And now that I actually listen
to other people's audiobooks,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.599
we're really, really
proud of that.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:09.680
Because most audiobooks you'll
get off of Audible or iTunes,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.190
we blow them out of the water.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.290
Our stuff sounds really,
really good.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.910
And our mission has always been,
even before we started

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.530
selling the condensed
audiobooks, if I'm going to

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.220
take 30 minutes of somebody's
time that they'll never get

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.720
back, we're going to make sure
that there is not one

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.060
better-quality thing
out there.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.860
We will have the best quality
audio, period.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.510
So now the system's
really dialed in.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.100
And it's nice, because we
just go in and record.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.110
And we do the podcasts, put them
all together, and then

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.130
sell that as a downloadable
audiobook.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.490
And that's one of the things,
we're very happy to hear from

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.370
people, like, this
sounds fantastic.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.340
So quality audio is a
big priority for us.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.260
INTERVIEWER: Definitely.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.330
So it seems like lot of what
you do is for the fans, and

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.210
you want to make sure they're
getting the most out of the

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.000
experience, whether it's
listening to your book or

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.020
reading it.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.630
What's more important to you?

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.870
That fan loyalty and retention,

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.710
or the writing awards?

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.670
What are you looking
to achieve over the

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.590
next couple of years?

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.970
SCOTT SIGLER: Our job is
to make the fans happy.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.860
That's what our job is.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.340
We've got what we feel are some
important messages and

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.140
themes in the book, and if
people get something out of

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:19.850
it, that's great.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.050
But for the most part, people
are reading or listening to my

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.120
stuff to escape their
day-to-day life.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.510
They want to go experience some
other world for a while.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:34.140
So keeping really high-quality
content that the fans expect,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.910
keeping that coming to them, is
the most important thing.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.890
So that's way more important
than any of

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:39.630
the awards or anything.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.430
The awards, if you get nominated
for something or win

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.520
something, that's really good.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.660
It's flattering to the ego.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.810
But the biggest thing is
making sure that the

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.900
customers are happy.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.590
Because we started
all this out--

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.000
I wouldn't have anything without
a bunch of die-hard

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.560
fans who were clamoring for the
next episode every week.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.520
And then we put out "Ancestor,"
and we're like,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.780
I've been giving you guys
this stuff away

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.090
free for four years.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.180
Do you mind buying a book?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.530
They were like, just boom.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.590
And we knocked it out of
the park with Amazon.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.120
My dad had a phrase--

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.930
he was a football coach,
as I mentioned.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.340
But he would run a play, and if
it was successful, he would

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.620
run the same play
90% of the game.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.010
And everybody would be
complaining, like your games

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.540
are so boring.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.470
He's like, we won 42 to 6.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.740
They could not stop that play,
so we ran that play.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.500
And his phrase is always, you
dance with the one that

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.190
brought you.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.710
So if you've done something to
get to a place, and people

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.920
have taken care of you, then you
take care of those people.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.380
So the fans are the most
important thing to us.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.190
There were times when I was
working a day job or two and

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.220
trying to record audio to
put out in the feed.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.580
Like I was literally writing a
novel, recording that novel,

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.510
editing that novel, just to make
sure something hit the

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.670
feed on Sunday.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.640
We were just killing ourselves
to get that out.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.500
But we didn't want
to lose that.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.420
What we do is we give you
that every Sunday.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.890
That's why you keep
coming back.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.110
So the fans are the most
important thing.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.810
Taking care of them
is job one.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:05.800
INTERVIEWER: So I consider
myself a very relaxed,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.350
laid-back fan of yours.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:11.440
Talk about some of your more
extreme fans and the following

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.520
that you've kind of gathered
over the years.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.420
I go to your blog and I see
these people with tattoos of

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.540
characters on their arms
and things like that.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.760
Talk a little bit about
that, and how

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.140
you've grown that loyalty.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.210
SCOTT SIGLER: That's awesome.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.400
I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.470
Somebody sends you a picture,
and their back is a tattoo of

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.750
something that you made up,
it's like, just wow.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.880
Ego just swelling so big you
can't get through the door.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.590
But it's great.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.990
It's great to see that people
enjoy it that much, that they

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.240
literally want that to be a
permanent part of them.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.452
The team logos from the
"Galactik Football League" are

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.520
a really big one.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.680
And "Infected" is a story of
an ex-linebacker from the

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.590
University of Michigan.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.230
Blew out his knee, never
made it to the pros.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.230
He's working a desk job as
a customer support guy.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.120
And he gets these seven rashes,
these tiny little

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.510
rashes on various parts
of his body.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.330
And what he doesn't know at
the time is that these are

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.690
spores that are going to tap
into his bloodstream and use

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.730
the nutrients there to grow.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.010
They also tap into his nervous
system, and they use his

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.560
nervous system like it's their
own internet, so that they can

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.510
talk to each other
through his body.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.480
And a final part of that is
they tap into his seventh

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.590
cochlear nerve, and so they
start talking to him.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.390
So he hears voices in
his head, but they

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.400
are actual real voices.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.150
He's just the only who can
hear it, because it

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.250
bypasses the ear.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.580
And as these things grow,
they grow into these

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.025
triangular-shaped growths on his
body, and that has become

00:21:37.025 --> 00:21:40.790
an extremely popular
tattoo for people.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.690
And it's a really--

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.160
if you don't like a little
bit of the messy stuff,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.030
don't read that book.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.500
Because most everyone who gets
infected by this finds a place

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.580
to hide, get away from
everybody, and let these

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.160
things grow.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.900
And that's what they're telling
you to do, is just run

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.820
and hide so you avoid the
police, avoid hospitals.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.760
But Perry's got a bit
of a rage issue.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.900
The main character is beaten as
a child and has a cycle of

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.400
violence he's been
trying to break.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.740
So he decides he's going to
cut these things out of

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.910
himself before they can reach
their final growth phase.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.090
So it's really gross.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.770
It's a really gross book.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.680
INTERVIEWER: Lot of
science, though.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.110
SCOTT SIGLER: It's really
packed in with science.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.415
And explain the process of what
they do in the brain, and

00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:23.420
where they grow, and
it's very fun.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.260
But that's the weirdest one.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.020
Like a lot of triangle tattoos,
people getting that

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.280
image somewhere on their body.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.090
One girl's got it on
her inside lip.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.350
And then people will--

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.480
to give away a little bit of the
book, one guy just sent me

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.510
a picture where, they're called
hatchlings when they

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.150
come out, where it's actually
coming out of the body.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.740
This guy's got blood tattooed
on his arm, just to show how

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.940
things work.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.570
And that that's amazing.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.135
INTERVIEWER: So you don't have
any of your own characters?

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.360
SCOTT SIGLER: No, not yet.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.910
INTERVIEWER: Not yet.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.430
SCOTT SIGLER: Not yet.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.730
I have one tattoo
of our company--

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.330
now we're changing it to Empty
Set Entertainment.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.790
So I have an empty set tattoo,
kind of a personal

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.220
philosophy of things.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.260
We'll get one eventually.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.960
So we do that, and
then we have--

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.590
scottsigler.com has like 16,000
people signed up to get

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.940
the newsletter every week.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.140
There's a certain group of
people whose social circle has

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:22.040
primarily become the people
on that site.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.110
We get email that so-and-so from
California flew to New

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.420
York to go hang out with their
buddy from the site, and that

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.450
people have their own
spontaneous get-togethers.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.790
Marginally to talk about
my content, but they

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.290
just kind of get--

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.070
Because there are crazy threads
that are incredibly

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.600
long, people just chatting back
and forth on the site.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.150
It has nothing to do
with me anymore.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.560
So now we've become this weird
little social hub where people

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.640
get together.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.450
And then every year, we do a
thing called SiglerFest.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:52.670
So people fly in from all over
the country to come hang out

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.890
for three or four
days in Vegas.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.770
And then the weirdest thing
to me is when we do those

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.820
hardcover books, we
have Hell Week.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.530
Because A and I-- this is my
business partner, A. When we

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.350
first did it, we assumed to
send out 2,000 copies of a

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.050
hardcover book, it would
be four 10-hour days.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.420
It wound up being nine 14-hour
days, because we just had no

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.880
idea what we were doing.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.860
So then for Book Two,
we emailed the fans.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.950
Anybody want to come work
for us for free?

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.500
We'll give you a beer.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:20.780
Come on.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.690
And we had four or
five people.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.570
And then for Book Four,
17 people showed up

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.020
for two days each.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.750
And we just had, we looked
like a sweatshop.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.080
It was awesome.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.730
We had all these tables lined
up, and people are stamping

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.010
and numbering and signing.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.880
And they just came to do that,
to hang out and help out.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] or you're
signing, actually?

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.430
SCOTT SIGLER: I--

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.010
signing 3,000 books at once
takes a long time.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.160
Especially if you're putting a
personal message to everybody

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.430
in your book.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.620
So the fan base is great.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.730
The tattoos are fun.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.880
But the real shocking thing is
having watched people make

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.160
lifelong friendships that would
not have existed if they

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.510
hadn't all been playing
in our sandbox.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.660
It's kind of crazy.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.080
INTERVIEWER: So one other topic
that I wanted to talk

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.420
about is "Nocturnal," your
most recent book.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.150
You're in the process
of trying to make

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.280
that into a TV show.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.570
Can you explain that, and who's
producing it, and the

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:17.540
process there?

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.130
I think that's a pretty
interesting story.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.450
First talk about "Nocturnal,"
and what the

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.480
story is around that.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.630
SCOTT SIGLER: "Nocturnal," it's
really densely packed

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.820
with a couple different
areas of science.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.340
So it's hard to tell too much
about it without giving away

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.520
the big reveal.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.300
But largely, it's my homage
to '80s buddy cop movies.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.830
So if you ever watched "Trading
Places," "Lethal

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.340
Weapon," anything from back in
the day, you've got the two

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.600
joking cops, one more serious
than the other.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.880
So it starts out as kind of
a buddy cop procedural.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.020
Our two characters are
Brian Clauser--

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.170
trigger-happy, shot
one too many guys.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.470
And the other guy is Pookie
Chang, who's the jokester, and

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.530
everybody loves them.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.200
And it's intentionally starts
out as, OK, I've seen this

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.080
movie a thousand times before.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.310
And hopefully you go, I love
this movie already, because

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.340
I've seen this one a thousand
times before.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.080
And Brian starts to have dreams
of these really awful

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.230
mutilations, these murders that
are way beyond the pale.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.250
And the next day, they will go
out to investigate a lead, and

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.040
they will find a body
that is mutilated in

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.580
exactly that style.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.980
So right off the bat in the
first 50 pages, all of a

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.660
sudden, it shifts from, this
is a jovial, buddy cop, CSI

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.260
procedural, to the
happy-go-lucky guy, Pookie,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.810
assuming that his partner and
his best friend is a serial

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.510
killer, and a really
sick one at that.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.250
And then as they start to
investigate what's going on,

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.600
it becomes a balance between a
police officer trusting the

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.820
evidence in front of him and
trusting his heart and

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.380
believing that this guy couldn't
possibly do it.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.380
And as they investigate, they
uncover a cult that has

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.220
existed since San Francisco
has been founded, a very

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.920
murderous cult that the police
have been shielding and

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.020
protecting since the police
department has been founded.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.550
So you've got a 200-year-old
conspiracy, and they are going

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.630
through the city, and most of
the cult operations happen in

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.140
the tunnels.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.380
There's a lot of tunnels
in San Francisco.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.400
There's Chinatown.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.570
There's a lot of World
War II emplacements.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.590
A lot of things World War I,
Civil War-- there's many, many

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.920
miles of tunnels.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.640
And as they start to go under to
find this culture under the

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.010
city, and start to try and find
out what's going to clear

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.880
Brian's name.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.870
And then things get
nutty from there.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.740
INTERVIEWER: That's where
it's calmed and relaxed.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.480
SCOTT SIGLER: This
is still, yeah.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.550
You're largely in, for the first
150 pages, like OK, it's

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.340
not what I thought was coming,
but this is pretty exciting.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.300
And then the shit
hits the fan.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.165
Things just get wild
from there.

00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:57.270
So it's a giant 500-plus-page
book.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:57.880
It's huge.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.990
The publisher didn't even
want to publish it.

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.050
It was too big.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:05.780
We've slimmed it down a little
bit, but it's been described

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.880
as an urban fantasy, even
though there's not one

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.180
supernatural element in it.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.140
It's all hardcore science, with
a little liberty to the

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.660
science, which you can
see at the end.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.080
But the story of how "Nocturnal"
came to be a TV

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.890
show goes back to the same
way you discovered me.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.250
You read John Scalzi's
"Old Man's War."

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.370
You might like this.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.100
You picked it up, you
became a fan.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.150
Lloyd Levin, who is the
producer of "Hellboy,"

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.840
"Hellboy II," "Die Hard II,"
and "The Watchmen," these

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.840
crazy monster-specific
movies--

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.270
there might be monsters
in "Nocturnal.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.810
I'll go ahead and give you a
little bit of a spoiler here.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.510
He read a book, and then Amazon
said, if you like this,

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.310
you'll like this.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.500
So he said, OK, and he bought
"Nocturnal" and read

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.980
"Nocturnal" on his Kindle.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.240
And had never heard of me.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.910
All the stuff that I'd done,
he'd never heard of me, never

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:52.920
knew anything.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.750
And we get an email to
the website, the

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.660
standard Contact Us form.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:58.910
Didn't come through the
publisher or anything.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.730
Like, I'm a movie producer.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.035
I would like to talk to
you about "Nocturnal."

00:29:02.035 --> 00:29:03.090
We're like, yeah, whatever.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.970
Because we do, we get those
about every other week.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.060
And it's usually someone who's
aspiring or a start-up.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.490
Or like, I've done this
five-minute YouTube movie.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.630
Can I option your book?

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:17.110
And we're like, well, no,
but let's stay in touch.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.500
Maybe there's something
else that we can do.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.270
Here's a short story.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.100
Would you like to do this?

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.180
So we've had people take
a short story and make

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:22.960
films out of them.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960
So we're like, OK, whatever.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.840
And then we google him
and go IMDB him, and

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.320
we're like, holy crap.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.350
This is the guy who
did "Watchmen."

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.520
Are you kidding me?

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.690
And then we've been talking.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.360
That was about a year ago.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.280
And originally, we wanted to do
it as a movie, and just got

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.800
to the point where the book is
so dense that two hours was

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.860
not going to cut it.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.410
So he changed his mind.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.960
Like, would you mind doing
this as a TV show?

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.830
It's not as much money, but
we could give you 12 hours

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.370
instead of two.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.820
And I was like, that
would be awesome.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.580
Because I don't know if anybody
watches "Game of

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.410
Thrones," but try and take any
of the "Game of Thrones" books

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.920
and turn that into a two-hour
movie, and it would be crap.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.580
There'd be, here's a midget,
and here's some people with

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.990
swords, and yay, people fight.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.360
And like, that's all you could
get in in two hours, compared

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.530
to the layers and the complexity
that are in those

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.940
books, and they've managed to
bring to life in the series.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.300
Or "True Blood," or any of the
fictional novels that have

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.740
been turned into TV series,
they're just doing an amazing

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.710
job with those.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.790
The storytelling is fantastic.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.050
So we're really excited
about that.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.920
And the pilot script is done.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.530
And Danny Bilson and Paul De
Meo, who did a show called

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:33.590
"The Sentinel" back in the
'90s have written a pilot

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.680
script for it.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.750
And I was--

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.680
I'm an artist, people.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.220
I was like, all right.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.150
Let's see what you Hollywood
butchers do to my book for

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.190
this first script.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.310
And we went back and forth
on plot points.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:46.460
But they sent back the first
script, and I made probably

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.730
nine comments.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.370
Like we might do this
instead of this.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.480
It was perfect.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.500
It was great.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.120
So now the pilot
script is done.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.180
I'm really excited about it.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.200
Lloyd is planning to take this
out to various networks and

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.200
see if we can land a show.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.510
And it all started because,
if you like this,

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.540
you might like this.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.470
It's crazy to think of that.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.150
'Cause I spent a lot of time
marketing and trying to get my

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.280
name out there, like trying
to go get attention.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.420
Because my work doesn't
really fall into--

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.930
it's not traditional sci-fi.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.030
Or it's not the sci-fi
with a message.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:24.360
Or it's not, let's be careful of
all of what's going on with

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.620
cybersecurity, Cory Doctorow,
this is this cool thing that

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.900
people are worried about
and reading about.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.120
It's like, my stuff's sci-fi
and horror and

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.910
action/adventure and thriller,
and it's all mashed together

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:37.720
and set in a modern-day
thriller.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.520
There's no handle on
it, so to speak.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.170
So trying to get attention from
that regard, it's been

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.360
very difficult to do.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.210
And I have not had the runaway
bestseller "Hunger Games" kind

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:49.440
of a thing happen.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.700
I mean, if that happens,
obviously then you've got your

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.480
choice of who you want
to make the movie.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.690
So for this random thing to
happen, and everybody involved

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.020
with it is really excited and
thinks it's going to be really

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.340
special show, has
been amazing.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.220
INTERVIEWER: Hopefully
it happens.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.620
I'm looking forward to it.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.520
SCOTT SIGLER: Oh, "Nocturnal,"
I have a slug line.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.510
Now I got it.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.300
"Lethal Weapon" meets "Hellboy."
So there you go.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.000
I wasted 10 minutes of your
time because I couldn't

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.440
remember that.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.000
INTERVIEWER: In terms of your
other books, do you have

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.090
visions for them outside
of print, in terms

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.260
of TV shows, movies?

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.750
Like what you would want to
see them turned into?

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.090
SCOTT SIGLER: Well, "Infected,"
the first one, was

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.330
actually optioned for a movie
right out of the gate.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:39.660
So I had the bidding war, and
then signed with Crown, and

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.360
then two weeks later,
the movie was

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.920
optioned by Rogue Pictures.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.460
It was nuts.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.950
I was like, I can't believe
this is all happening.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.780
And then find out two years
later, they just

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.910
didn't make the movie.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.610
Which is what normally
happens.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:53.210
Authors get things optioned.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.790
Things almost never get
actually produced.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.990
So that book, "Infected,"
I want to really

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.040
see that as a movie.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:09.370
Because I think it fits well
into two hours, and I think it

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:13.730
would be an amazing vehicle for
a young actor, to go from

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:19.110
being the mild-mannered Clark
Kent, sitting at the support

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:23.430
desk, this huge arc, where they
have to wind up at the

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.380
end being kind of a
raving psychopath.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.660
And watching someone be
able to pull that off.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.560
So I want to see "Infected"
turned into a movie because I

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.190
think it could totally make an
actor's career, to show that

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.810
breadth in one span.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.510
That would be the really
cool thing to see.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.080
And it would be a little gory
and be a little fun.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.430
And then "Contagious"--

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.200
there's three books in the
series, "Infected,"

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.180
"Contagious," and "Pandemic."
"Pandemic" should be out in

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.600
October or early next year.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.890
And the concept is the alien
invasion, but from the

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.890
perspective of that hapless
sucker who's

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.520
just one of the numbers.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.740
So in "Infected," in the first
week, 5,000 people died.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.930
He's one of those 5,000
people that you never

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.040
hear anything about.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.090
Has no perspective, has no
idea what's going on.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.310
He's just one of the
first victims, and

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.750
you watch his arc.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.900
Then for "Contagious," you pull
the camera back and look

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.489
at the national level
of what's going

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.020
on across the country.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.699
Bring in the president, the
cabinet, FBI, a lot of the

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.500
traditional X-Files-type
people you would

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.699
see in these movies.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.090
And then for "Pandemic," you
pull it all the way out, and

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.420
you get to see how it's
affecting the entire world.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.500
So if "Infected" gets turned
into a movie does well, then

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.750
"Contagious" and "Pandemic"
would follow on after that.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:37.719
And "Ancestor" is straight-up
'80s creature feature.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.949
It's "Predator," it's "Aliens."
It's when you want

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.280
to go to the movies to see
people get eaten, it's pretty

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.250
shameless in that regard.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.190
It's hard science, and
you get to see--

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.570
the different take on that is
instead of in the first two

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.820
minutes, you've got the janitor
at midnight pushing

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.760
the broom, and a claw reaches
out and pulls him in, so the

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.770
monster's already formed, you
get to see the monster go from

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.190
a single cell that they have
heavily engineered and then

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.880
watch the nightmare of this
thing developing into an

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.080
animal that is completely off
the rails of what they

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.270
thought they had.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.580
"Ancestor" is, in effect, an
effort to genetically engineer

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.280
a herd animal with human organs
to take care of the

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.780
organ shortage problem.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.110
Every year, hundreds of
thousands of people die

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.110
because there's just
not enough lungs

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.450
and livers and kidneys.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.665
If you could have an animal
where you could take those,

00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:28.000
genotransplantation, take those,
put them into people

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.380
without any kind of immune
system response, not only

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.640
would you save millions of lives
and add to the quality

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.280
of life of a lot of
people, you'd make

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.300
a crap-ton of money.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.080
So if you can perfect this
thing, there's no end to the

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.040
checks that you're going
to be able to write.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.680
So they do that, and in
"Ancestor," instead of winding

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.520
up with a 200-pound herbivore
herd animal, they wind up with

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.500
a 650-pound pack predator.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.180
And they're stuck on an island,
because that's how

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.880
these things always work.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.313
It's total Michael Crichton.

00:35:54.313 --> 00:35:55.680
INTERVIEWER: You have to
be stuck on an island.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.580
SCOTT SIGLER: Yeah.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.800
I started writing this one 15
years ago when I was on this

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.100
huge Michael Crichton binge,
and it wound up being

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.350
a really fun book.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:05.400
That would be a great one
to see as a movie.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.000
That's a two-hour movie,
no question.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.300
Would not last as
a miniseries.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.690
And you would get to see
some awesome CGI.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.950
Unfortunately, Stan Winston is
no longer with us, but my

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.470
dream, my goal in my 20s was
to have Stan Winston do the

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.480
special effects for
one of the movies.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.770
He did "Terminator," he did
"Aliens." he did a movie that

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.820
I adore called "Pumpkinhead,"
that very few people have

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.600
heard of and even less
people like.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.970
So to watch a really high-grade
creature feature,

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:33.480
I'd want [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.600
to be excellent.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.860
And then the last one is the GFL
series, which will never

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.250
be-- it's just impossible.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.160
It'd be $250 million at the
drop of a hat to turn this

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:42.930
into a movie.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.260
Even with full-blown CGI.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.260
Because you've got five races
playing football, and humans

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.890
are just one of those races.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.100
So any on-field action
is really complex.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.280
And then off the field, you're
watching this racist farm boy,

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.740
who's been brought up to hate
everything that isn't human,

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.480
and pretty much everything that
isn't his kind of human,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.130
get thrust into the bright
lights in the big city of this

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.660
professional league.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.390
Because he's a quarterback
prodigy, and he wants to be

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.750
the best. there's ever been.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.980
Well, to do that, you have to
go play on the best teams.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.280
And the best teams have all
the different races.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.150
So it would have to be a "Green
Lantern"-esque movie.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:28.740
But even beyond that, because
my aliens are not bipeds.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.670
They're not primates.

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:33.325
They're not just people with
funny skin and some crap on

00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:34.360
the bridge of their nose.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.010
These are aliens that have
been evolved, like I

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.650
visualized the evolution of a
single cell in environments,

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.325
and into primitive forms, and
they really look alien.

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:46.630
And even communicating with
them is a difficult thing.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.380
And in the story, there are
races you just can't

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.845
communicate to.

00:37:49.845 --> 00:37:51.160
You have to have an interpreter,
because you can't

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.900
figure out what the other
person is saying.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.080
So it's not just on the field
where that'd be a complicated

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.840
thing to show.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.870
It's all the personal
interaction.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.390
And that would be a very
difficult movie.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.570
But for an anime, it
would be awesome.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.160
So my goal is hopefully see that
turned into a video game.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.100
There's a huge organized
crime in it, too.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.110
Because every franchise is
owned by a gangster.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.920
Because of the huge racial
hatred throughout the

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.400
universe, there have
to be laws.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.250
The overlord race-- which
is not humans.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.980
Humans are a subjugated race.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.960
There are these laws that you
cannot pull over a team bus.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.020
No search and seizure.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.490
You can't touch the players.

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.070
So players all have diplomatic
immunity.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.345
Now as you can imagine, being
a young professional athlete

00:38:35.345 --> 00:38:37.650
with diplomatic immunity is
going to create its own source

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.360
of problems.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.020
But the men and the women on
these teams are largely pawns.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.280
Because the real goal of the
league is so that the

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.500
gangsters can ship contraband
and smuggle information on

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.980
these ships, because the
ships can't be touched.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.960
So the gangsters will do
anything to make a winning

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.970
team, because if your team moves
up the tiers, to Tier

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:02.140
One, and you're traveling all
across the galaxy, you become

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.230
very powerful in the information
and the contraband

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:06.520
that you can ship.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.670
So it's organized crime.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.910
It's sports.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.630
It's the big racial
aspect of it.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:15.760
And I think it could be a "Game
of Thrones"-esque anime

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.840
that could last for years.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.380
Like an "Attack of the Clones"
kind of thing from "Star

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.210
Wars." So to see the aliens done
right, that's the kind of

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.480
thing I'd really like
to see turned into

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.420
computer-generated or anime.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.630
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.420
So we've talked a lot about
your books, kind of your

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.310
publishing career.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:36.920
What's next on the
horizon for you?

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:42.700
You have a couple series that
are still active, but what's

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.620
next for you, moving forward?

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.550
SCOTT SIGLER: Well, pretty much
the first thing right now

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.320
is getting control of
"Nocturnal" and "Pandemic,"

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.900
the audiobook rights, so that we
can get the books recorded

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.870
and we can podcast it
out to the fans.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.450
Let everything else take care
of itself, as long as we're

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.160
providing them their
free stuff.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.330
Then we have the fifth book
in the GFL series.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.510
It'll be coming out next year.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.080
I start writing that
pretty soon.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.690
And that's a seven-book arc,
so still got a few

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:11.690
more years in that.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.030
We are now hiring other authors
to co-write books with

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.540
me, to try and follow the
James Patterson model, a

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.790
little bit.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.120
You're not scalable,
as an author.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.660
I mean, James Patterson's
got that figured

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.880
out down to a science.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.065
So trying to figure out how to
put out quality content that

00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:31.130
the fans like, but also get some
help so we can put out

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.490
more of that stuff.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.560
That's what we're
doing right now.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.580
We've got four novellas
planned for next year.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.490
The TV show has been a big deal,
where we literally just

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.100
clear blocks of time during the
week, just in case they

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.150
need something.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.160
Because they'll-- oh, by the
way, we need this, and we need

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.910
this right away.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.860
You get to work on it.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.900
Having the time cleared
out to do that.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.910
"Pandemic" will be the final
book out for Random House at

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.040
the beginning of next year.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.730
And that's the end of
the five-book deal.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.180
So we're trying to write a new
book called "Flyer" that the

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.850
agent will take out to
the marketplace.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.200
And this will end up being the
most interesting thing.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.240
Because six years ago, when I
signed with Crown, I got the

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.370
brass ring that everybody
was going for.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.940
Everybody wants to be
signed with a major.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.130
Everyone wants a movie option.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.890
I found a way to
get that done.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.140
And then in the interim, the
entire industry has changed.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.640
Borders has gone out
of business.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.110
Amazon has become the 800-pound
gorilla in the room.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.180
You can write an ebook and not
have to answer to anybody, and

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.200
make 70% per sale of your book,
instead of 12% you're

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.580
making if you are
a bestseller.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.550
I'm sure Stephen King
probably gets more.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:42.210
But there's this thin upper tier
of people who sell 90% of

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.410
the books in publishing.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.090
Then there's a really solid tier
under that of people who

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:45.720
are bestsellers.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.410
If you're in that tier, you
can get up to 14%, 15%.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:49.250
Everybody else?

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.510
8% to 12%.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.080
Right?

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.200
So that was the goal, is to get
the publishing deal, to go

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.050
on book tours, see your
book in stores.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.690
There aren't as many
stores anymore.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.300
Nobody's doing book tours,
because they're

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.460
not profitable enough.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.940
And you can just put
out your own books.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.340
So I do "Flyer," have my agent
take that out, and we see what

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.700
the marketplace says.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.880
So like a typical advance for a

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.270
first-time novelist is $5,000.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.340
Say we get that.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.670
Say people are like,
OK, your book sold.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.840
We like you, but here's $15,000
for the advance of

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.940
your first book.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.240
I mean, for us, that's
like, no.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.090
Absolutely not.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.370
We can put this out on our
own, and we will do much

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:27.980
better than that.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.170
And have full control
over the cover, full

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.490
control over the design.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.020
We get to hire our own
editor, who knows our

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.580
stuff extremely well.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.480
So that has to get up
to a certain level.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.400
So that's the part I'm most
looking forward to, is seeing

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.310
how things shake out when
you take a book into the

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:42.940
marketplace.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.460
Because now as creators
in any stripe, you

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.470
can be your own boss.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.650
There's a number of ways to put
stuff out where you're in

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.280
charge and you control
everything.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.540
And the part I forgot to
mention, I think, is that I

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.570
run advertising on
the podcast.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.950
If you want my audiobooks
for free, no problem.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:00.700
Here they are.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.430
60-second ad before
every episode.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.490
We're all used to that
from television.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.510
Nobody minds.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.780
And then the ads are a revenue
stream for us.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.580
And they're like, I
can't stand ads.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.190
No problem.

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.300
It's $20 here on iTunes.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.400
Buy it, download it, or buy
the book and read it.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.290
It's totally up to you.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.070
So if we go out with a deal and
somebody throws a ton of

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.180
money at us for an advance, and
then they're like, yeah,

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.850
but you can't podcast it, that
cuts into the content.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.820
It's just not doable for us.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.720
Because we're a media company.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.190
We're an entertainment
company.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.400
We sell advertising against our
content, and that's where

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.690
most of our revenue
comes from.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.090
So watching what will happen
when we take the next book

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.710
out, probably five or six months
from now, and to see

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:43.150
how much everything
has changed.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:44.830
Because I haven't been able to
do a lot of these things

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.840
because I've been locked
in with Crown.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.130
I can't wait to see
what happens.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.930
It'll be crazy if somebody's
like, here's

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.010
a really good advance.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:55.390
And we'll just be, like, we'd
love to do that, but we just

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.150
can't, because we don't know if
you're going to promote us.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.325
That's the other thing.

00:43:58.325 --> 00:43:59.990
You're going to tell us you're
going to promote us.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.730
Then you're not.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:02.880
Then we're dead in the water
for the next three years.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.020
Whereas if we control our own
destiny, maybe we don't make

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.990
as much, but that same deal,
controlling your own content,

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:15.650
5 and 10 and 15 years down the
road, when we're 60 and trying

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:18.750
to figure out where our back
catalog revenue is coming

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:23.380
from, if we control that, making
less now makes for a

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.180
much more successful
long-term business.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.130
So do that, and trying
to think--

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.530
it's weird.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.740
We're trying to 20 and 30 years
down the road and make

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.480
decisions based on that.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.360
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.920
I want to let you guys know that
we have flash drives for

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.000
everyone with, I think, most
of the GFL series on

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.120
it, or all of it.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.850
That those are kind
of free giveaways.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:49.050
And then I want to open it up
for a few minutes for Q&amp;A. And

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:51.715
there's a mic in the back, but
you can probably just say it

00:44:51.715 --> 00:44:54.140
loud enough.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.565
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thanks for coming.

00:44:56.565 --> 00:44:58.330
Second of all, love
your work ethic.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.270
Love the creativity that you
have, both in your writing and

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.280
also in business.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.482
Would love to understand a
little bit more about the

00:45:04.482 --> 00:45:07.105
creative process behind
the writing.

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:08.800
How do you come up
with an idea?

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.860
How do you build out
the characters?

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.770
I know the process is probably
different for every

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.350
individual.

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.930
What is that process
like for you?

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:17.230
SCOTT SIGLER: So where the ideas
come from, and then how

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.400
do you manifest them?

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] and you
think, this is my guy.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.490
INTERVIEWER: Do you mind
repeating the question real

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.490
quick, just so we
get it on audio?

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:24.750
SCOTT SIGLER: Yeah.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.200
So how do I get the ideas?

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.110
And then once I had the idea,
how do I massage that idea up

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.490
into an actual full-blown book,
and what is the process

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.160
involved in that?

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.500
Yeah?

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.590
The idea is, I have
the opposite

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.050
problem of writer's block.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.050
I have an incredibly
short attention

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.000
span, and ideas just--

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.540
all day.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.320
I wrote three books
on the walk here.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.470
And I'm not even kidding.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.000
I passed a gated library,
and I'm like, oh,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:49.520
that's a cool place.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.520
What can we do with that?

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:55.980
So trying to try to control the
overwhelming amount of,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.740
this is the greatest idea I've
ever had, I have to stop

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.520
everything I'm doing
and go write this,

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.630
is a constant challenge.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:06.020
Which my business partner's
critical in.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.300
She controls what's being
worked on when.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.610
We have quarterly meetings.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.040
Like, OK, you really
want to do this?

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.870
You can do this, but
then you have to

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.420
stop doing these things.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.590
And I get all angsty and try
and figure out what I

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.660
want to work on.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:22.050
But then once we have the idea
we know we're working on, I'm

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.220
very fortunate, in that I get
up in the morning, I look at

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.140
my calendar, and the projects
are blocked out.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.260
You're working on this, you're
working on this, you're

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.160
working on this.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.380
So that's something I'm bad at,
and she's very good at, so

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.680
that works out really
well for us.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.950
The ideas come from--

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.480
I really am a big
fan of science.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.410
Not a scientist, but I read
as many blogs as I can.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:45.270
And "New Scientist," it's hard
to go through one issue of

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.000
"New Scientist" without taking
notes on four or five

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.220
different new projects.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.730
Because biology is
mesmerizing.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.650
All the amazing things
that we do.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:56.450
And then hacking biology is a
big one for me, not so much in

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:59.250
the computer sciences, but
every time I see somebody

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.630
tweak a genome or do
something, I'm

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.100
like, that's great.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.220
Let's do that.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.170
So a lot of times, that
idea will stick.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:12.010
Like let's insert this
particular genome into humans

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:14.470
so that they produce this
particular hormone, which

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.500
defeats this particular
symptom they are

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.160
suffering of lupus.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.790
Let's do that.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:21.110
Which that's worked into
"Pandemic," by the way, so

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.840
this is a case study.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.000
And that will just sit there.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.780
But that's not a good enough
story on its own, because

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.660
there's no drama,
there's no arc.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.600
And then like for "Ancestor,"
I learn about the organ

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.810
shortage, and that sticks.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.790
And then I learn about chimeras,
which is where you

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.740
are taking genetic information
from one animal, one or more

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.470
animals, and putting them
into another animal.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.950
You wind up with a chimera.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.420
And thinking that well, wait a
minute, what if we were to do

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.630
all of these things?

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.090
We could have organs.

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:51.605
And then you learn about
endogenous retroviruses, that

00:47:51.605 --> 00:47:54.690
are viruses that are kind
of stuck in your genome.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.640
And if you start messing with
this stuff, well, these things

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.970
come out and you get a crazy
bird flu and everyone dies.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.610
That's something they're
actually concerned about.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:02.920
I don't really get how
all that works.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.680
I just know everyone dying
is a good plot point.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.310
When I say everyone can die, you
are going to pull the book

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:11.800
a little bit closer, right?

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.980
So I got that.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.140
And then I learned about--

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.720
so all these things
stick in the head.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.030
And then I learned about the
work of, I think, Blair

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.180
Hodges, I believe is his name,
who did a genetic analysis of

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.120
all mammalia and figured out
that the main branches

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.750
branched off well before the
extinction event that kind of

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.760
cleared the dinosaurs and
cleared the field for mammals

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.890
to take over.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.320
There had always been this
premise that it's this one

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.750
ancestor of all of us, and then
the dinosaurs went away,

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.560
and then it went through rapid
expansion into all the

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.420
available niches.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.380
But it's not.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.980
The main branch of mammalia
were already there.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:49.150
So like, there were tiny little
hippos, and they were

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:52.370
hiding just like the
tiny little shrews.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.950
And then all of that
came together.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.970
I'm like, OK, so what if they
do this genetic sequencing,

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.620
get the genome of everything,
get rid of all the original--

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.910
like if this gene is only
found in tigers,

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.190
we'll remove that.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.780
And if you remove everything
that's unique and take

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.470
everything that's common, you
basically have the original

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.730
genome of the ancestor
of all mammals.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:13.560
So what if we do that?

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.020
Then what if we genetically
sequence that, put in the

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.000
computer, so we can do evolution
on the computer.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.080
And then what if
we tweak that?

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.930
OK, now what if we're going to
tweak that in order to make a

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.430
new animal that is going to have
human harvestable organs?

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.830
But we know it's clean.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:29.770
There's no retroviruses
in there, because

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:30.650
we can control it.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.620
We can see that in the genome.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.840
So now we've got this perfectly
clean animal.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.060
It's going to solve the organ
shortage problem.

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.130
And then we're going
to be doing this.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.800
And then I discover
this great--

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.230
I think it's an [INAUDIBLE]
machine--

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.180
I'm not sure-- that actually
prints proteins.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.770
And you can print
custom proteins

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:46.480
right from your computer.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.580
I'm like, OK, we'll bring
that together.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.850
Let's just jazz this up so it
can actually print a full

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:51.710
chromosome.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:52.560
Now I can do that.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.640
There's my hand waving.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.580
And then all of a sudden,
you've got this animal.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.260
What are we going to
put this animal in?

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.950
Well, then I learned about the
efforts to bring back the ibex

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.450
or various extinct animals,
where they will

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.600
take a close relative.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.060
I think they tried to do this
with a species of buffalo.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.140
They enucleate the egg of a cow,
pull out the cow genome

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.210
in the egg, and they take this
genome they've cloned, stick

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.740
it in there, and stick it
right back in the cow.

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.730
Because since it's got the egg
protein coating, the cow

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.620
should recognize as self.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.420
And hopefully, it'll be able
to gestate in there, a

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.440
C-section will pull it out.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.370
And they've actually
done this.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.910
They've actually brought back
extinct animals by letting

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.140
them gestate inside
a close relative.

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.835
So all that trashed--

00:50:34.835 --> 00:50:36.000
INTERVIEWER: Extremely
simple process.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:36.290
SCOTT SIGLER: Yeah.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:37.278 --> 00:50:38.760
AUDIENCE: I understand
what she does now.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.610
SCOTT SIGLER: All of that crams
together to make the

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:50.050
novel "Ancestor." And then, of
course, science goes horribly

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.690
wrong, and then you get to have
a lot of fun from there.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.040
They don't know the genome
that they're controlling.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.260
And you get giant 650-pound pack
predators with Dimetrodon

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.380
sails on the back
of your head.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.020
And it's wicked fun.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.910
It's so fun.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.030
It's a fun book.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.950
So that's how that process--
once you get those ideas, and

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.800
I get all excited, and call A,
and be like, we gotta do this

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.970
one, we gotta do this one.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:11.400
Then you start to
outline them.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.660
Then I take my layman's
knowledge of science and do my

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.150
research, and I hammer out
a really strict outline.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.450
And then a benefit from giving
crap away free for seven years

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:25.020
is a lot of scientists--

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.880
and policemen, and firemen,
and soldiers--

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.700
have emailed me to say, I can
tell you're trying to get what

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.410
we do right, and that
matters to us.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.200
So if you ever need
help, call me up.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.090
I'm a biology Ph.D.
At Harvard.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:40.790
Call me any time.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:41.630
You're like, awesome.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.980
Put that in the Rolodex.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.550
So now I've got this amazing
battery of people who are

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:49.110
experts in their fields, and
I send them the outline.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:52.280
They will go through the outline
and say, OK, you've

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.360
kind of got the idea.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.170
But this could never happen,
and here's why this could

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:55.760
never happen.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.670
Try this instead.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.320
Take that back, cobble together
another outline.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.590
Write the first draft.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.480
First draft is a real
pain in the ass.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.300
Because you're writing--

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.360
I'm long-winded, as you
can tell, right?

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.600
All of this goes onto
the page as well.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.600
Then I'll write the first draft,
turn that back over to

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.050
the scientists and the soldiers
and the cops, and

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.840
have them go through it.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:19.860
And they just tear it apart.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.600
It's really not a fun part of
the process to know that this

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.580
plot thread that you fell in
love with, and literally spent

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.630
a week of your life, every day,
working on it to get it

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:29.290
just right, it's
just got to go.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.220
It just flat-out doesn't work.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.880
Then they give me
the feedback.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.800
I go from there.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.390
And then by the second draft,
things are pretty

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.130
much blocked out.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:38.030
And then we go through the
regular draft process with the

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.396
editor at Crown.

00:52:39.396 --> 00:52:40.660
That's how we do it.

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.150
INTERVIEWER: So we're
out of time.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.620
We're going to hand out
the flash drives now.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.010
There are a few books for sale
in the back for $5 each, and

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:53.080
Scott's more than willing to
sign those, if you want.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.110
But thank you for being
here today.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:55.960
We appreciate it.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.160
And hopefully you guys
all have a chance to

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.543
enjoy Scott's work.

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:00.660
SCOTT SIGLER: Thank you.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.200
