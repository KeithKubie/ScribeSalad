00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.440
[Narrator] Everyone on the internet 
was in love with "The Grinch,"

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.200
When asked if they enjoyed it 
they'd say "Yes" in a pinch;

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.640
Jim Carrey's so funny 
and Ron Howard's a gem,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.500
and this holiday classic 
is perfect for them.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
Yes, the film seemed to make 
so many people happy,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.580
but, the Grump [dramatic musical cue]

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.820
of Channel Awesome 
found it all crappy.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.740
He hated "The Grinch"; 
every part of the movie

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.700
Please don't ask why, 
we're not sure how this could be.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.020
It could be that his head 
wasn't screwed on just right.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.940
Or perhaps it could be 
that his shoes were too tight.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.000
[Critic] Why would shoes affect 
how I feel about something? I...don't get that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.680
[Narrator]  But the most likely reason of all, 
I should think,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
Is the Grump thought his brain 
was two sizes too big.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.020
But whatever the reason
you might want to pick

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.720
the Grump spent his time 
HATING the flick.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.700
Staring down 
with a grumpy Grump frown,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.400
he never got what pleased 
all the people in town.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.140
"Can't they see," said the Grump

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.980
"That the remake is crap?
I'd rather get my nuts caught in a Lorax trap!"

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.280
"P.S. That's gotta suck too."

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.440
[Critic] The jokes are atrocious,
the lines make me weepy

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.400
They scare up the Grinch
when the WHOs are more creepy!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.320
The original's a classic;
no fixing required

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580
Whoever said this needs an update 
is a big fat f*ck liar!

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.540
Pop cultural references don't make a film work,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.560
Just makes you look like a big, dumb, lazy-ass jerk!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.920
On top of that, 
who the hell made Dr. Seuss PG?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.160
PG? Oh, I see!
Seuss was never child-friendly!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.380
[Narrator] And the more the Grump thought
how this movie could stink,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.300
The more the Grump thought,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.040
"I must stop this whole thing!"

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.680
Why for 11 damn years I've put up with it now,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.140
I must stop Christmas from sucking! 
...But how?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.060
[Narrator]
And then the Grump got an idea

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.120
An awful idea

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.340
The Grump got a wonderful, awful idea.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.820
"I know what to do," the Grump said sitting tall,
"If I can't enjoy it, I'll ruin it for them all!"

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.160
A critique of this stinker is just what they need, 
I'll tell them the truth: my words must take heed!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.980
So come on, ya pansies,
Let the bashing begin!

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.320
Stop smoking that Who-Hash
And let us dive in.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.460
[Critic continues]
So this world, we discover,
Takes place on a flake.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.140
[smack] [yell of pain]

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.520
Trust me. I did 'em a favor for God's sake.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.640
We see the Whos in Whoville 
are merry and bright,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.220
Many of them you'll be seeing 
in your nightmares tonight.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.160
Seriously. These Whos 
are freaky as hell.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.980
Were their mothers all pregnant 
when they fell down that well?

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.960
[Cindy] Dad?
[Lou] Yeah?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.360
[Cindy] Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.480
[Lou] This is what Christmas is all about!

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.360
[Critic] But we see our main innocent
And of course her dad too.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.280
This is Cindy Lou Who,
Who is no more than two.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.020
...Well, but we'll give them a little leeway.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.280
[Cindy] Everyone getting all kerbobbled. 
Doesn't this seem... superfluous?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.980
[Critic] Good, God, kid. 
Did someone put your hair in a blender?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.700
It looks like the penis 'do 
from the film Last Airbender.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.260
[Grinch] I guess I could use a little... social interaction.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.020
[Critic] We then see the Grinch: 
the epitome of cruel.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.000
And yes, to be fair, 
that makeup is pretty cool.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.400
He looks just like the Grinch,
despite the film's flaws.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.160
But hey, could be worse,
they could have given him cat claws.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.280
[Grinch] I merely noticed that you're 
improperly packaged, my dear.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.100
[ripping paper] Graah!

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.940
[Critic] So, as you'd guessed, 
he hates Christmas to a T.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.860
And so would I if lived 
in this town constantly!

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.800
For Whoville looks dirty, 
and kind of polluted

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.680
There's smog everywhere 
and the colors are muted.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.680
The wide angle makes things 
look strangely intense,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.540
And is it me, or did someone 
rub Vaseline on the lens?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.020
[Man] What happened to you?

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.520
[Teens] It was the Grinch!

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.820
[Screaming tires screeching, honking, crashes]

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840
[Critic] And the constant camera movement
has gotta be the worst.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.560
There's more Dutch angles here 
than in "Battlefield Earth"!

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.920
This doesn't look magical; it's ugly and henious!

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.380
This isn't Christmastime, 
it's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"!

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.780
But, at least we know the Whos have Christmas Spirit in check

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.860
[Betty] Well I'd blow every fuse 
if I tried to keep up with you, Martha May!"

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.640
[Boom! thunk thunk thunk thunk]

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.400
[Critic] Up! No, strike that, they're as phony as Glenn Beck.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.660
[Martha] Isn't this antique ~darling?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.100
[Critic] For ya see, these Whos are competitive 
and beyond materialistic.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.020
A town that just loves the spirit? 
Pfft! I guess that was unrealistic!

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.460
For these whos are corrupted 
and commercal to the max,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.940
But don't worry, it's just a story arc 
written by talentless hacks.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.760
[Martha] Well goodnight Betty!

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.240
[Critic] And geesh, is it me 
or are the decorations really bright?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.240
[Woman] Is your house on fire, Clark?
[Clark] No, those are ...Christmas lights.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.140

But we need this song 
like we needed one in "Polar Express".

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.280

To act in green latex 
is probably not breezy

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.680
[Grinch] Hate, hate hate hate, *double* hate 
... LOATHE ENTIRELY

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.540
[Critic] But GOD is he annoying!
I'm sorry but it's true!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.620
Is there a law to how much mugging 
a single person can do?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.680
[Grinch] What if it's a cash bar?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.860
How dare they.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.380
All right, I'll go.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.300
But I'll be fashionably late!

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.140
[Critic] [sigh] Just because you can make faces 
doesn't mean that you should.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.460
Can't you once say a line 
like a normal person would?!

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.460
[Grinch growling and mumbling]

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.040
[Critic] [sigh] Didn't you take anything 
from the great Boris Karloff?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.540
You sound like Sean Connery 
if his nostrils just fell off!

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.660
[Grinch] Those Whos are hard to frighten, Max!
But, we did our worst. And that's all that matters."

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.800
[Connery] Only on account of villainy

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.440
[Critic] Little Cindy Lou wants to find out about him

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.360
(If I was her I'd avoid him 
at every single whim)

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.020
[Cindy] Where did he come from?

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.600
[Woman] Oh! Well, [laugh] he came the way all new babies come.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.360
Adrift from the sky in their own pumbercellas

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.620
[Baby Grinch cries out as he lands]

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.420
[Critic] So we see the Grinch 
as a small little baby

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.200
...That or perhaps 
a young Gary Busey baby

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.180
As he grows up even older 
and we see school's at hand

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.680
He looks like Gizmo if he was thrown in the washer 
with a green crayon.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.760
[Martha] Oh, I hardly remember him;
I didn't have time to socialize

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.280
I was far too busy with my ... studies.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.360
[Critic] We see a girl who likes him.
Guess she ...has a thing for green too

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.240
(If you think that's weird, 
I know a chick who has a thing for blue)

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.940
[Kid] You don't have a chance with her;
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.940
So the Grinch was made fun of
for being so damn hairy

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.420
(Boy, who'da thought the guy from Passions 
would be more subtle than Jim Carrey?)

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.480
[Grinch] What a lovely family heirloom!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.120
[Critic] So he makes her a gift 
out of all that he's saved

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.060
But then he thinks that maybe 
he should give himself a shave.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.580
So he goes ahead and shaves his chin
and leaves a couple nicks

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.920
And... for some reason it gets the class 
all laughing at him like hicks.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.680
[Laughter]

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.300
[Grinch] Stupid ribbons!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:15.960
[crash]

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.120
[Critic] Is it me or are the Whos 
just who-rible creatures?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.280
They show us the true meaning of Christmas 
in this feature?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.580
Even the teacher is laughing! 
Dude, what's up with that?!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.180
It's not that funny, lady! 
She's as contrived as those brats.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.540
[Grinch] I hate Christmas!

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.840
I hate it!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.580
[Movie Narrator] So whatever the reason;
his heart, or his shoes.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.500
He stood outside his cave, hating the whos.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.460
[Critic] Wait a minute! Whatever reason...
Dude, are you high?!

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.500
They just told you the reason
you dumb stupid guy!

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.340
It's because he was mocked
All the way from the start

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.000
What?! Did you just 
fall asleep at that part?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.760
So they look for a ringleader:
A Cheermeister they say,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.400
To take on the role
Just before Christmas day.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.320
[Cindy] The Cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.640
And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.360
And I believe that soul is the Grinch!

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.240
[cheering and clapping]

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.320
[Critic] So Cindy tells the Grinch 
in his Grincy Grinch-lair

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.160
Dude, do her parents 
ever accompany her anywhere?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.300
[Grinch] How dare you enter the Grinch's Lair?!

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.320
The impudence! The *audacity*!

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.960
The unmitigated *gall*!

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.060
Another unmistakable sign of the heebie-jeeb-eh-ies!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.420
Now. You're. *doomed*!

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.520
[Critic] [sighs]

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.600
So if you're a strange person 
for one reason or another

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.180
Who likes to watch men
act like Snarf's deformed brother,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.240
Then this scene's for you!
I'm so filled with glee.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.120
Now please, never make
eye contact with me.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.820
[Grinch] WHAT DO YOU WANT?!?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.200
[Cindy] I came to invite you 
to be holiday Cheermeister!

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.040
[Critic] So the Grinch heads on down;
He'll be glad that he did!

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.340
Because this scene happens!

to have dampened his cheer,

Mistletoe butts,
for Mom to get offended!

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.320

[Grinch] Taxi! [taxi driving past]
It's because I'm green, isn't it?!?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.400
[Critic] Ok, *that's* a good joke.

...Wait...Santa's in this movie?
That's a ...little confusing...

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.820
But no matter. He gets his stuff
and starts to head down,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.560

in their quiet little town.

was so smart and so slick,

and he got her a drink

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.620

[Critic] Odd, seeing how the Grinch 
is someone she knows,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.340
Bit it fooled her in the book, 
so I guess we'll let it go.

But here's a scene  
I simply cannot let fly,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.900
It's where the Grinch sees the Mayor's house
and needs to drop by.

[Mayor snores]

This is high art!

This is the Christmas classic you all love?

Aw hell, as long as he's not wearing a tanooki suit

So as the film promised,
he steals the holiday

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.260
Which puts all the Whos 
in alarming dismay.

and that was uplifting
