00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.980
Photons are oddballs.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.370
When they’re not busy being waves, they’re
massless particles that can travel at light

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.080
speed because, well, that’s what they are,
little packets of light.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.679
For decades it was also thought photons didn’t
interact with each other, but recently researchers

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.029
have discovered how to bind photons together
as though they were molecules.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.420
With flashlights, unlike ghostbusting equipment,
you can cross the streams all you want.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.439
They don’t bounce off each other or cause
every molecule in your body to explode because

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.710
photons don’t much care for one another.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
Unless, that is, they’re fired through a
ultracold cloud of rubidium atoms.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
When scientists from Harvard and MIT fired
a weak laser through a rubidium cloud, they

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
observed photons coming out the other side
in pairs and triples.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.170
Not only that, but they could tell from how
much the photons were oscillating that they

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.789
weren’t just bunched up together coming
out of the cloud -- they were bonded, like

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.980
molecules.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.130
Photonic molecules!

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.929
They could even tell how strong the bond was
based on their oscillation frequencies!

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.559
Before we get too ahead of ourselves, I should
tell you that not all of this is new news.

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.590
Back in 2013, scientists fired a blue laser
at ultracold rubidium gas and observed the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.460
photons forming pairs when they came out the
other side.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.399
What’s new THIS time are that the photons
formed the trios.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.530
Scientists weren’t sure if it was even possible
to form groups of three interacting photons.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.869
Turns out it’s not only possible, but three
photons interact even more strongly than pairs

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.189
of photons.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.860
To explain how this happens, researchers believe
that as the photons travel through the rubidium

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.510
cloud, they’re briefly captured by the atoms
to form an atom-photon hybrid called a Rydberg

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.759
polariton.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.810
The photon travels from atom to atom doing
this, and if two polaritons come across one

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.390
another, the photons can mingle thanks to
their atomic partner.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.750
They become entangled, and when they reach
the edge of the gas cloud the atoms stay behind

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.380
while the photons stick together.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.549
It’s like two shy people being introduced
to each other by their more outgoing friends

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.180
at a party.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.189
They’d never approach each other on their
own, but once they meet they really hit it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.189
off.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.780
Apparently, they’re even open to adding
a third person to the mix.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.520
Ok, I’m going to abandon this metaphor before
I get in trouble.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
These new photonic molecules have interesting
properties, like taking on a tiny amount of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.860
mass, which is crazy when you remember photons
by themselves are massless.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.860
They also travel about 100,000 times slower
than normal, so you know, around a sluggish

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.640
10,000 kilometers per hour.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.940
What we can DO with these photon molecules
remains to be seen.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.360
They could make it possible for computer logic
gates to use light, instead of inefficiently

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.990
converting light to electrical impulses and
back again like some do now.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.010
Or they could be used in quantum computing
to carry information, thanks to their entangled

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
state.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.411
OR if adding more photons to the mix makes
them interact more strongly, maybe it’s

00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:46.060
possible to make entire crystals out of light!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.610
Time and more research will tell, so more
research is needed.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.710
Be the light of our life, take a sec, and
subscribe.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.550
Speaking of quantum craziness, did you hear
scientists teleported stuff to SPACE?

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.960
A handsome devil talks about it here.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.020
While photons in the visible spectrum usually
won’t interact, very high energy photons

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.790
have a higher probability of bouncing off
one another, a process called gamma-gamma

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.880
scattering.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.920
Thanks for absorbing our photons into your
eyeballs.
