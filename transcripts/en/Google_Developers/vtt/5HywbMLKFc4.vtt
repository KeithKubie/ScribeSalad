00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.570
Entrepreneurship is a state
of mind, a different way

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.250
of thinking about things.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.480
It's a way of understanding
large challenges

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.350
at a conceptual level
and transforming that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.710
into a real solution for a
person, a community, or even

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.750
the world.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.570
Entrepreneurs use
technology as a way

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.820
to connect people
and create solutions

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.590
to problems once thought of
as too big or impossible.
