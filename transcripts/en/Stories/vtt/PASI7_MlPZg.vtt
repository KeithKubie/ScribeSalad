00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.440
How far would you go to
charge your cell phone

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.110
if you had no electricity?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.505
Would you walk for hours?

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:11.005
Miles?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.610
That's what millions of people
across sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.920
do every day simply to
charge their phones.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.275
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.330
LAURA LING: I'm Here in Tanzania
because sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.650
is experiencing a
major energy crisis.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.850
Modern-day Africa has been
transformed by cell phones,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.910
but the infrastructure needed
to charge those phones,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.650
and to power sub-Saharan Africa
in general, just isn't there.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.912
And it's leaving hundreds of
millions of people in the dark.

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:44.870
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.250
In the village of Mkuranga,
I immediately felt welcomed.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.030
Since most people don't have
electricity in their homes,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.540
they go to charging stations
to power their phones.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.150
Recho Mango, a health care
provider at the local clinic,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.940
was picking up her cellphone
that she paid roughly $0.20

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.028
to charge.

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.432
Hi, I'm Laura.

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:03.593
Nice to meet you.

00:01:03.593 --> 00:01:04.280
RECHO MENGO: Nice to meet you.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.350
LAURA LING: She took me to her
clinic's maternity ward, which

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.340
has no power.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.640
So this is the clinic?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.292
RECHO MENGO: Yeah,
this is the clinic.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.395
LAURA LING: Do you often have
to deliver babies in the dark

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:24.436
because there's no light?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.160
Vital immunizations for
mothers and children

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.785
are kept cool by gas
from a propane tank.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.040
It's getting dark
out, and Recho is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.790
about to see a client who
is in her third trimester

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.660
of pregnancy.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.090
And she could give
birth at any moment.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270
So Recho basically
has to do whatever

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.890
she can just make it work.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.690
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.390
women in developing
countries such as Tanzania

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.280
are dying every 90
seconds from complications

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300
during pregnancy or childbirth.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.500
Would having adequate
light save lives?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.360
While a few homes in
this town are connected

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.590
to an electrical grid,
they often experience

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.880
frequent blackouts, sometimes
lasting up to 48 hours.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.400

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.490
18-year-old Hussein Mwende
has lived his entire life

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.660
without ever having
electricity in his home.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.880
What you want to be
when you grow up?

00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:40.130
It sounds extremely
difficult. Do

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.855
you ever feel like giving up?

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.990
Mkuranga is typical of many
villages across Tanzania.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.462
Just a few hours away is
Tanzania's largest city,

00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:00.045
Dar es Salaam.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.040
It might seem surprising,
but Africa has the world's

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.620
fastest-growing middle class.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.365
While there still is a long
way to go, signs of development

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:14.870
are all around.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.300
At [? Nelwa's ?] Gelato shop,
I met owner Mercy Kitomari.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.830
How many gelato shops are
there in Dar es Salaam.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.421
MERCY KITOMARI: So
there's, like, five.

00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:27.920
LAURA LING: In all
of Dar er Salaam?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.090
MERCY KITOMARI: In Tanzania.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.840
LAURA LING: In all Tanzania?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.970
MERCY KITOMARI: Yeah.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.440
LAURA LING: Why do you think
that there are some few.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.880
MERCY KITOMARI: The costs.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.440
An average person won't even
think of doing this business

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.595
because when they
think of power cuts,

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:43.620
you don't even think
following that.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.705
LAURA LING: There's
a blackout right now.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:46.580
You have a generator.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.241
That's why we hear this
little buzz in the air.

00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:50.366
MERCY KITOMARI: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:51.067
And it's often.

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:53.150
LAURA LING: It seems
extremely challenging to have

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.120
this kind of business in a
country with so many blackouts.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.480
MERCY KITOMARI: It
does slow you down.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.250
When power cuts off, the
first thing is the freezers.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.015
You freak out.

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:05.710
I started thinking, oh, shit.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.160
Need to hire a generator.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.552
You hire a car to bring it.

00:05:09.552 --> 00:05:12.220
You hire a crane to lift it.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.422
And for the generator,
they charge you per hour.

00:05:14.422 --> 00:05:15.880
LAURA LING: So it's
very expensive.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.713
MERCY KITOMARI: Yes.

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.080
LAURA LING: And meanwhile,
your gelato is melting.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.020
MERCY KITOMARI: Yeah.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.436
LAURA LING: Is it
worth it to you?

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:22.510
MERCY KITOMARI: It is.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.050
It has been worth it.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.560
It's been super challenging.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.865
Super, super challenging.

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:32.100
But every day, there's progress.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.990
LAURA LING: Mercy
relies on social media

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.220
to build her business.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.640
In many ways, her
entrepreneurial spirit

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.950
represents Africa's
enormous potential.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.400
But energy issues may determine
how bright that future will be.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.650
MERCY KITOMARI: I love my
country, don't get me wrong.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.684
But there's still a
lot of work to be done.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:53.142
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.682
LAURA LING: It's Saturday night
here in Mkuranga, Tanzania.

00:05:56.682 --> 00:05:58.390
And we're going to do
what the locals do.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.848
We're going to go to the movies
at the local movie theater.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.979
They're playing a
local Tanzanian movie.

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.747

00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:13.480
LAURA LING: Good.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.940
Most people in this town
don't have electricity,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.780
so they come here
for entertainment.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.560
Luckily, this place
has a generator.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.530
When blackouts occur,
life proceeds for those

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.710
that can afford a generator.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.612
But for those that can't,
it's a different story.

00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:31.070
There's a blackout going on
right now in this neighborhood.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.560
Everything around
me is pitch black.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.060
The stores have closed.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.770
The only light is
really this candle

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.686
and whatever motorcycles
and cars pass down the road.

00:06:41.686 --> 00:06:44.969
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.560
It seems strange and
a little unsettling

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.175
to be in near total darkness
that was beyond my control.

00:06:52.175 --> 00:06:55.570
But those around me
didn't seem fazed.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.930
This is life as normal here,
and in pretty much the rest

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.930
of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.460
Thinking back on
the people I'd met,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.910
they were making it
work despite challenges.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.380
And if power never
arrives, I'm sure they'll

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.920
keep plugging away, determined
to make a better life

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.320
for themselves and for others.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.880
But charging stations and
generators will only go so far.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.020
These are some of the
friendliest and supportive

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.830
people I've ever met.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.660
