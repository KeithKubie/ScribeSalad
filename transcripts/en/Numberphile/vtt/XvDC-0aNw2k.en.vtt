00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
BRADY HARAN: Hi everyone.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.030
You've probably noticed from
the lack of "Numberphile"

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.290
videos lately and my
Grizzly Adams beard

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.470
that I've been away.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.510
I've been in Nepal doing various
bits and pieces.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.050
But I've also been keeping my
eye open for bits of numbery

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.190
trivia and a few things I've
come back with that I thought

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.300
were worth sharing.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.990
Now, anyone who knows anything
about Nepal knows almost

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.560
everywhere you go, you're
being watched by these

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.510
Buddhist wisdom eyes.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.780
But one thing I didn't know
was that little curly nose

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.810
that looks like a question
mark, well

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.410
actually, that's a number.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.490
It's an ornate version of
the Nepali number one.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.500
Its symbolism is unity.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.835
And here's the number
one on their money.

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.130
You can see that's what
a one looks like.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.300
And here's the number one on
a motorcycle license plate.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.140
So there are always numbers
where you least expect it.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.350
Another number that's really
important in both Buddhism and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.580
Hinduism, I learned, was 108.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.950
And 108 is everywhere
in Nepal.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.220
Even these recesses here
cut in the stupa,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.570
there's 108 of them.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.830
It's actually quite good fun
when you're in Nepal seeing

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.180
how many places you can
find that number 108.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.290
Now, here's another
number, 261.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.350
That's the number of photos
on this SD card.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.630
This card was found by my
Nepalese trek leader, Budhi,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.550
while he was actually going to
the toilet in some bushes.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.380
It was raining.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.510
And this thing was soaking
wet when he found it.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.450
But we found out later on, the
photos were still on there.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.160
I don't know whose
photos they are.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.840
But I know if someone found my
holiday photos, I'd want them

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.310
to return them.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.200
So if you recognize these
people, have a look at the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
link under my video and help
me get in touch with them,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.670
because I'd love to return their
holiday photos to them.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.220
Now, that trek was to
Everest base camp.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.280
And those of you who are
familiar with "Numberphile"

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.113
will know that I actually
went there last year.

00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:49.200
It's a place I'm really into.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.110
Have a look at this photo I
took this year, though.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.560
There's Mt.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.790
Everest in the background.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.890
8,848 meters high.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190
We're having a bit of fun
there with the torch.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.190
I've already done a video
about the height of Mt.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.335
Everest and some
of the numbers.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:04.160
So have a look at that if it's
something that interests you.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.560
And another video we've done
before is all about the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.030
Nepalese flag.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.850
So that's one you can also
have a look at if you're

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.310
interested.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.280
But this year what I did, was
as we went to all the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.460
different elevations, we boiled
water and had a look at

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.270
how the boiling point
of water changes.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.785
BUDHI: And the boiled water
temperature is 88.

00:02:25.785 --> 00:02:27.870
BRADY HARAN: I'm doing that
video for my chemistry

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.020
channel, which is called
"Periodic Videos." So

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.870
subscribe to that and have a
look if it's something you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.060
might be interested in.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.980
It's very numbery, of course.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.780
And just to show that I'm
always thinking of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.300
"Numberphile," I couldn't
resist getting a bit of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.870
footage of this mountain here.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.240
It's called Mt.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.100
Numbur.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.430
That's Numbur, Numbur.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.590
I read on the internet that
some people say it has the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.970
shape of a female breast.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.470
It's not something
I can see myself.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.410
But there you go, Mt.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.340
Numbur for all the
numberphiles.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.050
E making be equal to ab.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.580
4 touching e, draw a line fg
starting from the point f on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.820
line ac, parallel
to ab to the--
