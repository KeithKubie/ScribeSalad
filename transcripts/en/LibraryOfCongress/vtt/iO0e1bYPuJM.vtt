00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.350
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Hi,
I'm Gail Shirazi,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.670
of the Israel Judaica
section here at the Library.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.590
Welcome to today's
program, "Violins of Hope",

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.850
co-sponsored by the European
Division, the Hebrew Language Table

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.650
at the Library of Congress, in
cooperation with the Czech embassy

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.230
and the Rebean Chair at
George Washington University.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.710
Two announcements before we start.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.300
Please shut your cellphones off or
silence them, and the second one is

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.650
that we are being webcast.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.930
And the part that will be
scanning the audience is a question

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.250
and answer period, so, if you
don't want to be webcast and appear

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:08.110
on the LC website, you can leave
the room, stand in the corner,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.390
but just so you should know.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.190
Speaking of violins, I just
want to mention that the Library

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.350
of Congress has musical
instrument collections.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.500
Our first collection was five
violins of Antonio Stradivari.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.940
So, we have five, we
may have more now

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.430
but Stradivari's violins
are here at LC.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.320
There's also a collection
given to the Library

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.450
by the King of Thailand, in 1960.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.560
To learn more about
these instruments

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.450
and other wonderful
collections and treasures at LC,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.530
you can google www.loc.gov.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.070
This program was a truly
cooperative effort.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.830
I would like to thank Grant
Harris and Erica Spencer

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.860

Jennifer Gavin [phonetic]

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.270
and Donna Herschel [phonetic]

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.280
Mary Fetscow [phonetic] and the
embassy of the Czech Republic

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.460

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.680
and of course, Amnon and
Avshalom Weinstein are presenters,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.230
and our violinist Hannah
Tarley [phonetic].

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.010
It is a true honor to have these
talented artists with us today,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.300
Amnon, a master violin
maker, his son Avshalom,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.300
third generation luthier,
and Hannah [phonetic],

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.740
a world renowned violinist who
just arrived today this morning

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.470
from New York, and she
has to leave at 2:00

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.190
because she has a performance
she's giving in New York tonight.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.950
So, thank you very much
Hannah, for above and beyond.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.830
She started playing
the violin at age two

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.190
and gave her first
performance at age four.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.550
She's the founder and artistic
director of "Notes by the bay",

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.230
a new children summer music
festival in California,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.220
and if you'd like to know some
more information about her,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.730
there's some sheets in the
back and some up front,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.790
because her accomplishments
are too great to mention.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.120
Through their work with the
violins, these dedicated

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.640
and amazing individuals
are giving voices

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.070
to millions murdered
in the Holocaust.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.730 position:56%
We will start with the
presentation by Amnon, then Avshalom

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.520
and in between, Hannah
will be playing.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.060
First, we have some opening remarks

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.980
by Pavla Valeczicnova
[phonetic], did I do it OK?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.580 position:56%
Had a Public Diplomacy Department at
the embassy of the Czech Republic,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.510
and then we'll start our
formal program, thank you.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.860
[ Applause ]

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.400
&gt;&gt; Pavla Valeczinova:
Good afternoon, others.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.200
It is the greatest pleasure and
honor indeed to be here in the name

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.630
of our Embassy and, as originally
the Ambassador was supposed to be,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.930
here and he sends his big apologies

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.200
because one Congressman only
confirmed last minute meeting

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.150
with him, when your
Ambassador's been here

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.800
for a week precisely, right?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.790
So, sorry about that, really.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.100
"Violins of hope", for me in
general, the terms of music,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.240
the Holocaust seem to be
actually impossible to unite,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.040
and I love the title because
that's what I feel when I think

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.760
about Holocaust and
music in connection.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.030
I feel that we must have brought
hope and it must have been a hope

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.420
for survival and a better world.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.670
Being Czech I immediately think
about Czech composers or Czech -

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.500
Jewish Czech composers
that were stationed

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.960
at Terezin [phonetic] start.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.350
There were about nine
or ten of them.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:34.420
And as you probably know, the
Terezin was a special case

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.140
in the Nazi camp system, because
it was the camp on show --

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.810
the ghetto on show so, it was
also a mean of Nazi propaganda.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.840
So, that's why the music
was also played over there.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.420 position:56%
And there was a large number of
musicians and artists in Terezin so,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.280
the Nazis used them very,
you know, in the Nazi way,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.840
and they even did documentaries
about this artistic part

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.900
of the ghetto, of the
example of ghetto.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.110
The Terezin composers Pavel
Haas, Guideon Kline, Hans Krause

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.940
and Viktor Oldman, we
had several years ago,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.730
I think 2014 we had a very
nice concert called "Phoenix

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.700 position:56%
from the ashes" and it was the music
by these composers, and it was one

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.910
of the strongest evenings we
had at the Embassy until now.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.240
I -- to conclude, seeing
these beautiful instruments,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.300
I'm thinking about one Holocaust
survivor that I met some years ago

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.840
in London, Alice Herz-Sommer
[phonetic], she was a pianist,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.430
she was in Terezin and she
died at the age of 110 years.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.660
Three years ago, in London.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:07.860
She was an example of
positivity, and very funny,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.120
and that's immearly [phonetic] my
thoughts tonight if you permit --

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.400
if you let me honor her and
of course I'm looking forward

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.050 position:56%
to hear Amnon and Avshalom's stories
and Hanna's beautiful performance.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.510
Thank you, and thank you Gail.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:08:10.330
[ Applause ]

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.290
&gt;&gt; Amnon Weinstein: Good
evening, ladies and gentleman.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:18.390
I'm very honored to be here
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.620
I'm afraid I may sound
too pompose in English,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:30.130
so I will not tell you
excited I am to be here today.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.120
Let me go into most
solid ground and present

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.360
to you our project,
"Violins of hope".

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.520
I would like to start
with a personal story.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.400
My history with music
started 100 years ago in 1915;

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.300
my father was a little boy in
Stechvlend [phonetic], east Poland.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.960
When he first time heard
the sound of a violin.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.250 position:56%
Ecclesial troop arrived there to
play for a versi [phonetic] wedding,

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.610 position:56%
and while all the children set under
the table trying to get some sweets,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.630
Moschele [phonetic] my father
was hypnotized by the music.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.260
He approached the violinist
and since then never stopped

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.290
to love and to live music.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.130
If you may let us, the
Cleisnard [phonetic] to live

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.920
and so there's Moschele, he
followed the wagon and the horses

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.810
of the Cleisnard out of town.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.730
Just like the story of
the flautist of Hamelin.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.990
His mother, my grandmother
Esther, looked for him everywhere,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.840
until somebody said that the
boy followed the musicians.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.760
Well, young people ran after the
wagon, caught the little boy,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.480
and for many days everyone gossip
about the punishment the boy got,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.680
also, about the violin he
was given to play with.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.330
And he played it.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.040
He learned to play all by himself
and later started in Vienna.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.810
This is how little
Moschele was introduced

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.210
to the Jewish musical
tradition of the haram,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.940
this is how he joined many
prodigal boys and girls,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.280
some who became the
greatest virtuosos of Europe.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.820
The day that my father got
his first radio simple violin,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.790
violin support project
was born symbolically.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.890
As a young boy in Tel Aviv,
in the middle of the '40s,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.450 position:56%
I remembered many survivors who came
to see my father at his workshop.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.340
He used to hug them and then
hand them a violin and say,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.950
[speaking foreign language].

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:52.500
He would say those words, and they
were the first words in the world

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.630
that they will learn in jiddish.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.510
[Speaking foreign language]
"Play a little bit".

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.460
Soon, the guests and my father
were sitting and playing a bit,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.890
loving a bit and playing the
violins like they would never stop.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:13.680
As a little, boy who started taking
violin lessons with a teacher,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.080
I remember asking one
guess, how did he play

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.650
without notes and books of music?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:26.300
"And the birds", he answered,
"Do they sing with notes?"

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.110
By the way, a very funny
history ahead of this time,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.830
because all his classmates that
knew to play, and to imitate birds,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.410
and my father had a cat in the
workshop, and every time one

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:47.510 position:56%
of them came over, they ask him to
imitate a bird, and the danny super.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.470
In the moment, the cat heard the
sound, he was going like crazy

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.000
in all the workshop to
look after the bird.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.190
Years later, an experienced
violin maker, I met Daniel Schmidt

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.800
of Dresden, East Germany who
came to study with me in Tel Aviv

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.770
and became a close friend.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.490
Daniel knew a little
of the Holocaust,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.600
he didn't learn it in school.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.470
Israel is different.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:21.500
The Holocaust is present everywhere
and all the time with most people;

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.890
Daniel was curious
and soon met musicians

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:30.090
who emigrated from Germany in 1936.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.300
This is when Boris
Labrunmun [phonetic]

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.860 position:56%
and Arturo Toscanini established the
Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.440
Uberman [phonetic], addition
Jewish musician, who lost position

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.130
in German Orchestra, and those,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.150
had sell him their
lives and their violins.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.080
The truth is that most
Jewish violinist made

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.820
on German-made instrument,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.590
which were on Sibert the
very best at that time.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:03.370
By the way, Uberman was the
Vunderking and as a child of nine,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:10.540
performed the difficult concerto
of the composer Johannes Brans.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.270
Brans, set in the modules
and rumors are saying

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.650
that the old composer
was touched to tears.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.870
In the last century, the violin
was considered almost a Jewish

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:30.710
instrument, popular in weddings and
the most in young boys' education.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:36.290
So, many boys were forced to take
violin lessons at age of five,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.880
and quite a few grew
to be world famous.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.270
When Isaac Stern was asked why so
many Jews play the violin he said,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:54.360
"It is an instrument which is the
easiest to pick up and handle".

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:01.910
As you know, many little managed
to run - to pick up the violins,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:08.550 position:56%
many were killed and the
instrument confiscated by the Nazis.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.190
In fact, the Nazis confiscated
thousands of violins,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.220
violas and cellos of
Jewish violinists.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.780
Why? Why the few instrument,
when the famously Italian made,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.460 position:56%
most were very cheap, made purposely
for plays in the kilometers.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.650
It is impossible to return
confiscated musical instruments

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.710
to their rightful owner.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:38.100
They outlay weigh, identified
simple violin and prove

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:45.520
that once upon a time, before that,
it belonged to a Jewish violinist.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:51.670 position:56%
But there is no doubt as to the
rightful owner of violins decorated,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.420
is one or more star of the heaven.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:15:00.170
They were truly owned by
lasemas [phonetic] to me,

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:07.640
the cheap unsophisticated
violins had no big name

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.610
at that [inaudible],
signified lost people.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:18.020
To me, that makes the
project "Violins of Hope",

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.390
to me the lovely decorated
violins have emotional value,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.900
far better than money value.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:32.440
One day, I got a violin broken
to pieces, practically to beat

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.490
and shred, on its plastic bag.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.930
It took me about a year and a
half to glue its broken bone

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.510
and to put them together
again, to fit its head

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.450
and belly and restore the sound.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:53.020
It was much care and love that
we brought it back to life,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:59.770
so it could play and reach out
many people in the concert hall.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:05.140
Only when I glued the other part I
discovered that this is beautiful.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.110
It is decorated with
Five Star of David,

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:15.900 position:56%
made by Jacob Tieveman [phonetic],
a Jewish maker who worked in Warsaw.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.670
It was probably made for a glasmer
[phonetic] and played outside

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:26.790
in rain and freezing snow, a
witness to many horrible scenes.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:32.990
By the way, Jacob Tieveman was a
teacher and mentor of my father.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:38.000
I must confess that each time
I finish to restore a violin,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.700
I feel nervous, holding
back my breath,

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:47.140
until the minute I have the
first note being played.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.600
Once the sound is heard,
I start breathing again.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.150
It feels like the birth
of a new child.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.350
Well, almost.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:04.400
After World War II, when the
Holocaust became common knowledge,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.300
and survivors were back to
Israel, there was a general boycott

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.110
of German-made goods,
so much so that the name

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.770
of Germany was not
mentioned on the radio.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.110
In this atmosphere, Varnemish
[phonetic] refused to play

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.000
on German-made instruments.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.300
Many came to my father and said,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.500
"If you don't buy a violin,
I'm going to break it.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.080
I'll never touch it again".

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:36.110
My father, who loved each and every
violin, bought many instruments,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:41.050
violins, viola, cellos, and
other to save their lives.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:47.570
Yet, realized that he could
never hear them again.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.520
This is how we developed
a big collection

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.180
of German-made instruments
of first rate.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.280
Back to my student, Daniel, he
asked me one day to give a lecture

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.480
and the Annual German and Violin
and Bow Makers Association.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.750
He asked me and I refused.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:10.970
This went on for about
two years, until 1999;

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.780
interesting when I presented the
German Association with 200 photos

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.060
of violins and many more
anecdotes and stories.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.050
Until then, for the past 20
years, I cannot stop talking

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.800
about my collection, now
sharing it with my son Avshalom,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.120 position:56%
a collection of pan serving violins.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:39.010
My father used to say that all
the children should learn music

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.860
and practice the violin.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.990
People who play the
violin, he believed,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.010
cannot be evil and violent.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:53.000
Well, he's to be proven wrong, as
many Germans who worship music,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.360
were evolved in so many atrocities.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.700
But he was a naïve
believer, my father.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:09.300
But, sometimes it is naïve people
who make difference in this world.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.180
Listen to this story.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.700
Ilona Fair was a Hungarian
violin virtue also,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.040
who somehow managed
to stay and survive.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.250
When she arrived in Israel,
she could not adapt to the life

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:29.980
in our country and then, and she
was unable to perform onstage.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.330
Ilona was desperate.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.040
She came to my father in tears.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.410
"You must give violin lesson
to teach the new generation

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:46.230
of Jewish children that in
time will become virtuosos.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.940
You must continue the
tradition of many violinists,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.830
who killed in Europe", he said.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.190
And she listened.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.530
And soon, he had listened

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:00.830
to six-year-old [speaking
foreign language],

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.040
and so many other Israeli legends.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.480
We named the project
"Violins of Hope",

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.990
violins with history
and personal stories.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:15.870
Many saved actual lives.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:21.450
Some violins survived by their
owners' burials, some were hidden

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.360
in the attic, one was buried
under the snow, one was strung

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.700
out of a kettle train in France,
some came from Poland and Romania,

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.190 position:56%
some from Holland, many from Germany
and Austria, when violin was played

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.260
in the main orchestra in Auschwitz.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.100
All of them are restored
as the best we can,

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.730
and all 64 of them today play in
concert in Europe and America.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.270
Two years ago, our violins
played an unforgettable concert

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:57.190
with the Berliner Philharmonic,
in remembrance of 70 years

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.140
to the liberation of Auschwitz.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.030 position:56%
We also played concerts in
Charlotte, North Carolina, Cleveland

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.400
and lately Sarasota at
Jacksonville, Florida.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.660
Since the premier concert in
Istanbul, Turkey, and the concerts

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.950
at the wall of Jerusalem,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:18.160
the violins do not
quietly in their cases.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.590
After 70 years of silence,
they refuse to keep quiet.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:29.660
Next year the reiterate Israel
70s in Nashville Tennessee.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.470
In Birmingham, Alabama, they
will also play as socket concert

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:43.300
in Dachau, the first Nazi
concentration camp in Europe.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.320
There are sought by many and soon
we hope, they will be exhibitioned

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.320
and played in ten major
American cities,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.990 position:56%
where educational programs will be a
part of their daily schedule as part

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.930
of exhibition internationals.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:06.220
Last December, the project was
awarded the Stumedal [phonetic]

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.790
of Holmes, honor by
the German government.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.270
This was also a piece of hope.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.560
I would like to finish with two
stories that inspired our concerts.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.650
These are the stories of
Alma Hauser and Emily Zend.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.170
Alma Hausen [phonetic] was born
to musical royalty in Vienna.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.780
Her father was a famous violinist

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.910
and composer Gustav
Mahler was her uncle.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.290
Alma was beautiful
and talented violinist

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.310
who conducted a little
orchestra of young women

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.240
that traveled all over Europe.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.020
When time changed, she
became the conductor

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.100 position:56%
of the Women Orchestra in Auschwitz.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:52.740
As such, she managed to save the
lives of many women prisoners,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.390
but failed to save herself.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.740
In her memory, I would like to read

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.140
to you a short paragraph
of her biography.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.200
It took place while she was
visiting her camps in hospitals,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.190
block ten Wilkenow [phonetic].

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:16.250
After dark, a woman prisoner
named Magda handed a violin

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.930
to Alma Hauser a new
inmate in Block 10.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.150
40 years later, Magda remembered

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.090
when all was quiet,
Alma began to play.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:33.690
Without words, she transported
the prisoner of the block 10

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.700
to the world outside Auschwitz,
far from hatred and inhumanity.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.850
Her music blossomed
into memories of family,

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:45.730
home, holiday and happy time.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.730
The docks on the back
[inaudible]; the operating room,

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.250
the excess doctors,
the muffled sounds

00:23:53.250 --> 00:24:01.700
of the execution yard disappeared,
beauty have long forgotten dreams

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.790
in block 10 until that night.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:11.500 position:56%
Nobody there who had dreamed of such
beauty, as her playing that moment.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.080
By the way, the only recording left

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.090
of Alma Hauser is the Bach double
concerto which she played together

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.000
with her father, Arnold Hauser.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.800
Now, Elie Wiesel [phonetic].

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.070
A few months ago, Elie Wiesel
a writer, political activist

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:36.350
and novel laurate, and most of all
an empathic, warm hearted person

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.250
and survivor, passed away.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:46.310
As a child in Sieget, Romania, he
took violin lessons and he used

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.280
to go to the teacher
with his violin case

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.500
and a bottle of shutka,
local vodkda.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:59.110
Fortunately for the little
Elie, his lessons lasted only

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:05.160
if there was vodka
left, not too long.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.810
Not so many years later,
Visel Meulik [phonetic],

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:12.910
a concert violinist, they were
on the Desmauch [phonetic],

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:20.330
rented for the freezing night in
a small barn with many inmates.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.020
Then miracle happened, Meulik
[phonetic] took out his violin

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:29.040
and played the violin
Beethoven Concerto.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:35.860
This was Meulik's finale, as the
next morning he was found dead.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:41.890
Visel told his sad story in
his famous book the night

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.700
that he got the Nobel Prize.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:57.510
I would like to conclude with a
Hebrew prayer [Speaking Hebrew].

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:10.990
[ Applause ]

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:18.580
Now is the turn of my son,
and he will take the podium.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.120
&gt;&gt; Avshalom Weinstein:
Good afternoon

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:31.250
and thank you for coming today.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:36.550
I'm Avshalom Weinstein, Amnon's
son, third generation violin maker

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.170
in Israel, and I'll present
you some of the instruments

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.080
that you see here today,
and I'll tell you some

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.680
of the stories of them.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.630
We will start with this instrument.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:52.820
As I'm sure many of you know,
some of the most famous violinist

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.890
in the world during the 20th
century were Jewish, Isaac Stern,

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.040
and many, many, many others.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.440 position:56%
But we only now about three or maybe
four Jewish violin makers during

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.300
this time.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.440
This violin for example was
made by Jacob Zimmerman,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.660
the mentor of my grandfather.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.780
We know from stories when we
spoke to Edel Handel [phonetic],

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.160
and Michele Schwangve [phonetic],
we used to be the concert Maestros

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.520 position:56%
of the Berlin philharmonic for many,
many, many years, on the carry on

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.890
and recorded some the best master
pieces, which until today concern

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:33.160
to be some of the best
recording ever.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.430
They were both his clients.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:41.000 position:56%
Michel Schwangve who has come from a
very poor family, he told my father

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.200
that when he was young he
would get his instruments

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.820
and repairs by Zimmerman for free.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.910
Edel Handel remembered him as
a very old man during the 30s,

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:57.010
drinking milk all the time probably
due to an illness or something.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:01.630
We have no idea what happened
to him during the Holocaust,

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.490
we assumed he passed away; he
was already probably over his 70s

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.280
when the war started, but
we have a few instruments

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.430
of his which survived.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:16.960
One of them we have here with us,
this is a very unique instrument.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.890
I don't know if most
of you could see it

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.940
but you can see it afterwards, it
has a Five Star of David carved

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.870
and layered on the back, and the
label inside is written in Yiddish,

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.580
and it reads, "I made this violin

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.940
for my loyal friend Mr.
Schuman Kongle [phonetic],

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:39.240
Varsow 1924, Jacob Zimmerman."

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.740
When my father asked
Michel Schwangve [phonetic]

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.840
if he heard the name Schuman
Kongle he said yes, he said,

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:52.210
"We were so poor, we didn't feel
comfortable bringing the violin

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.920
teacher home", and his
violin lessons used to be

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.750
in Schuman Kongle's
[phonetic] house.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.710
Schuman Kongle was a wealth
industrialist in Varsow

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:07.720
and when the war started he
took his violin and he ran away.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.630
He managed to arrive to Tashkent,
Uzbekistan, where he fell ill

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.510
and passed away, most
probably from typhus.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:21.210
He gave his violin to his
closest friend, and after the war

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.750
in around 1946, '47, this run came
to the Congo trammeling Jerusalem,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.530
he knocked on the door and asked,
"Did you know Mr. Schuman Kongle?"

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.120
He said, "Yes we do, we haven't
heard from him for many years,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.130
he's our uncle", and
he gave him the violin.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:44.570
We also have a photo of Schuman
playing on this violin in his house

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.770
in Warsaw, and these are
basically the only things

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.990
which are left for Mr. Kongle.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.710
We got this violin --

00:29:54.710 --> 00:30:00.200
&gt;&gt; The photo or Mr.
Kongle is at his --

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.860
&gt;&gt; You can see it later, there
is a booklet here, you'll be able

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.350
to see the photo, we have it large
and we got it from the family.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:13.230
And as I mentioned Jacob Zimerman
[phonetic]was not the only one,

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.830
we know of another violin
makers -- Jewish violin makers,

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.620
his name was Jacob Hackert, we
have one of his violins here,

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.150
unfortunately we couldn't bring
all the instruments today.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:30.210
Jacob Hackert [phonetic]was born in
the Netherlands, he went to Milkou,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.500
France to the Violin
Making School there.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.640
Later on, he led some of his
apprenticeship around Europe

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.870
and Germany, coming
back to Amsterdam

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.900
where he opened his workshop.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.610
He had later on a very
successful string factory,

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.500
he was making strings
and he made the booklet

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.190
of all the reviews he got from
the leading musicians of the time.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:01.310
Later on his factory was
converted to make medical supplies,

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:06.480
it was the same tools used to make
violin strings, instrument strings

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.610
and medical supply, and when the
war started his family managed

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:16.690
to run away, but Jacob Hackert
[phonetic]was caught by the Nazis,

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.640
later on deported to
Auschwitz and he was killed

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.860
on the 22nd of May, 1944.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.290
We have some of his
instruments who survived,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:31.740
we have the first violin he ever
made, in Milkou, still in 1906,

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.800
there is a cello of his, we do
know of some other instruments.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.680
We have some photo of his in his
workshop and there is a very,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.200
very beautiful miniature violin
about this big, which he made.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.020
The made the violin, the bow which
you can actually use, and the case,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.700
and this is a very, very unique
and very beautiful instrument

00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:01.070
and I can show you the level
of scale of Mr. Hackert.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:07.760
Now, we have another violin
maker, his name is Einstein,

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:14.040 position:56%
he worked in Germany, in Istanbul as
well and later on moved to New York,

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:19.520
but these are the only three makers
that we know, and unlike many

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.540
of the Jewish violinist, they
are considered to be very small

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:36.340 position:56%
and not many people know about them.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.860
&gt;&gt; Hannah Tarley: So, I
just wanted to say first

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.450
of all how -- is it this one?

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.730
Or is it -- No, this one, how happy
I am to be here and it's just,

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.380
it's amazing being a
part of this project,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.810
it's been an incredible experience.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.400 position:56%
And every time I hear these stories,
and then when I have to go up

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.670
and play, I kind of have to compose
myself because, it takes a second

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.430
to sort of, take all of this
in and to hear these stories,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.870
and I got goosebumps
and as I go, "OK,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.440
I actually have to play this now".

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.670
When we talk about playing violins
and very often, when you think

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.160
about violin or music in general,
it's about presenting your voice,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.090
it's about singing and it's
about whatever unique --

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.500
whatever is unique about you
and about your instrument.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.090
That is what you're
putting together,

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:31.340
and with these violins I feel
like that is especially true,

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.780
when I play them, when
they're talked about,

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.730
it's really very special
to talk about the voices

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.800
that are being presented here.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.030
And the fourth pieces, the
fourth extra step that I'm going

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.990
to be playing for you
today, I feel really show

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.830
that in sort of, the best way.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.320
So, the first piece that
I'm going to play is

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.510
by Rachmainov [phonetic]
and it's the Vocalise.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:37:11.510
[ Music ]

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:31.060
[ Applause ]

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; From what we know, most of the
German violin makers and bow makers,

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.950
were not in the Nazi party.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.230
Many of them, of course
had Jewish lines,

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.480
some of them even helped
Jewish people either

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.120
by buying the instruments
from them, --

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.570
this way providing them some
money so they can escape,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:57.820
or even hiding them at home; but,
as you can see here on this violin,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.490
somewhere Nazi sympathizer.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:05.000
This violin, which was
actually bought a few years ago

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.510
by a violin maker around here,
from Washington DC, he bought it

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:16.320
and his initial thought was to take
the violin, do some reparation,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.520
probably sell it and when he
opened the violin, he saw this,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:28.520
"Hail Hitler, 1936" with this very
strong and aggressive swastika.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.620
His first feeling was to
take the violin and burn it,

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.030
and then he did what most
of us would do today,

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:40.100
opened up his computer,
went to Google, and somehow,

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:44.610
he managed to find us, he gave
a call to my father and ask him

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.960
if he would like to have this
violin in our collection.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:53.340
He said immediately yes, and he
was so kind and sent it over to us,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.840
and this is one of the various
small amounts of instruments

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.780
which will never be repaired
and will stay as it is,

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.120 position:56%
to show what people could have done.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.700
When we take a closer
look on the violin,

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.360
there was no reason to repair it.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.910
When the guy opened it, in 1936
he didn't do any reparation,

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.060
there are no cracks; there are
no pieces which were replaced.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.110
The only reason he
opened this violin was

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:29.050
to write this horrible thing,
and then later he closed it,

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:33.320
tried to give it back to the
owner or sold it, we have no idea.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.400
We couldn't locate the name of
the guy, his initials are A.D,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.360
but we couldn't find his name in
any of the dictionaries and any

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.190
of our books, we don't know what
his name is, we know it's coming

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:51.000
from Germany, but that's it.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.590
Many of the German makers who
were some of the leading makers

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.960
of the time, after the
war people didn't want

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.720
to play on their instruments.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:08.290 position:56%
Many of the Jewish players either
sold or destroyed their instruments,

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:13.440
and only today, after so many
years they start getting again the

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.230
recognition that they used
to have, those German makers,

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.450
have been really some of the
leading makers of the time

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.180
and people today are still
looking for these instruments

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.460
and when Daniel Schmidt, when he
came into our workshop in Israel

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.050
and he saw the collection and he
saw these beautiful German-made

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:38.090
instruments, he was quite
shocked because this instruments,

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.190
you could not find in
Germany in this time.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:46.610 position:56%
It was very rare to see them and
many of them they were in a way lost

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:51.300
in Germany, and only today people
start understanding the quality

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.900
and how good makers most
of these people were.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.550
&gt;&gt; This next violin has
a very unique story.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.950
This violin was played in the
Men Orchestra in Auschwitz.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.880
Auschwitz as you know was
one of the biggest camps,

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.570
it had about eight orchestras,
there were men orchestra,

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:31.710
there was the women orchestra,
which was led by Alma Hauset.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:36.940 position:56%
Alma managed to save all the players
of the orchestra, they all survived,

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:41.640
but unfortunately a few
months before the war ended,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.120
she passed away, either
from poisoning

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.820
or from typhus, nobody knows.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.050
There are so many stories
about her orchestra but one

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:55.100
of the most interesting one is,
there was an inspection of mangle

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.290
in the hospital, and as you
know most of the people who went

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:04.350 position:56%
to the hospital was kind of a one
way trip, and many of them were sent

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:09.640
to death, and he was going around
and he saw this very sick lady

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.310
and he asked, "Why is she still
here, why is she still alive?",

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.500
and the people said, "Well, she's
part of the Women Orchestra",

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.770
he said just "OK", and he
went to the next patient.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:29.440
She was -- she had this kind of
halo, of someone who was respected,

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.060
and from what we know today
she was the only person

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.430
that the Germans called in her
name, they would call her --

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.920
they would address to her as "Frau
Hauset [phonetic], Mrs. Hauset",

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.990
the only person we know was
actually called by name.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:50.650
Auschwitz had the men orchestra
who played very close to the

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.720
"Arbeit Macht [phonetic] Frei"
sign, they would play every day

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.800
in the morning when the
Englands would go out to work,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.480
and in the evening when
they would come back.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.300
They would pile the dead just
in front of the orchestra.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:09.730
Many people who played in this
camp couldn't play afterwards;

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:15.880
they couldn't have the
power to play an instrument

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.520
after seeing everything they
used to see while playing.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.120
There were people and there are
stories about people playing

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.500
on the way to the gas chambers,
they would see their families sent

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.310
to the gas chambers, they would lay

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:33.810
down their instruments
and join their families.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:38.750
The Nazis used music
also as a deception tour.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.450
When the trains would arrive

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.820
to the kangs [phonetic] there
would be a small orchestra playing,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.950
and we heard some testimonies
of survivors saying

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.350
that when they were going out from
the train, sometimes after days

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:56.090
and days stuffed in a cattle
wagon with no food and no water,

00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:00.080
and no sanitary, and no break
and with many deads inside,

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.760
they would go out and
they would hear music.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.280
And they would actually
think to themselves, "Well,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.360
if there is music here,
how bad can it be?"

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:15.190
And of course, they learned very,
very fast how bad it could be.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:22.770 position:56%
And this violin, which we got two
years ago, we were told that the guy

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.930
who brought it - the father of
the person who brought it to us,

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.720
he was a soldier in
the Jewish brigade,

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:34.250
and after the war he was going
around and trying to help survivors

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:37.400
to get papers and start
their lives again.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.910
He met a survivor and the guy
told him he said, "Listen,

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:43.410
I have nothing on,
my family's killed,

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.220
I have nothing left,
only this violin.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.240
Would you please buy it from me?"

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.940
He bought it for $50, which was
more than ten times the price

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:57.350
of an instrument of this kind,
and he hoped that his son,

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.650
who had just born, will
hopefully one day play the violin.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.710
Unfortunately, he never did and
three years ago when he heard

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:09.070
about our project,
he brought it to us

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.700
and since then this violin was
played in all of our concerts,

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.910
sometimes by the soloist,
sometimes by the concert maestro.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:22.390 position:56%
The concert maestro of Cleveland
Symphony played it and it was played

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:26.210
in the concert of Berlin by
the soloist guy Bernstein,

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.580
and lately by the soloist
Alexei Kenyu [phonetic],

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.050
you know her concert in
Jacksonville, Florida,

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.350
and today you'll hear it now.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, the next piece that I'm going

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.260
to play is a movement,
from a partite by Bach.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.960
And when you're learning
pieces, you know,

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.790
when you're learning new
material it's mostly always

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.970
about what did the composer want?

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.290
What was the composer
thinking about?

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.380
What was going on in his life?

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.630
And that's -- as students and as
teachers, that's always something

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.870
that we're thinking about the
most, what came from the original,

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.620
where is this music coming from?

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:20.130
But I feel like today, with this
room and these violins we have

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.560
to change that a little bit, and
today it's not about the composers,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.030
it's about the instruments, and
it's about how the instrument wants

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.890
to play a certain piece, and I

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:34.160
of course will help the
instrument, show it's voice.

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:38.010
But in a way, I think that
makes it very special,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:40.590
because you communicate
the instrument

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:46.920
on a whole different level, so,
this would be a movement from Bach.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.690
&gt;&gt; This next violin has
a very interesting story.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:16.600
Fibal Veilenger [phonetic],
who was a Romanian Jew,

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.540
and when the war started
he was deported with tens

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.150
of thousands other Jewish people

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:26.170
to Ameria cult [phonetic],
on Istria in Romania.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:30.230
They were sent there
by the government,

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.110
knowing that they won't
have enough means

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:36.560
to survive, as food and supplies.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.080
And many tenths of
thousands of them passed away.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.630
When Fiber arrived with his family

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:47.860
and his one-and-a-half-year-old
daughter, Helen, she was so weak

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.340
that she couldn't even cry anymore.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:57.570
He arrived to the place and he me
a judge who knew him from before.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:01.360
The judge knew that he was a
violinist and he told him, "Listen,

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.740
I have this violin, this very
precious old Italian instrument,

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.260
made by Amati.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:10.640
Would you please take it,
maybe if you have some work,

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.680
of you can play a little
bit you'll earn something,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.290
maybe you can share it
with me and my sister".

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:21.100
Fibal [phonetic] of course was
very grateful, he took the violin

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.060
and after his first work, where
he would get the leftovers

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.780
of the party, he went
back to the judge's house,

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.280
but he said that it was too late.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.620
A few days before that,
the judge and his sister

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.900
who couldn't bare it anymore,
hang themselves and died.

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:42.290
Fibal kept the violin
for a long time,

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:46.490
playing around for the
villagers in small events,

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:52.330
and his payout would be some
leftover food, some firewood

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:58.360
and this way he managed to keep
his family of 16 people, alive.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.980
A while later the police heard
that he had this precious violin,

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.550
and they came over
and gave him a choice,

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.290
"Either you give us the violin
or we take away your family."

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:15.940
He didn't hesitate and gave them
the Amati violin, and days later

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.730 position:56%
when one of the villagers found area
around they came to him and said,

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.840
"Would you please come and play in
my daughter's wedding?", he said,

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:27.630
"I would love to do that
but I have no instrument".

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:29.800
The guy said, "Well,
that's not a big problem,

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.760 position:56%
come with me, we will find you one".

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.930
They went to the villages around
and they found his violin.

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:42.410
Fibal took it, he insisted on
paying later on the guy back,

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.250
he played of course in his
daughter's wedding and in many,

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:50.010
many other places, and this way
he managed to gather enough food

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:55.390
and supply, and him and his 16
family members survived the war.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:58.240
When they came back to Israel
- after they arrived to Israel

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.970
after the war, fiber would
take his violin every day out,

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:08.720 position:56%
play on it until his little daughter
Helen would survive all the stories

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.540 position:56%
and all the things that he was going

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.850
through with this instrument,
and before that.

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:19.380
Years later, when Fibal
was 90 years old,

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.950 position:56%
his daughter asked him what he
would like to have for his birthday,

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.390
he said, "I would like
to play my friend again".

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.250
He wouldn't call the
violin "my violin",

00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:28.950
he would call it "my friend".

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:35.220
Helen came to my father
and we saw the instrument,

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.800
it was in a very poor condition,
a very simple instrument.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.570 position:56%
We offered her maybe to take another
violin for her father to play on,

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:47.290
and when he heard the offer he
said, "You don't understand,

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:51.250
this is not just a
violin, he's my friend.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.100
I want to play on this violin".

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:59.460 position:56%
She came back to us, she told us
the story, when he purred the violin

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.640
and he got it back when
he was 90 years old,

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.840
smiling like a little child.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.490
He would take it out every
day, play on it, talk to it,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:13.310
he couldn't really play much,
he was very old, very sick,

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:18.060
but he would sit down and talk to
the violin and tell it stories.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.660
And a few years ago, after
unfortunately passed away,

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:25.050
we got the violin from
Helen and we have it

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.450
in out collection since then.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:44.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, this next piece will be by
one of my favorite composers, Vojak,

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.740
and this is actually one of his
-- he has three pieces for violin,

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:50.990
it's like three -- it's
a ballad, a nocturnal --

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:53.830
this part I'm going to
play part of the ballad.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.980
And of course, this is, again, this
is singing with the instrument,

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.930
this is bringing out the
voice of the instrument

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:03.150
and really connecting my voice
with the instrument's voice.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:08.600
And I really love the story
about this man and the violin

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.460
that was his friend, I think it's
such a touching story and it kind

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.850
of gets me every time I hear it.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.190
So, this is Vojak and
hopefully the violin and I,

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:19.910 position:56%
we're going to be friends right now.

today, we have this violin.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:30.910
As you can see there's a
very big Star of David,

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:34.410
and this violin was done in
Schrenbach [phonetic] a place

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.430
which was - I think it was a part

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:41.560
of the Czech Republic during
some time before the war, yes.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:48.770
And in this area they
made many instruments,

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.020
some of them were decorated,
some with Star of David,

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:57.020
some with crosses, some
with other ornaments,

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.310
they used to sell them
around Europe.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:03.050
Many were played by gypsies -- not
the ones with the star of David

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:07.820
but others, and they would play
them, and then someone would come

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:11.770 position:56%
and they would say, "Oh it's such a
beautiful violin, he would tell them

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:14.680
like a story, and he would
ask, "Can I buy the violin?"

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.850
and he's like "No, it's
my great-grandfather is

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.930
and blablabla blablabla",
take a really high price,

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:23.340
sell the violin two minutes
later till his son would came,

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:28.750
"OK bring me the next one",
and they would go on like that.

to the Bielski [phonetic] family.

both with 11 brothers and sisters,

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.240
and then -- and only one
uncle survived the war.

father's side, were all killed.

have seen the movie "Defiance",

taste of the story,

how it was, and him

conditions, surrounded by Germans

01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:36.300
and many other people who
were all the time trying

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.820
to have them arrested and killed.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:45.080 position:56%

would also save many, many people.

- after they were liberated,

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.820
he joined Russian army and
later was killed in Germany,

and later on moved to the States,

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.160
and one of their recent comers to
Washington DC, that I'm sure some

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.840
of you all know, Gerard
Bushnell, both his grandmother

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.450
and grandfather were saved
by the Bielsky partisans.

grandmother in Haipha [phonetic],

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:24.450 position:56%
the only - the bedtime stories would
be the stories of the partisans.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:30.340
I heard them since I was a little
child and, unlike my mother's side

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:32.310
of the family, my father's side --

01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:37.160
my grandmother and my grandfather
never spoke a single word

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.100
about their family,
about what was going on.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.830
They arrived [inaudible], in
1938, before the war and none

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:53.490
of the uncles or our aunts, none
of them survived except for one.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:58.350
So, this is the last violin for
today, I hope you enjoyed it,

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:03.620
we'll have time for questions
if anyone has and we hope now

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:09.180
that we are trying to have
this big project to go

coming to presentations very
similar to what we have today.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.020
They would hear the
stories, listen to the music

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.810
because in a way it's a very unique
project, you can hear a story,

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:43.340
you can hear the violins,
they would come afterwards

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:49.650
and they would see the violin
up in person, ask questions and,

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:54.120
it's something we cannot really
understand the holocaust.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:59.250
Nobody has ever seen 6
million people together.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:02.610
But when you're talking
about individual stories,

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:06.750
individual people, coming from
one place, going to another place,

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.250
managing to survive somehow,
to live yet another day,

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:15.130
it gives you in a way a
different perspective of a time

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:18.530
that maybe one day we'll
be able to understand

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:22.610
and hopefully we would never
have to experience again.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:37.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, the last piece that I will be
playing today will be two movements,

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:42.130
two dances basically, from Vartax
[phonetic] Romanian dancers

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.430
or folk dancers.

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:47.390
And I just thought that in this
violin -- this is a custom violin,

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:50.920
yes this is the custom violin
I just thought to play it

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.460
with folk dances would be
an appropriate kind of duet.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.960
&gt;&gt; Now we have time
for a few questions.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.260
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.560
&gt;&gt; And repeat the question.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.860
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for --
this has totally worked for me,

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:04.510 position:56%
what you're doing and I wanted to --

[ Applause ]

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.640
&gt;&gt; I have a comment and a question,

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.070
my first comment was
I have a friend,

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.560
who's a very accomplished
violin teacher

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.510
and he has a great story
that I wanted to share.

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:21.950
His teacher [inaudible] and
he was hiding in an attic,

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:26.730
and the Russians found
him, they broke his violin

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:29.630
and then they would kill him.

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.040
And then he started
played Tchaikovsky.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.490
And -- I'm sorry I'm crying,
but the violin saved his life.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:39.390
I wanted to tell you that story.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:43.780
My question is, is there any hope
for the stolen goods, you know,

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:45.170
tracing back stolen goods that,

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:51.280
whoever get that Amanti
[phonetic] that you talked about?

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.100
&gt;&gt; Well, the question was about
trying to recover instruments, so,

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:01.960
the main problem is that when
the Nazis confiscated musical

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.820
instruments and violins in
particular, the data would go,

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:13.800
"violin, made out of wood,
color, whatever" and that's it.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.570 position:56%
Unlike a painting that you say, the
woman standing with the flower vase,

01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:22.800
with the window behind it,
it's almost impossible to trace

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.550
because there were
so many instruments

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:27.510 position:56%
which were made, very, very similar.

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:29.980
Most of them like we said before,

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:36.370
they are not from the important
makers, and unfortunately,

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:38.590
I don't think we can locate then.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:42.750
There was a woman who was trying
to locate a few instruments.

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:47.160
I don't know, as far as I know,
she couldn't manage to find them.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.930
And it's very, very hard
to try to trace them

01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:52.960
because there is not
enough data basically.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.390
&gt;&gt; How would you compare the
wood, the selection of wood,

01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:00.860 position:56%
between these various instruments --

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:05.580
&gt;&gt; Well, the wood, which we use
for violins, the top is always made

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:10.700
out of spruce, the
ribs, back and scrawl,

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.030 position:56%
usually the instruments you see here
and most of the instruments are made

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:17.630
out of maple -- flamed maple.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:21.400
Sometimes out of birch
wood and some very few

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.700
out of different other woods,
which are grown up in Italy,

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.910 position:56%
but most of the instruments -- I
would say even more than 90 percent,

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:33.120
the ribs, back and
scrawl are made of maple.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.760
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you for
taking the trouble to come,

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.630
I'd like to talk tackalist
because the violins would teach,

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:48.810
when Isaac Vermont -- when
Isaac Roban was alive --

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.320
&gt;&gt; Isaac Stern

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.620
[ Crosstalk ]

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:59.240
&gt;&gt; There are teachers -- the great
violinists who teach they also,

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:08.360
as you know from Dick Pavlavoni and
other people, are very generous.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.770
You need to ask them to
adopt this project --

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:19.640
&gt;&gt; Well, let me -- let me tell you
one thing, Isaac Pearlman was born

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.800
in a street behind our workshop.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.270
His first violin that he ever
got was from my grandfather,

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:29.690
they made now a documentary
about him

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:31.670
and he's playing the
Auschwitz violin,

01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:34.880
he played the "Schindler's
List" on that for the movie.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.580
He does know the project;
hopefully he will take part of it.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:40.880
What do you say?

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.530
&gt;&gt; They have called all of the
great collectors of this country.

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.830
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:47.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And worked with them on projects.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.810
But this one is very special,
because I don't know a school

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:54.820
in the country that would
not want to participate.

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.380
And as the founding Vice Chairman

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:01.060
at the holocaust division we know
what this and what it's about.

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:06.110
And as you know from what you have
said already, the level of pedagogy

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:12.850
of kids absorbing when they see the
real thing, is a million percent.

01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:16.220
&gt;&gt; Yes, because they passed
it up and they tweet it

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.530
and get it communicated
very, very well and fast.

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:24.800
&gt;&gt; My major point is that these
violins are what I would call a

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.430
precious legacy of those who
owned it and didn't survive.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:35.240
Will live on and teaching
that no one can do otherwise.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.540
&gt;&gt; This is our main hope --

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:41.040
&gt;&gt; Your labor is what you have
done already, and it seems to me

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.580
that those who have
the possibilities

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.830
to really help you
will do it and fast.

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:49.630

your recommendation with me

and I will share it with the people
that I'll be touring with because --

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.540
I don't know any of them yet

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.800

be very interested to --

I'll give you a card gladly,

Yes.

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:49.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I know it's hard to generalize
but the majority of the instruments,

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:55.550
what type of shape were they in
before restoration and was most

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:56.850
of varnish remain intact?

01:14:56.850 --> 01:15:01.010
&gt;&gt; Well, the question was,
what was the condition

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:07.320
of the instruments when we got it.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:13.850
Well, some instruments they
were in very poor condition,

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:17.450
you could see that some of
them were played outside,

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.380
where the varnish of
the top was gone.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:25.260
Basically, the only thing which
would stay would be the color.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:30.000
Some of them were broken to pieces,
we have one which is so badly done

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.900
and so poorly paired that we left
it as it is so people can see

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:44.290
that they had to so everything
they could just in order to be able

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:48.630
to play another day and
hopefully survive another day,

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:53.890
even if it meant to repair
the instruments in a way

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:57.540
that they would never
think of doing before,

01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:00.250
but they actually had
no other choice.

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:01.550
&gt;&gt; Any other question?

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:02.850
Yes.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.430
&gt;&gt; You mentioned your grandfather
was a Bielsky [phonetic],

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:09.060
could you tell me the names of
the other two brothers involved

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:14.440
as the partisans and also, are any
Bielsky brothers still alive today?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.200

Bielsky was chosen

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.880
as the leader, he was the elder.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:28.200
And my grandfather was the head of
the fighting unit, Asoil Bielsky,

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:34.240

Zeus who was, he was the head

Zeuszia [phonetic].

was 13 years old, Pavel Bielsky;

a few concerts.

have two concerts in Birmingham,

have many people who are asking

for projects, we have
nothing finalized yet.

all the money and all the funds,

and then slowly, slowly
start touring on around.

of the Poland music program, and
you mentioned as a problem for --

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.460
and that's actually how we
got connected, they called me

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.820
and asked me if I wanted to
[inaudible] and they were like

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:29.210
"there's this project with these
violins from the holocaust,

01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:35.020
would you be in-" and I was like,
"Where do I go, when is happening?"

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.140
I'm from California originally,
I'm first generation American born,

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.670
my family is also from Russia,
Belorussia, Poland from this area

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:42.590 position:56%
and also the same sort of stories of
mom's side of the family were able

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:43.890
to get out like minutes
before the Germans came,

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.350
dad's side of the family where
like -- it's sort of a similar --

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.650
everybody I guess has
this mix in the families.

01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:48.320
At the moment, I live in New York
and I'm doing a master's degree

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.510
at Julliard school, so that why I
came from New York this morning.

01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:57.100
[ Applause ]

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.860
&gt;&gt; I've got one question for Amnon.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:03.350
How did you convince -- let
me say it into the microphone.

01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:07.690
How did you convince Avshalom
to also become a violin maker?

01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:11.890
I would love my son to have
gone to my husband's business

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:15.990
and it didn't work,
how did you do it?

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:23.200
&gt;&gt; First of all you should
ask how I am a violin maker.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.440
So, that's natural.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.620
I followed my father and
he's following his father,

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:30.350
that's it, very simple.

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:33.400
I wanted to add to the concert,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:40.480
one month from now we are doing
a project in Bucharest, Romania,

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.990
and February 18th we're going to do
something very special in Dachau,

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.490
in the concentration camp.

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:51.950
So, that's also on the
program that we have now.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:57.510
&gt;&gt; OK, no questions?

01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:04.260
[ Applause ]

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:15.070
&gt;&gt; Than you very much, we've had
an amazing program thank you Amnon,

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:18.280
Avshalom and Hannah for
giving us your time,

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:19.580
your challenge and your love.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.880
Thank you.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:22.280

of the library of congress.
