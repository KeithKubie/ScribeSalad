00:00:00.155 --> 00:00:03.826
- [Instructor] If the initial
condition is zero comma six,

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:08.288
what is the range of the solution
curve y is equal to f of x

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:12.052
for x is greater than or equal to zero?

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:14.858
So we have a slope field here,
for a differential equation.

00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:16.357
And we're saying, okay,
if we have a solution

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:18.378
where the initial condition
is zero comma six,

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:21.301
so zero comma six is
part of that solution.

00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:23.959
So let's see, zero comma six,

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:26.709
so this is part of the solution.

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:29.243
And we want to know the
range of the solution curve.

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:31.411
So solution curve, you
can eyeball a little bit

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.303
by looking at the slope field.

00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:34.965
So as x,

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:36.990
remember, x is gonna be
greater than or equal to zero,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.263
so it's going to include
this point right over here.

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:41.502
And as x increases, you
can tell from the slope,

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:43.630
okay, y is gonna decrease,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.294
but it's gonna keep decreasing
at a slower and slower rate.

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:50.564
And it looks like it's asymptoting

00:00:50.564 --> 00:00:53.277
towards the line y is equal to four.

00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:54.384
So it's gonna get really,

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:55.986
as x gets larger and larger, larger,

00:00:55.986 --> 00:01:00.134
it's gonna get infinitely
close to y is equal to four,

00:01:00.134 --> 00:01:02.352
but it's not quite gonna get there.

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:05.768
So the range, the y-values
that this is going to take on,

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:07.380
y is going to be greater than four.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.624
It's never gonna be equal to four.

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:13.214
So I'll do, it's going
to be greater than four.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.284
That's gonna be the
bottom end of my range.

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:18.274
And at the top end of my
range, I will be equal to six.

00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:20.900
Six is the largest value
that I am going to take on.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.067
Another way I could have written
this is four is less than

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.810
y is less than or equal to six.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.354
Either way, this is a way
of describing the range.

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:33.963
The y-values that the
solution will take on

00:01:33.963 --> 00:01:36.659
for x being greater than or equal to zero.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.940
If they said for all x's,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.902
well, then you might have
been able to go back this way

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.053
and keep going.

00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:45.116
But they're saying the
range of the solution curve

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:47.849
for x is greater than or equal to zero.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.779
So we won't consider those
values of x less than zero.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:53.932
So there you go, the curve
would look something like that.

00:01:53.932 --> 00:01:56.709
And you can see, the highest
value it takes on is six,

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.265
and it actually does take on that value

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:00.810
'cause we're including x equaling zero.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.617
And then it keeps going
down, approaching four,

00:02:03.617 --> 00:02:05.024
getting very, very close to four,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.524
but never quite equaling four.
