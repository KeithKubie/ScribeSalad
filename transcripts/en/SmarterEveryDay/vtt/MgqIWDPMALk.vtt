00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.803
- Hey, it's me Destin.

00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:02.780
Welcome back to Smarter Everyday.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.640
Today, we're in rural Tennessee

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.080
for an actual artillery competition.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.830
And if you learn anything from this truck

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.340
that's coming up behind me.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.510
This is pretty legit.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.090
There's dudes from all over the country

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.080
that have actual cannons

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.913
and we're gonna learn about them today.

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:18.650
Pretty sure this guy's gonna hit me.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.241
Anyway, I've got two high speed cameras.

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.770
We're gonna learn about
cannons of all types.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.017
Let's get smarter everyday.

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:26.600
(upbeat music)

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.970
Okay, this is Matt Brothers
and this is your land, right?

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.803
- That's correct.

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:33.050
- [Destin] And so those are
your chickens over there?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.280
- It is.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.400
- [Destin] What do they think about this?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.690
- Well, they're...

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.930
Hopefully won't get too alarmed,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.240
but they'll hopefully be alright.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.350
- So the question is.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.690
How does this happen?

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.673
You own this land.
- Right

00:00:44.673 --> 00:00:46.730
- And you just let people
come from all over to shoot?

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.970
- Well, yes.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.530
About 10 years ago a local roofer

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.931
who has a cannon that lives around here.

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.490
He came and roofed my mother's house.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.900
Saw the farm.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.670
Saw the potential for
being a wonderful place

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.060
to cure, safe to have
an activity like this.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.020
So he asked if he could do it

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.970
and I reluctantly said
yes, we'll give it a try.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.700
I found out that they're
very professional,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.110
they did a wonderful job organizing it

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.420
keeping everything safe and
just had a wonderful time

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.870
and we've done it ever since.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.703
- That's awesome.

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:17.660
So have you ever been scared
about anything happening

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.493
on your land or anything?

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:20.230
- No, I've been vary comfortable.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.030
Again, the first year, I
was a little skeptical.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.680
Cause I had no clue what they were doing.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.230
But once they showed me
what they were capable of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.980
and how they were able to manage it.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.380
No problem.
- That's awesome.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230
Well, thank you for doing
this with your land,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.063
I appreciate it.

00:01:33.063 --> 00:01:33.896
- You bet, Des.

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:35.270
- The interesting thing
about this shoot is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.630
there's two high speed cameras.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.500
The V2511, that I normally
use, ultra high-speed

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.280
but there's also the new camera, the V2640

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010
that I borrowed from Vision Research.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.260
It has a higher resolution chip on it,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.400
a sensor, so we're gonna
get a good trade off

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.450
between ultra high-speed
and beautiful imagery.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.430
Another interesting thing is,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.200
I get to explain those facts to people

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.340
that are dressed like
they're in the civil war.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.680
Yeah, guys, my name is Destin.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.910
We have the newest high-speed camera

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.800
in the country here,
actually, it's awesome.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.960
It's literally the best
footage you can get right now.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.040
After a quick meeting
about safety and a prayer,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.060
it was time to roll out the thunder.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.040
You know it's about to get real

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.054
when you're unloading the cannon.

00:02:10.054 --> 00:02:12.554
(banjo music)

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.410
Okay, here we go, this is awesome.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.243
Are you ready?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.167
Three, two, one fire!

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:39.776
(cannon fires)

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.276
(man mumbles)

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.400
- This is nuts.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.023
This is like stupid nuts.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.343
- [Man] That's pretty close.

00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:53.360
- Like all these, old gray-beard dudes,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.930
you've got the young guys doing the work,

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.090
you've got some high speed,

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.000
it's pretty rad.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.500
(banjo music)

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:01.881
- Whoa.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.690
Look at all the unburnt powder!

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.857
(cannon slowly fires)

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.398
(cannon fires)

00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:18.565
- [Man] Whooo!

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:20.594
- [Man] Fire!

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:21.552
(cannon fires)

00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:23.885
(man talks)

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:27.657
(cannon fires)

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.824
(cannon slowly fires)

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.423
- Right there.

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:43.114
- Oh wow, it's neat
- [Woman] Oh, look at that.

00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:43.947
(cannon fires)

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:46.658
(cannon fires)

00:03:46.658 --> 00:03:49.491
(people mumbling)

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.933
(cannon slowly fires)

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:04.400
(cannon fires)

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.733
(people cheer and clap)

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.037
(cannon slowly fires)

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:17.991
- Three second interval!

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.158
On my command!

00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:21.670
Fire!

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.771
(cannon fires)

00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.749
Two three fire!

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:25.665
(cannon fires)

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:27.931
One two three fire!

00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:28.764
(cannon fires)

00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:30.347
One two three fire!

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.053
- [Man] I shoulda got over there.

00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:35.002
(cannon fires)

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.252
(cannons slowly fires)

00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:03.031
(cannon fires)

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:07.313
- [Man] It hit the bottom left one again.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.253
- [Man] Fire!

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:12.560
(cannon fires)

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.136
(cannon slowly fires)

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.022
- [Man] Gun number seven, prepare to fire!

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:22.855
Fire!

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:25.849
(cannon fires)

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:26.817
- [Man] Keep going.

00:05:26.817 --> 00:05:27.650
- [Destin] Whoa!

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.440
(laughs)

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.400
Wow, I'm glad we were clear!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.910
I'm really glad we were cleared back

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.090
cause that went a long ways!

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.416
That's like 20 feet!

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:38.749
(men grunt)

00:05:39.952 --> 00:05:42.313
- [Man] Number 4, fire!

00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:44.010
(cannon fires)

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.860
- These videos are amazing to me.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.840
There's a lot of mechanics
going on that my brain

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.230
really likes to hone in on.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.560
There's two things in particular

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.900
I want to focus on with you.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.190
Number one, the gun carriage itself.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.860
That's the wooden structure,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.080
the wheels and all that
stuff around the gun.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.990
These are reproductions made by the Amish.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.681
But the people that
originally designed these.

00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:04.510
I have to believe that
they would love to watch

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.320
slow motion of that gun
carriage absorbing the recoil

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.530
of the cannon itself.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.640
I mean, here we are in the modern world,

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.620
we get to watch it just for fun.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.540
But back in the day, think
about what the person

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.410
that designed that would be thinking about

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.186
as they watched this in slow motion.

00:06:20.186 --> 00:06:23.353
(cannon slowly fires)

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.890
The second thing I want to look at,

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.270
specifically on this video,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.370
are the shock waves.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.580
Now a really easy way
to see the shock wave

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.650
is just observing the grass
out in front of the barrel.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.424
If you look you can see
there's this spherical

00:06:41.424 --> 00:06:44.510
wave-front that propagates over the ground

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.510
and you can see how the grass behaves

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.538
out in front of the cannon.

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:50.705
(cannon slowly fires)

00:07:04.108 --> 00:07:07.275
(cannon slowly fires)

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.470
Another way to look at shock
waves is something called

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.840
fast-frame differencing.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.840
What you do is take one layer of video

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.930
and put another layer
of video on top of it

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.310
and then offset it by a frame or two.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.160
What you can do then,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.830
is set up a blending
mode called difference,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.300
which basically only shows you
the pixels that are different

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.370
from the one below it.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.710
It's a pretty interesting
technique that people use

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.980
all the time to detect motion for example

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.980
in like a webcam or something like that.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.434
Anyway, if you use this
fast-frame differencing

00:07:43.434 --> 00:07:46.060
algorithm, technique,
whatever you want to call it,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.570
in this particular case,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.640
you can see the reflected shock wave

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.680
bounce up off the ground and
what's neat to me is that

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.850
that reflected shockwave
doesn't exactly look spherical.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.920
You have to look very close.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.410
There's not a lot of pixels
here showing you what's going on

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.170
but it almost looks like
that reflected shockwave

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.680
is an ellipse because it's
kinda being influenced

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.350
by all that expanding gas
coming out of the cannon.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.620
So I was trying to work up the nerve

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.700
to see if they would
let me fire one myself,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.090
and then I saw this one.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.120
And I was like that's me.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.650
I have to ask.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.603
There it is.

00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:18.202
(laughs)

00:08:18.202 --> 00:08:19.510
Here we go, Stan.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.223
Three, two, one,

00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:22.990
(cannon fires)

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.840
That was awesome.

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:26.935
It's not as hard of a pull
as I thought it would be.

00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:27.768
- [Man] No.

00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:29.270
That's why everybody does this,

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.868
and they usually end up popping it off.

00:08:30.868 --> 00:08:32.083
- [Destin] So you just rotate?

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:33.970
- That's all you need to do.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.803
- That's awesome!

00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:36.670
Thank you for letting me do that.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.837
(cannon slowly fires)

00:08:52.587 --> 00:08:55.754
(cannon slowly fires)

00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:05.948
(cannon slowly fires)

00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:20.546
(cannon slowly fires)

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.350
This stuff is interesting
to observe and think about.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.620
I mean, there's a lot of
dynamic things going on here,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.960
but at the end of the day,
these were weapons of war

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.100
which is pretty intense to think about.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.110
For example, listen to this gentlemen

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.340
explain canister round to me.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.800
It's pretty sobering.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.470
- The easiest way I can
describe it for this gun here.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.910
It'd look like a 24 oz beer can.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.690
With a powder charged
attached to the back of it

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.110
and you'd have to have
about 30 iron balls in it.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.340
And they were all about the
size of a 20 mm projectile.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.540
Now the reason they used iron and not lead

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.450
is because lead flattens out
when it hits something solid

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.950
like a breast plate or a spine or a hip.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.780
Iron goes right through you,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.000
right through the man standing
behind you in the rear rank.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.950
Hits the ground 20 yards behind you

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.827
skips up and goes through the next wave.

00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:18.930
- Gotcha.
- From behind you.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.800
It was not uncommon

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.170
- So it can go against formations.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.100
- It was not uncommon
that one round of canister

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.800
can take out 40 guys with one shot.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.060
- So Hunter is about to
shoot a canister round

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.943
which is what?

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.770
- It's got 58 caliber balls.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.323
I don't know how many, exactly.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.640
Packed in saw dust.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.473
- [Destin] Gotcha.

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:39.110
So this is gonna make a mess.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.700
And you're gonna make
a mess out of that hill

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.596
right over there.

00:10:41.596 --> 00:10:42.429
- It's what we're trying to.

00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.262
- [Destin] Okay.

00:10:43.262 --> 00:10:44.190
Awesome, sounds good.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.273
- [Man] Fire!

00:10:45.273 --> 00:10:47.451
(cannon fires)

00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:50.534
(rounds slowly fire)

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.400
- Canister rounds are not a joke.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.790
That is some serious stuff.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.110
What is funny, though,
is every time I caught

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.830
a civil war soldier
using their cell phone.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.845
Which I'll show you right after I eat.

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:03.678
(beep)

00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:04.620
Yeah, that was as rad as it looks.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.980
Okay, so that was the first
video on civil war cannons.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.270
I want to do one on how to ignite them.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.800
That pull-string, how that thing works.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.670
And also there's a special
one called a whitworth.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.520
I want to talk about that.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.970
But, I want to say thanks to
the sponsor of this video,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.050
which is Hello Fresh.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.720
Tonight is peppercorn steak night

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.330
which was my request.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.860
Hello Fresh is a really cool service.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.458
They will send food directly to your house

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:28.820
with a full-on recipe for
how to make everything

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.350
and the perfect amount of
ingredients that you need.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.740
We are cooking more and we love it.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.520
Tonight we have a meal for two.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.353
That's kind of a nice thing, isn't it?

00:11:36.353 --> 00:11:37.186
- [Woman] It is nice.

00:11:37.186 --> 00:11:38.710
- [Destin] We don't
get that very often, so

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.200
we're cooking and we're
about to eat a meal together.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.482
Which feels like date night.

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:43.985
I'm going to be honest here,

00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:45.317
we don't get to do that very often.

00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:46.150
What happened?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.010
- [Woman] I started the potatoes.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.957
- [Destin] Oh sweet,

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:50.460
that means we're doing
the peppercorn thing.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.583
- Yes.

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:52.416
- [Destin] Yes!

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:53.890
(knocking)

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.760
They send food directly to your house

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.690
with perfect, pre-measured ingredients.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.350
Things you would never think to purchase

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.610
like truffle oil,

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.950
like special mushrooms and
stuff, it's pretty cool.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.874
You get to figure out how to
cook this stuff by reading

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:06.730
this cool recipe card.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.190
It's a step by step instruction.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.560
It's almost like replicating
somebody's experiment in a lab.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.680
It's pretty simple stuff.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.630
The sauces are what really amaze me

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.670
because I don't really
know how to make 'em.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.810
But if you followed the recipe,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.790
you end up making a fancy sauce.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.623
It's really good.

00:12:19.623 --> 00:12:22.300

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:38.220
(beep)

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.500
I totally like catching these reenacters

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.770
with their cell phones

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.190
because they get really embarrassed

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.000
and they try to hide it and stuff.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.780
So is this the kind of
field comms that they had

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.613
in the civil war?

00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:48.748
- Yeah, I was like whoops,
let me hide this cell phone!

00:12:48.748 --> 00:12:49.581
(laughs)

00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:50.414
- Go ahead.

00:12:50.414 --> 00:12:53.590
It's a little strange,
seeing you in your garb

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.492
holding up a cell phone camera, sir.

00:12:55.492 --> 00:12:57.033
- Yeah, well.

00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:57.866
Can't help it.

00:12:57.866 --> 00:12:58.788
That's the way it is.

00:12:58.788 --> 00:12:59.621
(laughs)

00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.115
- Get us while we're still alive, man.

00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:03.410
- [Destin] I'm gonna be
honest with you, sir.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.210
You've got the period piece going on

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.463
and then you got this little lounge chair,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.163
what's going on here?

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.236
- This is actually the 1862 model.

00:13:11.236 --> 00:13:13.408
(laughs)

00:13:13.408 --> 00:13:16.580
- [Man] Tell me when we
get to the right spot.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.620
- [Destin] What'd you say?

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.037
- Assisted living bus dropped us off

00:13:20.037 --> 00:13:22.134
and didn't tell us what to do!

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:22.990
(laughs)

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.400
- [Destin] It looks like
you're on a cannon crew, today.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.920
If this video earned your subscription

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.880
that's really cool!

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.750
If not, that's also cool.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.620
I'm Destin,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.720
I hope you enjoyed this.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.090

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.923

00:13:33.923 --> 00:13:34.756
Bye.
