Android applications can integrate

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
Android applications can integrate
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.390
Android applications can integrate
features and data from other

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
features and data from other
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.640
features and data from other
applications they can also use all of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
applications they can also use all of
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.570
applications they can also use all of
the hardware sensors on the device

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
the hardware sensors on the device
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.300
the hardware sensors on the device
including GPS compass accelerometer and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
including GPS compass accelerometer and
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980
including GPS compass accelerometer and
the camera and of course they can also

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
the camera and of course they can also
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779
