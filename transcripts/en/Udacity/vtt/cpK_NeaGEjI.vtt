00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.410
Great job.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.930
Let's review what we've
done in this lesson.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.510
First, we made an interactive
prototype using InVision.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.950
Second, we changed it in reaction
to our first round of feedback.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.020
Next, we shared it with subject
matter experts and users.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.620
Finally, we got feedback using
our interactive prototype.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.260
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson, we'll talk
about how to bring your prototype to

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.720
an engineer to think
about getting it built.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.150
We'll also talk about how to continue to
iterate your prototype through the rest

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.620
of the process.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.350
Finally, we'll talk about
using your app prototype

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.660
to talk about your app with investors or
other people interested.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780
See you in Lesson Three.
