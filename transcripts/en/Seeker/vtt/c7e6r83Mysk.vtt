00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:08.460
Gulch, gulf, gull, gullibility- Oh it is here!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.500
JULES!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.080
Hey, everybody, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
Pop quiz: Can you remember how many animals
of each kind Moses took onto the ark?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.990
If your answer is two, think again.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.369
The correct answer is… zero.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.849
Moses didn’t actually take any animals onto
the ark, Noah did.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.640
If you didn’t catch the error, don’t worry,
you’re far from the first to miss it.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
In fact, a recent study in Psychology Press
notes that failing to register errors in questions

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840
like this happens all the time.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.050
In the study, participants were asked questions
that were both “distorted” with false

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.489
information, like the Moses example, and questions
that had no false information.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.430
The participants answered 35% of distorted
questions as if they were correct, even after

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.140
they were told to watch out for false information.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.090
But most of us do know that Noah was the one
who brought animals aboard the ark.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.440
So then why isn’t this prior knowledge enough
to detect the error?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.199
The study calls this phenomenon “knowledge
neglect,” which means that prior knowledge

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.860
about a topic doesn’t save us from falling
for semantic errors.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.040
Some have likened this to absentmindedness.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.900
Others may simply see it as being gullible
-- easily duped or cheated.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.001
The study also found that not only do people
often miss semantic errors like this, but

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.970
they also use the false information to answer
general questions later on.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.920
For example: if someone reads a statement
that incorrectly refers to a prune as a dried

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.540
date instead of a dried plum, that person
is more likely to think that prunes are dates

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.470
later on when they’re asked about it.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.820
In fact, we’re prone to accepting entirely
erroneous stories as truth, which can cause

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.400
us to believe in conspiracies, major myths
and fake news.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.200
So, if we’re an intelligent bunch here (which
we are), why is it that we’re prone to fall

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.810
for myths about vaccines causing autism and
the earth being flat?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.460
Just because we’re gullible doesn’t mean
we’re stupid...right?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.549
Exactly.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.780
Multiple factors encourage gullibility.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.930
Images for instance, play a powerful role
in giving credibility to messages.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.460
Studies found that pairing claims with photographs
increased the believability of a claim whether

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.460
it was true or not.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.759
We’re also more likely to believe information
if it’s told to us by someone we’re acquainted

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.110
with... even if that someone is a talking
head on a news program who we don’t personally

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.680
know, but have grown familiar with simply
by repeated exposure.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.860
Similar to how we grow familiar with a person,
we also grow familiar with a message.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.480
Studies found that the more we see or hear
a certain message and the more consistently

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.480
that message aligns with our beliefs, the
more inclined we are to believe it.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.400
Imagine having a bias against a certain person,
and then reading a headline condemning that

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.940
person for committing a crime.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.280
Whether it’s true or not, our mind already
recognizes that the message is both familiar

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.600
and consistent with previous thoughts, and
suddenly we’re one step closer to believing

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600
it.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.790
This tendency to interpret evidence in ways
that confirm our beliefs is known as confirmation

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.790
bias.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.680
These factors allow our minds to do less work
and take mental short cuts when processing.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.930
So, if you or someone you know has fallen
into a gullibility trap, how do you get out

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.930
of it?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.930
It’s not that easy.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.670
Because misinformation gets embedded in our
memory, retracting it is difficult as it would

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.069
leave gaps in a truth we’ve come to believe.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.160
We have to do more than focus on the right
facts.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.100
When we bring up the false information to
debunk the myth, we’re also providing another

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.420
opportunity for someone to become more familiar
with it and develop an even deeper conviction

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.980
for the misinformation.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.540
Instead of trying to compare misinformation
to the real story, we should focus solely

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.900
on the truth, using clear language and pictures
in the explanation, so it’s easier to process.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.100
Now that you know more about gullibility tricky
ways, consider yourself armed for the next

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.410
time you enter the arena of news headlines
and storytelling.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.650
Speaking of myths...how about clean coal?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
We have a video about why that might not be
a real thing, here.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.920
And be sure to visit our friends at Seeker
Stories!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.610
They’ve got a new video on the power of
Chile’s student resistance movement here.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.050
So, did you fall for the Moses on the ark bit?
