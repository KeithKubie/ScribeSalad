00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.956
- [Voiceover] Hello everyone.

00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:06.123
So what I would like to do
here, is talk about curvature.

00:00:07.076 --> 00:00:10.536
And, I've drawn on the X Y
plane here, a certain curve.

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:11.976
So this is our X-axis.

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:13.276
This is our Y-axis.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.075
And this is a curve running through space.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:16.493
And I'd like you to imagine that this

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:19.394
is a road of some kind,
and you are driving on it.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:20.718
And you are at a certain point,

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:22.378
so let's say this point right here.

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:25.710
And if you imagine, what it
feels like to drive along

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.568
this road, and where you need to have your

00:00:27.568 --> 00:00:29.948
steering wheel, you're turning
it a little bit to the right.

00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.178
Not a lot, because it's kind of

00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:33.431
a gentle curve at this point,
you're not curving a lot.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:34.812
But the steering wheel isn't straight,

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:36.333
you are still turning on the road.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.876
And now, imagine that your
steering wheel's stuck.

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:40.768
That it's not gonna move.

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:42.150
And however you're turning it,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.814
you're stuck in that situation.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.459
What's gonna happen, hopefully you're on

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:46.968
an open field or something,
because your car is

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:50.056
going to trace out some kind of circle.

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:50.889
Right?

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.655
You know your steering wheel
can't do anything different,

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.396
you're just turning it a certain rate,

00:00:56.396 --> 00:01:00.018
and that's gonna have you
tracing out some giant circle.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.818
And this depends on where you are, right?

00:01:01.818 --> 00:01:04.069
If you had been at a
different point on the curve,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.428
where the curve was rotating a lot,

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:08.853
let's say you were back a
little bit towards the start.

00:01:08.853 --> 00:01:12.208
At the start here, you have
to turn the steering wheel

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.141
to the right, but you're
turning it much more

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.851
sharply to stay on this part of the curve,

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.415
than you were to be on this
relatively straight part.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.550
And the circle that you draw
as a result, is much smaller.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.210
And this turns out to be a pretty nice way

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.357
to think about a measure, for just how

00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:30.365
much the curve actually curves.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:31.910
And one way you could do this,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.064
is you can think, "Okay,
what is the radius

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.233
of that circle, the circle you would trace

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.389
out if your steering wheel
locked at any given point.".

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.698
And if you kind of follow the point,

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:43.149
along different parts of the curve,

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.832
and see, "Oh, what's the different circle

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:46.539
that my car would trace out if

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.176
it was stuck at that point.".

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:50.533
You would get circles of
varying different radii.

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.369
Right?

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.620
And this radius actual
has a very special name.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.253
I will call this "R".

00:01:57.253 --> 00:02:00.713
This is called the "Radius of Curvature".

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:02.329
And you can kind of see how this is a good

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.829
way to describe, how much you are turning.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.398
You may have heard with a car,

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:11.939
descriptions of the turning radius.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.020
You know, if you have a car with a very

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.566
good turning radius, it's very small,

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.363
'cause what that means if you turned

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:17.803
it all the way you could trace out

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.440
just a very small circle.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.437
But a car with a bad turning radius,

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.202
you know, you don't turn very much at all,

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:25.304
so you'd have to trace
out a much larger circle.

00:02:25.304 --> 00:02:28.102
And, curvature itself isn't this "R".

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:30.984
It's not the radius of curvature.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.817
But what it is, is it's the reciprocal

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.067
of that, it's one over "R".

00:02:35.764 --> 00:02:38.093
And there is a special symbol for it.

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.847
It's kind of a "K", and I'm not sure in

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.645
handwriting I am going to distinguish

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:43.828
it from an actual "K", maybe
give it a little curly there.

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:45.767
It's the Greek letter Kappa.

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.253
And this is curvature.

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:48.704
And I want you to think for a second,

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:51.003
why we would take one over "R".

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.733
"R" is a perfectly fine description

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.706
of how much the road curves.

00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:57.261
But why is it that you would think

00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:01.360
one divided by "R", instead of "R" itself?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.507
And the reason basically, is you want

00:03:03.507 --> 00:03:05.759
curvature to be a measure
of, how much it curves

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.943
in the sense that, more sharp turns

00:03:07.943 --> 00:03:09.521
should give you a higher number.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.459
So, if you're at a point,
where you are turning

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.560
the steering wheel a lot, you want that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.580
to result in a much higher number.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.519
But, radius of curvature
will be really small,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.842
when you are turning a lot.

00:03:19.842 --> 00:03:21.549
But if you are at a point that's basically

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.093
a straight road, you
know, there's some slight

00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:25.067
curve to it, but it's
basically a straight road,

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:27.702
you want the curvature to
be a very small number.

00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:30.268
But in this case, the radius
of curvature is very large.

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:31.928
So it's pretty helpful to just have

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:34.761
one divided by "R", as the measure

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:38.849
of how much the road is turning.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.530
And, in the next video,
I am going to go ahead

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.912
and start describing a little bit more

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:45.350
mathematically, how we capture this value.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.045
'Cause as a loose
description, if you are just

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:49.506
kind of drawing pictures,
it's perfectly fine

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:50.690
to say, "Oh yeah, you
imagine a circle that's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.071
kind of closely hugging the curve,

00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:54.672
it's what your steering wheel would do

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:55.624
if you were locked.".

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:58.771
But in math, we will describe
this curve parametrically.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:01.357
It'll be the output of a
certain vector valued function.

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:04.169
And I wanna know how you
could capture this idea.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.105
This, one over "R" curvature
idea, in a certain formula.

00:04:08.105 --> 00:04:10.934
And that's what the next few
videos are going to cover.
