so I think it's really crucial that we

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939
so I think it's really crucial that we
 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.090
so I think it's really crucial that we
all understand what's going on under our

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100
all understand what's going on under our
 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.720
all understand what's going on under our
scalp because this is the mothership and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
scalp because this is the mothership and
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.790
scalp because this is the mothership and
and it would explain a lot of our

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800
and it would explain a lot of our
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.480
and it would explain a lot of our
behavior for example we don't have one

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
behavior for example we don't have one
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.700
behavior for example we don't have one
brain we have like three brains all

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
brain we have like three brains all
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.460
brain we have like three brains all
smushed under one scalp and none of them

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
smushed under one scalp and none of them
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.840
smushed under one scalp and none of them
disappeared you know they're just like

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
disappeared you know they're just like
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880
disappeared you know they're just like
Russian dolls one inside of another it's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
Russian dolls one inside of another it's
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700
Russian dolls one inside of another it's
like a relative you can't get rid of so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
like a relative you can't get rid of so
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.620
like a relative you can't get rid of so
and they're always arguing with each

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
and they're always arguing with each
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.300
and they're always arguing with each
other that's what I mean about conflict

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
other that's what I mean about conflict
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.179
other that's what I mean about conflict
in the brain for example the oldest

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
in the brain for example the oldest
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.010
in the brain for example the oldest
brain the brain stem is about I don't

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
brain the brain stem is about I don't
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.440
brain the brain stem is about I don't
know five hundred million years old and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
know five hundred million years old and
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.500
know five hundred million years old and
it's basic it's just made sure we you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
it's basic it's just made sure we you
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080
it's basic it's just made sure we you
know that we eat kill and made which is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
know that we eat kill and made which is
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299
know that we eat kill and made which is
really only useful if you're working at

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
really only useful if you're working at
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.610
really only useful if you're working at
Goldman Sachs so then on top of that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
Goldman Sachs so then on top of that
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.119
Goldman Sachs so then on top of that
maybe 250 million years ago we started

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
maybe 250 million years ago we started
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.180
maybe 250 million years ago we started
to get this this mammalian brain which

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
to get this this mammalian brain which
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.060
to get this this mammalian brain which
meant that we are we bonded with our

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
meant that we are we bonded with our
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430
meant that we are we bonded with our
young rather than ate them and then only

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
young rather than ate them and then only
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560
young rather than ate them and then only
about 500,000 years ago we got this

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
about 500,000 years ago we got this
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.779
about 500,000 years ago we got this
frontal thing and this is El Capitan oh

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
frontal thing and this is El Capitan oh
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969
frontal thing and this is El Capitan oh
this is the executive brain it's in

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
this is the executive brain it's in
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.760
this is the executive brain it's in
charge of attention awareness

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
charge of attention awareness
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160

strategical logical rational thought
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020
strategical logical rational thought
so you see why we're confused we got

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
so you see why we're confused we got
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450
so you see why we're confused we got
three brains all squished in here so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
three brains all squished in here so
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700
three brains all squished in here so
that's probably why you get women who

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
that's probably why you get women who
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800
that's probably why you get women who
like to UM who read Heidegger but also

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
like to UM who read Heidegger but also

want to screw the plumber it's a mess

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
want to screw the plumber it's a mess
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.870
want to screw the plumber it's a mess
now I'm not saying there's nothing we

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
now I'm not saying there's nothing we
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370
now I'm not saying there's nothing we
can do but it's just kind of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
can do but it's just kind of
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289
can do but it's just kind of
understanding who's in charge if there's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
understanding who's in charge if there's
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.520
understanding who's in charge if there's
nothing you can do about it because

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
nothing you can do about it because
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319
nothing you can do about it because

ourselves up with our own hormones it's
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.139
ourselves up with our own hormones it's
important again beside the brain to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
important again beside the brain to
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.569
important again beside the brain to
understand how our hormones work because

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
understand how our hormones work because

a hit in that one serotonin you know
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.340
a hit in that one serotonin you know
it's a feel-good chemical these people

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
it's a feel-good chemical these people
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.810

have to buy it over a counter so it's

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
have to buy it over a counter so it's
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.810

problem it's it's again a backlash from

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
problem it's it's again a backlash from
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470
problem it's it's again a backlash from
when we used to you know back in the

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480
when we used to you know back in the
 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.560
when we used to you know back in the
bush when we'd hunt for nuts or food and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570
bush when we'd hunt for nuts or food and
 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.210
bush when we'd hunt for nuts or food and
we get a mouthful right

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
we get a mouthful right
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.520
we get a mouthful right
and before we swallowed we get this hit

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
and before we swallowed we get this hit
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.370
and before we swallowed we get this hit
of dopamine which made us look for

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380
of dopamine which made us look for
 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.520
of dopamine which made us look for
reward for nuts for later on like I'll
