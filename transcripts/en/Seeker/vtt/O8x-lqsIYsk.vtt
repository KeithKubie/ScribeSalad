00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.410
Every time I drive home from work, I don’t
remember the drive, like I don’t.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.510
What the hell is going on?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.030
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.860
I know you’re just sitting there, but right
now your brain is buzzing a million miles

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.860
an hour.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.810
Doing the same thing every day, brushing your
teeth, driving to work, your brain just kind

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.090
of runs on autopilot.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.900
Our brains like routine, we like familiar
things.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.250
and a lot of routines wind up becoming part
of that autopilot mode.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.300
So how does that happen?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
How does your brain just turn into a zombie?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.999
There’s a lot going on when you switch from
autopilot to on mode. and different parts

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:38.550
of your brain control these different modes.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.460
Let’s look at two main brain regions.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.379
When you’re brain’s just on zombie mode
when you’re in, let's say, the elevator

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.199
on your way to work and you haven’t had
any coffee yet, your dorsal lateral striatum

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.230
pushed the 3rd floor button for you.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.799
But when you’re on goal-direct mode on vacation
in Hawaii on your way to go snorkeling your

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.999
dorsal MEDIAL striatum hits the lobby button.

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.820
Studies like one published in the journal
Neuron- show that the two areas of the brain,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.409
the dorsal lateral striatum and the dorsal
medial striatum work in tandem when learning

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.800
a new task and turning it into a habit.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170
When researchers looked at the activity of
neurons in rats learning to navigate a maze,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.020
they found that the dorsolateral striatal
neurons were particularly active at certain

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.259
points in the maze.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.820
Mostly whenever an action had to be performed
like stopping or turning.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.660
Which makes sense since these neurons play
a part in movement.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.890
The researchers found that these neurons’s
activity increased as the rats got better

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.590
at the maze and sort of leveled out after
a while.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.700
While on the other hand activity in the dorsal
medial striatum decreased as the rats got

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
better.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.109
Basically the better they learned the maze,
they less they had to think about it.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.100
So the maze sort of becomes muscle memory.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.850
And a study published in the journal Science
Communications found that a third region of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.810
the brain, the orbital frontal cortex (OFC),
shifts the gears between those two modes.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.520
But those aren’t the only areas of the brain
that helps you get a routine down.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.729
In one study published in the journal,Neuron
researchers found that the Rostrolateral prefontal

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.729
cortex (RLPFC), an area of neurons situated
in the front of your brain, keeps you on task

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.729
while you learn a routine.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.569
The researchers found that if they stimulated
this part of the brain while study participants

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.600
were focused on a task, they would make more
mistakes.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.460
The researchers found using fMRI techniques
that activity in this part of the brain goes

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.070
up and down as a participant worked their
way through a series of tasks.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.300
They think this is due to some uncertainty
they face as they make a choice.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.670
Apparently this part of the brain helps resolve
some of that uncertainty.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.670
So after we’ve learned a task, it becomes
routine and there’s no uncertainty.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.860
And other studies show that once you’ve
learned something, since there’s no more

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.300
uncertainty, you’re not making decisions
anymore.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.730
You basically do the same thing based on a
decision you’ve made many times before.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.190
And researchers think this helps to conserve
cognitive resources.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.010
So when you’re running on autopilot, basically
your brain hates thinking and wants to do

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.690
as little of it as possible to save energy.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.850
So hurry up and make things routine, you brain
needs to rest.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.160
Want to get someone else on a routine?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
Maybe one day we could change someone’s
behavior just by flipping a switch.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:19.590
or reprogramming a few neurons.
