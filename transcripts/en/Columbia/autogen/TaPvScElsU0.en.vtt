this possible kinds of introduction just
by way of adding a little bit more of

by way of adding a little bit more of

human behavior physical environment

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
human behavior physical environment
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359

relationships so really the interaction

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
relationships so really the interaction
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.770
relationships so really the interaction
effects between people and place and so

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780
effects between people and place and so
 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.600
effects between people and place and so
that's also a way of thinking about

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
that's also a way of thinking about
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.549
that's also a way of thinking about
geography I when thinking about this

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
geography I when thinking about this
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.260
geography I when thinking about this
this dark and what I could offer from my

this dark and what I could offer from my
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.560
this dark and what I could offer from my
perspective as a practicing planner an

hunter I started to think about that I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
hunter I started to think about that I
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.520
hunter I started to think about that I
could probably help situate open data

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
could probably help situate open data
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.520
could probably help situate open data

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
of thinking about spatial citizenship
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.270
of thinking about spatial citizenship
it's a term that has been used in the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
it's a term that has been used in the
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.029
it's a term that has been used in the
literature it's not particularly new but

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039
literature it's not particularly new but
 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.089
literature it's not particularly new but
probably trying to to build traction for

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:17.099
probably trying to to build traction for
 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.520
probably trying to to build traction for
that terminology here and see if we can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
that terminology here and see if we can
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.660
that terminology here and see if we can
establish some connections between open

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
establish some connections between open
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.480
establish some connections between open
GIS and spatial citizenship and really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
GIS and spatial citizenship and really
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.889
GIS and spatial citizenship and really
took to heart the panelists charge which

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899
took to heart the panelists charge which
 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.389
took to heart the panelists charge which
was to you know how do we achieve this

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399
was to you know how do we achieve this
 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.540
was to you know how do we achieve this
truly open GIS or then I started

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550
truly open GIS or then I started
 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.969
truly open GIS or then I started
thinking about is it open GIS or is it

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
thinking about is it open GIS or is it
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359
thinking about is it open GIS or is it
to be open with GIS oh it's catch the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
to be open with GIS oh it's catch the
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.059
to be open with GIS oh it's catch the
classic tool science conundrum that we

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069
classic tool science conundrum that we
 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.050
classic tool science conundrum that we
keep talking about in the GIS world so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
keep talking about in the GIS world so
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.210
keep talking about in the GIS world so
as I'm an educator I work with I prepare

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
as I'm an educator I work with I prepare
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.109
as I'm an educator I work with I prepare
practicing planners I'm a researcher I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
practicing planners I'm a researcher I
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.270
practicing planners I'm a researcher I
work with communities that are often

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280
work with communities that are often
 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.690
work with communities that are often
marginalized for one reason or the other

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700
marginalized for one reason or the other
 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.869
marginalized for one reason or the other
and so from that perspective looking at

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879
and so from that perspective looking at
 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.300
and so from that perspective looking at
the lens with that lens looking at this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
the lens with that lens looking at this
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580
the lens with that lens looking at this
landscape of what comes under the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
landscape of what comes under the
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.450
landscape of what comes under the
umbrella of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
umbrella of
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.470
umbrella of
open GIS or open planning the landscape

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480
open GIS or open planning the landscape
 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.350
open GIS or open planning the landscape
is very crowded it seems almost daunting

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
is very crowded it seems almost daunting
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.050
is very crowded it seems almost daunting
for an for an outsider to look at this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
for an for an outsider to look at this
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.400
for an for an outsider to look at this
landscape so you have industry you have

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410
landscape so you have industry you have
 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.230
landscape so you have industry you have
the scientific community you certainly

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
the scientific community you certainly
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.830
the scientific community you certainly
have the activist community everybody is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
have the activist community everybody is
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.920
have the activist community everybody is
sort of putting their mark on on what it

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
sort of putting their mark on on what it
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.880
sort of putting their mark on on what it
means to be open and do research in this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890
means to be open and do research in this
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.460
means to be open and do research in this
way and this is a screen grab from City

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
way and this is a screen grab from City
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.110
way and this is a screen grab from City
fixer and open is everywhere so I'm a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
fixer and open is everywhere so I'm a
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.840
fixer and open is everywhere so I'm a
practicing planner I'm preparing experts

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850
practicing planner I'm preparing experts
 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.290
practicing planner I'm preparing experts
who are put on food experts and planning

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
who are put on food experts and planning
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.410
who are put on food experts and planning
but this is everybody's a planner so

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420
but this is everybody's a planner so
 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.260
but this is everybody's a planner so
there's a little tension here about what

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270
there's a little tension here about what
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.410
there's a little tension here about what
happens when we use open G is that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420
happens when we use open G is that
 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.660
happens when we use open G is that
because it empowers a whole bunch of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
because it empowers a whole bunch of
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.560
because it empowers a whole bunch of
people to to have positions and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570
people to to have positions and
 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.240
people to to have positions and
interventions about the city that we

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
interventions about the city that we
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.800
interventions about the city that we
live in so you are probably familiar

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810
live in so you are probably familiar
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.740
live in so you are probably familiar
with these these concepts and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750
with these these concepts and
 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.540
with these these concepts and
terminologies but from is just to think

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550
terminologies but from is just to think
 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.940
terminologies but from is just to think
about you can't get anywhere in this

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
about you can't get anywhere in this
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250
about you can't get anywhere in this
this day and age without hearing big

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260
this day and age without hearing big
 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.430
this day and age without hearing big
data thrown in it almost is sort of de

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
data thrown in it almost is sort of de
 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.030

rigueur to have the those phrase big

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
rigueur to have the those phrase big
 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490
rigueur to have the those phrase big
data and they've been occasional

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
data and they've been occasional
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.950

critiques of what big data is and the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960
critiques of what big data is and the
 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.110
critiques of what big data is and the
limits of big data for the kinds of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120
limits of big data for the kinds of
 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.790
limits of big data for the kinds of
problems that we're trying to solve but

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800
problems that we're trying to solve but
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.880
problems that we're trying to solve but
essentially we are really moving into a

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890
essentially we are really moving into a
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.460
essentially we are really moving into a
highly data-driven geography work that

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470
highly data-driven geography work that
 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.040
highly data-driven geography work that
has frozen content assume that will

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050
has frozen content assume that will
 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.470
has frozen content assume that will
address them in the discussion but in

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
address them in the discussion but in
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880
address them in the discussion but in
the end it comes back to what you said

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890
the end it comes back to what you said
 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.920
the end it comes back to what you said
like you know technology for the common

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930
like you know technology for the common
 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.190
like you know technology for the common
good that the you know it's sort of

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200
good that the you know it's sort of
 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.420
good that the you know it's sort of
these cliches you know don't do evil or

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
these cliches you know don't do evil or
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.320
these cliches you know don't do evil or
do technology for good and you

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330
do technology for good and you
 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.010
do technology for good and you
immediately have to ask good for whom

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020
immediately have to ask good for whom
 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.470
immediately have to ask good for whom
good for what and without that it's

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480
good for what and without that it's
 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.140
good for what and without that it's
really not very helpful but yet that's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
really not very helpful but yet that's
 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.040
really not very helpful but yet that's
what we hear in

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050
what we hear in
 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.159
what we hear in
everywhere so I said to you that I was

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169
everywhere so I said to you that I was
 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.379
everywhere so I said to you that I was
looking at people place relationships so

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389
looking at people place relationships so
 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.769
looking at people place relationships so
most of my thinking is really about this

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:38.779
most of my thinking is really about this
 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.760
most of my thinking is really about this
how do we as as human beings and

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770
how do we as as human beings and
 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.699
how do we as as human beings and
gatherings of human beings with and with

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:45.709
gatherings of human beings with and with
 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:48.489
gatherings of human beings with and with
the help of technologies transform the

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.499
the help of technologies transform the
 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.939
the help of technologies transform the
world we live in and we all have

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949
world we live in and we all have
 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.559
world we live in and we all have
examples by which we do this on a

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569
examples by which we do this on a
 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.059
examples by which we do this on a
day-to-day basis but it seems to me this

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069
day-to-day basis but it seems to me this
 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.659
day-to-day basis but it seems to me this
week in particular considering all the

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669
week in particular considering all the
 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.969
week in particular considering all the
events that have occurred we probably

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979
events that have occurred we probably
 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.449
events that have occurred we probably
want to think about sort of those pesky

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:07.459
want to think about sort of those pesky
 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.759
want to think about sort of those pesky
issues that have been there from the

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:09.769
issues that have been there from the
 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.219
issues that have been there from the
beginning right access to information

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229
beginning right access to information
 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.949
beginning right access to information
who has access who doesn't have access

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:14.959
who has access who doesn't have access
 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.619
who has access who doesn't have access
and how quickly that access can be taken

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629
and how quickly that access can be taken
 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:23.079
and how quickly that access can be taken
away because any and the same argument

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089
away because any and the same argument
 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.509
away because any and the same argument
about privacy this is a conversation

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:25.519
about privacy this is a conversation
 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.989
about privacy this is a conversation
worldwide going on right now about what

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999
worldwide going on right now about what
 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.089
worldwide going on right now about what
our right to privacy is really and

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099
our right to privacy is really and
 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.309
our right to privacy is really and
particularly geospatial in geospatial

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319
particularly geospatial in geospatial
 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.529
particularly geospatial in geospatial
privacy and then the ethics of using

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539
privacy and then the ethics of using
 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.389
privacy and then the ethics of using
this approach the data-driven approach

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:43.399
this approach the data-driven approach
 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:47.619
this approach the data-driven approach
to decision making and and sort of in

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629
to decision making and and sort of in
 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.619
to decision making and and sort of in
the public interest but really who

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629
the public interest but really who
 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.269
the public interest but really who
defines what that public interest is and

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:54.279
defines what that public interest is and
 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.759
defines what that public interest is and
so I put it to you very bluntly I asked

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:57.769
so I put it to you very bluntly I asked
 

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:00.639
so I put it to you very bluntly I asked
you who has the power and so I make this

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:00.649
you who has the power and so I make this
 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:04.419
you who has the power and so I make this
list which I try to make it in terms of

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.429
list which I try to make it in terms of
 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.959
list which I try to make it in terms of
a hierarchy and you so going from most

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969
a hierarchy and you so going from most
 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.799
a hierarchy and you so going from most
power to lease power and some of you

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:11.809
power to lease power and some of you
 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:13.449
power to lease power and some of you
might look at this and say hey you got

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:13.459
might look at this and say hey you got
 

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:17.230
might look at this and say hey you got
the order all wrong because really you

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240
the order all wrong because really you
 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.839
the order all wrong because really you
know you put universities in there about

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849
know you put universities in there about
 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.189
know you put universities in there about
super PACs is can that be and we can

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199
super PACs is can that be and we can
 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.639
super PACs is can that be and we can
quibble about where each one is on this

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:27.649
quibble about where each one is on this
 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.949
quibble about where each one is on this
hierarchy but there's some people who

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:29.959
hierarchy but there's some people who
 

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:31.689
hierarchy but there's some people who
are not even they didn't even make it to

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699
are not even they didn't even make it to
 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.919
are not even they didn't even make it to
the list right and so the people who

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:35.929
the list right and so the people who
 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.940
the list right and so the people who
don't have formal

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950
don't have formal
 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.030
don't have formal
who don't have skills aren't even on

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040
who don't have skills aren't even on
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.240
who don't have skills aren't even on
this list so then and I say power I

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250
this list so then and I say power I
 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.260
this list so then and I say power I
don't just mean money power money powers

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270
don't just mean money power money powers
 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.030
don't just mean money power money powers
really important but there's

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040
really important but there's
 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.910
really important but there's
infrastructure power is computing power

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920
infrastructure power is computing power
 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.290
infrastructure power is computing power
there's data power they staffing like

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
there's data power they staffing like
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.200
there's data power they staffing like
you know technical support power and in

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210
you know technical support power and in
 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.640
you know technical support power and in
that context we are not really engaging

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650
that context we are not really engaging
 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.550
that context we are not really engaging
very carefully about the large to other

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560
very carefully about the large to other
 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.690
very carefully about the large to other
people who are not on this list as a

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700
people who are not on this list as a
 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.880
people who are not on this list as a
community of scholars and educators and

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890
community of scholars and educators and
 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.460
community of scholars and educators and
and activists so when I move on to think

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470
and activists so when I move on to think
 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.980
and activists so when I move on to think
about you know how we are creating

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990
about you know how we are creating
 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.020
about you know how we are creating
knowledge how we are producing knowledge

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030
knowledge how we are producing knowledge
 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.420
knowledge how we are producing knowledge
and how we are using knowledge at least

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430
and how we are using knowledge at least
 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.600
and how we are using knowledge at least
in my field which is planning we have

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610
in my field which is planning we have
 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.070
in my field which is planning we have
moved from doing planning which is a

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080
moved from doing planning which is a
 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.740
moved from doing planning which is a
very normative future-oriented set of

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750
very normative future-oriented set of
 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.220
very normative future-oriented set of
goals to being managers and nothing

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.230
goals to being managers and nothing
 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.950
goals to being managers and nothing
wrong with being managers you need good

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960
wrong with being managers you need good
 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.060
wrong with being managers you need good
managers but management of cities is

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070
managers but management of cities is
 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.700
managers but management of cities is
very different from planning of cities

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710
very different from planning of cities
 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.330
very different from planning of cities
and and there's a tension there which we

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340
and and there's a tension there which we
 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.330
and and there's a tension there which we
are glossing over right now because if

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340
are glossing over right now because if
 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.700
are glossing over right now because if
you talk to the Big Data folks and if

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:01.710
you talk to the Big Data folks and if
 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.070
you talk to the Big Data folks and if
you talk to the the people who are using

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
you talk to the the people who are using
 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.510
you talk to the the people who are using
let's come to open in a minute but let

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520
let's come to open in a minute but let
 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.980
let's come to open in a minute but let
you get are you talking about big data

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:09.990
you get are you talking about big data
 

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.280
you get are you talking about big data
and how would you sister cities it's all

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.290
and how would you sister cities it's all
 

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.450
and how would you sister cities it's all
about just in time real-time decision

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.460
about just in time real-time decision
 

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.150
about just in time real-time decision
making solving problems on the fly and I

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160
making solving problems on the fly and I
 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.730
making solving problems on the fly and I
occasionally introduce questions about

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740
occasionally introduce questions about
 

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.300
occasionally introduce questions about
causality and I get shot down right away

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.310
causality and I get shot down right away
 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.240
causality and I get shot down right away
and yeah it's an answer usually is you

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.250
and yeah it's an answer usually is you
 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.190
and yeah it's an answer usually is you
don't need to worry about causality or

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200
don't need to worry about causality or
 

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.710
don't need to worry about causality or
causal chains correlations good enough

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:36.720
causal chains correlations good enough
 

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.130
causal chains correlations good enough
to get the job done and and for

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140
to get the job done and and for
 

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.770
to get the job done and and for
management purposes yes that in some

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:42.780
management purposes yes that in some
 

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.660
management purposes yes that in some
sense that the correlation is what all

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:44.670
sense that the correlation is what all
 

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.190
sense that the correlation is what all
that we may mean but it seems to me that

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200
that we may mean but it seems to me that
 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.939
that we may mean but it seems to me that
we are

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:50.949
we are
 

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:55.150
we are
missing out some huge opportunities in

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160
missing out some huge opportunities in
 

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.910
missing out some huge opportunities in
not asking these difficult questions as

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920
not asking these difficult questions as
 

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
not asking these difficult questions as
a bigger community I think the

00:08:59.920 --> 00:08:59.930
a bigger community I think the
 

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.689
a bigger community I think the
conversations are happening but they are

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:01.699
conversations are happening but they are
 

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:06.759
conversations are happening but they are
very siloed so I did my own Yelp version

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:06.769
very siloed so I did my own Yelp version
 

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.550
very siloed so I did my own Yelp version
of what what I think is going on totally

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560
of what what I think is going on totally
 

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.129
of what what I think is going on totally
this is a Laxmi's view of the world and

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:14.139
this is a Laxmi's view of the world and
 

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.569
this is a Laxmi's view of the world and
you know welcome to argue with me about

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:16.579
you know welcome to argue with me about
 

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:22.000
you know welcome to argue with me about
it so I think that you know why why do

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.010
it so I think that you know why why do
 

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.850
it so I think that you know why why do
we care about open data why do we care

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:24.860
we care about open data why do we care
 

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.090
we care about open data why do we care
about open G is open knowledge because

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:28.100
about open G is open knowledge because
 

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.300
about open G is open knowledge because
we want to to address those larger

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.310
we want to to address those larger
 

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.030
we want to to address those larger
societal rules of democratizing

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040
societal rules of democratizing
 

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.329
societal rules of democratizing
decision-making presume we're not doing

00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:37.339
decision-making presume we're not doing
 

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:40.030
decision-making presume we're not doing
it just for the the sake of doing it we

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040
it just for the the sake of doing it we
 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.810
it just for the the sake of doing it we
see there's a causal link there so how

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:43.820
see there's a causal link there so how
 

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.000
see there's a causal link there so how
we doing and I think we're doing pretty

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.010
we doing and I think we're doing pretty
 

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.079
we doing and I think we're doing pretty
well on data access although we can

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:50.089
well on data access although we can
 

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.509
well on data access although we can
quibble about this because you go back

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519
quibble about this because you go back
 

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:55.960
quibble about this because you go back
to a data that used to be open is no

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:55.970
to a data that used to be open is no
 

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.050
to a data that used to be open is no
longer open data that used to be free is

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.060
longer open data that used to be free is
 

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.610
longer open data that used to be free is
no longer free it keeps changing I can't

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:02.620
no longer free it keeps changing I can't
 

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:07.689
no longer free it keeps changing I can't
rely on things always being accessible

different forums and I think we're doing

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:39.260
different forums and I think we're doing
 

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.050
different forums and I think we're doing
very well on individual empowerment

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.060
very well on individual empowerment
 

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:47.470
very well on individual empowerment
right and that is the commercial angle

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480
right and that is the commercial angle
 

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.769
right and that is the commercial angle
to all of this that that you as an

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:50.779
to all of this that that you as an
 

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:53.410
to all of this that that you as an
individual are very empowered because

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:53.420
individual are very empowered because
 

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.360
individual are very empowered because
you have access to all of this

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.370
you have access to all of this
 

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.780
you have access to all of this
information and data like that you can

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:58.790
information and data like that you can
 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.100
information and data like that you can
then use in your own

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.110
then use in your own
 

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.110
then use in your own
and perhaps you know my co-panelists

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120
and perhaps you know my co-panelists
 

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.350
and perhaps you know my co-panelists
we'll talk some about that think we're

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360
we'll talk some about that think we're
 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.509
we'll talk some about that think we're
not doing very well on Kruk empowerment

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519
not doing very well on Kruk empowerment
 

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:10.000
not doing very well on Kruk empowerment
that you know we're not really doing

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.010
that you know we're not really doing
 

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.730
that you know we're not really doing
well on using the open data the open

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:12.740
well on using the open data the open
 

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.949
well on using the open data the open
knowledge to actually deal with

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959
knowledge to actually deal with
 

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:17.829
knowledge to actually deal with
structural problems socio-political

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839
structural problems socio-political
 

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:21.160
structural problems socio-political
problems we're not doing well in we are

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.170
problems we're not doing well in we are
 

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.130
problems we're not doing well in we are
reactive we are not so again it's just a

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140
reactive we are not so again it's just a
 

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.410
reactive we are not so again it's just a
tension-free planning and management we

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:26.420
tension-free planning and management we
 

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.420
tension-free planning and management we
are reactive rather than being proactive

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.430
are reactive rather than being proactive
 

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.030
are reactive rather than being proactive
so let me give it a little bit if next

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040
so let me give it a little bit if next
 

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.889
so let me give it a little bit if next
set of ideas is really related to

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:35.899
set of ideas is really related to
 

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:39.970
set of ideas is really related to
citizenship and so if you do a simple

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:39.980
citizenship and so if you do a simple
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.930
citizenship and so if you do a simple
word cloud you come up with these terms

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:43.940
word cloud you come up with these terms
 

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.350
word cloud you come up with these terms
that relate to critical thinking and

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360
that relate to critical thinking and
 

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.790
that relate to critical thinking and
reasoning because in order to be a

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800
reasoning because in order to be a
 

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.560
reasoning because in order to be a
facial citizen you you have to have

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:55.570
facial citizen you you have to have
 

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.710
facial citizen you you have to have
motivation to to use these technologies

00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720
motivation to to use these technologies
 

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.590
motivation to to use these technologies
to participate to actually again to

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600
to participate to actually again to
 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.900
to participate to actually again to
bring this idea of participating in

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:04.910
bring this idea of participating in
 

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.509
bring this idea of participating in
democratic processes so I started to

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519
democratic processes so I started to
 

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.990
democratic processes so I started to
think about what are the components what

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000
think about what are the components what
 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.240
think about what are the components what
are the framework elements that would

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.250
are the framework elements that would
 

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.079
are the framework elements that would
allow you to participate so then if you

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:17.089
allow you to participate so then if you
 

00:12:17.089 --> 00:12:20.920
allow you to participate so then if you
look at these individual frames like

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:20.930
look at these individual frames like
 

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.290
look at these individual frames like
methodological competency technical

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:23.300
methodological competency technical
 

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.439
methodological competency technical
competency communication competency or

00:12:26.439 --> 00:12:26.449
competency communication competency or
 

00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:29.230
competency communication competency or
situational assessment competency then

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240
situational assessment competency then
 

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.480
situational assessment competency then
you start to think what should we be

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.490
you start to think what should we be
 

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.819
you start to think what should we be
doing and I mean I'm in the education

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:33.829
doing and I mean I'm in the education
 

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:36.550
doing and I mean I'm in the education
sector what should I be doing as an

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560
sector what should I be doing as an
 

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.850
sector what should I be doing as an
educator to prepare my students to

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:39.860
educator to prepare my students to
 

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.670
educator to prepare my students to
achieve these competencies and what is

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680
achieve these competencies and what is
 

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.170
achieve these competencies and what is
what are what is the open G is community

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:47.180
what are what is the open G is community
 

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.590
what are what is the open G is community
doing to help me address these goals and

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600
doing to help me address these goals and
 

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.810
doing to help me address these goals and
I think they are doing a great deal but

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:52.820
I think they are doing a great deal but
 

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.430
I think they are doing a great deal but
really that's a continuing question and

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440
really that's a continuing question and
 

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.050
really that's a continuing question and
move over this i think there are

00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.060
move over this i think there are
 

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.590
move over this i think there are
benefits that are quite clear that we

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600
benefits that are quite clear that we
 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.970
benefits that are quite clear that we
are do i think others argue that if

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:06.980
are do i think others argue that if
 

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.220
are do i think others argue that if

a collaborative way but that it also
 

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:20.759

open G has communities come together and
doing all these things but that by

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.100
doing all these things but that by

itself is not going to achieve a
 

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.199
itself is not going to achieve a
long-term goal so maybe I can come later

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:16.209
long-term goal so maybe I can come later
 

00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:18.960
