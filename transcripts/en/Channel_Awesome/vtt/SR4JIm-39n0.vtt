00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.420
OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.620
SPOILERS!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.800
This is a prequel to Wolverine Origins.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.120
There's this guy named "Jason Lee If He Worked Out Every Day"...

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.320
...and he's an assassin for teenage girls who have a lot of money!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.160
A...very broad market.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.140
But he falls in love with a prostitute while playing skee-ball.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.060
Yes, that old cliche.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.180
But he suddenly finds out he has cancer!

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.400
I had cancer once!

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.440
There is no way I can make a joke that won't offend somebody, so I will just move on.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.760
So he does what any man in his position would do.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.320
Leaves his girlfriend behind...

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.220
...donates his body to mad scientists...

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.100
...subjects himself to a life of torture...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.600
...and all in the name of becoming a superhero!

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.940
*chuckle* It's like this guy read my biography.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.500
So Muscle-Bound Jason Lee is really upset...

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.900
...because it turns out a guy named Francis lied to him!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.800
They weren't making superheroes, they were making superslaves!

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.340
Well, that's the last time I agree to go with a person who says he can cure cancer and make me a superhero!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.120
You can't fool me eight times!

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
But Muscle-Bound Jason Lee gets out of it by burning himself alive!

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.780
Often the answer I usually choose.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.060
And he's out to get revenge as Deadpool!

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.240
The only problem is he looks like Freddy Krueger made love to an avocado.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.420
Oh wait, they already made that joke.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.500
He says he doesn't want his mouth sewn shut because it reminds him of Wolverine Origi--

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Wait, they made that joke too.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980
He wants to be sure not to be the next Green Lanter--

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.200
Wow, this is really hard.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.940
When a movie makes so many fourth-wall jokes, what can I say about it?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.760
Oooh, I know!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.740
When it's not making fourth-wall jokes, the movie is actually kind of boring.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.280
Like, you know that Mark Wahlberg and Ice-T movie that you see advertised, like, every other weekend?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.500
The one where they wear backwards hats and carry guns?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.280
The plot to those movies is pretty much the plot to Deadpool.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.600
"He had a good life..."

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120
"...until tragedy struck..."

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.780
"...and he made the wrong choices!"

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.700
"Now, one man is out for revenge..."

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.220
"...but they kidnapped his girl!"

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.380
"So, he's gonna have to break the rules!"

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.720
Yeah, you know the trailer to those movies you never see, that's it.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.040
But when he does make fourth-wall jokes, it's really funny!

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.220
It's like watching Bugs Bunny in Training Day or something!

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.260
Oh, and one and a half X-Men are in it!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.100
But seeing how it's the only X-Men character ever that actually looks a hundred percent and acts a hundred percent like an X-Men character...

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.320
...that technically makes this the best X-Men movie ever.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.100
And their names are Colossus and some girl I've never heard of before.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.200
But she can blow up!

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.820
So I think her name was SponTEENeous Combustion.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.000
I worked on that on the walk from the theater.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.200
That was a fun 20 miles.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.360
So Deadpool is staying with a blind lady who everybody is gonna think is Uhura, but isn't!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.680
And he calls on the help of the one and a half X-Men to get his girlfriend back!

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.660
And Deadpool is like:

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.000
"Let's make literally one chimichanga joke and kick some ass!"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.980
And Colossus is like:

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000
"How come only you can make the fourth-wall jokes but we don't catch on to 'em?"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.340
"Because I'm the only fictional character who knows he's a fictional character!"

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.840
"How?"

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.680
"Nobody cares because I'm funny and I do a lot of gory stuff!"

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.300
"You're what every thirteen-year-old boy thinks he can be."

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.460
"Except with an army of writers!"

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.360
"And the ability to dub in better jokes in case they think of them later."

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.320
(Yeah, OBVIOUS!)
"Yes, you couldn't do that if I wasn't wearing the mask."

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.860
So Deadpool has Francis in his clutches!

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.020
But Colossus is like:

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.420
"You can't do that, I'm going to talk about what it means to be a real hero and I'm gonna go on and on even though the entire audience has already guessed the joke and they're just waiting for you to pull the trig--"

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.960
*gunshot*

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.000
"Thank you, now I'm gonna see if they keep me Russian in X-Men: Apocalypse."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.380
So Deadpool meets up with his girlfriend and he's like:

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.940
"I know I'm really ugly and you're really beautiful, but I'm kinda hoping we can do that early 2000s sitcom thing where the really hot chick gets together with the unattractive guy..."

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.020
"I think if we want to give our main demographic any hope, we better."

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.840
"End on an in-joke?"

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.740
"End on an in-joke."

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.220
"I'm Ferris Bueller and Cable's gonna be in the next movie!"

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.520
Hooray!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.780
So Deadpool was a lot of fun, I especially like the parts where he looked right into the camera and talked to the people.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.640
But isn't it kind of distracting when he does that?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.240
I mean, doesn't it just draw more attention to the fact that he's a fictional character?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.360
Doesn't that make it so friggin' obvious that the illusion is just totally shattered?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.500
"This is Chester A. Bum saying..."

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
I have a Nostalgia Critic to shoot.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.760
No, no closing line, I have work to do.
