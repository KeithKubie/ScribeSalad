00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.573
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.710
&gt;&gt; Ev Small.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.806
I'm here to welcome you on
behalf of the Washington Post

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.426
which is a charter sponsor of the
National Book Festival and also

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.770
on behalf of the Library
of Congress.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.230
I'm a former editor at the
Washington Post and now working

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.520
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.853
So, I get two good places there.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.413
Just a caveat, you may
have noticed the cameras.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.073
The Library of Congress films these
talks for webcast on its website.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.373
So, if any of you told your
families you were going off to work

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.486
for a few hours, please duck down
when the camera pans the crowd.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.050
But we wanna make sure
you know that.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.373
Right now we're gathered to hear

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.440
from Elizabeth Kostova whose
first novel, the eerie, hypnotic

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.130
and authentic The Historian is what
one reviewer called a toothsome

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.110
reworking of the Dracula
myth indeed.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.673
It's worth pouring out for all
of you book lovers here today

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.200
that Kostova's undead Dracula
is a historian, an archivist

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.633
and a bibliophile of sorts, what
one reviewer calls a bibliomaniac

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.353
which probably describes
many of you as well.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.093
A Dracula with a penchant for
librarians, what could be better?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.420
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.426
&gt;&gt; Kostova spent a good part of
10 years writing The Historian

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.693
but it immediately soared in to the
stratosphere becoming the fastest

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.600
selling hardback debut
novel in US history.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.430
A record we think it still holds.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.230
[ Applause ]

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.563
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.230
[ Laughter]

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.696
&gt;&gt; We need look no farther
than right across the mall

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.246
from where we're sitting now
to the National Gallery of Art

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.533
for the momentum for her
current novel, The Swan Thieves,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.493
where an attack on a
painting propels the story.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.386
Don't anybody get any ideas.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.120
Elizabeth Kostova has
worked in a number

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.523
of things including recording folk
music in Bulgaria and mowing loans

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.050
at least according to one source.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.316
But we're lucky she
turned to writing.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.650
In her work she conjures up
the powerful effects of myths,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.656
the power of obsessions, and
the pleasure of old libraries.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.916
One last thing I'll tell
you that you might not know.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.123
Her interests in books and
libraries started early.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.696
According to a reliable source, her
mother who was a librarian took her

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.670
and his sisters to the public
library and they were each allowed

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.556
to check out 30 books for which
they had a special shelf at home.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.833
So please welcome book
lover, Elizabeth Kostova.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.930
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.330
Can everybody hear me well?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.553
Good, okay and I'm already
knocking the mic off the stand

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.506
but I'll try not to do that again.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.030
I know many of you are librarians
and I feel I should say something

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.010
about this before I say all
the usual formalities which is

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.836
that when my mother who was one
of my best readers in addition

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.460
to being a librarian read the
manuscript to of The Historian.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.486
She said, you know, I love this
book and I'm just a little concerned

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.453
about the fate of all
these librarians.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.600
So I was very careful to
dedicate my second book to her

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.783
which she has appreciated
and which we have shared.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.793
I do love libraries and like all of
you I love books and I'm so thrilled

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.076
to see this outpouring of people
and readers today here on the mall.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.263
And I also wanna say I'm so thrilled
to see all the reading programs.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.690
I hope that you've all had
a chance to check those out.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.743
The programs that help us
raised readers in this country.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.903
That 30 books at the
library story is true

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.583
and I think it is a great gift
to children to be given books

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.583
and take them to the library.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.733
So, I wanna say thank you very
much to the festival for having me.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.900
I'm honored and I'm honored
that you're all here.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.500
I'm gonna speak very briefly
because what I'd really

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.566
like to do is answer
your questions and talk

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.643
about the subjects you
would like to discuss.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.396
So, I'll just tell you as you
heard my first book, The Historian,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.613
took me 10 years to write.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.113
The good news for those
of you who read it is

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.306
that my second book is The Swan
Thieves which came out in January is

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.283
about a 120 pages shorter.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.026
So, I feel that-- it
also took me about four

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.973
and a half years to write.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.506
So, I feel I'm getting
shorter and faster, I hope.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.860
The inspirations for the two
books were very different.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.080
The first one as you
know is about Dracula.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.443
I have to say it.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.843
It was a great surprise to me to
find myself writing a literary novel

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.576
with elements of the supernatural.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.913
I'm always very surprise when
people say to me, you know this--

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.320
I don't usually, something I feel,
I don't usually read vampire books.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
I don't either.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.403
I never read vampire books
and then I'm always pleased

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.570
when they say I enjoyed
this one anyway.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.756
So, I was fascinated by-- to
hear Isabel Allende's talk.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.250
I hope some of you heard that.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.250
Yes, and she's someone I admire very
much as a person as well as a writer

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.973
and I loved what she said
about how she lives other lives

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.026
by writing fiction.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.983
And one of the things that's
been very entertaining to me

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.670
about having written a book
that's about experiences

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.606
with the mythical Dracula is

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.073
that people still ask me
whether this is an autobiography

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320


00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.263
and so, no it's not.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.863
One of the joys about writing
a book about the impressionist

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.653
and as you heard some of the scenes

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.306
in The Swan Thieves are set right
here in the National Gallery

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.786
around some of the
fantastic paintings

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.860
in the 19th century galleries there.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.293
But one of the great
things about writing a book

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.493
about the impressionist painters is

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.550
that nobody asks you ever whether
you believe in them or not.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.700
So I would like to actually open
this up very early to questions

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.793
because I think I'll be
able to tell you more

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.103
and tell you exactly what
you like to know, I hope so.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.910
So if you wouldn't mind coming

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.416
up to the mic 'cause I'm actually
a little bit hard of hearing

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.666
and I'll answer the question
you asked if you come

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.273
to the mic instead of
something I made up.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.833
So that would be great.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.300


00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.666
Nobody has any-- okay.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.510
[ Pause ]

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.833
&gt;&gt; Yes, and please the mic

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.443
&gt;&gt; Good morning, ma'am.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.976
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.643
&gt;&gt; First of all, I very match
enjoyed both of your books.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.043
I just like to say that upfront.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.940
I noticed on your website
when I've last check it

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.146
that there's been someone hired

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.980
to write a screenplay
for The Historian.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.103
And my experience has been

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.680
that really great books often
make really lousy movies.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.046
And I was just wondering if
you could speak a little bit

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.136
to any concerns you might have had
or any influence that you have tried

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.410
to maintain on turning The
Historian into a movie, thank you.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:47.786
Did everyone hear the question?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:49.846
Well, it's about the movie that's
projected for The Historian.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:53.876
Yes, of course when you write
a novel you feel concerned

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.576
about what might happen to
it when it becomes a movie

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.213
if you're lucky enough to
sell it for a movie deal.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.240
And it did sell several years
ago, quite a few years ago now,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.566
about four and half years ago
to Sony-Columbia Pictures.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.376
And it's sold to a studio that
has made some wonderful movies,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:17.940
Red Wagon Pictures, and I'm sure all

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.326
of you have seen some
of their movies.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.660
They make some blockbusters

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.793
and they've also made
some really good movies

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.726
from books including novels.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.536
Including Memoirs of a
Geisha on which they worked

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.510
for 7 years very closely with
the author Arthur Golden.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.396
They have a track record of working
closely with authors which I liked.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.796
But I think when you sell a book to
Hollywood in particular you do have

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.770
to kind of let go of
it because it's likely

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.716
to become a very different animal.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:50.743
And I'm curious to see what they do

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.203
but in the end all I could
do is choose a studio

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.120
that seemed closest
to what I wanted.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.676
I will tell you one
really quick thing

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.610
and then I'll take
the next question.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.300
When I first went out
to meet with the studio,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.053
they said, well I asked them.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.836
I have one very frank question.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.140
Do you intend to make a horror
movie out of this novel?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.980
And they laughed and they said well,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:19.966
we've heard how you
feel about horror.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.593
That you're not a fan of the
hardcore genre, and we want you

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.556
to know that we intend
to make a movie

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.816
that will be terrifying
and beautiful.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.413
And I thought that was such a
good answer for a novel like this

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.520
so that gives me a lot
of faith in the studio.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.630


00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.670
Yes, please.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.310
&gt;&gt; The Historian, although I do
read a lot of supernatural fiction.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.163
I like other types,
historical especially.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.650
What I loved about that book was the
nested journals of how you did it

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.220
and how you straddled the 20th
century's history, cold war

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.483
and pre-cold war, and so for
me, Dracula kind of emerging

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:02.316
out of this made a
whole lot of sense.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:09.236
But I'm curious, what made you pick
that, that framework for the novel,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.250
those interacting journals
of interacting people?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.793
&gt;&gt; The question was about the
structure of The Historian.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.506
It is a series of documents.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.886
In fact the whole book is a
document that's put together

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.726
by the main character.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.060
And there are a lot of
journals and letters

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.460
and even an academic paper in it.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.233
And I stole this shamelessly
from Victorian novelists.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.210
They premiere the great novels

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.800
and the novelists I read the
most often although I read a lot

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.913
of contemporary fiction as well.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.196
But I love that sense as
a re-- when I'm a reader,

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.636
of having been given a document,
especially letters and journals.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.750
It also is a way to get
very close to characters.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.256
I think there's a part of us and
probably not a very good part of us

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.146
that would love to read
other people's mail.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.020
So even if we shouldn't and we
don't, it's there's a kind of joy

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:05.253
in being allowed that close to a
character so that was part of it.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:13.753
The other reason I chose that format
was that it's what Bram Stoker used

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.693
for his brilliant novel Dracula.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.286
And Dracula, I have no idea whether
Dracula's a great literature or not

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.313
but it's just one of the
best reads I've ever read.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.816
And as you know, it's
completely told in documents

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.843
and you get an amazing sense of the
characters through that structure

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.750
so it really was because
of the Victorians.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.630
Thank you.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.630
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.030
&gt;&gt; My question is more of
a writer process question.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.563
What is your writing process and
how did you maintain your stamina

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.630
over 10 years in such
a dense rich book?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.300
You know to keep going, you
know, keep it organized,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.520
keep remembering all the story
lines and the threads through it.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.316
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that
question about writing process.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.503
You know, I've had a very
different writing process

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.823
with each of my two books.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.490
I'm now working on
a third and again,

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.460
it's quite different
from the first two.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.053
When I wrote The Historian,
I did keep going for 10 years

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.723
and I was really fascinated to hear
what Diana said a few minutes ago

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.873
about writing her first book.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.940
That rang very true for me as
well that she kept going partly

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:20.966
because she wanted
to prove to herself

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:22.750
that she can finish something and
that was incredibly important to me.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.916
I had a feeling I might be
stuffing this into a drawer forever

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.986
but that I would know
I can finish something

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:35.603
and I wanted to be able to do that.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.870
I also had three children under the
age of six like Diana and when I--

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.720
in fact I started it right before
they were born so it was even,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.073
they're even younger than that
part of the time and frankly,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.606
I think it was an escape.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.273
I think that it was the part of
my day even when it was 20 minutes

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.033
of my day when I actually
was handling something

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.450
that didn't have egg on it.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.443
So it was a great sort of personal
vacation including doing the

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.990
research and the research
took a long time.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.263
That's one of the things that
make me a very slow writer.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.673
The writing process, writing process
I think is fascinating to all of us

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.826
and when I wrote The Historian I--

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.683
because that book has a very
careful, logically plotted kind

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.143
of framework, about halfway
through, I outlined all of the rest

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.970
of the book and the original--

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.313
the first manuscript of it was
about 1100 pages, first typescript.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.403
So I really would have
lost my way eventually

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.806
if I hadn't plotted it carefully
and worked on it in the order

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.356
in which you read it, pretty much.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.983
I learned a long time later that
the best way, the most efficient way

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.803
to write a mystery is to write--

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.556
to know what the heart
of the mystery is.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:04.266
In the case of detective
fiction that's the crime.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.716
In the case of an historical novel
that might be a mystery from history

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.520
but to know that ahead of time
and then go back to the beginning

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.780
and work forward to that so
I think I must have written

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.340
in the least efficient way possible.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.130
But it worked for me.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.130
It's the order in which you read it.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.930
Finally, though I had a sort of--

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.396
after I finished that
I had a revelation.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.110
I went to-- I was visiting with a
friend who's a wonderful novelist

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.746
and short story writer and I asked
her what she'd been working on

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.286
and she said oh, I've been
working on my novel this morning

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.686
and I said, wow, that's lovely.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.830
What chapter are you on?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.340
And she said well, I don't
know and I was shocked by this.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.320
I had no idea you were allowed
to write a book in that way

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.620
and so I've promised myself

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:55.446
that if I ever wrote another novel
I would try to write the way she did

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.653
which was to have the
archivist story, the characters,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.363
and then to write whatever seemed
most compelling at that time,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.026
whatever voice was most important,
whenever a scene occurred to you,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:13.966
and then of course when
you do that, you have--

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.543
you end up with masses of material
which you have to stitch together.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.816
This was the way I
wrote The Swan Thieves

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.016
which has a heavily psychological,
very intimate feel to it

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.463
and it was a great process
for that particular kind

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.616
of story because of that.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:30.356
But of course, I just spent about
over a year putting it together

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.376
in the order in which you read
it which is now an interweaving

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.376
of the 20th and 19th centuries.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.333
Can everyone hear me alright?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.533
It feels like it's bouncing
in and out but maybe

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.956
that just makes it sort of, I
don't know, it gives it texture.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.920
But if you start being able to not
hear me, please wave from the back.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.033
Yes ma'am, thank you
for that question.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.500
Yes.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:55.833
&gt;&gt; Hi! It may interest you to learn

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.833
that your grandmother Eleanor
Stevens was my high school librarian

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.340


00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.546
in Asheville, North Carolina
and helped to instill

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.596
in me a great respect for
books and love for reading.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200
So yes and--

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:15.456
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
for telling me that.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.343
&gt;&gt; You're welcome and my question is
I'm very intrigued by your interest

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.430
in myth and its import in our lives,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.850
our understanding of
our own psyches.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.423
One author who I think
exemplifies this in her writing

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.620
and whose books I love
very much is Sue Monk Kidd

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.080
and her book The Secret
Life of Bees.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.740
I 'm just wondering if you could say
a little bit more about your love

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.773
for myth and your interest in myth.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.490
Thank you.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.823
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much and
thank for telling me that.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.490
I'm thrilled.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.290
My grandmother was a wonderful
encourager of reading and--

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.690
in her family as well
as in the library.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:57.906
I'm so happy to hear that and she
read all of Jane Austen allowed

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.700
to me by the time I was 16.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.353
So I can't think of a better
training for a writer.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.340
So thank you.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.673
I am very interested

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.313
in myth although I am
certainly no expert on it.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.770
I imagine many of you
know much more about it.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.030
I've never studied myth in a kind of
formal comprehensive way but I think

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:26.300
that it's fascinating that there are
stories that last for us and some

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:26.823
of them have lasted
for thousands of years

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.543
and they are still powerful for us.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.330
Dracula has become
one of those although

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.393
over hundreds rather
than thousands of years.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.480
In The Swan Thieves I heavily
used the myth of Leda and the Swan

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.690
which is a favorite subject of
painters of course through the ages.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.233
But it's also I think
just one of the strangest,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.026
most fascinating stories out
there, the story of a human being

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.700
and the divine or a human
being and the beast.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.106
Do we know whether it's
beast or the divine?

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.186
It's really an amazing story
when you think about it.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.473
I think it's very interesting
that if you look, for example,

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.510
at the movies that become-- that are
sort of box office, enormous hits

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.803
or television shows that have
millions of people glued to them.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:22.410
At the heart of those, you
find exactly the elements

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.323
that we love in our myths.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.990
I had the experience a few years ago

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.283
when my children were
quite a bit younger.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.243
I'm reading aloud to them from
that wonderful book of Greek myths,

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.993
the D'Aulaires book which
probably some of you have

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.266
that has watercolor illustrations.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.930
It's a classic children's work on
myth but a pretty sophisticated one.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.913
And my children who were
pretty good but they

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.096
like most children may never
believe in bedtime or baths

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.543
so I guess that's normal but when we
were reading that book which is all

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.716
about things like Helen of Troy
and people chained to rocks

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.783
so their livers can be
eaten out by an eagle.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.973
They would say every
night to one another.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.343
Quick, get your pajamas
on, get your pajamas on.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:11.733
We're going to have Greek myths
which I think is so remarkable.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.860
There's just something deep in
us that responds to these stories

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.220
and they can be chosen only by time.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.770
Thank you.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.093
&gt;&gt; And piggybacks on
that a little bit.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.473
Would you talk a little bit
about your time as a child

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:29.550
and your father telling you
the stories of Dracula and how

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:32.570
that all-- did it scare you, did
it you know, did that come back

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.010
to you as you were writing.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.743
Would you talk a little
bit about that?

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.210
Thank you.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.543
The question was about the stories
my father told me about Dracula

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:46.520
when I was a child and I feel
less than hesitant to say

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.766
that my father is a very nice man.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.660


00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.080
He is a wonderful storyteller
and from the time my sisters

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.330
and I were little he told
us a lot of great stories,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.616
many of them from his imagination.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.443
&gt;&gt; But some of them as in the
case of Dracula from things

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.640
like movies he had grown up with and
he grew up in Brooklyn and Queens

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.866
in the '30s, '40s,
early '50s and he went

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.473
to all those classic
Dracula movies, Bela Lugosi

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.706
and all those great,
great Dracula classics.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.796
So his Dracula stories were heavily
based on those movies which in turn

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.050
of course are based on
the Bram Stoker book

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.560
and in them the noble Englishmen
always tracked Dracula to his lair

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.610
in his stories and it always worked
out very well for the good guys

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.543
and they always ended
in Dracula's castle.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.100
He told us these stories while we
were traveling in Eastern Europe.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.760
He was a-- he is a professor
and he was given a post

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.113
in Slovenia and then in Yugoslavia.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.363
So the magical thing about
this for us as children was

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.113
that we often were hearing them
while we were actually having a

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.693
picnic at the foot of a 13th
century castle, for example.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.786
So they were incredibly real
that gave me a sense that myth

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.583
and history and travel
were all kind of one--

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.750
could all become together
and be one thing in the mind.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.543
So that is why I've dedicated
my first book to him.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.463
Thank you for asking about that.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:29.850
Yes ma'am.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.850
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.450
The Historian introduces to so many
wonderful and exciting new places.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:35.783
Where has been your
favorite place to travel?

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.250
&gt;&gt; The question is where is my
favorite place to travel then?

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.250
That's honestly very
hard for me to answer.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.580
It's a -- I love thinking
about that.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.780
Many of the places in The Historian
are places I know very well.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.933
I lived there or I traveled there
long before I wrote the book.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:56.316
A couple of them I
didn't get to until

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.966
after I've finished the manuscript
either for research or even

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.893
after the book was published.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:02.970
So I had to do a tremendous
amount of research

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.090
to make sure I knew what those
places would have looked like,

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.343
smelled like, sounded like
at those particular periods

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.593
and it would be very hard for
me to choose but I have to say

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.506
that Bulgaria is extremely,
extremely close to my heart.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.820
My husband is from Bulgaria and I've
been going there off and on for more

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.666
than 20 years and I have a kind of
second life there where I know a lot

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.400
of writers, publishers but also a
lot of people who have nothing to do

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.663
with the literally world and are
very interesting people living

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.836
in a way that is some ways extremely
different from what I grew up with

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.726
and those, Bulgaria was such an
inspiration to me for The Historian.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.373
As you know it's-- it's-- if
you read the book about a third

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.426
of the novel is set in Bulgaria in
the 1950s and when I went back there

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.273
on book tour the book was touchingly
a huge success in Bulgaria

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.013
in Bulgarian translation and
when I went back there I met

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.440
so many wonderful writers
who were struggling,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.993
struggling to have any opportunity.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.860
It's hard to be a writer
anywhere but in Eastern Europe

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.233
after the collapse of communism,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.853
there was just no funding
for the arts.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.786
So a few years ago I
started a foundation

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.303
with the international
royalties from The Historian

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.243
to provide competitive
opportunities for writers

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.140
in Bulgaria, literary writers.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:38.393
It also provides opportunities for
American writers to go to Bulgaria

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:42.480
and work with translators
and with Bulgarian writers

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.160
so I really urge you
to check it out.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.796
It's become much bigger than
just my own project and if you

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:51.756
like to see the website for it.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.156
If you're a writer and you
like to apply for example,

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.223
it's www.ekf for Elizabeth
Kostova Foundation dot edu.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.773
Thank you for asking that.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.510
[ Applause ]

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.526
&gt;&gt; Actually I think you
just answered my question.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.563
I read The Historian as a
peace corp volunteer in Romania

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:18.800
on the Bulgarian border and I
was pretty surprised and please

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.446
that the spot on psyche and kind of
characters of the Eastern Europeans

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.993
in the book, so congratulations.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.653
How did your interest in Eastern
Europe start since we've already,

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.790
you just explained
where you've been?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:39.953
&gt;&gt; This-- that's amazing
that you did that, wonderful.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.453
It must have been a great
experience, peace corp in Romania.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.596
And I have been interested in
Eastern Europe since I was seven

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.573
because of my father's career
because he took us there

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.560
and we lived in Slovenia for about
six months so it was long enough

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.036
to really-- for us to
really get a feel for it.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.790
And I've stayed interested ever
since really and so did my parents,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.156
so it just seemed like a
natural place to set a novel

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.313
and I'm very pleased that it
seemed, with your experience there

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.746
which I'm sure was profound.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.680
I'm very pleased that
you found it accurate

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.453
for what you know people
there, so thank you.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.173
&gt;&gt; I also have a Bulgarian
directed question.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.100
My father-in-law escaped Bulgarian--
communist Bulgaria and so my husband

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:36.636
and I were thrilled to see
so much Bulgaria in the novel

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.073
and also I can see my father-in-law
and his personality and quirks

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.480
in the novel which was really fun

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.013
and I guess my followup
question is how much of that part

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.320
of the world Romania-Bulgaria
inspired your story

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.600
and how much did you have to
include all your great descriptions

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.333
of the scenery because of
the material that you chose?

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.540
Your family sounds very
interesting and again,

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:06.793
I'm glad it seemed accurate to you.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:08.726
I found that setting a book,
that writing a book about Dracula

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.246
of course makes Romania a
major topic and I really tried

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.970
to include scenery that seemed
to fit the story itself.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:23.700
The places, to have the characters
go to real places and many

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.620
of those places you can go.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.790
In fact I was sort of half
pleased, half horrified to hear

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.910
that there are historian tours
in both Bulgaria and Romania now.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.630
I really recommend that you-- I
mean they may be very good tours

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.700
but I recommend you just take
your backpack and get on the train

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.370
and ignore them because
you'll see much,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.390
probably much more off
the beaten path places.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:54.016
But I did try not to simply hit
famous places in those two countries

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.053
but to really incorporate
the story and the scenery

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.140
and they are beautiful countries.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.340
I mean, if any-- most

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.806
of you probably saw the
movie Cold Mountain.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:05.956
That was field in the
Carpathians in Romania

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:08.873
which is why the mountains don't
look quite right but they--

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:12.806
it's gorgeous, they are
wonderful countries to visit.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.883
Does that answer your question
or was there another part?

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.663
&gt;&gt; No the last three
has covered my question.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.970
Thank you.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:25.970
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.036
Good. I just wanna tell
one really quick story.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.020
When I was in graduate school I
was in a wonderful writing class

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.726
that included some graduate
students from other departments

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.380
at the University of Michigan.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:36.920
And there was a young woman there
who announced on the first day

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.373
when we had self-introductions
that she was from Romania and I was

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:45.176
in the middle of writing
The Historian

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.080
and I'm feeling pretty shy about it.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.013
I mean I wrote it in private,
mostly in private, for about--

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.400
for those 10 years and I went
over to her after class one day

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.840
and I said you know, I
was fascinated by the fact

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.666
that you said you're from
Romania and I just wanted--

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.013
I wondered if I could talk with you

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:05.740
because I'm writing a novel that's
partly about Romania and she looked

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:10.576
at me and she said
oh, that sounds great.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.863
I sure hope it's not about Dracula.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.513
So I'm afraid, you know, and
I have to add that she's one

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.233
of my best friends now and
she helped me enormously

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.093
with The Historian and ended
up really approving of the book

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.393
and helping me with the Romanian
dialect and Transylvanian customs

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.953
and is very knowledgeable.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.796
But I think that Eastern Europe
of course has had its share

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.610
of stereotypes and
so I've also tried

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.683
to stay away from some of those.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.700
Last question.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.033
&gt;&gt; Vampires have been a
real pop culture phenomenon

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.566
in the last couple of years.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.100
Did you know when you
started writing about vampires

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.826
that you would be part of this
whole plethora of books and movies

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.706
and TV shows about vampires?

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.313
&gt;&gt; You know when I
wrote The Historian,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.276
I have to say it was a
little bit before that wave

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.216
that has included the Twilight
series and all but it was

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.333
after Anne Rice and as I said,
I'm not really, to be honest,

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:17.110
I'm not a reader of genre vampire
literature so I wasn't very familiar

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.690
with a lot of those
books but I did--

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.343
I have been astonished
since then by this wave of--

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.123
this parade of vampires
into popular culture.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.400
I do think that this is nothing new.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.266
I mean, vampires live
up to their reputation

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.843
by never ever dying even
if you want them to.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:45.276
And I think it and this started
in about 1760 in literature

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.553
and it happens every 40,
50 years and I think again

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.773
in the mid 21st century when
everybody has forgotten this

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.183
and were on to something else,
vampires will come back and some

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.603
of us will be saying to
our grandchildren oh,

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.310
I think there was some kind

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.176
of vampire craze back
in about 2007 or 8.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.026
&gt;&gt; So it's-- I think it's the
nature of vampires and again,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.366
I think that speaks to the
power of myth in our lives

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.066
that we love this-- we love
and we love to hate this figure

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.026
of ourselves in the form of
the vampire, something human

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.086
but also evil, something
recognizable.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.273
It's a lot scarier and a lot more
interesting than say the blob

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.130
or something that doesn't
seem as close to us.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.193
I think we're fascinated by
that so for anybody who is

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.990
around in say 2065 or 70,
let's just keep an eye out

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.503
and see if they come back.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.083
Thank you so much for all
your wonderful questions.
