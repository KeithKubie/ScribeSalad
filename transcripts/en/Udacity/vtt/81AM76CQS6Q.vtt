00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, the next market type is a new market. Customers don't exist today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As the real questions are, if they don't exist, how will they find out about you?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And how will they even become aware that they need to be in this new market?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And by the way, how do you know the market size of something that doesn't even exist today?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The market size is zero and what factors should you create that the industry has never offered.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, a way to look at this is take a look at the chasm.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Man, this is scary. That is you can sell to the crazy people all you want.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The early evangelists, the early adopters, and that's nice but you'll have a small business

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
until you figure out how do we get the masses to adopt?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and here's what that hockey stick sales curve looks like.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here are the early people you're selling to and one of the mistakes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that start-ups and entrepreneurs and founders make, is look at that slope of those early sales,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and when you get them, you go great time to like kick up spending

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and look at this, our board is happy and when we start doing advertising

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and stepping up the company, but then it kind of declines

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and people scratch their heads on what's going on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What's going on is the mainstream market just hasn't adopted and this might go on for years

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and never kick in but if you're lucky, you'll hit a tipping point and market adoption happens.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And when it happens, it happens faster than you could imagine

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but at times, it takes longer to get there than you could imagine.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So in a new market, one of the things you need to be thinking about is that,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is there any possible way to move this curve in?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There's a couple of really interesting things to notice about in a new market.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One is this value of debt of almost no sales can continue for years.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, why is this important to know?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, just imagine  you're a start-up and you put together a nice financial forecast

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
for your board and your investors and they all believe that you are an existing market.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, they're expecting you to have revenue that increases every year.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Why? Because you've never asked the question what type of market am I in?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now, if you're in a new market, you now know that it's quite possible that you might have a curve

00:02:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that doesn't look like this but actually is flat for a long period of time.
