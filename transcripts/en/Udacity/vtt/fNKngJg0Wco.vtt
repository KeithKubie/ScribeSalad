00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.137
Let's say that we have some number, n. And to the left of it on the number line

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:08.053
is some number m. We're not exactly sure where it is but we know that it's

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.842
located to the left of n on the number line. Which statement then, best

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:14.791
describes the relationship between these two points?
