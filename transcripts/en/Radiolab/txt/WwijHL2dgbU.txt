Speaker 1:          00:01          Um, so we want to finish the night with a salute to a guy who's been on our program and part of our family pretty much from the beginning. I have known him for more than 35 years. Early on when radio lab started, I asked him if he'd help us out and send us a few story ideas. He didn't send us a few. He sent us bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine, hallucinations, music people. So many extraordinary people that he knew or found or help cause the guy just doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks.

Speaker 2:          00:37          [inaudible] is a guy who noticed

Speaker 1:          00:39          is everything, is deeply interested in everything that happens around him and to him. And tonight we're bringing them back on tape for what I'll ask may be his final offering for us. As many of you know, Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver cancer and he wrote about this in the New York Times. He said he plans to spend the time that he has a left writing, being with friends, not doing interviews, but he did agree to share his thoughts exclusively with us tonight for you gathered here. Um, cause he's one of our family. So as I've done for decades now, I went over to his house in Manhattan with my mic and I said to him, I just need to know like what, what just happened a month and a half ago? You were fine. And then what? Um, at the beginning of the year, I was fine. On the 3rd of January, I felt a little queer and I passed some dark urine. I thought had a little gallbladder attack and, um, didn't pay that much attention, but thought I better get things checked.

Speaker 3:          01:41          And, um, the extra day, which was expected, Ooh, need to show a couple of gallstones, showed hundreds of cysts in my liver. Uh, although my doctor said he didn't know what the, his one I would need further tests. I, I knew what they were. I said, it's happened.

Speaker 1:          02:05          And he was right. The doctors eventually confirmed at a cancer that had been found in his eye nine years ago had spread to his liver. Where you

Speaker 3:          02:15          frightened or relieved or console or what, what? No, I, um, I think my first feeling was one of, of overwhelming sadness. Um, now all sorts of things I won't see. Um, and I won't do one or two people have written to me in the, you know, consoling me and said, well, you know, we all die, but fuck it. It's not like we all die. It's like you have four months.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Has that, has your PR, what is your prognosis at this moment? Cause I know you had an eye. Oh, well if it gets revised, it depends on, of course, on how the cancer responds to and, or

Speaker 3:          03:00          how quickly it spreads so far. Um, the metastasis from my eye, uh, only in my liver I'm told they love liver. Actually. I love liver as well. And, and one of the magical things I did was to go and have liver and onions sued after the doctors and thinking that liver looks better than mine. He, this is what he's like, instead of being frightened by the thing is trying to kill him. He's thinking about loving liver and liver lovers and looking for connections and wondering. He doesn't stop. He, he just notices that the case in point a few months ago, his doctor said to him, we're going to run a line up your liver. And in effect we're going to try to shave off a star of some of the cancer cells first on one side, then on the other to see if we can give you a little more time.

Speaker 3:          03:46          But they weren't him as the metasticies die, they um, put out various unpleasant chemicals that may exhaust you, tax your system badly. And um, at one point, shortly after the procedures, I started talking a little strangely and um, as I was talking I was also writing, um, you'll be the first person to see this. So he showed me a notebook and we are showing it to you in just a moment. You can see they're sort of writing there on the left. It's all, he's writing a book, actually a children's book about the elementary table. But as he was writing, if you, if you look to the next page, if you can see that it gets a little bit wobbly, the letters and then, and then there was some crossing out there. I see. And then while the dramatically the lighting changes and actually there's, there's a large slash across it and then you, it seems a little incoherent at the partners.

Speaker 3:          04:46          Okay. And then it turns the pure scribble that has delirium and crept up on me. All this happened over the course of 10 minutes and I see what he's doing here. He's figuring, okay, I'm writing at a constant speed. I know pretty much how fast I write and so I can time this out. I can figure out exactly how long it took me to slip into delirium and then out of this delirium and he's doing this very, very sick man. It's science to write it out in a more medical way. I think this would form a lovely illustration you put in a timeline of delirium to us coming like that. Why aren't you more frack like unusual for any doctor and a man of science? You don't seem to worry at all when things become incoherent or strange. You're now showing it to me as if like, Ooh, how interesting. I was crazy here for a little bit. The truth is Oliver is fascinated by what goes on in the human mind no matter how strange he gets up there at one time when he was a young resident in California driving his bike. And by the way, I should show you what he looked like back then when he was driving his bike. This I think is him in New York, a kind of, you know,

Speaker 1:          05:58          in the 60s he was also a champion weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat. And in this picture that you showed you here, that's him raising 600 pounds in order to win a trophy. Like this is a that he was a champ. And, and you can see more pictures like these cause we have signed copies of Oliver's new memoir out for sale in the lobby. It's pretty good book too, by the way. So in any case at this time and the 1960s, in addition to being all muscled out, Oliver was a serious recreational drug taker. And because he's Oliver, he was extremely curious about his highs no matter how weird they were. One time for example, he took 20 pills that he shouldn't have. And then

Speaker 3:          06:39          to my surprise, um, uh, there was a spider on the wall which said hello. It had a voice like broken crosser and famous mathematician and it, um, it asked me a while, the technical question as to where the Russell had excluded free eagles paradox and um, we had this conversation answered the spider [inaudible] onto this fine discussed fracas paradox with this minor. I didn't deed cause you, you trust your perceptions. Okay. Many years later when I mentioned this to an entomologist, fed up Cornell and the philosophical spider, he said, yes. He said, I know the species.

Speaker 1:          07:21          So thinking Oliver's way, taking it all in, talking spiders, whatever the generosity of his curiosity becomes profoundly moving and transformative when he's treating his patients. I want to tell one story here really quickly to demonstrate what I mean. Oliver once had a patient whom he called Mrs o c she was an old woman. She was 88 years old living in a nursing home and one night she was awakened, jarred awake by a loud sound.

Speaker 4:          07:54          Um,

Speaker 1:          07:56          it was a song.

Speaker 4:          07:58          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:59          and she thought, well, somebody left the radio on, but when she looked, the radio in the room was off, her roommate sound asleep, which was odd because the song was really loud. Good. Doris. After that, there was another song

Speaker 4:          08:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:17          and then another song is a home. Mrs [inaudible] thought, well, maybe my roommate can't hear the songs because the songs are, are coming through the fillings in my teeth. I've heard that it's possible, but no, her doctors told her, this is something in your head, you need to see a neurologist, which led her to Dr Sachs

Speaker 1:          08:37          at when he met Mrs OSI, he, she could barely hear him. The song sung by the female voice were coming and coming. She was frightened and justifiably worried that she was going crazy. But Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going to do some tests. And when he was done, he said he'd found a slight stroke or condition that it triggered musical epilepsy. These sudden production of music in her brain. Now a normal doctor might say, okay, we've got the diagnosis, and he thought that the songs would probably fade and it will pass. So they would be done. But Oliver did not stop. He doesn't stop

Speaker 3:          09:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:10          he kept talking to her. She told him she was born in Ireland in the 1890s her father died before she was born. Her mother, when she was only five

Speaker 3:          09:21          often alone, she was sent to America to live for the welder for beating maison. She had no conscious memory at the first five years of her life, no memory of her mother of Ireland. She had always felt this as a key and painful sadness, this lack or forgetting of the earliest, most precious years of her life.

Speaker 1:          09:43          So we asked her about the songs, what are they like? And Mrs [inaudible] said, well, I think they're lullabies. Can you sing them for me? She did. And then after checking with, I'm not sure who al ever figured out that these songs were happened to be popular Irish ballads from the 1890s when Mrs OSI was a little baby and that gave him an idea. Now what he does next isn't science. It isn't in any traditional way medicine. He just told her a story and it goes like this. You know how nobody remembers anything that happens to you when you're one or two or three? Well, there was a theory once, not honored much today, but it sad that those earliest memories get locked away, deepen our brains in a special safe that we can never open. So let's suppose Mrs o see that you are stroked by some crazy chance. Open the lock that none of us can break and release those first memories in you just for a little while so that the voice you're listening to

Speaker 5:          10:40          there is a home [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          10:45          Maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's think that it's your mother's voice. Pat's your missing mother. And so at the ripe old age of 88 you finally get to be back in your mother's arms. You get to be a baby again, and Mrs z thought about that and said, okay,

Speaker 3:          11:02          it sort of fits. I'm an old woman with a stroke in an old people's home, but I feel I'm a child to Ireland. The Gate, I feel my mother's arms. I see her, I hear her voice seen

Speaker 5:          11:15          the green, it clean.

Speaker 4:          11:18          Who's Ron? [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          11:23          Shortly thereafter, the songs began to fade. The pauses widened. Mrs OSI had been so frightened by this music in her head was now sorry to see the songs go, but it was Oliver who noticed how those songs had touched her. Who noticed that the songs might become a comfort to her because that's what he does. He listens closely. He can hear another person's heart, and this is really the profound puzzles for me of Oliver because reading the new autobiography, you see that while he was so full of heart as a doctor in his own life and in the relationships that really mattered, it turns out he didn't get a whole lot of affection. He was, for a long time, a lonely guy. I'd say he was very lonely and he's talking about that now for the first time. Let me, let me talk about love for a minute. Um, in this book you tell the story of your, of your very first love a fellow by the name of Richard Selleck. Can you just tell me what happened with him?

Speaker 3:          12:22          Um, yeah. Um, he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond belief and I sort of fell for him. Um, although I didn't say anything because I was um, uh, very haunted by my mother's accusations. What did your mother well, to go a couple of years back then my father had opened a conversation that I was about to go to Oxford and have sort of father son conversation and he said, um, you don't seem to have many girlfriends. And I said, no, wishing the conversation would stop. He said, um, something wrong with girls. And I said, no, that they're fine. Perhaps you prefer boys. And I said, well, yes I do. I said, I've never done anything but I do. And then you knew that. Then I knew that. Then I'd known it for six years, probably since I was 12.

Speaker 3:          13:27          Um, and I said, don't tell mom she will be able to take it. But my father did tell my mother and the night and the next morning she came down with them. I somehow wants to say a face of funder and raged at me and among other things said, you're an abomination. I wish you would never been born. And then she suddenly shut up and said nothing for three days. And um, uh, the matter was never mentioned again in her lifetime. And then two years later I found myself for the first time in my life falling in love.

Speaker 1:          14:10          This was the gun guy, Richard Oliver at the time was in college.

Speaker 3:          14:14          It was a very positive feeling though. I didn't know whether it was one, which I did express, but I did say so with my heart and my mouth to each other. How about, did you remember what you said? I, I said, I'm in love with you. And Richard gripped me by the shoulders. And he said, I know. He said, but I'm not that way, but I love you in my own way. And um, I was glad I had said that I'm glad that has been received in such a, a warm, friendly way. I thought we might be friends for the rest of our lives. But then one day he came into me, he said he'd been bothered by finding a in his groin and he was worried could I have a look at it? And I looked at it and I felt it and it was hard and tethered and turned out to be a particularly malignant form of lymphoid Tema what was called a lympho sarcoma.

Speaker 3:          15:10          And, um, he never spoke to me again after that. I don't know whether since I had been the first to recognize the ominous import, I don't know whether he saw me as a harbinger of death or messenger of death, whatever. But you, you were left with the, with that silence. Yeah. Yeah. A few years later I'll ever met an man named Mel. He was young, he was a sailor. He like Oliver. He was into weight lifting, they became close friends and they began living together. I adored him and was in love with him and loved physical contact with him and they'd work out and they'd wrestle and ride motorcycles kind of tightly and they never talked about what might or might not be happening between them. But one day they were together and outer was giving male a back massage, which Mel often asked him to do. And uh, I love to do that.

Speaker 3:          15:59          And Oliver says sometimes he'd get a little, you know, excited. And so long as I gave no explicit indication, it was okay, but, but, but one day things went a bit too far and I got sort of, um, I went over the brief instead of just before the Brig. Um, Mel immediately sort of got up and had a shower and said, I, I can't stay with you anymore. And um, I found that very cruel and upsetting and heartbreaking and it made me feel, I don't want to have anything to do with people. I must've fallen in love and it cannot share lives with anyone again. And he didn't share his life with anyone for a long, long time. In fact, he told me a story about something that happened to him maybe eight years ago. I was just joining the faculty at Columbia and I was having a swiffer interview and a one point the interviewer said to me, she said, I have something whether private to ask you, we do like Ms Edgar, your system to leave.

Speaker 3:          17:06          And I said, no, she's privy to all my affairs. And I then said thinking she was going to ask me about sex. I said, I haven't had any sex for 35 years. I'm in fact what she was going to ask me, my social security [inaudible] first it's loft. And she said, Oh, you poor thing. She said, we must do something about it. Well, the truth is Oliver didn't do anything about it because he didn't think he could. I mean, he chosen, Richard lost, Richard Chosen Mail, lost mail. It wasn't the point he was thinking. And then finally, and who knows when or why these things happen to people. But a man came along who for the first chose

Speaker 1:          17:50          Oliver,

Speaker 3:          17:52          I have met Billy is I meet a number of people because I'd been sent a manuscript or proof for book and intimacy grew between us. I don't think I quite realized how deep it was. But then there was a particular episode in Christmas of Oh nine when he came up and in a sort of serious way, he has a serious careful way. He said, I, I have conceived a deep love for you. I have conceived a deep love for you. Yeah. Um, that is a story that's like got a few extra words I have conceived. Um, okay. Was He scared to say I love you or um, no, he likes the English language. I think it, I think it couldn't have been put, um, more cautiously and yet more strongly. I think it was a beautiful way of putting it. And then I realized at that moment with his saying that that I had conceived a deep love for him and I am among other things. I thought good goddess happened again,

Speaker 2:          19:10          two

Speaker 3:          19:11          and I'm in my 77th year and um, and, and what next two things, um, basically have gone happily ever since.

Speaker 2:          19:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:30          and supplies in me. Look, Leslie. Um, because then again, I'm not dealing with all what I'm dealing with a hoop. I'm dealing with an individual

Speaker 2:          19:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:45          I am not dealing with a, um, uh, a condition defined by medicine or law.

Speaker 1:          19:53          So Oliver's still doesn't know how much time he has left, but for the moment, as you can hear, his mind is totally intact. He's still writing. He has two books in addition to the one you'll find in the lobby, B that he's writing and the children's book, Bunch of New Yorker stories in the last few months and a New York review of books story. He's got energy to spare. So I want to do one last thing before we close. And this comes from yet another conversation I had with him. And it's a story. I know Oliver Wood heat because he's not a capital I religious kind of guy, but he is somebody who definitely embraces mystery. And for a long time he's been mystified by a color called Indigo, indigo, which Newton had inserted between blue and violent and no, no two people seem to agree as to what indigo was like. And so I built up a sort of chemical launchpad, meaning he took lot of drugs

Speaker 3:          20:49          [inaudible] base of amphetamine for general a while. So then some acid and a little cannabis. And when I was sufficiently stoned, I said, I want to see indigo now.

Speaker 2:          21:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          21:06          as if it were reply and does if phone by a giant paintbrush that appeared a huge trembling, pear shaped blob of what I instantly realized was pure indigo on the white wall in front of me. It had had a wonderful luminosity and in particular I am, although I am not a religious person, I thought this is the color of heaven.

Speaker 1:          21:35          And I lived towards it and I sort of ecstasy and then suddenly disappeared. And he says he had one more moment like that this time. No drugs. He was in a museum staring at an Egyptian artifact. He sees this re in color back again, just for a beat.

Speaker 3:          21:51          I was given five tantalizing seconds of, of, of radiant, ineffable beauty,

Speaker 1:          21:57          and then again, it vanished. And that was in 1965 and I've never seen an indigo since. But who knows? You know, someday I like to think Dr Sachs may get to see that color again.

Speaker 2:          22:21          [inaudible].
