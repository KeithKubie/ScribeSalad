 ANNOUNCER: THIS is Capitol TV.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.409
DEREK: Greetings citizens. Welcome to the
Coriolanus 9 solar thermal power plant in

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.740
the heart of District 5.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.320
This facility generates over 7% of our proud

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.980
Capitol’s energy needs.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.620
But did you know that you can generate electricity

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.180
from mere drops of water?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.520
I’m going to show you an experiment

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.710
that does just that.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.770
As we turn on the water, it falls
through these rings, and onto this mesh below.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.420
But look here. After a moment...

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.440
[Electrical buzz]

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.300
...there it is.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.040
It generates a spark of roughly 20,000 volts

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.000
of electricity. [Electrical buzz]

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.890
And there is no power source here,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.730
no turbine as in traditional hydro generation.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.450
In fact, there are no moving parts at all.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.619
We are creating electricity using only the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.740
intrinsic properties of falling water.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.360
So how does it work? Well, water contains

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.300
charged particles called ions.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.899
It has equal numbers of positive and negative

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.230
ions, so overall it’s neutral.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.011
However, as the water falls, there will sometimes

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.400
be a slight charge imbalance,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.579
with a little bit more negative charge over

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.080
here and a bit more positive charge there.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.180
Under ordinary circumstances, these variations

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.081
would even out over time, but not in this
case.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.629
Here is the ingenious part - the mesh on the

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:49.780
left is connected to the ring on the right.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.300
So if this mesh becomes negatively charged,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.140
then so does this ring.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.920
And now that ring will attract the positively

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.880
charged ions in the water,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.060
So the mesh on the right

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.020
will now be more positively charged

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020
meaning so is this ring

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.600
So what we have is a clear separation of charge.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.680
There’s a positively charged stream on the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520
right, and a negatively charged stream on
the left.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.119
And the more the charge builds up on the meshes,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.820
the faster that charge increases.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.120
And finally when we have reached our designed

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.620
operating voltage of 20,000 volts,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.319
electrons jump from the negative rings to

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.280
the positive ones through this spark gap...
[Electrical buzz]

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.240
DEREK: ...ionizing the air as they do so.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.380
We have created an electric generator with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.880
little more than a stream of water droplets.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.640
No field of mirrors or enormous coal-burning

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.040
plant is required

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.159
In fact, with access to the right

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.300
materials, you could even build this apparatus
at home.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.580
Thank you for your attention.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.600
We citizens of District 5 expand our knowledge

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.760
to better serve our great nation.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.100
Love your labor, take pride in your task.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.941
Our future is in your hands.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.020
And, don’t forget to register for updates

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.440
from Capitol TV…it’s mandatory.
