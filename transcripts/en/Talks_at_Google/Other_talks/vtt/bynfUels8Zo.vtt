&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: My name is Camille Hearst.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm a product managing
marketer at YouTube.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.660
And I'm very excited to be here
today with the cast and crew of Awkward Black

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.660
Girl.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.900
Let's give
them a warm welcome.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.640
[applause and cheering]

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.050
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Really excited about
the turnout so thank you all for

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.250
coming.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.359
What we'll do today is have a conversation
for

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.930
about half of the time.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.970
Then we'll screen an episode.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.040
Episode five: the party.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.559
[laughter] I can see a lot of
you have seen it already.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.559
&gt;&gt;Audience member: Love it

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.260
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And then we will go into
Q and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.640
A open to the floor.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.329
There's a mic over here that we ask
you to come and speak into the mic because

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.610
we have people
on VC which is video conferencing for those

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.120
out in
YouTube land.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.129
We're also recording this for YouTube
later that's also why we want you to use the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.129
mic.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.129
So
thanks for coming.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:53.129
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.970
For
those of you who are not familiar, Awkward

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.890
Black Girl is
the show about J, an awkward black girl who

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.560
navigates
the mine field of love, friendship and office

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560
politics.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.549
The series began in January 2011 so earlier
this year and

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.810
now consists of 12 episodes.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.499
At the beginning they
struggled with having enough money to continue

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.560
but were
able to raise over 56 thousand dollars through

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.340
an online
kick starter campaign that they promoted quite

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.340
a bit
through YouTube.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.619
And to date, Awkward Black Girl has 3
million views and counting so quite an accomplishment.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.039
So first I'd like to ask you all to introduce
yourself

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.880
and who you are in real life and who you are
on the show.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.290
&gt;&gt; Issa: So my name is Issa Ray and I'm just
a film maker,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.689
writer, aspiring producer.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.239
And in real life, J, the
character, is an extended version of me.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.289
I have my
awkward moments often and I really just like

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.909
to find the
humor in simple situations.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:56.909
Originally from LA.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.049
I don't
know this feels like a dating service.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.819
[laughter] That's me in a
nutshell.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.739
So I hope you pick me.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:08.739
[laughter]

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.739
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Okay.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.739
I'm contestant number 2.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.739
I'm a Gemini.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:18.510
[laughter] I'm
originally from the East Coast.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.790
Went to Stanford with Issa
and then went to USC film school to pursue,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.440
I guess, a
writing and producing career.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.459
Graduated last year, May of
2010, and linked up to co-produce and write

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.730
the show with
Issa.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.359
And I also play the probably most hated character
on the show.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.459
[laughter] Her name is Nina.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.510
She's a bitch;
everyone doesn't like her.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.959
Yeah, so that's me in a
nutshell.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.099
&gt;&gt; Female presenter: What's your real name.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.099
&gt;&gt;Tracy: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.099
I didn't tell you my name?

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.099
I'm Tracy Oliver.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.550
&gt;&gt;Madison: My name is Madison Shockley.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.590
I like long walks on the
beach.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.879
[laughter] I play Fred on the show but in
real life I'm an

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.409
entrepreneur, marketer, and just loving life.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.409
[chuckles]

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.680
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Great.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.030
So what is Awkward Black Girl?

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.040
Where did it
come from?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.090
What's your inspiration?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.069
How did this whole
thing begin.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.150
&gt;&gt; Issa: So as I mention I do have several
awkward moments in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.480
life and I come from a really, really awkward
family.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.390
My
mom is the queen of awkward.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.340
Her moments are ridiculous.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.720
Like as a family, we once walked into the
wrong funeral.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.340
[laughter] And had to leave quietly.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.750
We walked in late
to the funeral.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.709
Things like that and just as a family we
always would laugh at these simple moments

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.379
and we come
home and we share these moments together like,

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.180
you know.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.250
And something that I thought only we found
funny and then

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.879
as I started making friends, we'd share that
humor.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.470
And I
grew up watching shows like The Office and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.079
30 Rock.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.109
I didn't grow up
watching--.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.920
[laughter] But yeah.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.689
I love shows like The Office, Arrested Development,
.

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.459
Parks and Recreation.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.450
And that humor just resonated with
me but I felt like once again the humor wasn't

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.420
really
present in shows of color.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.389
And so, I felt that void and
I thought that it would be funny to put the

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.590
two elements
together.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.000
And so, I decided I wanted to make it an
animated series originally but I just didn't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.220
have the
money to do that.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.990
And so, after, you know, two years of
sitting on the idea, m I read an article in

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.720
Clutch magazine
and they were asking where's the black Liz

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720
Lemon?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.110
And I was like, "no, that's my idea; I need
to do it".

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.930
[laughter] So instead of
putting the money to do an animated series

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.820
I just decided
to shoot it guerilla style.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.099
Called up my friend Andrew, who plays A on
the show, and my best friend, Devyn, to like

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.860
--who had no film experience--
I asked her to help me shoot it and that's

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.430
how the show
was born.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.560
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's great.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.479
Who are the inspirations for the
characters.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.110
&gt;&gt; Issa: My pet peeves in life are the inspirations
for the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.110
characters.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.990
I really -- for example the boss lady when
she asks -- in Episode 2 she asks all these

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.740
questions about Jay's hair after
it's cut it off.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.640
She said, "Is that how your ancestors
wore it?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.210
Is that why you wear it?" [laughter] And I
actually had a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.849
teacher in sixth grade who asked that if I
wore my hair

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.729
naturally because I was honoring my ancestors.

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.120
[laughter] And then
like Baby Voice.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.479
Baby Voice, Darius, comes from my pet peeve
of having to ask

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.210
people to repeat themselves because I feel
rude asking

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.889
you to, you know, I'm sorry I didn't hear
you and they'll

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:38.910
be like.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.290
[laughter] One more time and I'll be like.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.270
[laughter] So things like that.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.480
Different pet peeves in
life, different awkward moments that come

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.750
from those
characters.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.310
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Tracy, Madison, where do you
draw inspiration when

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.580
you're playing Nina and Fred respectively?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.250
&gt;&gt;Tracy: Nina is pretty much that girl or
guy that everyone has

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.250
encountered.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.680
That person on the job that takes their job
too seriously [laughter] or that person who

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.990
shows up to class ten
minutes before class starts or the person

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.270
in high school
that stays after to ask the teacher questions

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.790
and people
are trying to leave.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.169
[laughter] It's -- she's pretty much that
type

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.050
A person who is kind of a go getter and that's
something

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.199
I guess to admire but she's also -- she's
mean and kind

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.860
of vicious and kind of a bully.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.360
And I think, playing her,
I had to draw on those experiences from middle

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360
school.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360
I
think middle school and high school are the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.290
times in your
life that you feel most like an outcast.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.470
And I try to
think of like the mean girls, the most popular

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.759
girls in
high school that pretty much either tormented

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.819
me or that I knew.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.090
So it's kind of ironic that I'm playing them
now because

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.940
I was not that person at all growing up.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.449
But that's what I try
to channel -- the people that I know and have

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.830
encountered
throughout different times of my life that

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.260
I couldn't
stand.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.260
[chuckling]

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.909
&gt;&gt; Madison: Yeah, Fred is like the guy -- he's
a hard working guy.

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:09.430
He's the guy in the office though that doesn't
really --

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.710
is not really aware of the attention he gets
from the

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.310
women in the office.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:21.539
[chuckles] But he's an easy going, nice guy,
hard working, and that's kind of who I am,

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:22.759
in general, too,
so.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.139
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So you are Fred in many ways.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.139
&gt;&gt; Issa: Woo.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.139
[laughter]

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:29.569
&gt;&gt; Madison: In some ways, yeah.

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:31.970
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Do you play the guitar over
your shoulder at home to

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.970
practice that?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.180
&gt;&gt;Madison: I did practice that for a week
straight to get it

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.180
down.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.030
Almost knocked my head off trying to do it,
too.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.449
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That's great.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.110
So did you set out to make an Internet only
hit or

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.409
were there greater aspirations for the show.

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.949
&gt;&gt;Issa: Honestly, in putting it out.

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.490
I wanted to just expand
my portfolio.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.819
I had two other web series before that.

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:55.930
The second one was sort of gaining popularity
and I

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.050
wanted to take advantage of that audience
and you know

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.539
once I put out the series I didn't really
-- I didn't

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.440
expect for anyone outside my friends and family
to spread

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
it.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.509
So I didn't have necessarily high hopes for
the web

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:10.741
series but I did have high hopes for the brand
because I

00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:15.680
did think awkward and black, in and of itself,
was something different and

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.000
wasn't represented.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.789
So I thought the web series would
accompany that brand.

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.229
And so, yeah I didn't have high
hopes initially.

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:26.229
So.

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:30.020
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You talked a little bit about
your prior projects.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.020
What were they?

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.020
You said two other web series?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.020
&gt;&gt;Issa: Yes.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.220
When I was at Stanford, I created a web series
called, "Dorm Diaries."

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.710
Forgot what it was called; Dorm Diaries.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.160
And it was about being black
at Stanford.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.170
And I was trying to like procrastinate
writing a paper one day and I had the idea

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.240
to the series
and I just went to the Stanford's library,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.130
went to their equipment, wrote a script
really quickly.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.190
Contacted people like Tracy to be in it.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.660
I wanted to take advantage of Facebook.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.690
Facebook's Posted
Items feature just came out and people were

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.060
sharing
articles and YouTube videos.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.320
And I was like how cool
would it be to make a YouTube video for people

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320
to share on campus.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.630
I felt like this would spread and it did.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:14.080
And people outside of Stanford, like people
at Howard, at

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.780
Duke were like, "I really identify.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.270
This is my black experience in
college."

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.940
I felt like there was something there.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.100
And so,
my second web series was called FLY GUYS present

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.100
the "F" Word.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.510
And it was
just about an LA group trying to make it in

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.070
the music
industry.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.060
It was a mockumentary.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.060
And same premise.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.370
That's the first time I started taking the
web really,

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.630
really seriously.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.200
Would have like these production
Meetings on Monday where we would sit down

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.420
together and
spread the word about the series.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.540
We would put out every
Monday faithfully.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.850
I just started taking the Internet
seriously and YouTube seriously.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.590
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Stanford really is a great place
for innovating ideas

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.780
whether it's in tech, in the arts.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.280
Tracy also worked on a
few projects at Stanford; you want to talk

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280
a little bit
about those.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.460
&gt;&gt;Tracy: I did.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.350
I came from like the theater space.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.420
I pretty
much -- which sounds crazy--, went to Stanford

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.290
wanting to
pursue theater [laughter] even though people

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.750
don't see Stanford like
that.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.850
It's a great place to kind of cultivate a
lot of

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.370
artists because there is a lot of grants and
resources

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.200
and fellowships that really supported us.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.360
And coming in,
I started this company called Blackstage and

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.760
it was a
theater company.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.460
And just through that, we were able to
do original productions that Issa adapted

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.070
and directed
and also productions that I would direct and

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.350
write and
act in.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.840
I directed the Wiz when I was there.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.270
Did like
a lot of productions.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.450
Vagina Monologues and For Colored Girls, we
both

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.620
acted in together.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.380
So we did several productions at
Stanford.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.720
Then when I graduated, I went to USC film
school.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.150
Did a few short films there.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.940
I'm currently
working on feature as well that I'm working

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.810
with Morgan
Freeman on.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.140
That's what I do outside of Awkward Black
Girl is I also write.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.690
&gt;&gt;Madison: I kind of came from the opposite
end of the spectrum

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.690
as they did.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:10.100
I dropped out of community college to start
my own business.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.950
Started a recording studio, recording
local artists and doing artist development.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.810
And then
also working for an independent record company

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.270
as a
marketing director.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:27.070
Did a national album release for MLK
records in association with SCLC.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.510
And that's kind of my
background.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.740
&gt;&gt; Presenter: No acting experience for you.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.740
&gt;&gt; Madison: No.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.740
This is my first time acting.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.740
&gt;&gt;Presenter: How are you enjoying it.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.740
&gt;&gt;Madison: I'm enjoying it.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.740
&gt;&gt; Issa: We were in a church play together.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.740
I would like to put on.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:45.160
Madison likes and I put on one of
my first plays in church and he was in it.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.000
I think he
played Jesus.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.040
[laughter] How dare you.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.810
&gt;&gt; Madison: I've only acted with Issa my whole
life.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.810
[laughter].

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.440
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I feel like I should have a
witty thing to say.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.070
I
don't want to get in trouble with Jesus jokes.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.170
[laughter] I already said too much.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.060
So let's move into
our uncomfortable controversial subjects section,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.740
on that
note.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.810
So can you talk a little bit about your decision
to use the N word in the show.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.870
If any thought went into
that, what thought did, and if anything didn't,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.040
what do you think of it in
retrospect.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.410
&gt;&gt; Issa: In creating the show I always say
this but I wanted to

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:36.370
create a character whose raw and unfiltered
thoughts were

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.350
put out there, essentially.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.970
And like a lot of the
feedback that we get is people find our show

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.080
funny but
they wish we wouldn't use the N word because

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.820
they don't
use it and they feel like it's vulgar.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.580
In my mind, I say, like
even if you don't use the word, you've thought

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.580
it.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.820
[laughter] If
someone's done something you'll be like this

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.040
-- umm.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.400
So
that's a real thought.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.440
Think about it -- J's passion
and what she does in her spare time is she

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.260
writes violent
rap lyrics to help her get through things.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.870
[laughter] Just kind of
rap uses that word a lot.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.280
There's so many phrases and sayings
in rap culture that are used.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.770
So naturally J would
embrace that.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.770
I mean -- at the end of the day this is
satire.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.660
It's supposed to be representative of what
real

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.890
life is.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.260
Real life is the N word.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.260
[laughter].

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.590
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Quotable, right.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.050
&gt;&gt;Madison: That's a t-shirt--
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I was at the Kanye West/Jay-Z

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.820
Watch the Throne show last night and they
perform "All of the Lights".

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.280
There's a line in there when he
says about Michael Jackson, our N word there.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.310
And he said I
want everybody in the audience to yell this

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.310
out.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.430
Black
people give everyone a pass just for right

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.830
now.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.240
[laughter] It's
interesting to see how.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.390
&gt;&gt; Issa: That's very interesting.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.770
&gt;&gt; Presenter: The N word continues to evolve.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.670
[chuckles] Plays a role in our
culture.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So speaking of offensive topics,
there's a recent

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:14.100
Internet controversy with the Feminist Collection
or

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.110
Collective which is an online blog or community
which is

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.160
LGBT community and they posted an open letter
offended about

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.150
the use of the T word which not all of us
knew that it was

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.920
offensive to the extent this group found it;
this community found it.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.240
So can
you talk a little bit about your response

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.830
and what these new controversies mean to you
in the further development of the show?

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:45.330
&gt;&gt;Issa: Yeah, like as you mention we weren't
aware that the T

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.900
word was a slur at the time.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.770
And it's really -- it's
actually odd because the original -- the original

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.300
line
was -- oh, I can't even say any of that.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.360
[laughter] But the actress
accidentally said that but we kept it in there

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.850
because it
still worked.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.910
But in doing the show, as I mention, it is
satire and it is everyday speak.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:13.450
A lot of these
characters -- we tackle so many subjects that

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.680
many people
consider offensive.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.890
And so, we put that in line.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.820
The
character CeCe, for example, just does questionable

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.270
and
says questionable things and that fit in with

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.270
her
character.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:31.780
And in a particular scene, J was going
through sort of like a heartbreak and this

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.100
other girl
comes into the picture and CeCe said this

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.830
particular
statement to make J feel better.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.000
And when the Crunk Feminist Collective, the
CFC

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.340
approached us about it, they wrote a respectful
open

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.340
letter.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.340
They're fans of the series.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.160
I wanted to
acknowledge it because they were one of the

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.440
first groups
to support Awkward Black Girl in the beginning

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.330
when we
had less than 1,000 fans, they were there

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.330
promoting the series.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.020
I felt like we owe them at
least an acknowledgment of what they were

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.750
saying even
though I didn't necessarily agree with the

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.720
fact that we
were targeting them or we were being hateful.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.940
I understood where they were coming from and
why that word could be offensive.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.590
We wanted to say, "hey we
hear you.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:16.500
We don't mean to offend you, to hurt you but
this is something we struggle with."

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.270
We walk this line
every single -- not every day -- every episode.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.270
What's
offensive what's not.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.070
You might want to add to that.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.600
&gt;&gt; Tracy: The irony in the situation is that
when we were in the

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.220
writer's room and we're coming up with episodes,
as Issa

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.280
just mentioned, we struggle with the issue
of being

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.310
politically correct versus incorrect all the
time and

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.580
what's appropriate and what's not appropriate.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.130
This
particular word -- T word -- we didn't even

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.410
know was any
kind of slur.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:55.040
It was the one word that we didn't even
debate it because we were that unaware of

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.680
its meaning
and the history that it now represents.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:02.450
We were unaware
of the violent history of that word.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.360
Other times that we
use the N word or we bring up social issues,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.549
it's
intentional.

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:13.549
It's deliberate time we're trying to bring
certain issues to light so we can talk about

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:14.549
it.

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:16.279
And
through certain characters like Sister Mary

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:20.630
being this
kind of like hypocritical Christian and then

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.089
Boss Lady
who is really down with black culture but

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.319
says really
culturally insensitive things.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.049
Or Amir who is racially
ambiguous so he can insult anybody ask and

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.179
get away with it
because nobody knows who he is.

00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:36.600
We do these things all
the time.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.059
Sometimes it's inappropriate to certain groups
of people and we're either unaware of it or

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:44.120
we're doing
it to bring those issues to life.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.300
With the T word, it was
just unawareness of it.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:52.250
Like Issa said now that we are
made aware of it and we realize it was offensive

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.799
to the
LGBT community, it's something we're aware

00:17:55.799 --> 00:17:57.929
of and we're
not going to do again.

00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:03.750
But that was not a deliberate
attempt to demean or cause harm to any member

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.750
of that
group.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.929
&gt;&gt; Presenter: The way I look at it you say
a lot of offensive things

00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:09.140
on the show.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.639
It's kind of the intent behind it in order
to promote dialogue or promote laughter.

00:18:14.639 --> 00:18:15.809
&gt;&gt; Issa: Absolutely.

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:20.529
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, let's move onto lighter
subjects [chuckles] and talk a

00:18:20.529 --> 00:18:22.590
little bit about heartthrobs.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.139
So where's CeCe?

00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:27.899
We had an
audience specifically from one of our fellow

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:28.899
Stanford.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:29.899
There you are.

00:18:29.899 --> 00:18:31.100
Dante in the back.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:35.799
So where is CeCe since
we know we got a few fans in the audience?

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:37.200
&gt;&gt; Issa: CeCe's chilling at home.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.010
She actually has to work.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.350
But this is so sad Dante.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.350
[laughter] Yeah.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.269
But yeah, she would
love to be here.

00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:48.009
She just couldn't.

00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:51.000
&gt;&gt; Madison: A lot of people don't know what
CeCe is and she's

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Indian.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.049
So I'll clarify that.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.259
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Thanks.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.090
And so, Madison.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.850
I keep wanting to call you
Fred.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.500
How does it feel like to be a heartthrob?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.530
Has your dating helped since being on the
show.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.529
&gt;&gt; Madison: It's helped a little bit.

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:10.210
It's definitely changed since being on the
show.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.263
[laughs] They
do a really good job of making me look good

00:19:13.263 --> 00:19:17.539
on the
screen, writing for my character.

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:20.370
Yeah, no -- it's way
different.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.409
In public, people recognizing me.

00:19:23.409 --> 00:19:25.899
Want to
take pictures and stuff.

00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:26.899
So yeah.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.809
It's a lifestyle
change.

00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:31.139
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So people do recognize you in
public?

00:19:31.139 --> 00:19:32.139
&gt;&gt; Madison: Yeah.

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:33.139
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That's incredible.

00:19:33.139 --> 00:19:34.139
&gt;&gt; Presenter: How about you Tracy?

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:37.500
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Yeah, so I get recognized and usually
it's not a

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.509
pleasant experience.

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:42.830
[laughter] Because most people think I'm not
acting for some reason.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:48.429
So even if I'm with them or with
anybody in the cast they'll be, "Hey Fred!

00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:49.539
Hey J. Oh."

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:53.620
And then they just don't even want to speak
or say

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.620
anything.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.559
I get the worst side eyes ever.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.279
So I'm not
Nina.

00:19:58.279 --> 00:20:00.990
I'm really pleasant and nice in real life.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.420
I get
recognized and I get really serious side eye.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:12.600
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So J -- sorry Issa -- how did
you learn to rap so

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.080
well?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:21.830
&gt;&gt;Issa: I've always had just a fascination
with rap.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.000
And my
little brother and I -- no -- ever since like

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.230
again sixth
grade I tried to start a rap group in every

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.440
grade.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:37.110
[laughter] And
like, I was the only ' bout it one.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:45.090
And my little brother
and I actually were a duo.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.890
We were a rap duo.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.890
We were called --. Never mind.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:49.890
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Presenter: No, no -- continue.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:50.890
What were you called?

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.890
&gt;&gt; Issa: We were called JoLeDi but it doesn't
make sense.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.890
It's our names.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.890
It's the
first letters of our names.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.890
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Is this Enimal?

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:55.890
.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.890
&gt;&gt; Issa: Enimal.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.890
Yeah, my brother and we would rap together.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:58.890
We had a
song Bang Bang.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.890
It was a hit in the house.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:00.890
And then
when I went away to college he actually pursued

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.890
rap and
got really, really good.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.450
And I got kind of jealous
because we were in this together initially.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.450
And he started
his own rap group.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.860
So I really started focusing and I
just love rap.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.700
I just love hip hop.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.710
I would free style
when I would be under the influence of alcohol.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.029
[laughter] And
since then I just never let it go.

00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:19.909
I thought it would be
fun to incorporate this love of rap.

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:24.880
This love of
raunchy, ratchet hip hop into that character.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.559
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Can you do a ratchet rap for

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:30.110
us right now.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.210
&gt;&gt; Issa: CeCe is not here so.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.350
Yeah, she's my beat.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.980
&gt;&gt; Presenter: You need a beat?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.039
&gt;&gt; Issa: Okay.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:41.820
&gt;&gt; Issa: Yeah, you going to give me a beat?

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.820
&gt;&gt;Presenter: [ beatboxes].

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.029
&gt;&gt; Issa: Sitting ere at Google.

00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:50.549
You all just oogling but I'm just me
and I'm just flowing.

00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:53.320
Got my girl Tracy and Madison with
me.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.140
This is real crazy because we're here for
ABG.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.400
And I'm so tough.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
I'm
on the mic rough.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:06.150
And I'm just going to keep going until
you say stop.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:14.200
Stop!
[laughter] [applause].

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.950
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That will be on YouTube later.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.149
[laughter] Thank
you.

00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:22.330
&gt;&gt; Madison: You all got a guitar in the house?.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.330
[laughter]

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.900
&gt;&gt; Presenter: I think he's going to go get
one actually.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.850
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: So why is Awkward Black Girl

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.850
successful?

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.620
There are a
lot of other shows, web series, that are built

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.820
just for
the Internet.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.419
What is it about ABG that you think has
made it take off?

00:22:37.419 --> 00:22:40.990
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Sure, I think the thing we hear
most often is that it's

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:42.830
relatable.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:48.190
I think if you come just from the awkward
point of view, first of all, almost everybody

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.610
can relate
to those awkward moments that we touch on

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.920
on the show.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.110
Walking down the hallway.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.710
Especially if you work in the
office building.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.889
You see the same people every day and
several times in one day.

00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:05.039
[laughter] Do I have to keep smiling and
say hello every time I pass this person?

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:07.720
And it's
awkward for the person that's stationary -- the

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.820
receptionist or somebody that keeps having
to see this

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.820
person walk past them.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.789
And that's something we can
always relate to.

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:19.190
The thing that Issa and I bond off of
because we're both semi-awkward.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.990
And at Stanford we would
just have these awkward moments happen a lot.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.400
And we
were in the airport recently and had like

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.740
another awkward
moment where -- we had one yesterday, too.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.970
Yeah, I'll
just explain this one where we were getting

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.059
off the plane
and like the person we got seated next to

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:39.190
was kind of a
celebrity person.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.190
&gt;&gt; Issa: She was on Top Model.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.049
&gt;&gt; Tracy: She was on Top Model and we both
--

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:43.950
&gt;&gt; Issa: Well, this is broadcast.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.620
We don't want her to know that.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.919
&gt;&gt; Tracy: She's on Top Model and we're both
like "Oh, she's on Top Model" and we're talking

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:54.610
about her even
though she's sitting next to me.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.490
Anyway, we got off the
plane and both of us had to go to the bathroom

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.130
and then
she was going to the bathroom.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.529
And we both needed to go
really badly.

00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:06.529
&gt;&gt;Issa: We'd already said "bye"
&gt;&gt;Tracy: We said bye to her.

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:10.950
[laughter] And we're like bye
girl and we went in separate directions and

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.299
realized we
were headed to the same bathroom.

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:17.340
So in order to not
have to see her again, we walked like -- and

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.980
extra, like,
mile to the nearest restroom.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.799
Having to go really badly
just to avoid seeing her again because we

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:24.799
said bye.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.490
So
it's like -- so we do these really awkward

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.910
drawn out
things all the time just make notes of them

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.149
put them in
the show.

00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:33.940
You guys can relate to that kind of stuff.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.289
So
it's not even just about race.

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:40.119
It's about like the universal
awkwardness we all go through.

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:45.659
I also think just the
cast being primarily filled with people of

00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:49.350
color --
there's not a lot of shows that display us

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.110
in those
lights.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:56.429
Because the thing is, all of us are awkward
and

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:59.630
nerdy and have all these weird quirks about
us, but I

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.630
don't really see that.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.649
I see us as being sassy and
really cool and really suave and put together

00:25:05.649 --> 00:25:07.909
or really loud or
obnoxious or whatever.

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:11.170
Be we don't really see normal
people that like I went to school with or

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.000
that remind me
of my friends and family.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.440
So I think we're showing a
different side of what it's like to be of

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.320
color and be
quirky and awkward.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.529
So I think the awkwardness is
relatable.

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:27.299
Just being of color and having that element
adds to it.

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:32.960
&gt;&gt; Madison: I would say it's also successful
because of the spirit

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.899
that we have among each other.

00:25:34.899 --> 00:25:40.019
And contributing and
helping get things done and move the project

00:25:40.019 --> 00:25:41.480
forward.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.639
That's been a big part of the success of our
project.

00:25:45.639 --> 00:25:47.309
Because it can be extremely hard.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:51.050
As probably a lot of
you know to coordinate a lot of people to

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.309
work on your
project without any money and without -- and

00:25:55.309 --> 00:25:57.919
that's
something that Issa did remarkably.

00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:58.950
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Great.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:04.899
Well, we wish you much continued success on
YouTube and beyond hopefully.

00:26:04.899 --> 00:26:09.809
And next we will go into a
screening of episode 5 the party.

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:16.840
[audience member hoots]
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Awesome.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.460
&gt;&gt; Issa: Just sit here?

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:29.490
&gt;&gt; Presenter: It's kind of awkward.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:36.510
&gt;&gt;Madison: Should we sit down?

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:42.130
&gt;&gt;Tracy: This is awkward.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.539
[laughter].

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:44.950
[music].

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:57.590
&gt;&gt; J: In my mind, I'm the best dancer ever.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.399
[rhythmic

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.799

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:19.149
Show me something.

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:25.000
You can do it; put your
back into it.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.679
I can do it put your ass into it.

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:39.210
You can
do it put your back into it.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.389
Put your ass into it.

00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:47.570
Put
your ass into it.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:55.090
[rap] tic-tic-boom, hear me banging down these
back streets.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.100
Bumpin' Blackstreet, fiending like an athlete.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:25.470
Life ain't a track meet, no, It's a marathon.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:35.100
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried
on.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:47.039
&gt;&gt;CeCe: [claps hands] J you need to focus.

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:53.929
We need to figure out this
dancing situation.

00:28:53.929 --> 00:29:02.509
&gt;&gt; J: [Coughing] You know I think I caught
something from

00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:03.509
Patty.

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:05.570
It's not feeling so good.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.629
I'm just going to stay
home.

00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:11.179
&gt;&gt; Cece: You're full of shit.

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:13.929
Look, Fred actually invited you tonight.

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:19.679
You've been
trying to get close to him forever.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:24.149
Here's your
non-stalker's chance to do it.

00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:25.429
&gt;&gt; J: Fine.

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:26.710
You're right.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:33.740
&gt;&gt; Cece: Besides you're not the only person
in the world who

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.019
can't dance.

00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:39.489
I'm an okay dancer but what makes me a
great dancer?

00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:40.489
This.

00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:45.809
[demonstrating] [music begins] I whip my hair
back and forth.

00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:49.819
I whip my hair
back and forth.

00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:58.970
&gt;&gt; J: I hate to say this but hair is the best
thing to

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.840
happen to rhythmless non-blacks.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.840
&gt;&gt;Cece: See?

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.039
You just work the hair and nobody knows you
can't dance -- oh, right.

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.039
Sorry.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.760
&gt;&gt;J: You know what?

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.399
Just forget it.

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:14.879
I got him a card.

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:23.190
I'll give it to him at work.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.269
No big deal.

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:30.129
&gt;&gt; Cece: No -- you're giving it to him.

00:30:30.129 --> 00:30:31.509
In person.

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:32.509
Tonight.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:38.440
And then you're going to make out with him.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.830
Get dressed.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.220
We're leaving.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.679
&gt;&gt;J: [heavy sigh]
[slow music]

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:46.759
&gt;&gt;Male DJ: Yeah.

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:49.529
[music picks up rhythm].

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:52.309
&gt;&gt; J: I hate parties.

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.389
They're so competitive.

00:30:54.389 --> 00:31:03.340
A blatant
contest of luxe, style and sex moves.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.739
I'm so above that.

00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:07.330
[music]
&gt;&gt;Cece: There he is.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.330
Go.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.330
Go.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.330
&gt;&gt;J: Fred.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.330
&gt;&gt;Fred: J, you made
it..

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.570
&gt;&gt;J: I just got you this card.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:19.119
Not a big deal or anything.

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:24.580
&gt;&gt;Fred: Aw, that's so nice.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.669
Thank-you.

00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:32.340
&gt;&gt; J: Is it weird I glued the card shut so
he needed my

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340
help.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.510
&gt;&gt;Nina: Damn girl.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.700
I didn't know Fubu made dresses.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.700
&gt;&gt; J: Nina.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.690
We're not at work.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:48.130
&gt;&gt; Nina: Well, it's Saturday night.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:55.860
Have you been taking our
drugs?

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:07.440
&gt;&gt; Fred: I cannot get this card open for nothing.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.020
&gt;&gt;J: Oh.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.309
Just.

00:32:11.309 --> 00:32:13.880
You know.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:21.610
&gt;&gt; Nina: I can help with that.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.190
&gt;&gt;J: Umm --

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:31.909
&gt;&gt; Nina: [reading] Oh, happy birthday, Fred.

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:39.620
Thanks for being the reason
I haven't quit.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.620
[giggles]

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.059
&gt;&gt; Nina: That's so cute.

00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:44.740
Another work reference.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.790
&gt;&gt; Fred: Thank you, J . Look, look -- grab
a drink.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.480
Enjoy
yourself, okay?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.660
&gt;&gt;Male DJ: [music] She want it, I can tell
she want it

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:08.809
Want me to push up on it 'fore she know when
I'm all on it

00:33:08.809 --> 00:33:17.840
We get the party going, liquor flowing, this
is fire

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.669
50 and Jeremih, number 1, there's nothing
higher

00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:25.019
&gt;&gt; J: Everybody from the office is here.

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:32.289
Why did I think I
was special?

00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:43.329
&gt;&gt; Cece: Why is Nina dancing with Fred?

00:33:43.329 --> 00:33:52.799
&gt;&gt; J: My comebacks weren't fast enough.

00:33:52.799 --> 00:34:03.839
&gt;&gt; Cece: Is she trying to get pregnant?

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:13.310
&gt;&gt; J: Let's get out of here.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:19.620
This party is lame.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.740
&gt;&gt; Cece: No, it's not.

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:33.510
I'm having a great time.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:43.290
You need to
loosen up.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.110
Get a drink.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:54.830
Go dance with some hot guy.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:35:06.400
&gt;&gt; J: Thirsty Bitch is dancing with my hot
guy.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.550
&gt;&gt; EnimaL: Hey, what's up.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:16.690
&gt;&gt; Cece: What's up Papa?

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.550
&gt;&gt; EnimaL: I'm enimaL.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.380
&gt;&gt; Cece: I be CeCe.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.410
What it do?

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.410
it?

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.410
&gt;&gt; EnimaL: It do.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.410
I guess.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.010
&gt;&gt; Cece: That's what's up bud.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.630
That's what's up.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.090
&gt;&gt; EnimaL: Hey, I'm going to get some drinks.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.090
You stay like
right here.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.090
&gt;&gt;Cece: Alright, play on.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.390
&gt;&gt;J: Why does CC sound like a contemporary
slave.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.300
What was that?

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:49.040
&gt;&gt;Cece: Black guys love when I talk like that.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.930
&gt;&gt; J: He walked off.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:58.750
&gt;&gt; Cece: He's getting his drink, see?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.670
Oh, hell no.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.670
Ruth!

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.580
&gt;&gt; J: Great.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.470
Now I'm by myself.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.410
[rhythmic music].

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:16.960
&gt;&gt; J: Standing alone at parties is the clearest
indication

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.990
that nobody wants you.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:24.540
Should I try to make friends?

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.050
[rhythmic music].

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:31.170
&gt;&gt; J: Do I need to act like I'm having a great
time?

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.220
Are
people looking at me?

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.250
Maybe if I dance next to this guy
he'll recognize his urge to dance with me.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:41.460
&gt;&gt;J: If this party is a competition, I'm losing.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:47.430
Could
things get any worse?

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:54.590
&gt;&gt; A: I brought you a drink.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:59.360
&gt;&gt;J: I'm allergic so.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:12.490
&gt;&gt;A: But you were
drinking the night we passionately made love.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:20.840
&gt;&gt;J: We did not f-ing make love.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:28.000
We had sex!.
[loud scratching noise]

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.160
&gt;&gt;J: It was a f-ing mistake.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:43.170
I never want to see you again; I was drunk.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:49.040
So get out of my
life.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.220
[slaps cup]
&gt;&gt;J: CeCe's right.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.240
I need to loosen up.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.510
&gt;&gt; White Jay: Here.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.380
Let me -- here you go..

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.380
&gt;&gt; J: Beautiful.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.380
&gt;&gt;White Jay: You bet
&gt;&gt;J: Awwww, mother f-[beep]

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.380
&gt;&gt; White Jay: Beautiful
&gt;&gt;J: What, this stain?

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.450
&gt;&gt;White Jay: No, that's I was talking about
the way you said mother [beep]

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.480
. I can't do it.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:12.490
But you had like a melody to it.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:20.210
It was beautiful.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:27.940
&gt;&gt; J: Mother f-[beep]

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:33.351
&gt;&gt; White Jay: I'm Jay.

00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:35.220
&gt;&gt; J: So am I.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.020
That's so --

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:47.270
&gt;&gt; White Jay: So dyno-mite! [laughs] Okay
because you're Jay and I'm Jay so

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.650
it's Jay Jay.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.230
So dyno-mite!

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.610
It's Good Times.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.190
&gt;&gt;J: Lame.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.780
So cool.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:02.500
&gt;&gt;White Jay: It was lame.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.350
I'm so awkward.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.200
&gt;&gt; J: I'm awkward.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:16.620
Like you don't even know.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:25.610
&gt;&gt; White Jay: No, you're mother fucking beautiful.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:37.170
&gt;&gt; Fred: Hey, I see you met my boy, Jay.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:43.580
&gt;&gt;White Jay: What's up, man?

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.150
&gt;&gt; Fred: Yeah.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:56.390
Well, I'm going to hit the dance floor and
get

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.250
my Dougie on.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.480
You all coming.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.230
&gt;&gt;White Jay: I don't dance
&gt;&gt;J: I don't dance

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:19.850
&gt;&gt;White Jay and J: Me, neither
&gt;&gt;White Jay: I just thought though, because

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.850
you just seem like.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.130
&gt;&gt;J: Like I have rhythm.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.130
[laughs]

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:29.880
&gt;&gt;White Jay: No, not to be like weird about
it

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:35.130
&gt;&gt; J: It's like a burden for me.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:54.339
&gt;&gt;White Jay: I just figured you could dance
but not because of any reason.

00:40:54.339 --> 00:40:59.020
&gt;&gt; J: Did I just see what I thought I saw?

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.020
No way.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.020
Fred
couldn't be.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.660
&gt;&gt; J: It's hot in here.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.110
&gt;&gt; White Jay: Yeah, okay.

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.810
&gt;&gt; Male rapper: [music] I think I started
something.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.990
I got what I
wanted -- can't feel nothing [song].

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.600
&gt;&gt; Darius: I just wanted you all to say happy
birthday to a man

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600
Fred.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600
It's his party.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.670
Hey Fred come on up here,man.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:32.740
You know, when we was in high school, dude,
. We was on the track team.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.810
He made us run[inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Fred: [laughing].

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.350
Aw thanks man

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.420
&gt;&gt; All: [singing] Happy birthday to you.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.800
Happy birthday to
you.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.940
Happy birthday dear Fred.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940
Happy birthday to you.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.940
[applause].

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.040
[music starts again]
&gt;&gt; White Jay: So it's a slow song.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.040
You want to give it a shot?

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.290
&gt;&gt;J: Sure, why not.

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:53.740
&gt;&gt;Female singer: [song] Even if we only go
to my house.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.490
&gt;&gt;J: Nothing like a cute white guy to make
me feel secure

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.490
about my dancing.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.310
Wait, is he looking at me?

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.310
Could it
be?

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.460
Is Fred suffering from a bad case of envy?

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.770
All it
took was a -- I change my mind.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:15.340
The worst thing about
parties is watching the guy you like kiss

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.980
the girl you
hate.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.280
[music]
&gt;&gt; Issa: Is it focused?

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.260
It's too dark.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.260
Okay.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.880
We can
turn the exposure up.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.520
&gt;&gt;Friend: Where is that?

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.520
&gt;&gt;Issa: I have to show you.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.690
So awkward.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:38.200
But my mouth is too dark?

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:46.000
I can put it in auto-focus at this point,
too.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.290
&gt;&gt;Friend: This is the view that I have of
you.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.290
Can't really tell.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.290
&gt;&gt;Issa: Can you?

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.830
&gt;&gt;Friend: Do you want the view of your radio
too?

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:01.180
&gt;&gt;Issa: No, I just want to start with the
radio with me

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.560
turning my song up and then back to here.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.850
Mostly like when I am going to shift
my.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.800
Yeah, when I am like -- as long as you can't
see out

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.600
my window that he's not there really.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.890
&gt;&gt; Andrew: I think it's pretty good.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.040
&gt;&gt; Issa: And what about if I'm scooting down?

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.740
Can you tell that my seat is going down?

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.740
&gt;&gt; Andrew: Yeah.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.740
&gt;&gt; Friend: That's good.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.740
&gt;&gt;Andrew: You can't see me.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.880
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.910
&gt;&gt;Issa: Okay, so let me just keep it at this
angle or

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:28.910
whatever.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:29.910
&gt;&gt; J: Are you coming?

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:30.910
[cracks up laughing]

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.910
&gt;&gt;Nina: t Yeah well, look.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.950
My sorors are meeting up later for dinner
if you

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.260
want to meet up later.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.910
&gt;&gt; J: You know it's really nice of you.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.260
You know I didn't really eat lunch today

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.200
&gt;&gt; Nina: Oh, whoa, -- no, no, no -- I meant
after.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.990
&gt;&gt;Tracy: [as Tracy] Oh no stop.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.460
Why did she
laugh?

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.060
&gt;&gt;Loud woman: Uh-huh?

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.800
For real?

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.800
No.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:04.470
But let me tell you last
night -- last night.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.730
Was so bomb.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:06.920
It was like.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.890
Then I
was like yeah.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:09.890
Uh-uh.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:10.890
Why doesn't she..

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.900
&gt;&gt;Loud Woman: Hello how may I help you.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.820
&gt;&gt; Loud Woman: Yeah, so I was like.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:24.550
Yeah, let me tell you about last
night though it was on.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:26.790
It was so on.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.150
Why didn't you go
last night.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.830
Where hold on.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.880
&gt;&gt;J: Can you keep it down a little bit.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.680
&gt;&gt; Loud Woman: Keep it down?

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.360
&gt;&gt; J: Yeah, just.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.410
&gt;&gt; Loud Woman: Yeah, anyway so yeah, the hair
appointment?

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.650
Lashanie
knee did it?

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:49.770
What did.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.010
[laughs]
[loud traffic noises]

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.820
&gt;&gt; J: Oh, I got it.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:01.030
When I pick up the coffee cup like
this.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.120
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Person filming: I don't see the coffee

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.410
cup.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.630
I see your ass.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:12.130
&gt;&gt; J: But is it just my ass.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.060
&gt;&gt; Filmer: Well no.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.340
Bend over.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.120
I see all of you.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.270
&gt;&gt;J: Hi.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.570
I'm Jay I'm sorry?

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:21.570
Derek?

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.880
&gt;&gt;Darius: [whispering] Darius.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.420
&gt;&gt; J: So are you from around here?

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.290
I'm sorry, come again?

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.690
&gt;&gt; Darius: Arizona, originally.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.090
&gt;&gt; J: Yeah, oh.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.430
Come again
&gt;&gt;Darius: Arizona, originally

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.430
[laughter]

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.980
&gt;&gt;Darius: I was upset when he switched.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:37.990
[inaudible]
[laughter]

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:42.530
&gt;&gt; Darius: My parents sometimes we don't like
jelly fishing.

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.050
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Crowd: Action.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.050
Hey.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.090
Go go go go go go go.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.100
Go crazy.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:50.110
Go crazy.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.140
&gt;&gt;A: I brought you a drink..

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.650
&gt;&gt;J: I'm allergic.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:59.310
&gt;&gt;A: But you were drinking the night we
passionately made love.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.870
&gt;&gt; J: We did not make love.

00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.910
We had sex! [beep]

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.110
&gt;&gt;Woman on stage: So, I said live today like
it is tomorrow.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.220
Yet, I
felt so much sorrow.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.910
But I will not borrow nor buy your
excuses.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:18.210
[long beep] But I will not borrow nor buy
your excuses..

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.510
&gt;&gt;EnimaL: Let's go, Queen.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.950
Nothing but OGs in here anyway

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:27.390
&gt;&gt;Cece: [singing] Good-bye high high high.

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.110
High high high.

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:31.980
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That was great.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.120
I don't think I've ever laughed that
hard at work.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.520
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So we'll open up the floor to
questions now.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.460
Anyone
has a question wants to come over to the mic.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.240
Please
don't yell out because we are recording this

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.980
for later
and there are people on VC.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.370
Some come on over.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:54.210
While we're waiting, when
will we find out who J chooses?

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.780
&gt;&gt; Issa and Tracy: January 12th.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:01.100
&gt;&gt; Issa: Episode 12 season finale premiers
and we'll know who J makes; who

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.320
decision J makes.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.370
&gt;&gt;Tracy: J makes what [laughs]

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.010
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Okay.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.240
Hi I'm Shaniece.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.910
I loved your episode by the way.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.040
I've seen
all your episodes like ten times.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.040
[laughs]But I know that you
did make it -- the webisodes are supposed

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.030
to be able to
view them online and everything like that.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:26.220
But I know
one day I was watching MTV and I saw a show

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.220
called
Awkward.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.120
And I thought it was interesting because the
entire cast of course is white.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:35.420
And I much prefer your
show and I was wondering if in the future

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:39.560
if you're
working towards being like on mainstream or

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.620
something
like that do you think the kind of show you

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.790
have just
wouldn't fit in and it would limit what you're

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.010
trying to
do with your show.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.010
&gt;&gt; Definitely the latter.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.820
It's something Tracy and I
struggle with all the time.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.720
We just went back and forth
with this particular week.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:55.330
There's definitely interest
in terms of mainstream television, but there's

00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:01.850
such a
fear that in selling our rights away we have

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:05.800
to change
the title, the cast, the content.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:12.700
A lot of it would be
watered down.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.000
That's a big fear of mine in addition to
creative control.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.910
That's very important to us moving
forward.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:24.850
So personally I feel like keeping it online
and

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:29.640
leveraging our audience, I'm sorry, building
our

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:38.260
audience so we can leverage our position to
networks in the future is the intended goal

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.260
right now.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:46.780
&gt;&gt;Tracy: Yeah, well I would love to see ABG
on television.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:55.740
I
would love it.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:12.810
If we could still maintain what we love
about the show -- like, maintain the integrity

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:13.810
of it.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:14.810
And there are some networks -- cable networks
rather --

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.780
that allow you to do controversial topics
and language

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.210
like HBO,Comedy Central , Showtime, FX, and
Comedy Central, things like that.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:23.560
So I think
if we did do television it would have to be

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.180
on a network
that allows you to push buttons.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.580
Because I can't see a
format where ABG can exist the same way if

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.360
we water it
down to a point where it has to fit a mainstream

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.560
audience
and be really PG and family friendly.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.460
Because it's not
that kind of show.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.490
Like Issa said, it's something that we
struggle with.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.630
We we're trying to figure out how to
reach the most mass audience possible but

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:45.080
also maintain
the integrity of the show.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:49.780
So sorry if that didn't
answer your question.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.710
&gt;&gt;Female #1: No, it did.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:57.990
Thank you so much and I love you guys.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.920
I'm so glad you're here.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.270
[giggles]
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.440
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Yeah?

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.680
So we've got some questions people submitted
online.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.330
&gt;&gt;Tracy: Oh, cool.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:15.270
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Do you want to bring them up
here?

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:22.610
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So after creating ABG, you step
behind the camera to

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.190
create the hilarious Fly Guy series.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:29.490
How have the
creative directive processes differed for

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:30.490
you?

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:35.190
Do you have different
goals and audiences in mind for these two

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.190
shows?

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:38.430
&gt;&gt;Issa: So actually Fly Guys before I did
ABG.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.540
At that point I
was really comfortable being behind the camera

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.050
and sort
of directing them and the way that show is,

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.320
I'll
essentially give them an outline much like

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.320
Curbed.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.420
Curbed
I'll give them outline or plot points -- moments

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.690
to get
to -- and they'll essentially improvise it

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.460
-- improvise a
scenario to come to a certain conclusion.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.280
And so, I love
working with them just because they have a

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.200
natural
chemistry and it's just easy.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:09.260
Whereas ABG is scripted for the most part,
I'm in it, and for the majority of the episodes

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.260
I'm directing
myself.

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.430
And that's hard because I feel like I'm, like
--

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.110
I don't get to focus as much on other actors
because I'm

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.110
worried about me.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.480
And I feel like I'm bringing them
down.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.410
If I do focus on other actors I'm not working
on

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:22.410
my own performance.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.730
So I would prefer to have other directors;
it's a little bit

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:26.730
harder.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:32.360
Yeah, I would prefer either being behind the
camera and directing or being in front of

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.970
the camera and
being just an actress.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.130
&gt;&gt; Presenter: That question was from Natalie
Bell who was actually

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:37.130
at YouTube right now.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.130
She's watching.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:39.440
&gt;&gt; Issa, Tracy and Madison: Oh cool hi Natalie.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.440
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Any other questions?

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.840
Come up to the mic and we'll
take your questions as they come.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.190
&gt;&gt;Male #1: How is it going?

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:46.190
Thanks so much.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.560
I started watching
the show this week when I saw your post.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.690
Really loved it
so far.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.410
I wanted to ask -- I'm sorry Nina --

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:52.410
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Awesome.

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:53.410
You can call me that.

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:54.970
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #1: You talk about mentioning the universal

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:55.970
awkwardness of
the show.

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.200
I think that's one of the things that's really
appealing.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.020
It's about dating and it's about the office
space.

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.150
But then there's also moment unique to being
African-American.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.700
People ask you about your hair.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.720
I'm
wondering what other kind of specific like

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.490
unique to
being African-American awkward moments you'd

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.890
like to
bring to the show in the future.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:10.789
&gt;&gt; Tracy: You were asking that?

00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:11.930
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Anybody.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.960
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Do you want me?

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960
&gt;&gt; Issa: You can.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.710
&gt;&gt;Tracy: I think episode 7 -- I don't know
if you've gotten

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.170
that far in watching but I'll tell you what
that episode

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:23.170
is about.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:26.830
It's J's character going on her first interracial
date

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.440
with a white guy.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:38.700
For me -- because we co-wrote that
episode together -- and for us to do that

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.420
I had to draw
into my experiences with interracial dating.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.370
And just
being African-American woman, it varies.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.370
Like, where you
are.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.750
I'm from the South originally.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:49.640
And walking around
with someone who's not black -- like, pretty

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.820
much elicits
all kinds of stares.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.620
And so, I wanted to incorporate
that into the show.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:58.910
Even in LA, in places that are more
progressive, there are certain people that

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:05.620
still feel like
interracial dating is something to stare at

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:06.620
or something
to talk about.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.620
So we wanted to kind of make that, I guess,
situation known.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.620
And when they walk into the soul food
restaurant.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:13.940
It's over-exaggerated, but everybody in the
restaurant turns to them.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:23.860
We even have a black guy with
a white girl on his arm like -- judging them

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.860
as well.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:29.880
[laughter]
And so, those are the kind of moments where

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.043
we are
directly talking about what it's like to be

00:53:32.043 --> 00:53:34.760
a black woman
and what it's like to be in an interracial

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760
relationship.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.890
And then also hair is a big -- like you mention
hair is a

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:40.170
big part of the show.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.570
We haven't really delved into like
issues of colorism.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.420
&gt;&gt; J: We're definitely going to go into more
-- after jay

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.530
makes decision next season we want to talk
about the

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:49.940
awkward moments of dating as that relates
to I guess

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:54.720
being African-American sort of the standards
that we expect.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.030
So yeah, I
guess to answer your question in terms of

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.770
that like where
we'll start figure out.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.720
Because they come every day.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.540
I
don't isolate them as -- oh, this is a African-American

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.540
awkward moment.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.930
[laughing] Tapping into that we'll definitely
think

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.930
about these experiences.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:11.930
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thank you.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:13.360
&gt;&gt; Issa and Tracy: Thank you.

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.360
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi.

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.070
My name is Camille as an awkward person no
matter

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.520
what my race, I'd like to thank you for the
show.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.359
[laughter] Is
there a way to submit ideas?

00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:27.080
&gt;&gt; Issa: Currently we can't.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:34.550
I mean, I guess, legally accept
ideas.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:39.570
People like will write things in the forum
but

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:44.000
legally we can't accept ideas unless they
come from the

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
writing team.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.360
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Okay, thank you.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.370
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.030
&gt;&gt; Female #3: This is mildly awkward because
the questions I had

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.330
they actually both took them.

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:54.330
So.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:58.830
[laughter] You mention, Issa, that
you thought about and people are like this

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:02.790
is funny but
you didn't think it would be funny beyond

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.050
your family and your
friends.

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:11.390
What would you say to those who were in your
shoes -- they were doing things they currently

00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:14.150
find funny
between family and friends and they want to

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:18.490
do it but they literally convince themselves
it's not going to be funny.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:23.240
It seems like your impetus
was when you saw someone else was going to

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240
do it.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.380
And were like
no I got to do it now.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.330
What would any of you, not specific to hear,
say for those who

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.330
want to do it but it's just like I just won't
invest the

00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.330
time.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:35.330
They've already discouraged themselves.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.850
&gt;&gt; Issa: One of my biggest things is I would
continue make

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.660
excuses as to why I couldn't do it.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.040
"Oh, I have a 9 to
5.

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.260
I don't have time to do it."

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:52.390
Or "Oh I don't have the
money."

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:58.140
And the more and more I kept saying that I
just

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.830
wouldn't create anything.

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:05.110
That was just really holding
me back.

00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:13.000
I guess the advice I would give is just to
stop

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.080
making excuses.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:20.600
And if you're really passionate about
something just put it out there.

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.790
Doesn't matter if it's
just funny to your family and friends.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.090
Someone else could think it's funny and spread
the word about it.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.260
If you want to put
something out there, there's nothing stopping

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:31.650
you from
putting it out there but you.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:32.650
I strongly believe in
that.

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.720
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Do you still have your day jobs?

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:41.670
&gt;&gt;Tracy: No
&gt;&gt; Issa: No, I quit.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:42.670
[laughter]

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:44.150
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Congratulations.

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.630
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you.

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.280
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Thanks.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.760
&gt;&gt;Madison: Hold on.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.680
I need a day job.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.170
&gt;&gt; Tracy: I think for me, it's never been
a matter of time in

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.170
fitting it in.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:56:59.170
Mine has always been fear of other people
judging it.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.270
And that's something I grapple with as an
artist all the time.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:07.750
Any time I write anything, I'm
always afraid of criticism.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:10.970
And even with awkward black
girl.

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:16.180
It's been a great experience for testing out
I

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:34.590
guess our work and then also learning to have
thicker

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:43.790
skin and dealing with comments.

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:55.920
The great thing about
YouTube is the feedback is instant.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.090
So you can tell if
someone hates it or loves it within two minutes

00:57:58.090 --> 00:57:59.090
of
posting it online.

00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:00.090
And that's a good and bad thing.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:05.140
[laughs]
It's great because you don't have to guess

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.200
how you're
doing.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.620
People are telling you.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.400
But it's also -- you
know, bad -- because as an artist, you're

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.240
really
sensitive to your work and when you put something

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.240
up it's
really hard to hear, "I hated it.

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240
Or this sucks.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240
You're
terrible at this; you're a bad writer.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240
You look crazy in this episode."

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.240
For
me, because I play the villain, I never read

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.240
anything
nice about myself.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.690
It's something I just had to deal
with just like getting over the fear of criticism.

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.190
And I
think honestly that's one of the main reasons

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.770
why people
are afraid to go after their dreams because

00:58:32.770 --> 00:58:33.800
they're
afraid of what people are going to say.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.640
And I think you
just have to do it and take the criticism

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.160
if it comes and
take the praise if it comes.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.562
Just learn to get over your
fears and just put it out there no matter

00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:41.562
what.

00:58:41.562 --> 00:58:42.740
&gt;&gt; Madison: Yeah, I think a major excuse for
people not to start

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.240
their great ideas they have is they tell themselves
I'd

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.590
do it if I only had this or I had this piece
in place.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:47.780
I
encourage people to start with what you have

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:49.390
and I think
once you do that our minds can figure out

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.525
ways to
accomplish the stuff that's not already in

00:58:50.525 --> 00:58:51.525
place.

00:58:51.525 --> 00:58:52.525
So it
kind of spurs that creativity.

00:58:52.525 --> 00:58:53.525
So go ahead and start.

00:58:53.525 --> 00:58:54.525
Figure it out.

00:58:54.525 --> 00:58:55.525
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Thank you..

00:58:55.525 --> 00:58:56.525
&gt;&gt;Issa: Thank you.

00:58:56.525 --> 00:58:57.525
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Can you guys hear me?

00:58:57.525 --> 00:58:58.525
I'll just bend down like this.

00:58:58.525 --> 00:58:59.525
Hi guys.

00:58:59.525 --> 00:59:00.525
My name is Taylor.

00:59:00.525 --> 00:59:01.525
Thank you so much for
coming; we are really happy to have you.

00:59:01.525 --> 00:59:02.525
I wanted to ask you a question.

00:59:02.525 --> 00:59:03.525
As my friends
and I were watching the show.

00:59:03.525 --> 00:59:04.525
I think this is more
geared towards Nina's character.

00:59:04.525 --> 00:59:05.525
We noticed a lot of references to
sorority life.

00:59:05.525 --> 00:59:06.525
And like the satire off of that.

00:59:06.525 --> 00:59:07.525
I feel
like you've gotten this question before.

00:59:07.525 --> 00:59:08.525
[laughter] I wanted to
know if there were any real life situations

00:59:08.525 --> 00:59:09.525
that caused
you to maybe integrate that into Nina's character.

00:59:09.525 --> 00:59:14.510
And
also if there are any like pet peeves associated

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.050
with
sorority or fraternity life that you kind

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:19.250
of wanted to
highlight on the show.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.250
&gt;&gt;Issa: She wants to know if you're Greek.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:21.250
&gt;&gt; Tracy: You're trying to get me in trouble.

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.250
&gt;&gt; Female #4: No I'm not.

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:23.250
I'm not even in one; totally objective.

00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.250
&gt;&gt;Tracy: So I'm not either.

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:25.250
For some reason I think people
think because Nina is very much into sorority

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.250
life that
I'm into sorority life as well.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.250
I'm not.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.250
Didn't pledge.

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.250
I'm not Greek.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:30.250
But the reason why we put it in there was
because it's a huge part of African-American

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:31.250
culture.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:32.810
And it's a very big part of going to HBCU's.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:38.380
It's a big
part of going to any college pretty much at

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.380
this point.

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.870
There's people that pledge and there's people
that don't

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:43.870
pledge.

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:44.870
So I think we have to have some kind of
character that does represent the Greek community.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:45.870
As we
do with everything there are moments we are

00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:46.870
using satire
to laugh at some parts of Greek life.

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:47.870
In episode 10, that was
that when Nina is hazing the office.

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:48.870
[laughter] That's just an
over-exaggerated like version.

00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.870
And we combine that with
our Halloween feel to make it really over

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:50.870
the top.

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:51.870
But
we're not necessarily saying anything about

00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:52.870
Greeks at
all.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.870
We just think it's important to have some
character

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:54.870
represent that part of black culture.

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:55.870
And it's just fun.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:56.870
And I do have to share stories.

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:57.870
My sister was at her
best friends wedding reception and her -- my

00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:58.870
sister --
the entire, like, bridal party was, like,

00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:59.870
in the same
sorority together.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:00.870
And there was one person who wasn't.

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:01.870
And they like were doing their stroll at the
reception

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:02.870
and she was unaware that you can't just jump
in the

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:03.870
stroll.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:04.870
[laughter] And so, and she picked up on the
choreography, like, rather quickly and just

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:05.870
kind of like
jumped in.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:06.870
And they really reacted to it.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.870
And so, that
was something when she told me that -- oh

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:08.870
my God we have
to use that.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:09.870
And so, we threw Jeremy Patti into my
sorors doing the activity.

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:10.870
What do you think
you're doing.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.870
I thought this was open audition.

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:12.870
[laughter] So
yeah, there's just in a moments.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:13.870
That was one actual
moment that happened we thought was fun so

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:14.870
we wanted to utilize it.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:15.870
So yeah --
that's why it's there.

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:16.870
&gt;&gt;Female #5: Thanks.

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:17.870
My name is Shayna.

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:18.870
Thanks again for coming.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:19.870
We really enjoyed it.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:20.870
My question is how can we help you
guys move forward?

01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:21.870
Remember after you had to push after
Episode 7 to raise money and I'm sure you

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.870
need funds to
continue to eat, to make stuff.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.870
So how can we as the
audience help you guys move forward.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.870
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you for asking.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:25.870
&gt;&gt;Issa: We actually have a donate button on
our website.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:26.870
People have donated after Kickstarter, And
that's really

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.870
been helpful.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:28.870
So if you find it in your heart and your
pocket to donate, go to awkward black girl.com/donate

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:29.870
and
there it is.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:30.870
&gt;&gt; Presenter: White Jay?

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:31.870
Go ahead.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:32.870
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Coincidentally my question is
about White Jay

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:33.870
[laughter]

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:34.870
&gt;&gt; Tracy: Love it.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.870
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So does the audience have a -- when
you meet

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:36.870
with the fans and interact with the audience.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.870
Do they
have a preference?

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:38.870
Because you guys have a team Jacob
team Edward thing going here and everyone

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:39.870
I talk to it's
pretty split.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:40.870
Usually when I see an do you feel
pressure?

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:41.870
First of all is there a certain preference
and

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:42.870
is there pressure writing that in.

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:43.870
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Let's do a quick poll.

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:44.870
Who's team Fred?

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:45.870
Team Fred
hands up.

01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:46.870
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Tracy: You got one.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:47.870
Two.

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:48.870
Yeah.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:49.870
There we go.

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:50.870
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Issa: It's funny she does that.

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:51.870
Initially it was team white
jay.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.870
That wasn't our intention at all.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:53.870
After episode 5
white jay was only supposed to be a one time

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:54.870
character.

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.870
His name was jay at the time.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:56.870
&gt;&gt; Tracy: The white came later.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:57.870
&gt;&gt; Issa: And then after episode 5 people were
like "Ooh team

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:58.870
White Jay".

01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:59.870
So we're like wow, okay.

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:00.870
This really worked.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.870
And so, the love triangle thing happened really
by

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:02.870
accident.

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:03.870
The audience's feedback.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.870
With that there was
pressure to continue.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:05.870
I guess you're hired for the rest
of the season.

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:06.870
We worked as writers to put back Fred into
the running, to change things.

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:07.870
So we're happy to say that
not in this room apparently but overall it's

01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:08.870
pretty
split.

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:09.870
There's -- there are a lot of team Freds out
there -- teamwhite jays.

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:10.870
Really hostile.

01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:11.870
See what kind of
backlash you get.

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.870
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you and love the show.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:13.870
And thank you Janna for
introducing me.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.870
&gt;&gt;Issa: [inaudible]
[cheering and applause].

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:15.870
&gt;&gt;Presenter: [laughter] Sounds like you're
responding real-time to

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:16.870
comments and taking feedback on the go

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:17.870
&gt;&gt; Issa: Yeah we do.

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:18.870
That's what we love about the series.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:19.870
Instant feedback and you can see how people
respond

01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:20.870
about scenarios.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:21.870
We don't take everything into account
but we do take a lot of things into account.

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:22.870
&gt;&gt;Presenter: We'll go ahead and wrap up this
final question.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:23.870
Being a YouTube employee
this one caught my eye.

01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:24.870
Using YouTube as a platform to
test out a series seems like an obvious way

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:25.870
to gauge viewer
interest.

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:26.870
Do you take into consideration viewer's
comments in creating content and have YouTube

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:27.870
stats
helped you pitch to TV networks.

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.870
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You kind of answered the first
part.

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:29.870
Have YouTube
stats helped you in your pitches.

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:30.870
&gt;&gt;Issa: Absolutely.

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:31.870
Stats just help in general.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:32.870
Even people
to sit and watch the series.

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:33.870
A lot of people -- and I'm
this type of viewer as well.

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:34.870
I'll look at a video and
I'll be like, "this only has 500 views?

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.870
Wag."

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:36.870
Without
even testing it.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:37.870
The fact the show does have a lot of views
or

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:38.870
relatively does help people tune in to paying
attention.

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:39.870
Networks and people have been paying attention.

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:40.870
So definitely the numbers help and the fact
the numbers

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:41.870
are displayed at screen and the likes are
displays really

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:42.870
helps to get us out there.

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:43.870
Through word of mouth, especially.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:44.870
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Well, it's always exciting to
hear our work is

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:45.870
impacting people's lives individually and
communities

01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:46.870
online and off line, in the real world.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:47.870
With that we'll wrap it up.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:48.870
There
is a merchandise table in the back if you

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:49.870
guys would like
to pick up some Awkward Black Girl T-shirts.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:50.870
That's a great way to support the show.

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.870
There are
some free ones that we're giving away -- is

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:52.870
that the
case?

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:53.870
Yeah.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:54.870
So everyone check under your seat.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:55.870
If you
have a post it under your seat, then you're

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:56.870
getting a
free Awkward Black Girl T-shirt.

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:57.870
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you guys.

01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.870
[Applause]

01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:59.870
&gt;&gt; Issa: Thank you.

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:00.870
Tell your friends all about the show..

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.875
&gt;&gt; Presenter: Thank you for coming.
