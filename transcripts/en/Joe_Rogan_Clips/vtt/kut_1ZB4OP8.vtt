1
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.280
The Joe Rogan experience and I never got the rubber boots.
You know what I mean?

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.470
I was always just like had sneakers.
I'd be like trying to get,

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.810
trying to get the Fallon at like seven in the morning,

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.720
walking to the subway through the slush.
It was like,

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.180
it would be beautiful while it was snowing and then as soon as on the ground you

6
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.390
were just like,
get rid of this shit.
Now did you write for Fallon?

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.430
[inaudible] what was that kid like?
I mean it was,
uh,
it was frustrating.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.900
They didn't like,
because I started when he started late night with Jimmy Fallon,

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.940
I was one of the first guys there and they didn't like any of my jokes.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.150
Like it was just,
it was,

11
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:38.460
it was impossible to mean or just like this is going to make Jimmy unlikable.

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.480
Like it wasn't about being funny so much as like coming off as smart and uh,

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.830
and friendly,
you know,
and likable that they,

14
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.030
that's what I was there for a year and then they barely used anything I ever
did,

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.470
but they knew I was funny.

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.810
They liked me and I thought for some reason in my head,

17
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.860
I thought that if I quit before a year,
that it'll like follow me.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.210
People were like,
what happened with Fallon?

19
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.520
Why were you only there a year that like,
and then when I left,

20
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.340
it was like no one would have given a shit if I had left after 10 weeks,

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.570
you know,
it wouldn't have mattered at all.
Yeah,
it was good.

22
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.740
It's an interesting experience,
but I did not enjoy it.

23
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
Being a writer for other people's voices has gotta be very difficult.
It's,

24
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.170
I mean,
for me it's impossible.

25
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:22.020
It's like I write in my voice and you either like it or you don't.

26
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.830
Like I've written for Jimmy Kimmel,
Sarah Silverman,
and then if I love to joke,

27
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:30.310
they loved it too.
Uh,
but with Fallon,
that was not the case.
You know,
it was,

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
he was,
it was almost never like he might,
he might,
he would laugh at the joke,

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:38.100
but he be like,
I can't say this.
I can't do it.
What are they trying to do?

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
Like what,
what does he try to do?
And he's trying to be like Middle America,

31
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.800
like there's a market for that.
Right.
Is that what it is?

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.240
He just wants everyone to love him,
you know,
he just wants everyone to,
uh,

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.293
everyone to love him.

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.510
And that's like not a bad trait to have in a late night host.
Right.

35
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.810
Probably the best trait to having a late night host.

36
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310
[inaudible] I'd like to see him drunk one day.
Just shitting on everybody though.

37
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.520
I think it'd be hilarious slurs.
Does it do that?
Oh yeah.

38
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.680
Cause I mean,
I,
I've,
I've heard that he quit drinking.

39
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.190
I don't know if that's true,
but he would like,
he liked to get drunk and like,

40
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.840
and like shitty bars and like hang out,
like with the,

41
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:15.900
with the staff and the crew,
like he was,

42
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.930
he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink.

43
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.670
He wanted to go out and go to some weird bar that was like in a subway that no

44
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:28.260
one knew about and have beers.
Like he was,
uh,
he was like a fun drunk,
you know.

45
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
But he did a lot.
Yeah.
There was always those rumors that he's got a problem.

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.190
She found it's got a problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

47
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.480
Do you think that's like the pressure of just being this like super friendly,

48
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.950
sweet guy on TV wanting everybody to love you?
Then you're like,
oh my God,

49
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.240
get me a fucking drank so I can cut loose.
I'm,
I'm,

50
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.820
I think that could be part of it,
you know?
That's why I was,

51
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:54.450
I was thought like with my persona,

52
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:57.180
like let's be the meanest person you can so that you can,

53
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.400
it allows you to be nice off stage.
You know,
you guys,
you kind of,

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.140
it gives you a little bit of distance,

55
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.180
but the guys who come off as like your best friend onstage tend to be monsters

56
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.600
off stay.
Some of them,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got another story.

57
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.250
I'll tell you when you get off the air about one of those.
Great.

58
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>
