00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.056
&gt;&gt;Julia: So how can we
improve it so that it's clear

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:11.486
that there's more than one thing?

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:14.656
&gt;&gt;Quimiah: You could just go to
the tab that says that category.

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:17.746
&gt;&gt;Student: The cats, some cats are
what makes the ecosystem healthy.

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:18.846
&gt;&gt;Julia: Awesome ideas.

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:19.956
We're going to share with--

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:23.616
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Because our students solve
real world problems, they see themselves

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:27.746
as important, thoughtful
people, who are able to grapple

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:33.816
with really tough problems and to
make decisions that have meaning.

00:00:40.036 --> 00:00:43.786
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Our school is a preschool

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:46.956
through eighth grade public
charter school in Washington.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:53.806
Our mission is really to help all
students develop a lifelong love

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:54.436
of learning.

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:55.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So keep cutting.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.326
&gt;&gt;Jessica: Problem based learning
is at the heart of what we do.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.576
We think that learning is really
important, but it's for a purpose,

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:04.296
and that purpose for our
kids is to solve some kind

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.496
of problem that's important
to them and to their lives.

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.436
&gt;&gt;Anne: What was the problem
we're trying to solve?

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:14.346
&gt;&gt;Student: People think that
spiders are disgusting and gross.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:19.436
&gt;&gt;Anne: Yeah, and one of the
stories that we read about spiders,

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:22.416
how are the spiders portrayed, Jonas?

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.176
&gt;&gt;Jonas: In a horrible way.

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.436
&gt;&gt;People think that spiders
are like scary

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:30.786
or dangerous, and actually they're not.

00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:34.226
&gt;&gt;Anne: We've been working on our
spider stories for quite a while,

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.816
because they are the way that
we're solving our problem.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:38.756
&gt;&gt;Why write stories?

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:40.816
&gt;&gt;Student: It change people mind.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:42.926
&gt;&gt;Anne: And what else can it change?

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:44.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Their heart.

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:45.386
&gt;&gt;Anne: Their heart.

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:49.126
&gt;&gt;Every student studied
their own spider.

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:52.886
They did research on all of
the attributes of that spider.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:58.616
Then they had to take those facts
and create a story around them.

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.986
&gt;&gt;Sofia: The spider I've been
researching is the broad-faced

00:02:02.716 --> 00:02:03.346
sac spider.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:08.926
My story's about this little
spider trying to find a home,

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:15.186
and other problems it gets through
to find the perfect place to live.

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.336
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a daddy long legs.

00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:21.146
&gt;&gt;Jonas: This writing project
is actually helping us learn how

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:25.226
to write better, because you
can look back at your research

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:28.166
and then you can know like, the facts.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.946
&gt;&gt;Anne: He dove to eat the spider.

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:34.526
&gt;&gt;What I hope that I'm building
are like, tiny problem solvers.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:36.566
&gt;&gt;Student: There was a spitting spider.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.386
&gt;&gt;Anne: It's a really
appropriate way for them

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:41.336
to practice those lifelong skills.

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:46.056
&gt;&gt;Student: The bird didn't
see him, so he went past.

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:47.606
The end.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:51.546
&gt;&gt;Jeff: When I think about how
to identify a quality problem,

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:54.506
I think about what is
the authentic context

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:56.566
that I can situate that problem within?

00:02:56.726 --> 00:03:01.926
Our school is called Two Rivers, and one
of those two rivers is the Anacostia,

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:05.586
that is not swimmable or fishable.

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:10.246
&gt;&gt;Julia: Our website needs to teach
kids all about the river ecosystem.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:15.756
Both its problems and how we
can make it healthy again.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:16.966
&gt;&gt;Jeff: So they're creating a website.

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:21.376
&gt;&gt;Julia: So start to think
about this third question.

00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:23.086
What changes can we make to improve?

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.836
&gt;&gt;Quimiah: We get to teach
kids about the Anacostia

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:30.186
and what makes the ecosystem healthy.

00:03:31.406 --> 00:03:34.786
&gt;&gt;Julia: Partnering with the Anacostia
Watershed Society is giving kids the

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.816
idea that this is a real
world connection.

00:03:37.986 --> 00:03:39.376
&gt;&gt;Ariel: We worked with Two Rivers.

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:45.916
The students are really taking part
in an authentic restoration project.

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:48.066
&gt;&gt;Bryn: I like that a
topic isn't taught to you.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.866
You have to like, figure stuff out.

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:55.396
We go on field studies so we can
see what it actually looks like.

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:58.906
&gt;&gt;Solutions like rain
barrels, wetland plants.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.936
&gt;&gt;Ariel: It's not like
we're looking at, you know,

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:03.386
what's happening with the rainforest.

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:07.046
Everything that they do every
day is impacting the water.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Zoom in, zoom in.

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:10.576
&gt;&gt;Ariel: It's much more
powerful for them to be involved

00:04:10.576 --> 00:04:13.136
in something that's part
of their own community.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:16.906
&gt;&gt;Jeff: As kids move through our school,

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:19.976
they all are working
within these problems.

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:22.196
&gt;&gt;Anne: Did it make you like
the spiders a little more?

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:26.856
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Our youngest kids are working
on projects that speak to things

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:27.976
in their immediate environment.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:29.976
&gt;&gt;Julia: Interesting.

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:31.916
&gt;&gt;Jeff: But as kids move
forward in class,

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:34.076
they work with more philosophical kinds

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:37.116
of problems outside of
their direct community.

00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:41.236
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Is your conclusion covering
a variety of stances on gene editing?

00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:44.336
&gt;&gt;Jessica: So what we want kids to be
able to do is getting in the practice

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:48.106
of weighing information, of
grappling with really difficult things

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:49.566
that don't have clear answers.

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:52.916
Considering different points of view,
considering different points of data,

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:56.586
asking for expert opinions and
ultimately coming up with a solution.

00:04:57.436 --> 00:04:59.656
Those are things we all
do every day in our lives,

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:03.826
and they make our work better, so
we want kids to be able to do that.

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:06.816
&gt;&gt;Student: Hold up, guys, we have
a Twitter and Facebook and YouTube.
