AUSTIN MCCASLAND: Thank
you so much for coming

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.880
to our session on
AR as a feature.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
And for everyone watching
on the live stream,

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.450
thank you for tuning in.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.250
We're really excited
to talk to you guys

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
about how you can supercharge
your projects and products

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.070
using augmented reality.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.250
But before we dive
too deep into that,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.640
let us introduce ourselves.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.550
My name is Austin McCasland.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.180
I am a UX designer and
prototyper at Google Daydream.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.610
And before I joined Google, I've
written a couple courses on AR

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.110
and VR product design
and development.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.240
I've designed and developed
some award-winning AR apps,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.790
and I just am really passionate
about spatial and immersive

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.712
computing.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:47.420
DIANE WANG: Cool.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.725
And my name is Diane Wang.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.300
It's nice to meet you all.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm a lead user
experience designer.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.630
I work on Austin's team, and I'm
really passionate about working

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.150
at that intersection
between digital and physical

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.350
interfaces.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.450
Before I was
working at Daydream,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.940
I was designing
products at Nest,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.610
so really thinking about
hardware interfaces,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.580
spatial and physical
computing, and everything

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.110
that's in between.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.350
And before that, my background's
in computer science.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.480
But in general,
my day-to-day now

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.260
is working with Austin on
rapid prototyping all the time.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.240
So we're super excited to jump
in and share with you what

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.880
we have today.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.970
So today, we're here to talk
about augmented reality.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.590
We're excited because AR
can give apps superpowers.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.830
But the key message today
is that you don't have

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.500
to make an AR app to use it.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.450
AR has progressed
to a point where

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.450
it can be reliably
used as a technology

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.330
that any app can leverage.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.380
The ability to spatially
understand and output content

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.320
into the world opens
up new possibilities

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.655
across every vertical.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.860
So today, we're going
to start by talking

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.080
about AR as a technology.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.000
We'll talk about
where it was and has

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.690
been in the past few years, and
where it has gotten to today,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.990
and why we have this
message for you all today.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.170
We'll spend some time talking
about how you can evaluate

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.720
your app for its AR potential.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.930
And this is going to draw a
lot from our team's experience

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.062
working with a lot of
apps, working with AR.

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:30.520
And we'll talk
about different ways

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.890
you can think about your
app and where we found

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.210
that AR brings a lot of value.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.280
And then we'll spend
the bulk of our time

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.180
today talking about different
approaches and processes

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.270
so that you can develop
your own AR features.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.013
And now, I'll hand it
over to Austin to jump in.

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:51.180
AUSTIN MCCASLAND: All right.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.670
So I want to start
off just by level

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
setting on what we mean when we
say AR, or augmented reality.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.140
So, to us, there's
really two key components

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.490
that makes AR this awesome
thing that can up-level any app.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.830
And the first of
those is the ability

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.303
to understand the world
through the camera.

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.470
So when we're talking about
understanding the world,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.428
it could be anything from
little feature points

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.010
that are on objects around.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.020
It could be detecting
that a plane is somewhere.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.540
It could also be more semantic
understanding of the world.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.430
So if you lens a banana, we
know it's a banana, right?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.970
The ability to reach out and
have the computer understand

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.560
space is super powerful, and
that's one of those two spokes.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.440
The second is the
ability to reach back out

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.840
and put spatial content
believably seated in the world.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.990
So what you're
looking at there is

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.150
when you put Andy the
Android on a table,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.190
and he's moving
around, and there's

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.320
lighting estimation
happening, and there's

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.510
tracking that helps
keep it all in place.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.660
And when you combine the
ability to understand the world

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.092
through the camera and to
put content back into it,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:03:59.550
all these really
interesting things

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.760
start to happen in terms of
use cases and user journeys

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.570
that you're able to
enable in your product.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.090
So before we dive into
the nuts and bolts,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.260
I wanted to set
context for why we

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.070
are talking about
AR as a feature

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.839
today, because AR
has not always been

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.770
ready to be a feature in all
different kinds of products.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.640
So we're not going to do an
exact historical run-through

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.610
of dates and times, but I
do want to bucket eras of AR

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.330
from a product perspective.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.530
So the first one, at
the very beginning,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.630
AR was pretty much relegated
to like lab environments,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.590
or you would see art
installations that had AR.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.380
And we even consider some of the
early projection mapping work--

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.160
so projection mapping is
using a projector to light up

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.130
particular shapes and stuff--

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.070
as being these early
first steps of AR.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.650
But if you're a
product person, it's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.160
not that easy to see how you're
going to create a product out

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.220
of it, unless you're doing
experiential marketing,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.690
or immersive theater,
or something like that.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.140
And so if you have to get
people to go to a place

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.200
to experience AR, it's
kind of hard to build

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.620
a scalable product
around it in that sense.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.160
So there's this next
phase, which was--

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.910
I'm sure many of you
are familiar with it.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.660
If you're not,
it's sort of where

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.500
we're using images
tracked on mobile devices

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.940
to pin content in the world.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.730
And the way that worked is
you would have your phone,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.350
and there would be some
sort of image or QR code.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.260
And by using that as
a reference point,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.000
we could put this
digital content

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.310
overlaid into the world.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.280
And it was awesome.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.040
It actually represented
this big jump

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.680
because, now, you could
deliver AR experiences

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.910
on mobile devices, right?

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.690
I could put
something on a store.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.480
Someone could download
it, and then they

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.100
could have this cool experience.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.970
But there were a
couple of shortcomings.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.500
The tracking wasn't as
good as what we have now.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.040
And if you lost sight
of the image marker,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.050
it would kind of go haywire.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.960
And most importantly, you
had to have this image

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.495
marker in space, right?

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.120
And that's a really
tricky proposition.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.860
It's hard enough to get
someone to download an app.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.350
But to get them
to download an app

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.287
and also print something
out can be challenging.

00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:20.120
And so we did see some
adoption of this tech

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.670
in marketing campaigns, where
there's physical collateral,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.920
or if there were
instruction booklets,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.950
things like that, where you
would know that your app could

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.620
have those markers available.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.760
But the game really changed
with modern AR platforms,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.960
like ARCore.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.070
And this was basically,
from a product perspective,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.160
like a quantum jump.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.390
I remember when I first
saw these new AR platforms.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.550
I was working with the
image maker stuff, right?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.960
And there was always a struggle.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.340
And I saw some
videos, and I just

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.010
was like, I don't believe that.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.710
That's not real.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.860
So I went out, I bought
devices, and I tried it.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.630
And I remember sitting
there and thinking,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.510
man, this can actually
be a thing now.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.860
I can release production quality
user experiences with AR.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.500
And the really important
thing about this

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.600
is there's no need for markers.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.910
That is a feature
that you can access,

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.660
but you can send anyone a
link to download your app.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.570
They can download it, and no
additional effort is required.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.370
They can have the
experience you intended.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.100
And so lowering that
barrier to entry,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.340
combined with a really
consistent output of quality,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.810
has just really changed the
game for AR in a product sense.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.010
And that brings us to today,
which is AR as a feature.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.430
So when these platforms
first hit, everyone went out

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.020
and we were making AR stuff.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.870
That's when I made an app
you can paint in the air.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.810
It's really cool, really fun.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.820
But these were these AR apps.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.070
And what our team
has discovered,

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.710
because we sort of go around
inside of Google and say,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.090
how can AR unlock new
potential use cases for people,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.738
is that your app doesn't
have to be an AR app.

00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:02.530
And in fact, some of
the most powerful ways

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.140
we can execute on AR
is including it just

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.870
as a feature in an existing app.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.120
And today is the perfect
time to be doing it,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.720
because these frameworks
make it super easy.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.630
When you see AR, it can look
kind of like black magic,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.810
like it's super hard.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.570
You need to be a mega genius
to get AR stuff happening.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.070
But, in reality, ARCore
makes it super easy,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.570
and there are tons
of helpful tools.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.390
So today is the
time when, I think,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.980
any product person
can be evaluating

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.380
their product for this stuff.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.530
So AR as a feature essentially
means that the whole app

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.700
isn't about AR.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.480
So what you see here
is Google Maps, right?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.520
And Google Maps
is not an AR app.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.020
It helps you get
where you're going.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.440
It helps you search
for awesome stuff,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.880
but it's not all about AR.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.470
However, the team discovered
that, for certain areas like,

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.380
in this case,
walking navigation,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.180
it can be really powerful and
enhance the app experience

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.250
to use AR in those moments.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.250
And same in your I/O app.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.750
If you pull it out
and use Signpost,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.340
you can get where you're going.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.560
But it's not it's not relegated
just to navigational use cases,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.770
as we'll see later.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.650
So I'm going to kick
it over to Diane,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.720
who's going to tell you
about how you can assess

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.300
the stuff you're working
on to see if maybe AR could

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.857
do something awesome with it.

00:09:22.857 --> 00:09:23.565
DIANE WANG: Cool.

00:09:23.565 --> 00:09:24.810
Thank You, Austin.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.030
So let's bring it
over to all of you

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.850
and start talking about
how you can determine

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.200
if AR is right for your app.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.220
Here are several
principles and questions

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.650
that you can ask
yourself as you decide on

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.030
whether AR has the potential to
add a lot of value to your app.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.100
And this is all going to
be drawn from our team's

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.250
experience, but we'll just kick
it off with the big question.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.010
So we always start off by asking
ourselves the simple question,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.040
why do we want to use AR?

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.490
And that really helps
ground us in user value

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.220
and thinking about
the specific value

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.420
that this suite of
technologies brings to us.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.790
And going a little bit
deeper here, on our team,

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.800
we think that there are two
broad categories of experiences

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.770
that AR can make shine.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.230
Use these as guidelines,
as starting points,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.090
to answer this question.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.640
So here are the two dimensions.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.370
You may have heard this
in our developer keynote.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.530
The two dimensions here are
helpfulness and creativity.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.570
So these are two
broad categories,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.660
and that's one really
easy way to get

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.440
started in thinking about,
hey, does my app fit in here?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.110
Does my feature fit in here?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.230
And just thinking about these
from a broad perspective--

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.370
helpfulness is a really great
place for AR to help shine.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.360
Because AR understands so
much of the spatial context

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.160
around a user that,
if you're trying

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.190
to have an app that helps the
user accomplish something,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:02.150
AR can do that in a lot
more quicker of a way.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.650
And when you think
about creativity,

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.470
AR has a lot of
opportunity here to help

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.240
make features shine as well.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.330
You can see that AR allows you
to be a lot more expressive

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.240
and engaging when you're
thinking about a creativity

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.110
feature.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.690
You can directly overlay
things and output content

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.800
into the world and also
have suggestive content

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.960
that leverages our
understanding of the context.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.450
But beyond these two
buckets, our team

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.640
also has some other
insights that we found,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.010
just by working across
a lot of different apps.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.310
So here's one to start with.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.000
One area that we found
has high AR potential

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.430
is when there's
information from the world

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.990
that we'd like to
have in our app.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.210
Often, if users need
to look something up

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.320
from the phone to
complete a flow in an app,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.320
AR has opportunities to enhance
and streamline that experience.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.710
AR has the ability to capture
information from the world

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:06.010
and make user journeys a lot
easier and more streamlined.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.230
So that was from the
helpfulness dimension.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.310
But when you're thinking
about creativity apps as well,

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.260
AR can suggest
expressive content

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.475
that's relevant to
the scene and context.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.710
And another category
of experiences

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.100
that has high opportunity
for AR features

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.320
is when someone needs to
interact with the real world

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.770
to use our app.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.770
So if someone needs to
do something in real life

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.380
to complete a flow, these
are really great signs

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.850
that AR may be useful.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.410
And one example of that
we illustrated here

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.060
is, you can imagine if someone
has some specific dietary needs

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.790
or preferences, and
they're at a grocery store,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.410
and they really need
to go and fiddle

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.570
with the products
in front of them

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.750
to understand the products
that are right for them,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.810
AR has the opportunity
to understand

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.470
that at a much faster rate.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.890
And we can even output
that in a way that's

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.840
really, really natural.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.750
So this illustration shows
that, for example, maybe we

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.330
could just highlight that
area that would have taken you

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.350
a while to get to.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:15.560
So I've just covered two
broad categories, but also

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.150
two other insights.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.470
But is that all?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.970
Definitely not.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.900
These are not absolute truisms.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.430
And there are often entirely
different AR opportunities

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.740
in an app that don't
fit in these buckets.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.500
So you're all going to have
your own special scenarios.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.980
So we encourage you to use
these as starting points,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.050
as ways to start
thinking and having

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.880
discussions about your app,
and to try out the experiences.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.570
And so we're going
to go over this next.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.870
But one of the fastest
ways to really understand

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.900
where AR can add a lot of
value is to just jump right

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.630
in and start making things.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.270
And one last note is
to remember that AR

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.860
is a tool and a
suite of technologies

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.260
and will add a lot of value
to some problems, but not all.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.400
But our guiding
principle remains.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.990
Always ask yourself, why
is this better with AR?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.030
And now, I'll hand
it over to Austin

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.590
to talk about how we
get these to happen.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.590
AUSTIN MCCASLAND: Sweet.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:17.530
Thank you, Diane.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.560
So I call this
part the fun part.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.910
It's the fun part, for me.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:25.770
So when we talk about
building AR features,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.000
how do we go about
approaching that?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.908
And our team does
this all the time--

00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:31.200
over, and over, and over again.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.460
It's great.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.750
So I'm going to run you
through these three principles.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.240
And these principles, they're
just these lighthouse concepts

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.800
that we try to keep
top of mind when

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.300
we're developing AR features.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.430
And there's some unique
things in here that sort

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:50.700
of differentiate an AR feature
from a more traditional feature

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.780
in an app.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.193
And these that our
prototypes are our sketches.

00:14:55.193 --> 00:14:56.610
We consider design
and development

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:57.990
to be intrinsically linked.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.812
And that it's OK to be cool,
but we need to strike a balance.

00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:04.020
So I'm going to dive a little
bit into each of these,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.150
starting out with
prototypes are our sketches.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.520
So if anyone has been in a
room with designers, or product

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.530
people, or anyone
anywhere, we know

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.660
that sketching is this awesome
tool for communication.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.970
And for the purposes
of this piece,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.400
let's think about sketches as
a way that we can assess ideas.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.400
So I might make a sketch,
and I give it to Diane.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.288
And we use that to figure
out, is this idea good?

00:15:29.288 --> 00:15:30.330
What do we like about it?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.950
What don't we like about it?

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.650
And those things run
through product teams.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.100
Product management,
engineering, design-- everyone

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.960
lays eyes on these.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.920
But we've found that, with AR,
understanding whether or not

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.040
something is good
or worth pursuing,

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.880
it's really hard to
capture from a sketch.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.750
There's all sorts of things
that look great on paper,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.710
and then when you try to go to
execute on them, they stumble.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.370
And it's really tricky.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.040
And so we try to get
to these prototypes

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.800
as quickly as possible
because that's really

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.630
the baseline for
our AR features,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.540
for us to be able to
say, is this working?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.680
Do we want to continue
on this and refine it?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.165
The next principle is that we
consider design and development

00:16:15.165 --> 00:16:16.290
to be intrinsically linked.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.610
And I know, they are in all
normal app development cycles

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.480
as well.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.570
However, the relationship
between design and engineering

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.610
in AR is incredibly tight.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.040
And in fact, every time
we start a project,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.260
we start design and
development at the same time.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.878
We don't come up with
designs, and then

00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:37.920
show them to engineering.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.660
We don't even run like
tight back and forth cycles.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.127
We sit next to each other.

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:44.460
And we'll have a computer
with a development environment

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.520
happening, and a computer with
a design environment happening.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.480
And that's because,
right now, there's

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.490
all sorts of
opportunities for design

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.680
to be really helpful for some of
the harder technology problems.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.290
So an example that
I like to give

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.560
is, let's say it's
pitch black, right?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.119
That's a really hard
situation for AR.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.555
We lose tracking.

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:07.180
And so from an
engineering perspective,

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:07.804
that's really hard.

00:17:07.804 --> 00:17:09.270
You're like, ah, do
we need depth cameras?

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.353
Do we need all that stuff?

00:17:10.353 --> 00:17:12.819
But if the design
team is right there,

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.363
they can say, actually, hold on.

00:17:14.363 --> 00:17:15.780
As long as you can
tell it's dark,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.660
we'll just ask the user
to go turn the lights on.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.760
And we find that there's
all these opportunities

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.060
to design around really
hard technical problems,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.670
and that the technology
often informs what's

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.830
even possible in a design.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.830
And you really have to
try it and the hand feel.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.705
It's super important.

00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:32.470
So the coupling of these in AR--

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.902
super critical.

00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:36.360
And the last
principle I'll go over

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.700
is that it's OK to be
cool, but strike a balance.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:44.220
So in the design world, we often
call these moments of delight,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.130
moments where we do something
that's really exceptionally

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.010
powerful or useful for a user
that was surprising to them,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.860
or these little moments
that you see in animations.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.305
Or just go to dribble,
if you're looking

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.430
for what I'm talking about.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.120
But in AR, these
moments exist as well.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.730
And they're actually
often much more powerful.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.290
They're these sort
of moments of awe.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.520
Like if you watched the keynote,
you saw that shark go on stage.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.020
And that's just one
of those moments

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.060
that it's not just
delight, it's this.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.310
Whoa!

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.950
And we have found in
our testing that that

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.930
is really powerful for users,
because it does two things.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.380
One is that it captures
their attention.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.340
And when they're more
focused on our app,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.180
they more successfully
complete tasks inside of them.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.353
And so it actually serves
a functional purpose.

00:18:30.353 --> 00:18:31.770
And two is that
we've noticed when

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.380
we were working on features
where we actually really focus

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.960
on these awe moments
and consider them worth

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.770
spending the time on, they
tend to go hand-in-hand

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.510
with users being
successful, overall,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.370
even besides attention.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.290
And it really helps
them be memorable

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.460
against the competition.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.250
So the other part of this
is, strike a balance.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.900
It can be really
easy to go overboard,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.430
once you have the
AR stuff running

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.490
and turn your app into
a game experience.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.330
And maybe you want that,
but you want to be on brand.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.290
And it's possible to maintain
the mood and attitude

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.780
of your application
and have AR that's

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.660
impressive and exciting,
without distracting

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.557
from the core needs
of your users.

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:16.890
And now, I'm going to dive
into just a couple of methods

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.150
and techniques we use.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.442
A lot of these will probably
look very familiar to you,

00:19:20.442 --> 00:19:22.470
if you've done product
design type stuff.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.270
But I'll give you
some examples of how

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.163
we use them in our AR practice.

00:19:27.163 --> 00:19:28.830
So they are sketching
and whiteboarding,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.660
rapid prototyping,
and quick user tests.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.100
And I know I just said that
prototypes are our sketches,

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.040
but it does not mean
that we do not sketch.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.100
We do a lot of that.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.930
Early in the cycle of
an idea, having a shared

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.490
visual for these
spatial computing

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.580
concepts is super important.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.080
There have been
multiple times where

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.200
I've had like a 30, 45-minute
conversation with the PM,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.700
a fellow designer, or engineer.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.040
And we're both vibing.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.260
We're on the same page,
and we're super excited.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.080
And then I go to draw
what I was talking about,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.630
and it turns out that we
were not on the same page

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.490
and that it was very different.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.800
The sooner that you can get
some sort of shared visual

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.320
to frame your thinking
around, the better,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.730
because the vocabulary for
describing spatial problems

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.480
and the way that users
interact with space

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.120
is just really challenging.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.020
And so these visual
supports are super helpful.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.480
We'll also do
storyboards where we

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.340
show how users are
going-- we anticipate

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.710
them moving through space
with our experience.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.888
And we'll do flow
charts, you name it.

00:20:29.888 --> 00:20:31.430
And this is really
just a tool for us

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.190
to iterate super fast, before
we even touch those prototypes.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.020
Next up is rapid prototyping.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.320
And I would have to say, if
our team has a superpower,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.700
it's this.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.170
We make prototypes fast.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.900
And you too can
make prototypes fast

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.970
because, one, they
don't always need

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.240
to be technology prototypes.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.200
As Diane will show you later,
you can do physical prototyping

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:53.710
in space.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.140
And often, that's
enough to assess an idea

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.580
and at least get
it off the ground.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.560
But also, there's
amazing tools nowadays.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.490
Like we use Unity
a ton on our team

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.130
to just bust out these quick and
dirty prototypes, just to get

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.510
the hand feel.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.298
And if our prototypes
are our sketches,

00:21:09.298 --> 00:21:10.840
then we do a lot of
sketching, right?

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.690
So we try to just get to the
quickest and dirtiest way

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.480
to feel it, and try
it out, and assess it.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.570
And if it passes muster,
then we really refine it.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.720
And one of the ways
that we do this refining

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.670
is through quick user testing.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.640
And I don't mean doing a really
quick SurveyMonkey user test,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.142
although that could be fine.

00:21:30.142 --> 00:21:32.600
It's more like I'll go to Diane,
and I'll tap her shoulder,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.840
and I'll say, hey, try this.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.280
I'll just constantly thrust
new builds of the prototype

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.570
in her hand, because it's
really difficult to see

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.412
the forest for the trees in AR.

00:21:42.412 --> 00:21:43.870
And part of that
is because there's

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.913
this physicality to augmented
reality as a medium.

00:21:46.913 --> 00:21:48.580
And you actually
develop a muscle memory

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.070
from making your app
work the right way.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.423
So you're like, oh,
this is how you do it.

00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:55.840
You hand it to someone else,
and then they're like, whoop.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.270
You know?

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.520
They're off in space, and
you didn't realize that, oh,

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.940
I need to have some
affordance to guide them back

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.780
to what they need to be doing.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.470
So lots of quick user
testing and feedback.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.150
And then eventually,
once you think

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.210
you've landed on it, yeah,
run some actual user tests.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.502
Validate a feature.

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:13.960
I'm going to kick
it over to Diane,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.418
who's going to run
you through what

00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:17.900
it might look like for our team
to go through this process.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.775
And it's a process you
might be able to scalp

00:22:19.775 --> 00:22:22.042
for your own
product development.

00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:22.750
DIANE WANG: Cool.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.680
Thank You.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.500
So yeah, we're going to go
through the whole process

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.110
and take a look at what
it might look like,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.300
end-to-end, for you to start to
prototype your own AR feature.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.040
And so I'll talk through
the steps first right now,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.550
and then we'll walk
through them one by one.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.370
And these are incorporating a
lot of what Austin just said.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.110
There's principles, methods.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.300
And these are very
special to AR,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.220
because these features
are so closely

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.620
tied to the physical
and world space

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.050
that there's new things
that classic methodologies

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.070
in the field might
not really address.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.340
So we generally follow
these steps in our process,

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.830
although we always adjust
steps based on what

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.850
is relevant for the feature.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.820
And we recommend
that you do the same.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.090
Kind of dig into what I'm saying
and the underlying purpose

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.670
behind these methodologies
and pull the steps

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.700
that really work for you.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.230
And so, from a high
level, we always

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.350
start our process by
jumping into a brainstorm

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.803
and opening up the
AR opportunities.

00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.970
This is where you start to
bring in a lot of people,

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.950
get a lot of diverse
perspectives,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.680
bring out the
creativity in the group.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.380
And then we start deciding.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.680
And this is where my
previous conversation

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.770
about how you can evaluate
different AR features and apps

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.530
comes in handy.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.670
Then after we decide on our
ideas, we start sketching.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.850
And this is where we get the
broad strokes of all our ideas.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.040
Austin talked about
this before, but there's

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.420
different types of sketching.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.850
You can work with any
low-fidelity materials

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.620
you have around you.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.290
But then we gradually push
it toward physical testing.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.980
And if it's really
applicable, you

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.530
might have some apps that
are really closely tied

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.680
to the physical world
space and physical elements

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.210
that are all around you.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.780
So the fastest way to get a
sense of those interactions

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.480
is just to try those out.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.240
And then after that, we kind
of understand our concepts,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.340
so we jump into design and
development simultaneously.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.440
And I'll talk more about
how we do that later.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.410
And another underlying step
that we consider more horizontal

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.188
is, we're always
testing early and often.

00:24:34.188 --> 00:24:35.730
And that's with the
people around us,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.520
but it's also great
to try to incorporate

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.030
your users as soon as you can.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.590
And we always wrap
up our process

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.260
by taking the feedback that
we get from all of our tests,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.880
and we prioritize the stuff
that we want to incorporate.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.980
We think about
supporting functionality,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.290
and then we walk out with
a really cohesive concept.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.470
But jumping right in,
let's just start talking

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:03.450
about the brainstorm phase.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.270
And so this is where we open
up all the opportunities.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.200
We have a really great, robust
conversation with our group.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.050
And we really try
to pull together

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.060
people of diverse
perspectives, so people

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.670
from different functions,
of different backgrounds,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.798
especially from
backgrounds of people

00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:21.090
who will be using your feature.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.610
So if people can empathize
with those groups,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.890
try to pull them in.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.680
And if you get a
diverse group, you also

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.360
get really creative ideas
on the board as well.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.610
And this photo shows you
what one of our brainstorms

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.600
might look like.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.120
Over here, I'm just
putting ideas on the board,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.040
but I'm using a
design methodology,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.200
called affinity
mapping, where we're

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.620
grouping a lot of the
Post-its together by theme.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.830
And that really lets us
take a step back and talk

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.297
about the themes that are really
exciting, before we get too

00:25:53.297 --> 00:25:54.255
caught up into details.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.950
And once we have our
ideas on the board,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.840
we have discussions
about the ideas

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.690
that we are most excited about
and have the most AR potential.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:12.130
And this is where our previous
sections on evaluating AR apps

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.710
and features comes in handy.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.780
And this photo shows
what one group of ideas

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.120
may look like at the
end of our brainstorm.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.950
We're doing something
called dot voting

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.220
where we give each person
a certain number of votes.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.530
And these are dot stickers.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.080
And we use this as a way to
gauge the general interest

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.380
and ones that we're most
excited about, as a group.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.110
And we use this as a way to
facilitate our conversations,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.240
and not to decide our ideas.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.340
So try this out yourself.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.570
And one other tip is that
our team has done this a lot.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.915
So we find that giving each
person around three to five

00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:52.640
dot stickers is a
really great balance

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.370
between trying to get a
nice breadth of votes,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.290
but not spending way
too much time trying

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.310
to get those votes done.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.330
And now once we've
decided on our ideas,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.190
we jump into sketching.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.330
So we sketch to get a first-pass
glance at the solutions

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.160
that we're excited about.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.190
In this photo, I'm
storyboarding a complete journey

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.940
of an AR feature using
whiteboard and marker.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.040
And this is where
you can see that AR

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.550
starts to have a difference in
classic design methodologies

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.880
as well.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.480
This is not a sketch
that you would typically

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.760
have for a 2D app,
because you can

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.150
see that I'm sketching
a user in world space

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.790
with elements that are
pinned in world space.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.240
So you can see that,
even at this stage,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.380
we're starting to think
a little bit differently.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.580
And you might have to pull
out your perspective drawing

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.050
skills.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.380
And so we encourage
anyone to use

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.050
any low-fidelity and scrappy
materials that are available.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.940
You can do pen and paper,
whiteboard and marker

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.230
to just try out the
entire user journey

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.095
and take a look at the
feature at a first glance.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.370
So one unique part
about working with AR

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.790
is that UI elements interact
with physical elements

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.980
in the real world,
so it's a great idea

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.190
to try out your designs
through physical prototyping.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.230
So here's a really
great photo of something

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.910
that our team tried out.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.010
We have these UI
elements that we wanted

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.310
to have pinned to these fruits.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.780
And so in order to understand
a few factors, like scale,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.930
legibility, and how
they look like and feel

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.460
like in world space, we just
created and started prototyping

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.290
with physical elements.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.250
So paper is great for this.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.560
We've worked with LEGOs.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.880
We've worked with clay.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.600
Those are really great
low-fidelity, physical things

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.530
to start working with.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.050
And once we've gotten a good
look at initial designs,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.770
we jump into design and
development simultaneously.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.650
And Austin talked about
this a bit before,

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.090
but our team really
enjoys working

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.420
with Sketch for 2D UI
designs, and Unity,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.943
to develop our
experiences quickly.

00:29:10.943 --> 00:29:12.610
And at this stage,
we work through a lot

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.230
of iterations of our concepts
as questions show up.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.560
We usually have designers
and developers partnering up.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.110
So you have that really
nice collaboration and just

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.940
back and forth of
questions along the way.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.420
And this step is
incorporated into some

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.720
of the previous steps, as well.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.570
But testing early and often is
really key to a successful AR

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:40.380
feature, since there are so
many edge cases and interactions

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.120
that we've never encountered
before in 2D designs.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.130
And here's a photo
of Austin testing out

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.100
a prototype in a lightweight
manner with real world

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.000
objects--

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.167
AUSTIN MCCASLAND: Beautiful.

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:53.730
DIANE WANG: --in our office.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.750
Yeah, just try to do it
really early, really often.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.140
And continue testing
with users all the way

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.160
through development.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.620
I know we're talking a lot
about rapid prototyping

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.908
for early concepting of things
that are just kicking off.

00:30:07.908 --> 00:30:09.450
But something that's
really important

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.850
is work with your
stakeholders, or whoever

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:15.030
is involved in pushing
your feature to launch.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.670
Work with them along the
way to share your insights,

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.090
but also push them to also
continue testing along the way.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.710
And here's our last
step for today.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.280
Once we have a lot of
feedback from your colleagues,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.060
from users, we bring
this feedback back

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.860
for our final polish.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.110
And this is where we walk
through all of the remaining

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:40.080
pieces for a cohesive feature.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.300
And some examples of what
we'll be working through

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.480
in this phase include,
notifications,

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.550
edge cases in
different contexts,

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:50.840
offline scenarios,
and scalability.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.630
But now, I'll hand
it back to Austin

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.432
to bring everything together.

00:30:54.432 --> 00:30:55.390
AUSTIN MCCASLAND: Cool.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.500
Thank you.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.220
So upgrading your app with ARj--

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.542
I hope you guys do
it, because it's rad.

00:31:03.542 --> 00:31:05.750
Let's pull together everything
we talked about today.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.010
So if you are a product person,
or a designer, or an engineer,

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.210
or anyone who cares
about the space--

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.330
maybe you have an
idea for a product--

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.770
really start thinking about
AR and what you're working on.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.500
And you should really
just evaluate your own app

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.470
for AR potential.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.530
Think about, are
there ways that I

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.290
might be able to make this
thing easier to do for my users,

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.950
or more exciting
for my users to do?

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.890
Or is there something
that we never

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.780
could have done before
that we can show them

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.340
in the real world?

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.430
And it's not right
for every problem,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.090
but if you can
answer the question,

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.693
why is this feature
better in AR,

00:31:42.693 --> 00:31:43.860
then you should do it in AR.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.930
The next is that you
won't know if it's

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.310
good or not, until you try it.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.900
So try stuff out.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.040
And I'm not kidding.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.640
The suite of tools that are
available for creating quick

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.880
features that you can
test out, it's amazing.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.860
So I'm a designer,
and I do some coding.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.870
And I make these
all day, every day.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.690
If you're an engineer,
go on Unity's website

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.680
and check it out.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.090
Or do native stuff.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.490
It's a lot less
intimidating than you think

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.622
to build these AR experiences.

00:32:17.622 --> 00:32:18.580
Just get your feet wet.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.070
I bet it's way more fun
and easy than you'd expect.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.250
And ARCore makes a lot of
the hard stuff really easy.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.070
And finally, keep on
testing, and testing,

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.980
and testing, until you're
confident it's awesome.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.690
And deploy it.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.690
Thank you, very much, for
coming to our session.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.040
I'm Austin McCasland.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.360
DIANE WANG: I'm Diane Wang.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.443
AUSTIN MCCASLAND: And we
hope you guys enjoyed it.

00:32:43.443 --> 00:32:46.022
And build some super
powered apps with AR.

00:32:46.022 --> 00:32:46.730
Cheers, you guys.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.647
DIANE WANG: Thank you.

00:32:47.647 --> 00:32:49.130
