00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.830
Before concluding this class on java development, I want to

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.330
talk about another process that is very popular these days, and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
it's used in many companies, which is called Scrum. Which similar

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.370
to XP is another agile development process, and I'm going to

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
start by discussing what the Scrum actors are. There's three

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.490
main kinds of actors. The first one is the product owner,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.590
which means the customer. The product owner is mainly responsible for

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460
the product back log, where the product back log is basically

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.660
the list of things that have to be done, the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.670
back log in fact for the project. And that is

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.640
analogous to the user stories to be realized in XP,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.190
that we just saw. So what the product owner does is

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.310
to clearly express these back log items, and to also

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.680
order them by value, so they can be prioritized. The second

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
actor is the team. The team is responsible for delivering

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.012
shippable increments to estimate the

00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:50.600
back log items. It's normally self-organized,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.055
consists of four to nine people, and it's what you

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:56.180
would consider normally as the main development team in a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.080
project. And finally we have the Scrum master. The Scrum

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.860
master is the person who's responsible for the overall Scrum process,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.980
so he or she has to remove obstacles, facilitate events,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.668
helps communications, and so on. So you you can see

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.013
the Scrum master as sort of a manager or the

00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:15.059
person who's got oversight, or the supervisor of the Scrum process.
