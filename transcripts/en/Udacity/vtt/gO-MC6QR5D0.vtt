00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.380
Next, we'll create the Today List Item.
Since this layout is different

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.790
from the other list items, we're going
to need to create a new XML file under

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.600
the resources layout folder. Use the same
place holder image as you did before.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.267
Also, use the same IDs 
that you declared in the

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:18.264
list_item_forecast_xml file.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.762
For example, in our code,
we called this list item Icon,

00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:23.270
and we called this list item
Date Text View.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.520
So, we use those same IDs
for the elements in this XML file.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.366
You'll see why when we introduce
view holders later.

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.042
After you've finished adding it,
make sure the app still compiles.

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.850
You won't see any visual difference
until the next step.
