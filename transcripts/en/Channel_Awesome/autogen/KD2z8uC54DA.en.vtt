that he had made called Tommy's planet

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:03.990
that he had made called Tommy's planet
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.730
that he had made called Tommy's planet
and he just is totally different I mean

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740
and he just is totally different I mean
 

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.559
and he just is totally different I mean
he comes up with lines like with the

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:09.569
he comes up with lines like with the
 

00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:10.999
he comes up with lines like with the
doggie thing like a lot of the best

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:11.009
doggie thing like a lot of the best
 

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:12.410
doggie thing like a lot of the best
things about Tommy are they're

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420
things about Tommy are they're
 

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.240
things about Tommy are they're
improvised like those Moe the best

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.250
improvised like those Moe the best
 

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.009
improvised like those Moe the best
moments in the film are just him having

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019
moments in the film are just him having
 

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.860
moments in the film are just him having
a reaction and and I think that's what's

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:18.870
a reaction and and I think that's what's
 

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.150
a reaction and and I think that's what's
great about the room as you're seeing

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160
great about the room as you're seeing
 

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.740
great about the room as you're seeing
something that you couldn't really find

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:21.750
something that you couldn't really find
 

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.720
something that you couldn't really find
anywhere else because nobody thinks like

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:23.730
anywhere else because nobody thinks like
 

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.480
anywhere else because nobody thinks like
him and nobody would have put this much

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.490
him and nobody would have put this much
 

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.340
him and nobody would have put this much
energy into making a film without

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:28.350
energy into making a film without
 

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.860
energy into making a film without
getting anybody else's opinion I just

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:30.870
getting anybody else's opinion I just
 

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.170
getting anybody else's opinion I just
totally bankrolling the whole thing and

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180
totally bankrolling the whole thing and
 

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.579
totally bankrolling the whole thing and
pushing it until people finally

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:34.589
pushing it until people finally
 

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:36.619
pushing it until people finally
responded to it so I think that's what's

00:12:36.619 --> 00:12:36.629
responded to it so I think that's what's
 

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:38.470
responded to it so I think that's what's
kept the room going for 10 years is that

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480
kept the room going for 10 years is that
 

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
kept the room going for 10 years is that
no one thinks speaks or acts like him

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.250
no one thinks speaks or acts like him
 

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.189
no one thinks speaks or acts like him

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:45.740
and I think people just are trying to
figure out what really it is do you feel

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:45.750
figure out what really it is do you feel
 

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.710
figure out what really it is do you feel
