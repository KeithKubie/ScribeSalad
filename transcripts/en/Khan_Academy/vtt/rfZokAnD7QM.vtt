00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:03.205
- Count by 10s starting with 40.

00:00:03.205 --> 00:00:04.923
Fill in the blanks.

00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:09.817
So, let's count by 10s, starting with 40.

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:11.982
So, 40 is four 10s.

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:13.514
So, if we add 10 to that,

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:16.417
we're gonna get five 10s, or 50.

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.879
Now, if we add 10 to that,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:21.060
we're going to get six 10s, or 60.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.500
Now, if we add 10 to that,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.381
we're going to get seven 10s, or 70,

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:25.495
but we don't have to type that in,

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:27.794
because they've already
put that there for us.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.348
Let's keep adding 10s.

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:33.645
So, if we add 10 to
70, or 10 to seven 10s,

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.292
we're going to have eight 10s, or 80.

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:37.592
Add 10 to that,

00:00:37.592 --> 00:00:40.239
you're going to have nine 10s, or 90.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.493
And then we're done.

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:43.020
Let's do one more of these.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.693
Count by 10s starting with 656.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.063
Fill in the blanks.

00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:52.569
Well, each time we want to add one 10.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.750
So, this 656, it's six hundreds,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.490
five tens, and six ones.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.417
Well, now we're going to add 10 to it.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:02.460
So instead of having five 10s,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.246
we want to have six 10s,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:08.474
so it's gonna be 666,

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:12.160
six hundreds, six tens, and six ones.

00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.186
Let's add 10 again.

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:15.417
Well, now, in the last one,

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:18.366
we had six 10s, now we
want to have seven 10s.

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:22.702
So, it's gonna be 676.

00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:25.448
Now, let's add another 10.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:27.073
Well, now we're gonna have six hundreds,

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:31.545
eight tens, and six ones, or 686.

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:33.714
Now, let's add 10 again.

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:36.639
So, now, we're gonna have six hundreds,

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.170
instead of eight 10s,
we're gonna have nine 10s,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.587
and six ones.

00:01:40.587 --> 00:01:43.489
So, 696.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:46.136
Now, the next one is
going to be interesting.

00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:48.829
We want to add another 10 to this.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.801
But how do we have, if we
add another 10 to this,

00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:54.588
what do we have in the tens place?

00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:56.677
Well, one way to think about this is,

00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:59.115
you can view six hundreds and nine tens

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.275
as 69 tens.

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:04.572
So if you have 69 tens,
and you add one more ten,

00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:06.731
you're going to have 70 tens,

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:10.980
so you're going to have
70 tens, and six ones.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.138
So, 696, you add 10 to it,

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:16.715
you get 706.

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:20.547
Once again, you can view
this as 65 tens and six ones,

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:21.940
So, 65 tens,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.310
66 tens,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.724
67 tens,

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:27.837
68 tens,

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:29.579
69 tens,

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.436
and 70 tens.

00:02:31.436 --> 00:02:33.753
706.
