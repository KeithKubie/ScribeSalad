00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460
 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.920
Joshua you asked a really great question

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930
Joshua you asked a really great question
 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.440
Joshua you asked a really great question
why is there no gravity in space I bet

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
why is there no gravity in space I bet
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.330
why is there no gravity in space I bet
you've seen pictures of the astronauts

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
you've seen pictures of the astronauts
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.650
you've seen pictures of the astronauts
up in the space station and they're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660
up in the space station and they're
 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.330
up in the space station and they're
floating around as if there's no gravy

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
floating around as if there's no gravy
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.940
floating around as if there's no gravy
at all and this is actually a really

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950
at all and this is actually a really
 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.890
at all and this is actually a really
interesting misconception about what's

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
interesting misconception about what's
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.170
interesting misconception about what's
going on with the astronauts and it gets

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
going on with the astronauts and it gets
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.270
going on with the astronauts and it gets
to one of my favorite questions all of

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280
to one of my favorite questions all of
 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.730
to one of my favorite questions all of
astronomy and that is what is an orbit

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
astronomy and that is what is an orbit
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.979
astronomy and that is what is an orbit
what's happening when astronauts are

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
what's happening when astronauts are
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840
what's happening when astronauts are
orbiting the Earth and why does it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
orbiting the Earth and why does it
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.020
orbiting the Earth and why does it
appear like there's no gravity in space

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
appear like there's no gravity in space
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.549
appear like there's no gravity in space
so to talk about why this is kind of a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
so to talk about why this is kind of a
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889
so to talk about why this is kind of a
misconception the astronauts are about

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
misconception the astronauts are about
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930
misconception the astronauts are about
200 miles above the surface of the earth

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
200 miles above the surface of the earth
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.579
200 miles above the surface of the earth
in the space station Space Station

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589
in the space station Space Station
 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.500
in the space station Space Station
orbits around us about once every 90

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
orbits around us about once every 90
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290
orbits around us about once every 90
minutes and it's not that they're so far

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
minutes and it's not that they're so far
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639
minutes and it's not that they're so far
away from the earth that there's no

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649
away from the earth that there's no
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619
away from the earth that there's no
gravity in fact if you built a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
gravity in fact if you built a
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.349
gravity in fact if you built a
skyscraper that was 200 miles tall and

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359
skyscraper that was 200 miles tall and
 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.969
skyscraper that was 200 miles tall and
you were up on one of those top floors

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979
you were up on one of those top floors
 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.099
you were up on one of those top floors
you might weight a tiny little bit less

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
you might weight a tiny little bit less
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.450
you might weight a tiny little bit less
but you'd probably weigh at least about

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
but you'd probably weigh at least about
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340
but you'd probably weigh at least about
80% what you normally would

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
80% what you normally would
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170
80% what you normally would
you're really not that much farther away

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
you're really not that much farther away
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450
you're really not that much farther away
from the earth so it's not that they're

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
from the earth so it's not that they're
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340
from the earth so it's not that they're
weightless because they're in space and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
weightless because they're in space and
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.470
weightless because they're in space and
far away from the earth they're actually

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480
far away from the earth they're actually
 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.300
far away from the earth they're actually
close enough to the earth to feel the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
close enough to the earth to feel the
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010
close enough to the earth to feel the
gravitational pull of the earth itself

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
gravitational pull of the earth itself
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200
gravitational pull of the earth itself
so what's going on why are they floating

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
so what's going on why are they floating
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080
so what's going on why are they floating
around well this is what an orbit really

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
around well this is what an orbit really
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.470
around well this is what an orbit really
is we have to get spacecraft going very

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480
is we have to get spacecraft going very
 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.870
is we have to get spacecraft going very
very fast to put them into orbit that's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880
very fast to put them into orbit that's
 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000
very fast to put them into orbit that's
why we put them on Rockets Rockets

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010
why we put them on Rockets Rockets
 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.620
why we put them on Rockets Rockets
launch spacecraft and get them going

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
launch spacecraft and get them going
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.500
launch spacecraft and get them going
very very fast and if you're in orbit

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510
very very fast and if you're in orbit
 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.120
very very fast and if you're in orbit
where the space station is you're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
where the space station is you're
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.840
where the space station is you're
traveling at about 17,000 miles an hour

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850
traveling at about 17,000 miles an hour
 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.760
traveling at about 17,000 miles an hour
now what happens to those astronauts is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
now what happens to those astronauts is
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310
now what happens to those astronauts is
that they're going very very fast but

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
that they're going very very fast but
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.290
that they're going very very fast but
they're actually freely falling towards

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300
they're actually freely falling towards
 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.630
they're actually freely falling towards
the Earth the earth has gravity and that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
the Earth the earth has gravity and that
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.000
the Earth the earth has gravity and that
gravity is pulling them down just the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010
gravity is pulling them down just the
 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.170
gravity is pulling them down just the
same as what would happen is if you

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
same as what would happen is if you
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.510
same as what would happen is if you
dropped a ball if you dropped a ball it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
dropped a ball if you dropped a ball it
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.790
dropped a ball if you dropped a ball it
would fall to the floor the same thing

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800
would fall to the floor the same thing
 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.260
would fall to the floor the same thing
is happening to the astronauts they are

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
is happening to the astronauts they are
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.030
is happening to the astronauts they are
falling towards the surface of the earth

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040
falling towards the surface of the earth
 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.700
falling towards the surface of the earth
but here's the cool thing they're going

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
but here's the cool thing they're going
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.640
but here's the cool thing they're going
so fast they keep missing the earth as

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650
so fast they keep missing the earth as
 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.490
so fast they keep missing the earth as
they fall and that's the definition of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
they fall and that's the definition of
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619
they fall and that's the definition of
an orbit now think about it this way I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
an orbit now think about it this way I
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479
an orbit now think about it this way I
talked about dropping a ball the ball

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
talked about dropping a ball the ball
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.520
talked about dropping a ball the ball
just falls straight down what would

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
just falls straight down what would
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.260
just falls straight down what would
happen if I put the ball in a little

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270
happen if I put the ball in a little
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.320
happen if I put the ball in a little
cannon and shot it out the ball would

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
cannon and shot it out the ball would
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.430
cannon and shot it out the ball would
start to drop

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
start to drop
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440
start to drop
the earth the minute it left the cannon

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
the earth the minute it left the cannon
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.090
the earth the minute it left the cannon
but the cannon has given it some

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
but the cannon has given it some
 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.520
but the cannon has given it some
velocity and so the ball might go a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
velocity and so the ball might go a
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.710
velocity and so the ball might go a
hundred yards right it might actually go

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720
hundred yards right it might actually go
 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.750
hundred yards right it might actually go
a hundred yards before it fell because

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
a hundred yards before it fell because
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600
a hundred yards before it fell because
the cannon gave it that velocity now

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610
the cannon gave it that velocity now
 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550
the cannon gave it that velocity now
let's take it even bigger cannon let's

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
let's take it even bigger cannon let's
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.350
let's take it even bigger cannon let's
take a huge cannon that can shoot things

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
take a huge cannon that can shoot things
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.960
take a huge cannon that can shoot things
many many miles so you shoot the ball

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
many many miles so you shoot the ball
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.450
many many miles so you shoot the ball
out the ball is still falling freely

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460
out the ball is still falling freely
 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.440
out the ball is still falling freely
towards the Earth

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
towards the Earth
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.240
towards the Earth
all the time but now it goes farther

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
all the time but now it goes farther
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.770
all the time but now it goes farther
because you've given it more velocity

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
because you've given it more velocity
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510
because you've given it more velocity
and maybe with a really big hand and you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520
and maybe with a really big hand and you
 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.090
and maybe with a really big hand and you
could shoot a ball 100 miles what about

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
could shoot a ball 100 miles what about
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.400
could shoot a ball 100 miles what about
with a rocket with a rocket you could

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
with a rocket with a rocket you could
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.490
with a rocket with a rocket you could
get something going so fast up to 17,000

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
get something going so fast up to 17,000
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.250
get something going so fast up to 17,000
miles an hour that as it fell freely

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
miles an hour that as it fell freely
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.740
miles an hour that as it fell freely
towards Earth Earth would keep curving

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
towards Earth Earth would keep curving
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.110
towards Earth Earth would keep curving
away under it and it would keep missing

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
away under it and it would keep missing
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.260
away under it and it would keep missing
it that's what an orbit is and that's

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270
it that's what an orbit is and that's
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.970
it that's what an orbit is and that's
why you need a rocket to get into orbit

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
why you need a rocket to get into orbit
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.460
why you need a rocket to get into orbit
you need to get yourself going so fast

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470
you need to get yourself going so fast
 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.790
you need to get yourself going so fast
that as you fall back towards Earth you

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800
that as you fall back towards Earth you
 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.280
that as you fall back towards Earth you
keep missing it so the astronauts are

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
keep missing it so the astronauts are
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.660
keep missing it so the astronauts are
not weightless because there's no

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
not weightless because there's no
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.340
not weightless because there's no
gravity in space the astronauts are

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
gravity in space the astronauts are
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.160
gravity in space the astronauts are
falling the same way a skydiver is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
falling the same way a skydiver is
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.190
falling the same way a skydiver is
falling freely through space it's just

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200
falling freely through space it's just
 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.380
falling freely through space it's just
that they're going so fast they keep

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390
that they're going so fast they keep
 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.050
that they're going so fast they keep
missing the earth there all the time

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060
missing the earth there all the time
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.810
missing the earth there all the time
falling towards the earth going fast

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820
falling towards the earth going fast
 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.330
falling towards the earth going fast
enough that they keep missing it

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340
enough that they keep missing it
 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.590
enough that they keep missing it
everything that's in orbit around

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600
everything that's in orbit around
 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.240
everything that's in orbit around
anything else is doing the same thing

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
anything else is doing the same thing
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.150
anything else is doing the same thing
right now you and I are falling freely

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160
right now you and I are falling freely
 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.610
right now you and I are falling freely
towards the Sun but the earth is moving

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
towards the Sun but the earth is moving
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.740
towards the Sun but the earth is moving
actually at about 30,000 miles an hour

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
actually at about 30,000 miles an hour
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900
actually at about 30,000 miles an hour
and we keep missing the Sun as we go

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910
and we keep missing the Sun as we go
 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.610
and we keep missing the Sun as we go
around it and that means we're in orbit

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620
around it and that means we're in orbit
 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.949
around it and that means we're in orbit
around the Sun the moon is in orbit

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959
around the Sun the moon is in orbit
 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.380
around the Sun the moon is in orbit
around the Earth it's falling towards

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
around the Earth it's falling towards
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.690
around the Earth it's falling towards
the earth is just traveling so fast it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
the earth is just traveling so fast it
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.560
the earth is just traveling so fast it
keeps missing it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570
keeps missing it
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.860
keeps missing it
you've asked an excellent question

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870
you've asked an excellent question
 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.780
you've asked an excellent question
everything in space that is orbiting is

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790
everything in space that is orbiting is
 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.420
everything in space that is orbiting is
freely falling under gravity it's just

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430
freely falling under gravity it's just
 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.910
freely falling under gravity it's just
going too fast to ever hit anything

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920
 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.980
you
