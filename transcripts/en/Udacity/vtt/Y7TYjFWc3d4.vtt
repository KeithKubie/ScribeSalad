00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Why should you be a facilitator or a teacher?

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.690
Why should you give your time to Startup Weekend and these entrepreneurs?

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.860
Number 1, we think you'll learn a tremendous amount yourself

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.750
just watching a variety of teams start with an idea and watch their process.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.500
And you as a facilitator will actually watch your skills rise

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.300
as you're able to see patterns you've never seen before.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.090
You will gain a deep understanding of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.860
That is, you'll understand business model design,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.460
you'll understand all the components of the business model canvas

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.300
and understand the startup is not just a bunch of teams who have free food

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.080
and you bring your dogs to work and work incredibly hard.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.840
You'll understand that there's actually a pattern here,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.170
and the pattern is not only the strategy, the canvas,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.520
but the process of getting out of the building,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.720
talking to customers, and understanding iterations and pivots and know when to do that.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.800
You will get fingertip skills that will be immensely valuable in your own career.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.470
And then we think that being part of an organization,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.170
bringing the democratization of entrepreneurship to a thousand cities worldwide

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.780
means you're part of something bigger.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.900
You're becoming part of a community and a leader and a role model

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.640
for the startup community in your city and your country.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.740
You have an incredibly important role.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.620
And I think you understand that the Startup Weekend program

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.520
is an important part of the ecosystem in your city and, potentially, your country.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.930
It is the catalyst in bringing entrepreneurs together

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.960
and giving them a set of skills they could never acquire elsewhere.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.850
And you are that leader.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.990
So I want to personally thank you for dedicating your time to something

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.460
we all believe is so incredibly important.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.800
This entrepreneurship, this education, this Lean LaunchPad, this Startup Weekend

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.530
and Udacity is all part of a global movement that's truly impacting the world.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.600
I'm really, really impressed that all of you have decided to participate and give all you have.

00:02:06.600 --> 99:59:59.000
So thank you from the bottom of my heart.
