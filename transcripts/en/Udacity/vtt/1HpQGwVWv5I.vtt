00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Norvig] And the answer is all we have to do is check to see if Englishman

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and red have been assigned the same house number.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we just do that with saying if (Englishman == red).

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I should note just as an aside

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if you wanted to be sort of clever and make it look more like English,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in this case it would be okay to say if (Englishman is red)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because is is checking for whether 2 objects are identically the same object.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Equals checks to see if they have the same value.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it turns out that Python handles small integers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as a single identical object.

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So the is check would work as well as the equals check here.
