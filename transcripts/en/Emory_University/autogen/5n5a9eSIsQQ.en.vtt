00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520
 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.460
fundamentally the the drugs that we use

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470
fundamentally the the drugs that we use
 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.820
fundamentally the the drugs that we use
today are are very similar to the drugs

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
today are are very similar to the drugs
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.870
today are are very similar to the drugs
that we've used since the 1980s 1983 was

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
that we've used since the 1980s 1983 was
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570
that we've used since the 1980s 1983 was
the the drug the drug that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
the the drug the drug that
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160
the the drug the drug that
revolutionized transplantation

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
revolutionized transplantation
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.909
revolutionized transplantation
cyclosporine was introduced since then

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919
cyclosporine was introduced since then
 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.760
cyclosporine was introduced since then
that class of drugs another drug very

similar to it have been the cornerstone

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240
similar to it have been the cornerstone
 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.630
similar to it have been the cornerstone
the foundation of immunosuppression so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
the foundation of immunosuppression so
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420
the foundation of immunosuppression so
it's been since 1983 since we've had a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
it's been since 1983 since we've had a
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.979
it's been since 1983 since we've had a
new drug that has formed the foundation

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
new drug that has formed the foundation
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.740
new drug that has formed the foundation
of transplant preventing transplant

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
of transplant preventing transplant
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030

rejection

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040
 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.640
rejection is caused by an immune

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650
rejection is caused by an immune
 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.160
rejection is caused by an immune
response an immune reaction against the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170
response an immune reaction against the
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.600
response an immune reaction against the
transplant and when we when we reject an

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610
transplant and when we when we reject an
 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.270
transplant and when we when we reject an
organ we have to recognize it as foreign

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280
organ we have to recognize it as foreign
 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.670
organ we have to recognize it as foreign
and then we get these other signals

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680
and then we get these other signals
 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.130
and then we get these other signals
co-stimulatory signals that turn on the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
co-stimulatory signals that turn on the
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.830
co-stimulatory signals that turn on the
immune system what ballot asif does is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
immune system what ballot asif does is
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.380
immune system what ballot asif does is
block those co-stimulatory or second

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390
block those co-stimulatory or second
 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.600
block those co-stimulatory or second
signals and therefore it aborts the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610
signals and therefore it aborts the
 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.100
signals and therefore it aborts the
rejection response

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
