 In a world populated by 7 billion people, 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.500
 Which person is the most typical? 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.000
 The world's most typical person is 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000

 … But has no bank account. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000

 … But only straight 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 The average age of the world population is 28 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.000
 The largest ethnic group he is Chinese 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200
 28-year-old he Chinese man. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 There are over 9,000,000 of them 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 Scientists have used 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 photos of 190,000 of them 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.000
 … To create a composite image 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.250
 And here is the world's most typical peron 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
 But he does not typically remain forever 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 In 2030, the person from India comes 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.000
 And typically it is always relative 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 The typical Dutch man is 180 cm tall 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.000

 In parts of Ethiopia, it is under 10 liters a day 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And some women spend 8 hours a day picking it up. 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.500
 Typical people have to make choices 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500
 But not everyone has the same opportunities 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 The decisions we make make a big difference 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.750
 When you multiply them by 7 billion 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 7 billion on the planet. What does that mean for us?
