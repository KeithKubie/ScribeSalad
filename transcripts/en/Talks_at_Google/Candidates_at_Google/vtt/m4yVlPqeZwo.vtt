00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.670
&gt;&gt; DRUMMOND: Another great day at Google.
So I want to welcome everybody to the latest

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.150
installment of Candidates at Google. For those
of you who don't know me, I'm David Drummond,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.589
Senior Vice President of Corporate Development,
the company's Chief Legal Officer. I'm very

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:33.570
pleased and distinctly honored here to welcome
back to Google Senator Barack Obama. I say

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.300
welcome back because for those of you who
were around in the summer of 2004, you may

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.530
remember at TGIF in which I joined Larry and
Sergey on this stage and introduced to the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.860
assembled Googlers then senate candidate Obama.
And Barack had been in the Bay Area and he

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.410
wanted to come down and see what we were up
to here at Google, see what this Google thing

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.490
was all about. And he had a great visit. He
came and did the tour. He saw the GeoDisplay,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.560
the Search Traffic, and he saw the servers,
and everything we had at Google. We sat down

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.869
with Larry and Sergey. We had a great talk
about innovation, about policy, and he later

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.259
wrote about that in his book, The Audacity
of Hope. And I know all of you have a copy

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.460
of that. And all in all a great visit. And,
you know, while it was a fantastic visit,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.860
I now realized that we made a grave error
that day at TGI, we didn't let him speak.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.860
So, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are going
to rectify that error. We are thrilled that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.939
Senator Obama has chosen Google to unveil
his innovation agenda. And you're going to

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.670
hear that today and we're very, very excited
about what that means for the country and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.329
I think you will be too. Following that, Eric's
going to come up on the stage and do a Q&amp;A

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.609
with Senator Obama. And following that, you'll
have your chance to ask your question. So,

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:12.110
without anything further, please join me in
giving an enormous Google welcome back to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:47.725
Senator Barack Obama. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:52.000
every body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
so much. What a--what a wonderful reception.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.070
I am so grateful to all of you for showing
such interest in taking the time to be here

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:07.300
today. I want to thank Larry and Sergey and
Eric and, obviously, David for helping to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.690
set this up. I am extremely grateful to all
of them for their leadership and their friendship.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.100
And I also want to acknowledge state Senator
Elaine Alquist who is here. This is her district,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.110
and since I used to be a state senator I always
want to give her, her props, so it's wonderful

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:35.620
to see her as well. So, thank you. Well, it
is wonderful to be back. As David said I was

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.680
here about 3 years ago and had just a wonderful
visit. It was such a striking visit for me.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.730
It made such an impression that I ended up
writing about it in my book. And so it's always

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.320
good to be back in Mountain View and it's
good to see that Google is maintaining its

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:01.310
strict dress code.
When you stop to think about it, there is

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.320
something improbable about this gathering.
After all it wasn't much more than a decade

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.840
ago that Larry and Sergey got together in
a dorm room as graduate students, with a big

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.710
idea to organize all of the world's information
into an accessible form. And at that time,

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.930
I was an Illinois state senator doing my best
to help people get a better shot at their

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.440
dreams. What we shared is a belief in changing
the world from the bottom-up, not the top-down.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:43.880
That a bunch of--that ordinary people can
do extraordinary things. We shared that. We

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.700
also shared a bunch of student loans that
still needed to be paid off. And you would

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.620
have found it hard to predict that Larry and
Sergey would now be the co-founders of one

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.570
of the most successful companies in recent
history and that I would be standing on this

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.600
stage today as a candidate for president of
the United States. But this is where improbable

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.710
journeys have led. This is where the moment
finds us. And I'd like to say a few words

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.090
about what I believe we have to do together,
to seize this moment with a sense of purpose

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.720
and a sense of urgency. We know how the first
chapters of the Google story have turned out.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.350
After all, all of you have good jobs. But
we also know that the Google story is more

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.750
than just being about the bottom line. It's
about seeing what we can accomplish when we

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.150
believe in things that are unseen, when we
take the measure of our changing times and

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.030
we take action to shape them. And that's why
we're here today, that's why many of you decided

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.900
to work here instead of someplace else. Technology
and innovation have reshaped our economy and

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.020
our lives at breathtaking speed. America's
been fighting to figure out how to tap this

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.210
awesome new resource that we have, and Google
has helped to show us the way. But the story

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.780
is far from over. Google’s story is far
from over. The story of how we shaped our

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.520
changing times is far from over. What comes
next depends on the choices that we make right

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.270
now, at this moment, in this election. We
could see the spirit of innovation that started

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:39.650
this company be stifled. We could see the
internet divided up to the highest bidders.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.790
We could see a government that uses technology
to shut people out, instead of letting them

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.840
in. Tax break shuffled to special interests
while the next start-up, the next Google can't

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.570
get a fair shot. Challenges like healthcare
and energy that hold our country back while

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:05.199
competition from other nations picks up. That's
one alternative. Another alternative is for

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.490
us to unlock a new future of opportunity.
Together we could open up the government and

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:17.919
invite all citizens in while connecting all
of America to 21st century Broadband. We could

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.600
use technology to help achieve universal healthcare,
to reach for a clean energy future, and to

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.530
ensure that young Americans can compete and
win in the global economy. If America recommits

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:39.220
itself to science and innovation, then we
can lead the world to a new future of productivity

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.740
and prosperity. That's what we can do if we
seize this moment. That's the choice we face.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.110
And as president, I intend to work with you
to write the next chapter in the story of

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.620
American innovation. That's part of the reason
why I'm running for president of the United

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:04.520
States. To seize this moment, we have to ensure
free and full exchange of information, and

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:16.530
that starts with an open internet. I will
take--I

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.560
will take a backseat to no one in my commitment
to network neutrality, because once providers

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.560
start to privilege some applications or websites
over others, then the smaller voices get squeezed

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:35.401
out and we all lose. The internet is perhaps
the most open network in history and we have

00:08:35.401 --> 00:08:41.260
to keep it that way. To seize this moment,
we have to connect all of America to 21st

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.310
century infrastructure. As president, I will
set a goal of ensuring that every American

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:52.480
has Broadband access, no matter where you
live, no matter how much money you have or

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.070
don't have. We will raise the standards for
Broadband speed. We will connect schools and

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.960
libraries and hospitals. And we’ll take
on the special interest so that we can finally

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.300
unleash the power of wireless spectrum for
our safety, our security, and our connectivity.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:17.010
To seize this moment, we have to use technology
to open up our democracy. It's no coincidence

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.320
that one of the most secretive administrations
in our history, has favored special interests

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.600
and pursued policies that could not stand
up to the sunlight. As president, I'm going

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.270
to change that. We will put government data
online in universally accessible formats.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:46.930
I'll let citizens--I'll let citizens check
federal grants, contracts, earmarks, and lobbying

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:53.310
contracts. I'll let you participate in government
forums, ask questions in real time, offer

00:09:53.310 --> 00:10:00.950
suggestions that will be reviewed before decisions
are made, and let you comment on legislation

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:06.190
before it is signed. And to ensure that every
government agency is meeting 21st century

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.810
standards, I will appoint the nation's first
chief technology officer to coordinate and

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.880
make certain that we are always at the forefront
of technology and that we are incorporating

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:29.270
it into every decision that we make. And if
you want to know how I'll govern, just look

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:38.870
at our campaign. We’ve received over 370,000
donations online, half of which have been

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:48.330
under $25. Nearly 300,000 Americans have their
own accounts on BarackObama.com. They’ve

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:56.161
created—they’ve created thousands of grassroots
groups. They've offered up over 15,000 policy

00:10:56.161 --> 00:11:02.620
ideas, because we believe the real change
can only come from the bottom-up, and technology

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:08.580
empowers people to come together to make that
change. Because at this moment, I think we

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.050
have to do more than to get our house in order,
the opportunity in front of us is bigger than

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.250
that. Seizing this opportunity is going to
depend on more than what the government does

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.860
or even what the technology sector does. It's
going to depend on how together we harness

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:29.610
technology to confront the biggest challenges
that America faces. Just imagine what we could

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.990
do. If we commit ourselves to electronic medical
records, then we can lift up the quality of

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:45.390
healthcare and reduce error and dramatically
lower costs. If we take on--if we take on

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.649
special interests and make aggressive investments
and clean a renewable energy like Google has

00:11:50.649 --> 00:11:56.440
done with solar here in Mountainview, that
we can end our addiction to ore, create millions

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.740
of jobs and save the planet in the bargain.
If we make technological literacy a fundamental

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.839
part of education then we can give our children
the skills they need to compete and ensure

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:15.000
the next generation of scientists and engineers
as being educated right here in America. We

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.730
can do this, but we can't wait because Silicon
Valley is not the only corner of innovation

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:27.570
in the world. If America doesn't seize this
moment, then we will face only more competition

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:35.279
from Dubai and Dublin, from Shanghai and Mumbai.
So, instead of George Bush's policy of undermining

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:41.910
science, I intend to double federal funding
for basic research and make the R&amp;D tax credit

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:53.390
permanent. To keep--to keep the door open
for the next generation of start-ups, I'll

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:59.620
enforce tough anti-trust laws, and to ensure
that America continues to track the world's

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:05.120
best and brightest, we need comprehensive
immigration reform that strengthens permanent

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:18.959
resident visas like the H-1B program. We need
to make sure that the next success story,

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:25.870
the next Google, happens here in America.
The Google stories about what can be achieved

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:32.000
when we cultivate new ideas and keep the playing
field level for new businesses. But it's also

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.110
about not settling for what we've already
achieved, it's about constantly raising the

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:42.950
bar so that we're more competitive. And so
we use technology to reach ever expanding

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:50.930
horizons. You know, the first time I was back
here in 2004, Larry showed me the image that

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.510
tracks all the internet searches taking place
in the world. I wrote about this in my book.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:02.930
And I saw the earth rotating on a flat panel
monitor with the different lights for different

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.829
languages marking all the traffic on this
wondrous network, the network that didn't

00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:19.270
even exist when almost all of us here were
born, almost. But what struck me wasn't the

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:28.329
light on that globe; it was the darkness.
Most of Africa, chunks of Asia, even parts

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:35.089
of the United States, the disconnected corners
of our interconnected world where the promise

00:14:35.089 --> 00:14:42.980
of the 21st century is being eclipsed by peril.
You and I must not settle for anything less

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.570
than an America that replaces that darkness
with a new light, because the promise and

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:54.209
prosperity of the new economy must not be
the property of the few. It must be a force

00:14:54.209 --> 00:15:07.760
that lifts up our entire country and ultimately
lifts up the entire world.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:14.079
We have the privilege to live in a transformational
moment, a moment when an idea can change the

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:20.450
world, a moment when technology empowers us
to come together as never before while letting

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:27.240
each of us reach for our own individual dreams,
a moment when we can finally progress and

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.600
move beyond the huge challenges that have
stood in the way of progress for far too long.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:41.529
We cannot and we must not look back and regret
that we settled for anything less. And that's

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:47.089
why I'm asking you to join me in seizing this
moment, I'm asking you to join me in changing

00:15:47.089 --> 00:16:13.462
the world. Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:13.462 --> 00:16:14.462
Eric, come on up. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Brilliant. Brilliant.

00:16:14.462 --> 00:16:15.462
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Thank--thank you, Senator, for

00:16:15.462 --> 00:16:17.569
such a strong message about innovation.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you.

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:24.850
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Senator Obama, the product of
a Kansas mother and a father from Kenya, born

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:32.610
in Hawaii; your history, of course, Columbia,
Harvard, state senator, now, senator running

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.009
for president, welcome to Google.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:16:35.009 --> 00:16:48.690
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: When you see yourself in the presidency
in 2008, 2009, and for many years, what is

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:55.930
it that you're going to do that's exceptional?
What is your fundamental reason why you think

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:05.400
this company--this country, excuse me, is
going to be--is going to be a great country?

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.089
And by the way...
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Is this the kind of interview that

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:14.220
you guys want too?
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: And your book is really extraordinary,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.270
its title is The Audacity of Hope.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah. Well, Eric, first of all,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:23.650
thanks, thanks for letting me be here, and
the reason that book is called The Audacity

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:30.500
of Hope is it captures an idea that got me
into politics in the first place, which is

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.559
that part of what has been great about America
is there’s a certain audacious quality,

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:43.750
this belief that this ragtag bunch of revolutionaries
can overthrow the greatest empire on earth,

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:51.960
start a government that we've never seen operate
before, spread across the continent, create

00:17:51.960 --> 00:18:00.230
the greatest economy and the greatest democracy
in our history, and then overcome barriers,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.950
both internal and external that would prevent
us from making progress. There's a certain

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:11.510
confidence and boldness to the idea of America.
And the reason I'm running for president right

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:16.540
now, because oftentimes people ask me, "Why
now?" You know, if I waited 10 years, I'd

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:30.100
be still younger than most of the other candidates,
that's true. It is because I think we are

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:37.350
at a defining moment in our history, our nation
is at war, the planet is in peril, ordinary

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:42.290
Americans are working harder for less. They
feel as if the dream that generations fought

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:50.760
for is slowly slipping away. There are costs
for everything, from healthcare to college

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.590
have gone up. They're finding it more difficult
to save, difficult to retire, and they don't

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.980
feel as if anybody in Washington is listening
to them. And when I made the decision, I sat

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.980
down with my wife, and I asked myself three
questions: One, could my family survive the

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.520
rigors of presidential campaign? And because
my wife is exceptional and my children are

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:20.890
above average, we figured we could do it,
and they’ve been great. That's also true.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.299
The second question we asked was, "Could we
win?" And we determined that we could. But

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:28.371
the third question was, I asked myself the
question you asked, because I think so much

00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:34.511
is at stake right now that running for president
can't be about just ambition this time, there's

00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:39.570
got to be a rationale. And what I concluded
is this; I believe I can more effectively

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:45.400
bring this country together to solve problems
than on the other candidate. And, yeah, we

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:52.669
have seen a gridlock where 45% of the country
is on one side, 45% of the country is on the

00:19:52.669 --> 00:20:00.100
other, we've got 10% in the middle, they all
live in Ohio and Florida apparently, and so,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:05.520
political contest just become beating down
the other side and eking out of victory one

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.750
way or the other, but you can't govern. And
the problems we face, whether it's climate

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:18.530
change or healthcare or our standing in the
world are so enormous that we have to govern,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:26.220
we have to make good decisions, so that's
number one. Number two, is I--I have taken

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:33.390
on the special interest in the past and of
one and I've got an instinct of bias to push

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:38.120
against the status quo, which I think is really
needed right now because Washington has become

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:43.929
captive of special interest that are making
decisions not based on reason, not based on

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:49.179
competition, not based on innovation, but
all too often based on who's got the most

00:20:49.179 --> 00:20:58.130
juice, who's got the most clout, and that
has to change. And the third--the third thing

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:10.860
and this is the last thing is--you mentioned
in my background--I was shaped by a new global

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:17.630
perspective. I grew up in Hawaii. I lived
in Indonesia. I have family all around the

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:25.500
globe. And the damage that's been done over
the last seven years and outstanding in the

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.330
world is so significant that we have to have
the next president engage in a level of personal

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:39.060
presidential diplomacy that I think is unmatched
at least since World War II. And I believe

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.090
that the day I'm inaugurated, the--not only
does the country look at itself differently

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.740
but the world looks at America differently.
And I'm able to go to Africa and speak to

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:56.840
them about development and problems of corruption
and our obligations towards that continent,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.200
and I could say--I've got a grandmother in
a small African village without electricity

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:08.059
or running water. So I have a little credibility
that no other president could match. If I

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:12.600
go to a Muslim leader, I can speak to them
and I can say, "I am a Christian but I live

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:21.020
in the country with the largest Muslim population
in the world. And so, I don't assume a clash

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.590
of civilizations. I think that there's something
we have in common that we can potentially

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.640
build on. And I have a level of credibility
that no other president has. That I think

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:44.649
is what's going to be necessary to lead us
out of the problems that we're in right now.

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:55.451
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: You know--well. Now, Senator,
you're here at Google and I like to think

00:22:55.451 --> 00:23:01.770
of the presidency as a job interview. Now,
it's hard to get a job...

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.919
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: As president...

00:23:02.919 --> 00:23:04.640
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: And--I mean, you're going to do

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.140
a great job. It's also hard to get a job at
Google.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.010
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: We have questions and we ask our

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.720
candidates questions. And this one is from
Larry Schwimmer.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.040
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Okay.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: What--you guys think I'm kidding,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:27.080
it's right here. What is the most efficient
way to sort a million 32-bit integers?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.489
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Well...
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Maybe--I'm sorry...

00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:38.620
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: No, no, no, no. I think--I think
the bubble sort would be the wrong way to

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:46.210
go.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Come on. Who told him this? Okay.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.870
I didn't see computer science in your background.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: We've got our spies in there.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:59.550
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Well, why not--okay, let's ask
a different interview question. Well, obviously,

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:10.450
more serious. You're notable in this campaign
for your steadfast opposition to the Iraq

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.860
War.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.710
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: On the assumption that you're
elected president on day one, you'll walk

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:15.710
in...
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.830
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: And the war will probably still
be on.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.710
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: And we know your view that the

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:21.770
war was a mistake.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.340
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: But here it is, you're at the
desk, what are you going to do?

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:32.280
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: We will call in--I will call in
the Joint Chief of Staff, my Secretary Of

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:40.470
State Nominee, my National Security Advisor
Nominee, and they will have a new mission,

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:47.940
which is to end this war. And it appears based
on the advice that I've gotten from military

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.630
commanders that we can safely bring out one
to two brigades per month. At that phase,

00:24:53.630 --> 00:25:02.580
we will have our combat troops out in sixteen
months. The only mission--we will not have

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:09.470
permanent basis in Iraq and we will not have
combat operations in Iraq. The only mission

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:19.790
that I will allow will be to protect our embassy
and our civilian personnel, diplomats, humanitarian

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:27.330
workers and we will have a narrowly targeted
mission of if there are terrorist camps that

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:34.450
are amassing in Iraq that we have a strike
capability. Now, it is important during those

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:41.350
16 months that we are redoubling our diplomatic
efforts. The reason that it is so important,

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:47.100
I believe, to start getting our troops out
is because the Iraqi government has declined

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:53.220
to negotiate with the various factions. The
Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds have not come

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.220
together and arrive at the political accommodations
that are necessary to solve this problem.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:04.830
And we have not reached out to the regional
powers including Iran, Syria--so not just

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:12.760
our friends, but also our enemies to arrive
at a workable and stable Iraq. And this is

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.070
an argument that I've had with some of the
other candidates, including Senator Clinton

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:22.820
in this race. And I think it's part of what
signals a break from Bush-Cheney diplomacy;

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.090
the willingness to speak to our adversaries.
President Kennedy once said, "We should never

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:33.030
negotiate out of fear, but we should never
fear to negotiate." And the notion that not

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:39.080
talking to leaders we don't like makes us
look tough is fundamentally flawed. It makes

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.940
us look arrogant and it sends a message to
the world that we're not listening. And if

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:52.010
we change our diplomatic approach led by me,
the president of the United States, that I

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:58.780
think will allow us to shift not just the
situation in Iraq but change the climate in

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.820
the Middle East around the world. It will
give us more leverage then to deal with terrorist

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:11.770
activity that's taking place in Afghanistan,
in the border areas around Pakistan and elsewhere

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:16.260
in the region.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Let's ask about--let's ask about

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:21.290
Iran, Guantanamo...
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:29.640
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Pakistan, give us your sense as
leader what you would do with all of these

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.440
issues.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: I will talk to Iran directly. That

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:41.970
does not mean that we will be conceding any
positions with Iran. It means that we will

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:49.900
listen and see where we can find common ground.
I think Iran is a grave threat to security.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.250
If they develop nuclear weapons, they could
trigger another arms race in the Middle East.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:28:00.120
It is indisputable that they have assisted
Hezbollah and Hamas in terrorist activity

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:06.460
and--you know, their language, when it comes
to Israel is unacceptable. But what is also

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:14.809
true is that we have repeatedly rebuffed gestures
that might allow for some resolution of these

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:20.340
conflicts in a non-military way. And so, for
us to say to them, "You stand out on the nuclear

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:27.750
issue and you may be able to join the World
Trade organization. You stop supporting terrorist

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:34.809
activity; we are in a position to start normalizing
relations." Having those conversations face-to-face

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:43.030
are important. Not--it may be that Ahmadinejad
rejects it, but it will send a message to

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:50.179
Iranian people that they are not our enemy
and it sends a message around the world that

00:28:50.179 --> 00:28:54.050
we are doing business differently. Sarkozy,
President Sarkozy, I know you just met with

00:28:54.050 --> 00:29:00.230
him, Eric. He was quoted in the New Yorker
a while back, and he said--he was asked what's

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:07.760
the most important thing America could do
to help you, and he said, "Be more liked."

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:14.529
Be more liked. You know, and he wasn't joking
because when our standing is low, it gives

00:29:14.529 --> 00:29:19.970
us less leverage. We can't negotiate and maneuver.
Many people are concerned probably here about

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:25.309
the genocide in Darfur. We would be in such
a stronger position to ensure there was a

00:29:25.309 --> 00:29:31.789
protective force on the ground and to save
people's lives if we had more credibility

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:37.680
and more trust so that people--so that the
Khartoum government couldn't say that, "Oh,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:49.020
we're just trying to invade another Muslim
country." So that's on Iran. Pakistan--Pakistan

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.010
is in a difficult situation right now. And
in some ways, we've got the worst of both

00:29:54.010 --> 00:30:01.270
worlds; we’ve got a military ruler who has
locked up political opposition and institute

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:09.500
an emergency rule. So he's violating human
rights in Pakistan and he also has not dealt

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.000
with terrorist activity inside his borders.
We need to reverse course. I've already said

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.120
that we should suspend military that's not
related to--directly to hunting down terrorists.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:28.600
We should suspend that until military--emergency
rule is lifted and prisoners were released

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:36.080
and they can proceed with what the Constitution
of Pakistan has called for. This is a mistake

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.640
we repeatedly make. We think somehow and we
made this all throughout the Cold War. We

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:48.360
think that by latching on to non-democratic
authoritarian rule, we somehow contain--in

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:56.190
this case, Islamist extremism, it doesn’t
contain as Islamist extremism. It makes people

00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:01.539
believe that somehow the United States is
opposed to their liberty, opposed to their

00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:06.670
democracy. And that's not the side of history
that we want to be on. Now, we have to make

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:12.990
sure that the nuclear weapons in Pakistan
are secure. And that has to be our number

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:18.940
one priority and will be my number one priority
as president. But understand Pakistan--the

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:25.220
democratic element in Pakistan, a big chunk
of this movement is secular, it is middle-class.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.240
And what they're seeking is for the kind of
political liberty that we hope for. Last point,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:38.100
Guantanamo, that's easy. We close down Guantanamo,
restore Habeas Corpus, say no to renditions,

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:51.820
no to wireless wiretaps, you know, Part of
my job as the next president is to break the

00:31:51.820 --> 00:32:01.350
fever of fear that has been exploited by this
administration, that--you know, we're told--you

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:12.809
know, we're told that we should be afraid
of terrorists and immigrants and each other,

00:32:12.809 --> 00:32:20.480
and it becomes the means by which our civil
liberties are subverted, our values are distorted,

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.710
we start hearing our attorney general nominee
not being certain as to whether simulated

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:33.399
drownings are torture. That's not who we are
as Americans. And sometimes I’m accused

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:40.659
of being, you know, this progressive far--I'm
conservative in a sense that I want us to

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:46.980
get back to those values that were essential
to building America. Well....

00:32:46.980 --> 00:33:00.500
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: The--let's talk a little about
America, and the America that you see today

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.880
is one of extremes. And in your campaign,
you've talked a lot about the people who are

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:13.140
not the--the economic winners, the educational
winners, or whatever, and many people are

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.799
responding very strongly and positively to
that message.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:19.789
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Take us through what would be

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:25.350
different. What are you going to do, how are
you going to deal with the very serious economic

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:29.310
problems, educational problems, a set of problems
that we face here in the United States.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:38.370
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Well, let's start with acknowledging
that our economy is out of balance. We have

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:47.730
seen extraordinary economic growth and, obviously,
Google is a symbol of one sector of our economy

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:59.500
that's just been extraordinary; innovative,
creative and lucrative, but there's a whole

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:06.559
another part of America that has been left
behind. You know, if you look economically,

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:11.529
all the growth over the last two decades is
essentially been captured by not just the

00:34:11.529 --> 00:34:21.509
top five percent, but really the top one percent.
And the average American worker's wages and

00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:27.239
incomes have flatlined; they're not making
progress. And they feel anxious about it,

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:33.940
and because they feel anxious about it, they
are afraid of globalization. And that fear

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:41.389
has been fed by our politics. Now, my strong
belief is that globalization is here to stay

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:47.809
and it is a powerful potential tool for good.
But we've got to--but we've--but we have to

00:34:47.809 --> 00:34:54.809
make sure that everybody has the ability to
access what's good about globalization. And

00:34:54.809 --> 00:35:00.640
right now, people are locked up. So very specifically,
what would I do, I would transform our education

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.799
system and that means that we invest in early
childhood education to close the achievement

00:35:04.799 --> 00:35:13.269
gap that exists right now. And that's not
just pre-kindergarten, I mean, it's zero over

00:35:13.269 --> 00:35:16.739
to three. From the moment the child is born,
if they're born to an at-risk parent, we're

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:20.279
going to that parent and we are helping them.
If that parent can't read, we'll teach the

00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:24.150
parent to read so they can read to their child.
But make sure they're prepared for school.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:33.380
That's step number one. The--in terms of K
through 12, we know that the most important

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.750
element other than the parent in the child's
learning is the teacher. So we--I will be

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:43.539
a president who stops talking about how great
teachers are and actually starts rewarding

00:35:43.539 --> 00:35:58.910
them for being great by paying them more money.
We need to pay them higher salaries. We have

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:03.450
to give them more professional development,
especially in their early years where they

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:09.990
start and we have to change how we asses progress
for teachers because No Child Left Behind

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:15.240
has created a situation where people are being
taught just the standardized test. They're

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.900
not being thought art, they're not being thought
music, and it is stifling for the teacher

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.759
and for the student. Now, we have to have
high standards, but those standards have to

00:36:24.759 --> 00:36:30.999
build on what is best about the American education
system, which is innovation, and creativity.

00:36:30.999 --> 00:36:38.099
So that we have to take or we have to make
college way more affordable. And one way to--one

00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:44.269
way I will immediately do that is get to banks
and financial institutions out of the business

00:36:44.269 --> 00:36:49.180
of providing student loans. You can take billions
of dollars of profits with the direct loan

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.650
program. So that's on the education front.
We have to make investments in Broadband line

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:59.519
and infrastructure so that we are competitive.
There has to be lifelong learning available

00:36:59.519 --> 00:37:08.130
so that people can continually retrain. I
mean, you know, I will steal a phrase from--I

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:16.460
think it was Tony Blair who said that, "We
can't guarantee employment for everybody,

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.420
but we can guarantee that everybody is employable."
And that means that people have to be able

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:27.599
to constantly transition in terms of their
ability to adapt to new circumstances. And

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:32.880
technology can play a critical role in that,
but we've got to make sure that it's accessible

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:40.229
and available to every person. And the last
point I would make is that we've got to rebuild

00:37:40.229 --> 00:37:52.729
our social safety net that has not been adapted
since FDR. So, we've got to make sure that

00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:57.690
healthcare is available even when you lose
your job, that you have a retirement account

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.890
that follows you with the job. Part of the
reason where an innovative society is--that

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:10.059
we've always felt that, you know what, if
we take a risk and we make a misstep, that

00:38:10.059 --> 00:38:16.059
there's some cushion there for--not just us
but for our families as well. And that's why

00:38:16.059 --> 00:38:20.359
universal healthcare is so important, that's
why creating new systems for--to help people

00:38:20.359 --> 00:38:26.390
say this is so important, so that we'll actually
spur on people's willingness to take risks

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:37.510
in the marketplace. Right now, they don't
feel as if they're able to do so.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.099
&gt;&gt; A couple of final questions from me and
then we'll ask some audience questions. I

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:48.259
had a privilege. I was watching 60 Minutes
and I saw an interview with yourself and your

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.530
wife, Michelle, and there were a number of
questions to you and then they asked--asked

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:54.309
your wife about it, and excuse, it’s rather
a personal question. It's a question about

00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:55.309
race.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Uh-hmmm.

00:38:55.309 --> 00:39:00.599
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: How did she feel about race, the
dangers of presidency and so forth, and she

00:39:00.599 --> 00:39:05.660
looked straight in the camera and she said,
"I worry more about my husband walking down

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:15.309
the street from the Senate than anything else."
At that moment, I understood the gap and perception

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:21.450
between people of races in America. And it
was made vivid to me how different her view

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.450
and my view would be. The same question.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: All right.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:29.349
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Can you talk a little bit about
that issue in America?

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:34.910
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Absolutely. Look, the W. B. Du Bois
said that the problem of the 21st--the problem

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:42.860
of the 20th century is the problem of the
colored one. And if you expand that, the problem

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:50.219
of the 21st century is the problem of the
other, people who are not like us, whether

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:56.329
it's in religious terms. If you go to Sri
Lanka, it's, you know, what's been fueling

00:39:56.329 --> 00:40:01.700
as a vicious civil war there even though everybody
looks exactly the same, same with--in Northern

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:11.599
Ireland, or it manifests itself in this country
in racial terms. And that--it has always been

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:15.839
a nagging problem. There have been reports
just this week that African-Americans feel

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:21.579
more pessimistic than they have in a very
long time and there's statistics that bear

00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:31.289
out. Why--how they in fact have not kept pace
when it comes to economic growth in this country.

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:37.279
The virulent and anti-immigrant sentiment
that we're seeing all across the country is

00:40:37.279 --> 00:40:41.999
something that has been striking. I mean,
just in the last two years, you're seeing

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:49.039
a shift where, you know, I fought for comprehensive
immigration reform two years ago and we didn't

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:55.380
succeed, but there wasn't this raw anger about
it that you see now even when I'm campaigning

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:05.029
among Democrats sometimes. So part of what
I believe I bring to this office is somebody

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:11.809
who sees the world through a variety of different
races. My mother was white, my father was

00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:16.690
African. I grew up in Hawaii. I've got a sister
who's half Indonesian. She's married to a

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:21.640
Chinese Canadian. You know, I've said...
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: It sounds like Google.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:29.509
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah. It's--my family would fit
right in here, no doubt about it. But people

00:41:29.509 --> 00:41:37.779
talk about our federal budget deficit, right?
We have an empathy deficit. We aren’t able

00:41:37.779 --> 00:41:44.269
to see the world through other people's eyes.
And that's what I think I can provide. Now,

00:41:44.269 --> 00:41:48.680
very concretely, what we need to do when it
comes to issues of race, I think a lot of

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:57.059
the tensions are tied to economics. African-Americans
and Latinos are much more likely to be unemployed,

00:41:57.059 --> 00:42:05.559
employed in lower-wage jobs, will not have
healthcare, and be in substandard schools,

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:11.579
drops out of school. So on in every indicator,
they're doing worse. And that contributes

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:16.749
to that gap in perceptions that you're talking
about because, you know, the glass often looks

00:42:16.749 --> 00:42:24.130
half empty to a lot of African-American and
Latino children. And so, part of our job in

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:29.109
investing an early childhood education or
making sure that they're going to outstanding

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:37.490
schools, or insuring equality of opportunity
when it comes to employment, enforcing our

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:46.180
Civil Rights laws, investigating crimes like
news is being hanged in classrooms. All that

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:51.640
contributes to a sense that these kids matter
to us, that they're not those kids, they’re

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:59.819
our kids, and when we can have a culture and
a government that perceives every child as

00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:06.890
mattering, and then they will respond differently.
And I think we will start stitching together

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:11.760
the kind of America that all of us hope and
dream for.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:17.930
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: That's promising, absolutely riveting.
Let's get a couple of questions from the audience.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.829
I've also got--why don't you go ahead--and
I've also got some that were submitted that

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:26.519
we also ranked, so, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank so much for coming.

00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:28.299
Your words are really inspiring.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you.

00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:31.250
&gt;&gt; And we really appreciate it. You know,
I've been voting for quite few a years, a

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:36.979
little older than the average Googler. And…
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah, you know, you, like, look

00:43:36.979 --> 00:43:40.869
like you might almost be my age.
&gt;&gt; Maybe a little older.

00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:43.539
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And, you know, Bill Clinton is the only

00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:50.349
Democrat elected in the last 30 years. And
he's the only Democrat elected twice since

00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:51.741
World War II.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:54.490
&gt;&gt; I'm tired of losing.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:59.920
&gt;&gt; So, what have you learned from Clinton
that is going to make you win? What are you

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:06.520
going to do differently? And what have you
learned from Gore and from Kerry and all those

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.249
guys that you're going to avoid so that history
doesn’t reoccur?

00:44:10.249 --> 00:44:15.369
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think--there's
a lot to learn from Bill Clinton. I mean,

00:44:15.369 --> 00:44:21.199
one of the things that Clinton did I think
was recognize the moment. We were in a particular

00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:33.530
moment in 1991-'92 when the Democrats had
not wrung out the excesses of the '60s and

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:42.900
the early '70s, we were still deeply invested
in identity politics and interest group politics.

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:48.749
And the Democratic Congress wasn’t showing
itself adaptable and shaking off some of the

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:53.859
orthodoxies of the past. And he came in and
he said, "You know what? I'm a different kind

00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:58.710
of Democrat, and I'm willing to do things
in some new ways." And that was a powerful

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:05.739
message for that moment. The reason I'm running
and the reason I believe I'm going to win

00:45:05.739 --> 00:45:10.729
is because we are in a different moment. So
you can't just copy what Bill Clinton did,

00:45:10.729 --> 00:45:16.150
but you have to take the same approach. What
is it that's needed right now? And I believe

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:22.199
that what's needed right now is the capacity
to bring people together to think in practical

00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:30.799
reasoned ways about big problems that we face
to be straight with the American people about--and

00:45:30.799 --> 00:45:34.680
honest with them about the challenges that
we face. So part of what our message is built

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.390
around is that we are in this defining moment
and we can't keep doing the same things that

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:46.170
we've been doing that haven’t been working.
So that's point number one. What I've learned

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:52.329
in terms of how Democrats lose? Democrats
lose when they are not clear about what they

00:45:52.329 --> 00:46:01.799
stand for. Democrats lose when they are attacked,
and because they don't know where they stand,

00:46:01.799 --> 00:46:08.059
they end up getting defensive instead of going
on the offensive. So, let me give you a very

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:13.029
specific example, I am looking forward to
having a debate with whether it's Rudy Giuliani

00:46:13.029 --> 00:46:21.599
or Mitt Romney about the fear mongering that
has dominated the Republican debate of, like,

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:26.030
where they're going to say I'm going to double
Guantanamo. Or, I'm going to, I think torture

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:32.660
is okay. Or, you know, at least we'll redefine
torture. So torture is not okay, but these

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.380
things that look on off are like--like it,
are okay. Or we need to do whatever it takes

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:46.789
to read people's e-mails. And I am looking
forward to having that debate. But the problem

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:53.670
we have is when we get defensive, and we're
not sure about our beliefs and our convictions,

00:46:53.670 --> 00:47:01.289
and so we start trying to sound a little bit
like them, and that is a profound mistake.

00:47:01.289 --> 00:47:05.130
One of the things that my wife and I, we said
to ourselves when we got into this race is

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:10.359
if we start sounding like anybody--everybody
else, then what's the point, you know? I should

00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:13.009
go work for Google, you know, it'll be more
fun.

00:47:13.009 --> 00:47:22.109
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: You answered the question correctly.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: I did answer the question correctly.

00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:28.539
So making sure that we're clear about where
we stand, honest with the American people,

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:34.539
seizing the moment and recognizing that we
have to deal with climate change now, we have

00:47:34.539 --> 00:47:44.499
to deal with healthcare now. We have to revamp
our education system now. We have to double

00:47:44.499 --> 00:47:51.769
our investment and research and science now
and understanding that we don't have a lot

00:47:51.769 --> 00:48:03.809
of time to waste. That I think is going to
be a compelling message for the American people.

00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:06.619
Thank you. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: We--okay, thank you very much,

00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:07.619
Senator. We have an electronically submitted
question dealing with federal deficit.

00:48:07.619 --> 00:48:08.950
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Okay.
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: What concrete steps will the Obama

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.549
Administration take to address the federal
government's deficit and debt? What specific

00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:17.679
tax measures and program changes will you
recommend to Congress?

00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:22.839
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: This has been the fiscally the most
irresponsible administration that we have

00:48:22.839 --> 00:48:29.640
seen. I mean, we have increased the national
debt, almost doubled it since George Bush

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:38.069
took office. It is now over $9 trillion. And
that is money that we're all going to have

00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:45.529
to pay back. So, the first thing that we have
to do is to bring an end to this war in Iraq.

00:48:45.529 --> 00:48:55.299
We're spending $10 to $12 billion per month.
The latest request for both Iraq and Afghanistan

00:48:55.299 --> 00:49:08.569
are $196 billion for next year. One year,
a $196 billion. That is money that could be

00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:13.329
providing health insurance to all Americans.
It could be rebuilding our schools. It could

00:49:13.329 --> 00:49:17.880
be providing higher teachers’ salaries.
It could be providing scholarships for every

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:26.349
American, young persons going to college.
So we are using our resources in a way that's

00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:34.059
not sound. We can recapture some of that money.
Some of it will go to taking care of our veterans,

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:39.640
some of it should go to social programs, and
some of it should go towards deficit reduction.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:45.759
Second principle is a very similar principle
called Pay Go. If you want to cut taxes, you’ve

00:49:45.759 --> 00:49:50.740
got to cut spending, if you want to raise
spending, you got to raise revenue, so that

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:58.059
you have honest accounting. Right now, the
federal budget is not honest. And unless we

00:49:58.059 --> 00:50:04.599
have good numbers, we can't end up dealing
with this budget issue. Now, the biggest problem

00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:10.230
we have in terms of our budget though long
term. And look, I want to eliminate no-bid

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:19.969
contracts. I want to scrub the federal budget
free of earmarks and pet projects that are

00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:25.219
not based on our national priorities and that
require transparency in government. I talked

00:50:25.219 --> 00:50:29.049
earlier about the power of technology. One
of the things that we've done, you'll be pleased

00:50:29.049 --> 00:50:32.150
to know that we call this the Google for Government
bill and…

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:38.099
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Google is in favor of it.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yes. And what it does is we're going

00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:43.029
to set up a searchable database for every
dollar of federal spending so that we can

00:50:43.029 --> 00:50:49.459
track it, which means that we'll be able to--journalist
and ordinary citizens and think tanks and,

00:50:49.459 --> 00:50:52.940
you know, advocacy groups will be able to
see it. There are moneys going to a bridge

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:58.839
to nowhere instead of going to a bridge to
somewhere. We'll be able to challenge it in

00:50:58.839 --> 00:51:02.959
real time and that's going to be important.
But the last thing I was going to mention--and

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:08.709
this is probably the biggest problem we have
with the federal budget is healthcare spending;

00:51:08.709 --> 00:51:14.869
Medicare and Medicaid. That's the big budget
buster. That's the scary thing out there that

00:51:14.869 --> 00:51:20.090
it will be, like, the blop. It will just consume
everything unless we do something about it

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:24.490
now. And again, technology is part of the
answer. And innovation is going to be part

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:29.769
of the answer in reducing these costs. The
reason that healthcare cost is skyrocketing

00:51:29.769 --> 00:51:34.119
is not so much that the population is getting
older, that contributes a little bit to it,

00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:41.170
but the main problem is healthcare inflation
goes up six, eight, ten percent per year.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:49.349
It's unsustainable. And so for example, if
we use Health I. T., just simple stuff, making

00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:57.170
sure that everybody's medical records are
on digital--in a digital form, so that when

00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:04.739
a nurse pulls up somebody's chart, they can
actually read the writing, and they’re not

00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:10.430
administering the wrong drug. Making sure
that billing is all electronic. That can make

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:16.150
a huge difference, investing and prevention,
so that children are getting regular check-ups

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:20.949
instead of having to go to the emergency room
for treatable illnesses like asthma. That

00:52:20.949 --> 00:52:26.819
makes an enormous difference. That will probably
be the biggest savings item for our federal

00:52:26.819 --> 00:52:31.400
budget if we do it right. And people like
yourselves can be a part of that process.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.700
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Thank you. Ethan.
&gt;&gt; ETHAN: Thank you, Senator Obama, for coming

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.490
to visit us. And we’re really pulling for
you out here in the Bay area.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.849
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; ETHAN: I'm a big supporter and a vocal

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:47.599
supporter, and the biggest issue that I constantly
hear brought up about you is the lack of experience,

00:52:47.599 --> 00:52:49.369
the inexperience issue.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right.

00:52:49.369 --> 00:52:53.753
&gt;&gt; ETHAN: And I heard about it amongst my
friends, you read about that in the press,

00:52:53.753 --> 00:52:55.729
I'm sure you’ve had the answers to lots
of questions about it, without getting into--frankly,

00:52:55.729 --> 00:52:59.410
I guess you can--but without getting whether
experience makes a difference or not, but

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:05.299
what you’re actually going to do to address
this perceived weakness and allow a lot of

00:53:05.299 --> 00:53:09.999
voters that want to get behind you and want
to support you to get past this issue of inexperience.

00:53:09.999 --> 00:53:18.160
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Right. Well, look. The--first of
all, Sergey and Larry didn’t have a lot

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:31.160
of experience starting a fortune 100 companies.
And it's a--and I suppose when they came in,

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:37.469
we're talking to Dave Drummond about incorporating
Google. You could have said, "Duh, these guys

00:53:37.469 --> 00:53:45.009
don't know what they’re doing." But, you
know, what we're looking for, I believe, when

00:53:45.009 --> 00:53:57.439
it comes to leadership is judgment, vision,
character. And that's what I bring to bear

00:53:57.439 --> 00:54:06.199
in this race. I have the experience of bringing
people together to get things done that I

00:54:06.199 --> 00:54:11.949
would put up against any candidate in this
race. When I was in Illinois, I expanded healthcare

00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:18.699
to Illinoisians by getting Democrats and Republicans
to agree and work together. We were able to

00:54:18.699 --> 00:54:23.930
reform a death penalty system that was broken
by getting law enforcement and Civil Rights

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:30.400
advocates to agree on things that people said
was--were impossible, but I was able to get

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.029
it done, probably, because I'm pretty good
at listening to people and finding common

00:54:35.029 --> 00:54:43.549
ground. I've also got the ability to stand
up for what I believe in even when it's unpopular,

00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:49.170
which I think is the quality that the next
president has to provide. I mean part of the

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:55.789
reason I was opposed to the war--I was opposed
to the war in Iraq back in 2002 when George

00:54:55.789 --> 00:55:01.549
Bush was at 65%, I didn’t just stumble into
that. It was based on having thought through

00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:06.119
what the consequences would be, understanding
that I was running in the U.S. Senate race,

00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:12.029
and I might lose my race, but I thought that
it was important to speak out forcefully on

00:55:12.029 --> 00:55:20.349
what I believed in. I think that's what the
next president has to offer. And I know how

00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:29.259
to choose talent, get smart people around
me who are capable and independent and bring

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:33.609
together a variety of different points of
views and then set a vision and move in the

00:55:33.609 --> 00:55:39.900
same direction, that, more than anything is
what we need. We're not looking for a Chief

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:46.589
Operating Officer when we select a president.
What were looking for is somebody who will

00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:51.880
say--will chart a course and say, "Here's
where America needs to go. Here's how we need

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:57.189
to solve our energy crises. Here's how we
need to revamp our education system," and

00:55:57.189 --> 00:56:02.509
then gather the talent together and mobilize
that talent to achieve that goal and to inspire

00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:08.459
a sense of hope and possibility. So one way
to answer this question is to say, "Look,

00:56:08.459 --> 00:56:12.569
the guy has been in the public service for
20 years. He's a constitutional law professor.

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:18.609
He was a Civil Rights lawyer. He did X, Y,
and Z in the state legislature. He's done

00:56:18.609 --> 00:56:22.719
all these wonderful things in the United States
Senate." But I think the main way to respond

00:56:22.719 --> 00:56:30.529
is to say, "This is all about judgment and
character." And also, I think, a little sense

00:56:30.529 --> 00:56:37.219
of impatience because part of the reason I'm
running is I'm impatient with the status quo.

00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:50.189
And what we've seen out of Democrats and Republicans--what
we’ve seen from Democrats and Republicans

00:56:50.189 --> 00:56:55.679
is a certain willingness to tolerate, what
I consider to be an intolerable status quo.

00:56:55.679 --> 00:57:00.069
And I think the American people feel that
same frustration. So, thank you.

00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:05.490
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Thank you. Then we have our--we're
going to have our, unfortunately, our last

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:11.699
question, so why don't you go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Senator, you said you had a bias to act

00:57:11.699 --> 00:57:13.599
against special interest.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah.

00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:17.939
&gt;&gt; But if special interests were having a
perverting influence on the entire legislative

00:57:17.939 --> 00:57:23.579
process, what can you propose as president
that can make it through that process intact?

00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:30.449
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Yeah, it is the classic question
of how do you get insiders to fix the system

00:57:30.449 --> 00:57:37.499
that they’re benefiting from, and it's hard.
You have to use shame. No, and I mean it.

00:57:37.499 --> 00:57:44.699
I'll give you an example. Last year, I passed
the toughest ethics reform legislation since

00:57:44.699 --> 00:57:53.430
Watergate. And I worked with Russ Feingold
and we eliminated corporate gifts or gifts

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:57.679
from lobbyists, meals from lobbyists, and
corporate jets from lobbyists. We required

00:57:57.679 --> 00:58:04.039
the disclosure of campaign contributions that
were bundled from lobbyists. And I'll be honest

00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:07.900
with you, when we first started, it wasn’t
just resistance from Republicans, there were

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:18.630
Democrats who didn’t want to see this happen
either. But what I knew was that if you stuck

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:24.390
with it and you got it to the floor where
the people had to vote, then it was going

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:36.219
to be hard for them to vote against it. So
part of the key for any reform is going to

00:58:36.219 --> 00:58:41.410
be getting the American people to pay enough
attention, that members of Congress start

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:46.910
worrying, "You know what, the American are
looking at us. And so we better change how

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:55.180
we behave," that's why this Google for Government
is so important because it--that's why transparency

00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:02.329
generally is so important in this entire process
because the more American people know, the

00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:07.689
more government is going to be held accountable.
And I'll give you just one very specific example

00:59:07.689 --> 00:59:12.209
around healthcare. I've mention that I want
to set up a system where every American has

00:59:12.209 --> 00:59:16.410
healthcare that's at least as good as the
healthcare I've got as a member of Congress.

00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:23.309
And if people want to--and if you’re interested
in the details of the healthcare plan, you

00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:30.660
can go to my website, barackobama.com. But
people asked me, "Well, why do you think you

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:35.549
can get it done and overcome the insurance
and the drug companies to spent a billion

00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:41.150
dollars over the last decade preventing the
reform from happening in lobbying and campaign

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:46.599
contributions?" And what I tell them is, "Yeah,
I respect what the Clintons tried to do in

00:59:46.599 --> 00:59:53.009
1993, in moving health reform forward." But
they made one really big mistake and that

00:59:53.009 --> 00:59:58.079
is they took all their people and all their
experts into a room and then they close the

00:59:58.079 --> 01:00:05.559
door and they try to design the plan in isolation
from the American people. And during that

01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:11.140
period of time, the insurance companies and
the drug companies, and the HMOs they mobilized,

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.859
and by the time the Clintons announced their
plan, you already have this Harry and Louise

01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:21.299
heads up, you guys don't remember this, you
weren’t born, maybe, I'm teasing. You were

01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:29.390
six. But these ads were out there that convinced
the American people they should be afraid

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:36.579
of healthcare reform. Now, I will do it entirely
differently. Within the first 100 days of

01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:41.229
my administration, we are going to have a
big table, and everybody is going to be invited;

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:48.289
laborer, employers, doctors, nurses, hospital
administrators, patient advocate groups, the

01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:51.039
drug and insurance company, they’re all
going to sit at the table, they just won't

01:00:51.039 --> 01:01:02.489
get to buy every chair. And we will work on
this process publicly. It will be on C-SPAN.

01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:08.630
It will be streaming over the net. And every
time we hit a glitch where somebody says,

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:14.580
"Well, no, no, no, we can't lower drug prices
because of, yeah, RND cost that drug companies

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:24.939
need." Well, we'll present data and facts
that make it more difficult for people to

01:01:24.939 --> 01:01:28.949
carry the water of their special interest
because it's public. And if they start running

01:01:28.949 --> 01:01:34.109
Harry and Louise ads, I'll make my own ads
or I'll send out something on YouTube, I’m

01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:43.819
president, and I'll be able to--I'll let them
know what the facts are. But, you know, one

01:01:43.819 --> 01:01:48.749
of the things that you learn when you’re
traveling and running for president is the

01:01:48.749 --> 01:01:54.029
American people at their core are a decent
people. There's a generosity of spirit there

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:59.839
and there's common sense their, but it's not
tapped. And many people are--they are just

01:01:59.839 --> 01:02:05.169
misinformed or they’re too busy, they're
trying to get their kids to school, they're

01:02:05.169 --> 01:02:10.299
working, but they just don't have enough information
or just they're not professionals at sorting

01:02:10.299 --> 01:02:15.449
out all information that's out there. And
so our political process gets skewed, but

01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:19.619
if you give them good information, their instincts
are good and they will make good decisions.

01:02:19.619 --> 01:02:24.529
And the president has the bully pulpit to
give them good information, and that's what

01:02:24.529 --> 01:02:29.289
we have to return to as a government where
the American people trust the information

01:02:29.289 --> 01:02:35.049
they’re getting. And I'm really looking
forward to doing that because I am a big believer

01:02:35.049 --> 01:02:42.769
in reason, in facts, in evidence, in science,
in feedback, everything that allows you to

01:02:42.769 --> 01:02:48.120
do what you do, that's what we should be doing
in our government. I want people in technology.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:55.150
I want innovators and engineers and scientists
like yourselves, I want you helping us make

01:02:55.150 --> 01:03:02.109
policy based on facts, based on reason. You
know, one of my favorite stories I have from

01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:07.259
Washington is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he
was a giant of the Senate and a very, you

01:03:07.259 --> 01:03:15.329
know, towering intellect. And he got an argument
one time with another senator, and the other

01:03:15.329 --> 01:03:20.650
senator apparently was losing the argument,
and so he got kind of huffy, and he said,

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:25.719
"Well, Pat, you know, you're entitled to your
opinion and I'm entitled to mine." And Moynihan

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:32.150
says, "You are entitled to your own opinion,
but you’re not entitled to your own facts."

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:38.160
And part of the problem that we're having
and special interests exploit this is we constantly

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:50.130
have a contest where facts don't matter. And
I want to restore that sense of decisions

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:56.430
being based on facts to the White House. And
I think that many of you can help me, so I

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.309
want you to be involved. Thank you so much
everybody.

01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:59.309
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you.

01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.318
&gt;&gt; SCHMIDT: Senator, thank you very much.
&gt;&gt; OBAMA: Thank you.
