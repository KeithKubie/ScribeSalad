EMMA JACKSON: Hi, and welcome
to the next in our series of

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.810
Women Techmakers for Google
Developers Live coming to you

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.600
from Campus London.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.650
I'm Emma Jackson.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.470
I look after Google's education

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.690
programs in emerging markets.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.080
MANDY WAITE: And I'm
Mandy Waite.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.060
I'm a Developer Advocate on
the Google cloud platform.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.790
So welcome to Women
Techmakers.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.770
Today we have with us
Lorna Mitchell.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.300
Welcome, Lorna.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.780
It's great to have you here.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.170
Brief introduction of Lorna.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.910
Lorna is an independent web
development consultant, based

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.910
in Leeds in the north
of England.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.490
Since her degree in electronic
engineering, her career path

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.980
has taken in games development,
database

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.150
administration, and a selection
of web-related

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.400
roles, after which she took
the plunge and became

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.930
self-employed.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.840
These days, Lorna is
a published author.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.800
She delivers training on a
variety of PHP and API-related

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.590
topics, is a regular conference
speaker, and works

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.450
with a variety of clients
on their web

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.360
development and API projects.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.030
Lorna is also an active mentor
with PHP Women--

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.760
yay--

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.460
and helped found the PHP
Northwest Conference, and now

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.360
leads the Joined-in Open
Source Project.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.260
So welcome, Lorna.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.920
LORNA MITCHELL: Thank
you very much.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.710
EMMA JACKSON: So you're
self-employed but still

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.500
involved in the technology
space.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.660
Can you tell us a bit about what
you're working on at the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.670
moment and what excites
you about it?

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.150
LORNA MITCHELL: Sure.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.240
I think the most exciting thing
about what I do is the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420
fact that I can work on such
a variety of things.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.710
So it's not just I'm working
on different kinds of

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.470
projects, sometimes complicated
data projects for

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.030
using lots of sports data,
something about that.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.900
Sometimes content-related
projects.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.800
Sometime something that seems
quite mundane, working on

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.920
product databases and exchanging
information between

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.210
those systems, but they're
really important to the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.100
businesses that use them.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.410
So it's all quite different.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.700
I also do lots of different
kinds of tasks.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400
So sometimes I'm training.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.090
Sometimes I get to write code.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.790
It's a real different-- every
day, every day is different.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.460
I just finished writing a book,
so there was a period of

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.910
hermit-ness, where I sat quietly
in my office and wrote

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.580
a lot of words.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.430
And then this week, I'm out
doing events like this.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.690
I really love the variety.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110
I can't imagine doing something
where I knew in the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.600
morning what I'd be
doing that day.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.380
MANDY WAITE: That's awesome.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.790
So your degree's in Electronic
and Computer Engineering as

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.740
opposed to Computer Science,
which is more traditional.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.885
What attracted you to that
particular subject?

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.940
LORNA MITCHELL: At school--

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.820
my A levels are in
math and physics.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.760
I prefer the maths.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.340
There's kind of a definite
slant there.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.860
The things that I was interested
in and I was good

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.620
at was basically math.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.890
But rather than doing either
maths or computer science at

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.210
university, I wanted to go into
engineering, because I

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.060
think it's a very
practical topic.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.390
I have engineers in my family,
and I was also-- one of my

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.320
best teachers at school
was an engineer.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.890
And I just thought
it was a bit more

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.870
practical and hands-on.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.320
I wanted to make lights flash,
and that never gets old.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.580
MANDY WAITE: Awesome.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.180
Did you have any specific career
goals when you started

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.770
out on that particular
educational path?

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.620
LORNA MITCHELL: Really
not at all.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.720
I had quite good grades at
school, and I really just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.490
wanted to keep studying
and keep finding out

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.370
more about the world.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.260
Turns out, an engineering
degree is also

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.340
useful in the workplace.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.130
But I didn't have that in
mind when I was 18.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.710
MANDY WAITE: So I guess
one question is--

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.930
I'm not completely clear, and
it may be of interest to the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.300
audience is, what's the real
difference between an

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.300
electronic and computer
engineering degree than a

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.410
computer science degree?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.060
What's the main difference
apart from

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.810
the flashing lights?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.170
LORNA MITCHELL: So the
electronics degree gave me a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.970
really good grounding in
hardware, because I was

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.850
dealing with bits of wire, and
my soldering's good, and all

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.620
those kinds of things.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.030
And I did electromagnetics
and other kind of

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.660
quiet hardware-y topics.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.330
I didn't do some of
the traditional

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.310
computer science subjects.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.640
So I didn't really take an
algorithms class, or I didn't

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.150
write a compiler.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.885
But we wrote code that did
things that solved problems,

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.460
and we worked from FPGAs
into machine code.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.690
I learned Assembler.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.519
Then I learned C. I think C's a
high-level language, because

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.070
that's the background
that I'm from.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.070
So everything else seems,
oh, this is easy.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.410
You don't even have to
change registers.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.800
So most of the time now I work
in PHP, and that's brilliant.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.320
it just feels so advanced in
relation to my background.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.970
I think having that low-level
understanding of what happens

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.920
when you're compiling down to
byte code and the instruction

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.180
pipelines informs what I do,
even on a web platform.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.220
MANDY WAITE: I know exactly
where you're coming from

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.370
there, about working closer with
them and actually having

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.290
a better understanding of how
computers work can actually

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.000
help you build systems better
and build applications better,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.930
because you know how to
optimize, particularly

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.100
performance is very important.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.520
That's a really great answer.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.060
Thank you.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.940
EMMA JACKSON: I'm interested to
know about your work with

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.230
the mentorship program for PHP
Women and how you've had a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.310
mentor and how that has maybe
helped you in your career.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.110
LORNA MITCHELL: Yes.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.710
Being a mentor and having a
mentor I would say have helped

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.410
in equal measure.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.240
You think, oh, I need to get a
mentor so that I can progress.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.050
But the PHP Women mentoring
scheme is called Big Sis,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.890
Little Sis.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.850
And I have both a big sis
and some little sises.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.250
They're not all female.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.460
You just have to be called sis
if you want to be one, if you

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.810
want to be part of
this scheme.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.260
And I think my little sisters
have taught me at least as

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.010
much as my big sis.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.615
My big sis tries to disown me
on a regular basis, because

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:41.990
she thinks I know more
than her now.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.550
But in reality, someone who's
ahead of me on the career path

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.010
that I can--

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.320
I don't see her very often.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.910
We live in different countries--
but that I can get

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.960
in touch and just take her
guidance or ask her advice.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.220
And it might not even be
particularly a technical

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.110
thing, has helped enormously,
just someone that will always

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.310
listen, even if mostly
she reflects my own

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.450
advice back at me.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.420
You always need that person
who's outside of what you're

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.050
actually doing.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.960
So she's not someone that
I've worked with.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.630
She's not a colleague.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.550
She's someone that I've
always gone to.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.420
And my little sisters ask
me questions that

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.220
really make me think.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.410
And they come to me for advice,
and I've kind of had

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.940
to grow up to be an elder to
them, to be their big sis in a

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.010
way that I wouldn't have been
pushed to without them.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.910
But being part of the family
tree-- and some of my little

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.380
sisters are now big sisters
in their own right--

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.270
has been amazing, just this
extra sideline that's really

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.410
helped so much in
my development.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.880
EMMA JACKSON: That's great.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.680
MANDY WAITE: Does it take a
particular kind of personality

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.730
to benefit from mentorship?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.020
I mean, I've tried it
before in my life.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.720
I'm not very good at taking
advice from people.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.760
I tend to go my own way.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.810
Do you think your personality is
well suited to that kind of

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.070
mentorship?

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.960
LORNA MITCHELL: I think so.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.510
I mean, I've had little sises
that I don't think I've been

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.750
very much help to, and it's
people who don't really know

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.710
what they want to get out It.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.150
I think to be mentored, you need
to know what you need,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.285
and I say, I'm worried
about this.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:11.740
Should I do this or that?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.010
Or would you advise
me to do this?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.550
Or I'm not sure how to approach
this next problem.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.550
Or I don't know how to apply
for this job or write this

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.700
conference abstract.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.310
So if you have something--

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.590
it's like asking a technical
support question.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.340
So if it's a clear-cut question
where you're asking

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.680
someone to give you some advice,
then that makes you

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680
easy to mentor.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.820
And sometimes I adopt people
as kind of stealth mentors.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.830
They didn't really step up for
this, but they're people to

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.090
whom I would go for advice
on a particular topic.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.340
And they probably don't even
know that that's how I

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.370
consider them.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.670
So I think it's about making
it easy for other

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:46.580
people to help you.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.170
You can gain so much with not
taking up too much of their

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.360
time and energy.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.810
EMMA JACKSON: That's good.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.040
This makes me think actually,
so what is the best advice

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.310
you've ever been given?

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.130
That's a tough question.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.800
I'm sure you've had lots
along the way, but--

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.220
LORNA MITCHELL: I've had
a lot of advice.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.470
And I'm famous for giving
a lot of advice as well.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.460
I think some of the best advice
I've had came from

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.660
someone I know through the Girl
Geeks dinners in Leeds.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.180
And it's not advice at all.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.470
It's a question.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.960
And we had a conversation
immediately

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.450
before I went freelance.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.660
And I literally gave
up my job with

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.960
nothing to go to, nothing.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.700
And she said to me,
Lorna, what's the

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.891
worst that could happen?

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:31.190
I had a job I was tired of.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.070
I wasn't enjoying what
I was doing.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.320
And she just said what's the
worst that could happen?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.460
And so I've sort of taken that
with me and given that advice

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.309
to other people.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:42.429
Because if you're in a bad
situation, all you can

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.179
do is change it.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:44.750
MANDY WAITE: That's awesome.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.590
I actually have a really
detailed question on that, and

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.290
it kind of really answers it.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.080
How difficult a decision
was it?

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.920
How far ahead in the future
could you see at the time?

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.170
Sometimes it's easier to make
that kind of decision if you

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.910
know you have some work
lined up and you can

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.240
fall into that work.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.950
But sometimes, it's a
case of just saying,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.040
I'm going to stop.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.260
I'm going to do something
completely different.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.420
That was you then?

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.180
LORNA MITCHELL: I really--

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.250
it was a step change.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.980
I knew it was coming for quite
a long time, which I hope

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.270
won't upset anyone who was
working with me at the time.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.700
I knew it was coming for
quite a long time.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.160
My position was untenable.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.190
I was doing a lot of travel,
and that doesn't suit me.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.370
I'm a home bird.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.500
I was finding the job
very stressful.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.380
And it didn't play
to my strengths.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.980
It's not what I wanted to do.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.810
I resigned my job with some
savings in the bank, a

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.390
boyfriend with some income,
and three days

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.420
training lined up.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.520
I had one client and three days
of work, nothing more.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.080
MANDY WAITE: But you had the
confidence in your own skills

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.510
and abilities to do that.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.530
Did you consult anybody else
who had actually done

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.870
something similar in the past?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.380
LORNA MITCHELL: A few people.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.110
I talked to a few people who
run their own businesses.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.362
And I talked to trusted
mentors at the time.

00:10:01.362 --> 00:10:07.050
And I think I knew that I could
get a job that was no

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.860
worse than the one that I had,
and I saw that I needed to

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.420
make a change.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.200
You don't know how a job's going
to work out, but you

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.200
take a risk.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.340
I didn't know if I wanted
to take a permanent job.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.710
I didn't know what
I would find.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.090
I didn't know if I would
continue to be freelance.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.440
I'm nearly three years in.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.480
I'm still working for myself.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.140
The right jobs never come along,
and I'm happy doing

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.680
what I'm doing.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.910
So it's been a wonderful
lifestyle change in terms of I

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.480
can do outreach like this.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.080
I can go to conferences.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.380
I don't need permission.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.120
I can take two months off to
write a book as long as I can

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.000
somehow fund the lifestyle
with the consulting and

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.630
training work that I am doing.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.350
So it works.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.620
I quite enjoy the balance.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.210
It's a constant juggling act and
hoping that someone will

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.880
ring me up with a really
interesting

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.040
project, all the time.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.900
Then they do, all in the
same week, of course.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.100
But it's been a real journey,
and I'm not tired of it yet.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.730
MANDY WAITE: That's awesome.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.510
EMMA JACKSON: I was going
to ask you about

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.190
writing a book, actually.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.990
Because you talk about writing
code and doing all these

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.370
conferences and training
and other things, and

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.283
then writing a book.

00:11:07.283 --> 00:11:09.790
Are there similarities between
writing code and writing

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.480
books, or how do you
see the two?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.010
LORNA MITCHELL: The conference
talks are more similar, I

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.490
think, in terms of the way that
you communicate, much

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.940
more than writing code.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.210
I've been blogging for years
and years and years.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.140
I'm just about to write my
800th post, which is

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.080
ridiculous.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.090
EMMA JACKSON: Another couple
of books in there.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.660
LORNA MITCHELL: Why am
I writing more words?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.675
I should wrap them
up into a book.

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:35.470
No, I've been blogging
for a long time.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.410
And part of that is the way
that I deal with the

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.030
information, the way that
I retain things.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.170
Also, we talked already
about mentoring.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.145
The one thing you can't do is
ask the same question twice.

00:11:45.145 --> 00:11:47.020
People get tired of
that really fast.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.830
And I'm a bit of a scatterbrain
for detail.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.720
So I blog.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.920
It makes me understand it.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.370
It makes me express it.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.020
And when I Google for things,
it finds my blog.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.290
And that's brilliant,
because I can't

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.750
remember having this problem.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.170
But it's explained to me in
words that I understand, and

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.320
the paths are all correct
for my system.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.230
So it's just been the most
rewarding habit ever.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.710
And I moved up to
writing longer

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.970
articles for other outlets.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.210
When you're writing 3,000-word
magazine articles, you just

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.020
write lots of them.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.069
And there you are, you've
got a book.

00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:19.520
MANDY WAITE: That's awesome.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.280
It's interesting talking about
programming and development,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.940
and such like, some--

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.860
many people that work in the
industry actually see software

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.425
development-- the role as a
software developer as just

00:12:29.425 --> 00:12:30.840
being all about writing code.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.040
But what does the role of
developer mean to you?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.490
LORNA MITCHELL: The developer
is the craftsman.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.920
We're the facilitators,
and we make something

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.340
that's going to be useful.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.930
We're not distracted by--
well, we shouldn't be

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.090
distracted by necessarily
the new shiny or

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.330
making too many features.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.110
We're closely linked to the
needs of the customer or the

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.950
user, and we create useful,
robust things.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:00.430
It is a very creative,
practical discipline.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.080
And I do quite a lot
of craft as well.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.170
And I always explain it in those
terms, is when I'm doing

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:10.280
something with yarn or with
fabric, I'm making something.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.430
And that process about how the
pieces go together and

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.820
planning it out, making sure
you've got everything, is just

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.140
like building a software
application, is you're putting

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.400
the pieces together to make
something that is more than

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.310
the sum of its parts.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.030
MANDY WAITE: That's
really great.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.190
Because we had that similar
conversation earlier about

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.880
exactly the same thing, about
creativity, about the whole

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.300
thing about development being
a creative process and not

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.290
always being immediately obvious
to people that that's

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.090
what it's about, actually
a means to an end, just

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.250
something on its own.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.213
And I even used the example of
knitting and crochet, that

00:13:42.213 --> 00:13:44.350
sort of thing, because it's
the same kind of process.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.370
It's the same kind of inputs.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.760
That's really interesting.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.205
EMMA JACKSON: Can you tell us
about any craft projects

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.700
you're working on
at the moment?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.820
LORNA MITCHELL: I've just
finished a blanket for my

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.880
friend's new baby.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.480
Most of what I do is crochet.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.700
I'm currently taking an online
bag sewing class from Craftsy,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.130
which is really interesting,
because I'm starting to do my

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.510
own video learning classes.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.970
So to see another discipline and
how they teach their craft

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.760
really informs how
I teach mine.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.070
It's a funny crossover.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.690
Also, one of my friends
bought me a new--

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.920
it's a Lily Twinkle.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.250
So it's a sewable component.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.380
You sew the chip.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.630
It comes with parts that
you can sew the

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:23.590
conductive thread on to.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.980
And I've got little LEDs that
you sew into things.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.120
And it's preprogrammed.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.495
The chip-- you don't program
it or anything.

00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:29.480
It's quite entry level.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.760
And it just twinkles.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.270
So you hang all the lights off
the ends of this thing and put

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.160
a little coin cell
battery into it.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.660
So I'm doing the sewing class,
so that I can make something

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.100
cute enough that I then want
to put my hardware

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.270
electronics into it.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.270
EMMA JACKSON: Wow, we
should have asked

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.632
you to bring an example.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.340
LORNA MITCHELL: I haven't
finished it yet.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.540
I'll send you a photo
when I'm done.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.820
MANDY WAITE: And I'll
bring you some of

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.402
my hyperbolic crochet.

00:14:51.402 --> 00:14:51.820
LORNA MITCHELL: Oh, yeah.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.300
I've seen that with the coral.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.560
And that's really cool.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.270
MANDY WAITE: That's
really great.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.370
I mean, just listening to
this is so fascinating.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.920
So when it comes to software
development, you seem to have

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.573
an obviously strong
affinity with PHP.

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:05.080
You work with it.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.290
You blog about it.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.880
You write about it.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.815
You're writing a book currently,
or you just

00:15:08.815 --> 00:15:12.190
finished a book, "PHP
Web Services API

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.320
for the Modern Web".

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.900
Was that a conscious choice
to choose PHP?

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.680
Or is it more a case of
you just developed

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.300
experience with PHP?

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.190
LORNA MITCHELL: Yeah,
not at all.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.030
A lot of open source projects
were written in PHP.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.760
It's free to use everywhere.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.050
It was very easy to
get started with.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.530
And this is going
back a long way.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:31.410
I met a man at university who
was doing a terribly bad job

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.550
of the society website.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.220
And I said I could do better,
and had to ask someone to

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.240
teach me the program.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.560
I probably had to back
up my claims.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.990
And we used PHP because it was
free and it was available.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.120
It's going back--

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.810
this is 2001.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:49.230
And there were open source
projects in PHP.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.040
Anyone could do it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.040
It was a very friendly
language to

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.420
dip into as a beginner.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.880
Indeed, I did it as a hobby
for the first few years.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.240
It wasn't my profession
when I graduated.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.341
I had done a bit at university,
and I carried on

00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:02.160
doing bits and pieces
as a hobby.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.480
And then, it became my
main role only five

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.790
or six years ago.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.690
MANDY WAITE: That
is fantastic.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.090
What about comparing PHP
with other languages?

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.640
Have you coded in other
languages as well?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.470
Are you able to compare
and contrast?

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.140
LORNA MITCHELL: A
few, not many.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.670
I did C and Java at university,
but those are now,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.100
as you can imagine,
pretty rusty.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.532
I was once a Delphi developer,
but I don't like

00:16:24.532 --> 00:16:25.940
to talk about that.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.020
I'm fascinated by all the other
scripting languages.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.660
PHP developers are almost
all polyglot.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.850
So they'll all write some
Python, some Ruby, a little

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:33.410
bit of Note.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.900
I had a patch accepted into a
Note open source project.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.770
And that was quite exciting,
really writing in JavaScript.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.730
But those skills and the ideas
are very transferable.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.110
So I think I quite like PHP.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.640
I now know quite
a lot about it.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.840
I teach certification.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.240
I know more about it than
probably anybody

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.990
really needs to.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.920
I like the low barrier
of entry.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.930
Some people are snobby
about bad PHP code.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.270
But for me, if it solves
your problem, then

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.660
awesome, get in, do it.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.340
And that's where everyone
starts.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.380
Lots of people in my industry
don't have a degree or don't

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.230
have a relevant degree.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.069
There's a lot of art history
degrees around.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.880
And it doesn't matter,
because it's really

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.849
about critical thinking.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.890
You don't need to be able to
write a compiler to write

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.680
really good PHP application.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.720
So I quite like it.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.810
And newer versions of the
language have some really

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.165
awesome features in so we now
have anonymous functions and

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:23.780
name spaces and traits
and things.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.760
So it's starting to look a
bit more enterprise-y.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.720
But it's always true to its
solving the web problem roots.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.840
EMMA JACKSON: So what kind of
cool new things are happening

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.090
in technology that you're
excited about at the moment?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.500
LORNA MITCHELL: There's quite
a lot of things going on.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.190
The thing that is really
catching my attention is the

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.910
big data movement, looking at
data science and analytics.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.410
For me, I have a huge interest
in mathematics and statistics

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.630
as something that I feel I've
always been good at.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.230
But because I understand that,
and I can write code, and I

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.550
can communicate with people, I
think those types of things

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.100
are really interesting.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.550
As a sole developer,
quite often I don't

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.830
have huge data sets.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.190
But that's something that--
personally that's where my

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.468
interests lie, and I'd like
to pursue that this year.

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:14.360
MANDY WAITE: Interesting.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.180
So another question that came
up from your bio about

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.580
API-related topics.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.860
So much of the work you do
involves APIs of some kind,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.920
using them to integrate with
existing applications in their

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.490
APIs or adding APIs to
applications that you develop.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.670
How important is the API in
the modern world, when it

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.436
comes in developing
applications, creating

00:18:37.436 --> 00:18:38.720
mash-ups and so forth?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.600
LORNA MITCHELL: It's vital.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.800
There are very, very few systems
now which do not need

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.300
to talk to any other systems.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.940
And at one time, we used to
export CSV files overnight and

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.520
do these batch import jobs.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.770
And that's not good enough
for today's now, always

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.180
on kind of a world.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.860
So the APIs are really
important.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.800
And even for simple applications
that are almost

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.850
just websites, we're
distributing that content over

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.370
so many different platforms.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.080
We can customize the experiences
for apps, for

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.350
browsers, for different
kinds of browsers.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.090
And building the business logic
into an API layer and

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.640
doing lots and lots of
appropriate presentation is a

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.400
very robust way to build
your application.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.090
It allows integration with any
other systems that you need.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.960
And also, I hope--

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.220
I believe--

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.980
helps to future-proof, because
the next thing that comes

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.290
along, we can just bolt in.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.990
They'll be easy hooks, and the
system will already be

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.730
designed for that.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.320
So I think it's vitally
important.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.260
I'm seeing very few projects
where the website is built in

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.280
a single lump.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.540
I'm seeing multiple layers to
that stack, and I think it's

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.510
the way forward.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.370
MANDY WAITE: So you talked
about data in

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.020
the previous question.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.340
And you're talking
about APIs there.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.410
And data and APIs, they work
completely together.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.200
But we don't really have a
common set of data yet.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.100
We're working towards
a semantic web,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.380
ontologies and such like.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.860
How do you see that going
in the future?

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.140
Do you think we need to have a
shared data model which will

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.160
allow all APIs to communicate
together about

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.340
objects and so forth?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.430
LORNA MITCHELL: I think the way
that you consume different

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.190
pieces of information is
often very bespoke.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.090
I'm not sure how valuable making
them all look the same

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.920
really is, because data is
so, so different when you

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.440
get down into it.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.940
So standards are always
a good thing.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.310
Always a good thing.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:28.680
But I'm not sure how much a
unified data structure will

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.730
help when all the data
we can represent in

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.040
the world is so different.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.190
MANDY WAITE: Have you
heard of Schema.org?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.220
LORNA MITCHELL: Yes.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.080
MANDY WAITE: We have a guy who
works in our office, who

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.760
actually curates the
Schema.org site.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.170
He'd be really interested
in your comments.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.980
I think Dan would love to see
you create a model that could

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.650
represent every kind of object
in the universe in a certain

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.255
way that can be shared amongst
multiple applications.

00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:52.610
But I think you're right.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.560
The bespoke is difficult.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.030
We consume data in
different ways.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.710
We need it to be presented to us
in different ways as well.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.530
But maybe it's a something
that we'll move

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.450
towards in the future.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.180
LORNA MITCHELL: I think this is
an area that will change so

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.450
much over the next few years.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.730
It's a hot topic.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.980
MANDY WAITE: Oh, data
is huge now.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.110
And computing is becoming
a side topic.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.560
It's becoming all
about the data.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.040
EMMA JACKSON: So do you have
plans for the next few years?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.740
You said maybe getting into more
of the big data stuff.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.410
LORNA MITCHELL: Do
I have plans?

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.770
I'm not really a plans person.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.460
If I had ever had a plan, I
certainly wouldn't be here.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.660
So it's very much what comes up
and making the most of the

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.770
opportunities.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.440
I don't really have a plan.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.270
There's nothing huge on my
road map at the moment.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.400
I'm hoping for some more
data-related projects and also

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.680
some time to pursue that
myself, but it's--

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.050
I'm self-employed.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.020
June is empty.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.910
It's February now.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:50.366
So there could be anything
just around the corner.

00:21:50.366 --> 00:21:51.500
MANDY WAITE: That's amazing.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.550
I think it's like that for
most of us nowadays, that

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.840
nobody knows what we're
going to be working on

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.666
in six months time.

00:21:57.666 --> 00:21:59.080
These changes are rapid.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.120
LORNA MITCHELL: I like
it that way.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.870
MANDY WAITE: That's great.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.250
Open Source.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.580
You run Joind.in, the open
source community.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.170
Do you want to talk a little bit
about open source and how

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.940
you see open source's role
in the modern world?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.690
I come from a background
of open source.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.390
It has changed somewhat.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.700
It has moved much more to be
community driven, much even

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.100
more to than it used to be.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.870
It's now a collaborative
effort.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.120
People understand exactly what
the boundaries are when it

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.925
comes to open source projects.

00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:28.450
So do you want to talk about
open source a bit?

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:28.860
LORNA MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.715
Joind.in is a bit of a funny
open source project, because

00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:32.610
it actually--

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.130
it's always a product.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.010
So it's got a domain name, and
there's a single instance.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.170
There's no reason why
you shouldn't run

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.600
your own copy of Joind.in.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.970
It's a tool for collecting
feedback

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.330
from speakers at events.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.710
So it's mostly used by open
source events, because we work

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.080
on the project and
then we use it.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.700
It was built by the community.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.780
I didn't build it originally.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.320
I just inherited it.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.880
And open source has been so
valuable to me in terms of a

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.020
quick start when building
applications, being able to

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.440
deliver to clients without a lot
budget, 80% of what they

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.240
need, and you just make the rest
and help them with it.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.620
So the idea that we're not all
reinventing the wheel, that

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.840
we're all working on the same
wheel, and because it's

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.980
software, we can make as many
wheels as we need, I think is

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.810
quite magical.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:22.025
On a very personal note, open
source has made me.

00:23:22.025 --> 00:23:24.970
A lot of what I've had to learn,
I've learned because it

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.200
was something I wanted to do and
not necessarily at work.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.480
Open source is a fabulous
vehicle for professional

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.040
development.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.780
I'm now an open source
project lead.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.420
I didn't intend really
to take that on.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.850
It's just one of those
things that sort of

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.890
cropped into my life.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.930
And I had to learn how to lead a
community, how to manage all

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.310
the pro requests, how to support
everybody on GitHub,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.890
and so many other
things besides.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.880
And that has pushed my skills
in a way that I

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.070
didn't know I needed.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.120
So open source will always mean
that to me, as well as

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.150
just the technology.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.350
EMMA JACKSON: Thanks
so much, Lorna.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.975
It's just been great to have
you on Women Techmakers.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:04.515
MANDY WAITE: Yes, it's
been amazing.

00:24:04.515 --> 00:24:05.520
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.090
LORNA MITCHELL: My pleasure.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.340
MANDY WAITE: Thank you.
