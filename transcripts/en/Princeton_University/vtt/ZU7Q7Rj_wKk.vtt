MARGARET MARTONOSI:
Hi, my name is

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.390
Margaret Martonosi. I've been
on the Princeton faculty

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.160
for 23 years.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
I'm a computer scientist,
and I work in CITP as well.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.540
And I'm here as a
panelist on the panel

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.660
on internet of things.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.320
First of all, the relevance
of the conference itself,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.870
I think it's really struck
a nerve with a lot of people

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.180
to examine what democracy means
in an era where information

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.130
flows freely in many
ways, and what's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.420
technology's role in that.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.880
And I think it's particularly
important for technologists

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.630
to be a part of that discussion.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.590
We often, as
computer scientists,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.230
we develop technology, and then
sort of throw it over the fence

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.562
for it to be used
in different ways.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:44.520
It's important for us to
be in the conversation

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.995
about how it gets used
and its implications.

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.260
ASA CRAIG: Hi, my
name is Asa Craig.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.570
I'm a graduate student
in the Woodrow Wilson

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.540
School, a second-year
MPA student, studying

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.430
domestic public policy.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.207
And I'm here in Berlin,
one, because I just

00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:01.290
thought the topic was very
interesting, and really

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.440
important in terms of what do we
know about what the internet is

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.400
going to do for our rights and
our liberties moving forward.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.840
I just want to be a
part of the conversation.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.670
And I'm here helping
out and volunteering.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.250
So I think the one
interesting thing with my role

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.070
is that I get to see that
this is really a show.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.170
We have speakers from
all over the world that

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.960
are coming to chat from
all different walks of life

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.307
in different organizations,
different countries,

00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:25.140
different languages.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.690
And we have to just make sure
that people are ready to go,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.800
get on stage when they're
supposed to be there,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
and that when we
start and we end

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.750
at the right and
appropriate time.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.930
And so I'm the person that's
looking at the schedule,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.070
and saying we have
five minutes left.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.470
This should be
the last question.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.844
So I'm just looking
at the clock,

00:01:41.844 --> 00:01:44.210
and saying OK, let me see if
I can get their attention,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.614
and to let them know that
it's time to wrap up.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.840
CLAUDIA SCHMIDT-MEMMLER: My
name is Claudia Schmidt-Memmler,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.000
and I work at the international
strategy office at Humboldt

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.340
University, here in Berlin.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.300
And we are an international
strategic partner of Princeton

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.974
University, and I am
responsible for the connection

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:06.640
to Princeton, and the connection
between Humboldt and Princeton.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.290
And that's why I'm here.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.748
It was really
interesting, already,

00:02:08.748 --> 00:02:10.591
in the time leading
up to the conference,

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:12.340
when I started thinking
about these issues

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.930
around digitalization,
and liberty, and politics.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.020
It popped up everywhere.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.300
In German media, my
focus was so on it.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.870
And I realized there's a
lot of debate going on,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.200
and it's really a
topic that is spot on,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.110
and so current in Germany,
as well in the U.S., I'm sure.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.080
ASA CRAIG: It's just
interesting to get

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.900
to really connect not only with
what is happening on stage,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.670
but to think about
what is the process

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.220
of the whole for throwing
this type of a conference.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.260
MARGARET MARTONOSI:
As a Princeton person,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.180
we have a notion of
an orange bubble.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.179
We sometimes talk about
where we stay on campus

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.720
and we think great
thoughts, but it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.960
important to have
impact out in the world.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.480
I think Princetonians already
have tremendous impact

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.860
out in the world in
many different ways.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.920
So it's not like
this is particularly

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.460
new in that respect.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.450
But it's important to highlight
when we're trying to do that,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.820
and to make it as
visible as possible,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.820
and to bring those conversations
to as many different regions

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.980
of the world as possible.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.150
And so in that
respect, I think this

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.730
is another great
example of things

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.250
we're doing in that line.
