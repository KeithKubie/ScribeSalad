Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 21 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. And our guest tonight is Mr Tim Kennedy who is an active duty army special forces soldier, ranger sniper MMA fighter. Little bit of that Jujitsu black belt, the zits fighter in the UFC current fighter in the UFC who everyone's waiting to watch fight again, an American patriot, God bless America and just all around beast that miss anything, uh, pretty skinny right now and have a kick ass mustache and he's got that going for him and really excited to have Tim on the show. As you know, there's not been a lot of guests on the show. The only other guests that's been on this show so far has been Mr Leif Babin who was one of the platoon commanders, worked for me in Ramadi or last deployment and wrote the book that I wrote with him and we had a pretty fired up podcast and talked about a lot about the things that we went through and experienced.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       And you know, knowing you, and I know you're a little bit younger than me, but, uh, you know, you just been through a lot of the same kind of life events and mistakes and mistakes and same kind of stuff. So it's pretty cool to hang out with you a little bit today and get to talk to you. And for everyone that's waiting to know the results of the grappling death match between 10 candidates come and go. We can't even tell results because it's still to be decided. It didn't happen today. We, uh, we ran out of time. Tim's got a little dinged up injury and so we had to forgo that. And so instead we just went out and slaughtered some meat. Dude, it's amazing barbecue coming from a text and I was like, really? You're taking me to buy into barbecue? Yeah. Had to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Not disappointed. So also with us, of course, is Echo Charles. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. So we're going to get straight into it. Uh, two questions. We've got a ton of questions from the Internet. Everyone's like exploded. It did explode. Like, what questions should I ask? And he's like, my phone's on fire by the Internet broke and, but we did get a ton of questions, so thanks everybody for asking a bunch of cool questions. Obviously we can't answer them all and, but we're going to try, we're going to take a crack at it. And the first one, and I just started this whole thing off with cause it for anybody that does know who you are, because I bring in a lot of fans from, you know, MMA or whatever, but not really, you know, most of the people that are listening to me, I think they might be Jujitsu guys, but there's a lot of business people and, and stuff like that. So I guess to start this off with a question that would give everyone a little bit of background about you, other than what I've just said, is someone said, hey, I'd like to hear a little bit about Tim Kennedy upbringing and what led him to enlist.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Oh man, go Tim. Uh, I grew up in central California, uh, Rural California. When I say I'm from California, people are like, Oh man, you like, Hollywood is like, no, like do you surf? And I was like, dude, I speak Spanish. I argue with Mexicans. I ride horses and that's all there is to do where I'm from. Um, it's beautiful there, but uh, it's very rural. It was like an hour long drive from my folks place to the gas to them, the supermarket. Um, so you know, as I was like the Christian version of a boy scout or royal ranger and grew up hunting and shooting, um, and I dunno, pretty normal kind of rural kid. Like there's a lot of like the Marcus Luttrell and then Chris Kyle's like, they're from Texas and it seems like a pretty natural thing as a a decent athlete. I wrestled and always wanted that next thing, that next challenge.

Speaker 2:          00:03:54       And uh, so I was in college, I was fighting, um, I just won the ECC. It was like I find Jason Miller, Ryan McKown. Anyways, just like Dennis Kang was in the tournament is an eight man, one 85 tournament. Chucklito was in my corner. Matt Hughes was the ref and um, it was for three fights in one night and uh, one that which ranked me in the top 10 in the world. And uh, that was like August 30th of 2001 then September 11th happened, um, uh, watching planes find a buildings piss me off pretty bad. So at that time I was a pretty bad person. I had three women pregnant. And um, within the next couple of weeks I also found out that I had possibly contracted the HIV virus. And, um, so it's professional fighter and Grad school working at Dotcom and commerce in California thought I was pretty awesome. And like all revelations in life, um, when you're not reaching your potential, it's a stark, horrible reality.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       And that's what it was. It was this wake up call that I was a piece of shit I should be probably buried, would be, um, what I've sir, it would have served the planet better had I just knocked, continued consuming oxygen. So you're saying that that trigger moment for you was when September 11th. Yeah. You saw everything that was happening and you said to yourself, man, this is what I've done with my life so far. Yup. That's pathetic. Yeah. Time to get in the game. Yep. All correct there. But I think a little bit more, um, negative, like I am a super nasty piece of poop beyond the theoretic. Yeah. I'm looking on, my dad's an amazing human. My mom's an amazing human. My sister and my brother, you know, like even to this day, I aspire to be what they are. And then I was like, man, I'm a really bad.

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       So I go down to the recruiter's office and I didn't know the difference between special forces, Navy Seals, um, marine recon, um, being a ranger, being a green Brae. So I went in, I was like, I obviously want to [inaudible] they're all in the one at the same. And I was like, I just want to, you know, be Chuck Norris. Essentially. They laughed at me. Um, but it's when I got to the recruiter's office, when I thought I was like this awesome American, again taking my say self like, aw, I'm so cool that I'm going to go do this, you know, like how selfless of me and there's 2000 people in line ahead of me, you know, not, not like 1000, not like 100, which would been a lot, 2000 people in s in rural California. We're like, Oh man, I got to go do something and they'll beat me to it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       So I'm again, a complete piece of shit. So that, that was kind of like the genesis and the origin. That's what brought me to the recruiter's office. And then through the course of trying to figure out, you know, what they're as vap score and your gt score, being a college athlete, you know, like what the right fit was. I wanted the fastest thing to get me behind a gun, um, with people that wanted to kill bad people. And that's a ended up being the green berets. Awesome. You know, one of the things, I was on a, uh, interview in England and I was talking about the fact that America's pretty restrained in the way it handles things. But I also said that if we get pushed to a certain point, and I don't know where that point is and you can't describe it and no one can predict it, but that's a case in point. You know, something happens like September 11th, and you've got 2000 men, military age males in rural California standing in line to go and make the ultimate sacrifice if need be.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       You can't forget that about American now. You can't forget that about him. You go to Pearl Harbor, you know, Beautiful Hawaii. You drop some bombs on us for, you know, because you're pissed off about the economics of some oil deals. Uh, we're going to drop nuclear bombs on you. Yeah. You come and fly some planes into our buildings. We're going to go and try to wipe your culture off the face of the planet for 15 years. And that's where we are right now. Yup. Get a freaking clue. Don't fuck with us. We get pissed off if you push this too far, that's pretty much it. You know, you got guys like this who are already in there just like listen man, bad decision. Yeah, it unfortunately you can see that because it is American because it's an isolated place and it's a very comfortable place to live and people are driving around, you know, while you were, you know, flying around on a, on a helicopter, getting ready to get inserted on a target, there was someone else flying around the mall and they're Cadillac Escalade, getting ready to go and buy some new, you know, apple software or hardware and that's their reality.

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       I mean they have no idea what that's like. So we do forget in America that what's happening, what can happen to us and the threats that are out there. We can forget about that very easily. And a lot of Americans do. I know a lot of Americans, I know Americans are listened to this podcast. They don't forget that. Then they know what we talk about it all the time. But there are Americans that have no idea. They live so isolated from the rest of the world that it just wait, the, the thought of going to war for them, it means going to the mall cause it doesn't change their life. It doesn't impact their life at all. I mean, we're here in California, you know, like the perceived Utopian know, like the Shangri la of the United States and just two hours north of year. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       Two radicalized fanatics, bring machine guns, automatic rifles or raw shot rifles and start mowing people down. So I think we're coming to a crossroad where people are going to either need to wake up and stop being pandered entitled Little Bitches. Um, or we may not have the same type of life and culture and opportunity that we've always claimed America to have and to be. Yeah. Uh, the key point of that being freedom and the freedom to move, the freedom to go to that ball. It's the freedom of all those things that we definitely take for granted because we've had it for over 200 years. If people forget what it's like to live in an oppressive society, they're gonna learn it here pretty quick. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's one of the best things that the military does for you is you get to travel with these all these other places in the world and see what the rest of the world lives like.

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       I caught a little flack from the Inter webs because I didn't mention that. Yeah. I know that there's other countries that are first world countries in Europe that are nice places to live too. I get that. But would that, they don't send us in the military to those places. We, you know, we don't get to go to the first world countries that are all nice. We go to horrible places where there's wars happening. And so that's our impression of the world a lot of times. And it's accurate because that's what most of the world alive is like. I got it. Germany's nice. Right. You know, but you said Belgium was really nice. We said it like from, you know, from the fifties until just, I don't know, about two months ago we were like, Oh man, they got great chocolate and she's and coffee, when is the last time you were in Belgium?

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       Right. Pretty Nice. Oh crap. They're pretty much breeding terrorists there. Yup. So shut your face if you're talking to Jocko about what the world actually is, and at the same time you, you talk about like where you don't get sent to the nice places and the people complaining they don't get sent to the bad place. Right. They don't go on a vacation to Liberia. Yeah. Yeah. So it happens. So yeah, they'll, of course they're all, hey, I, I've been all over the world to all this, all this horrors that you claim to have seen, you know, kind of ad. Obviously you don't say that, but I had a pretty good and balanced perspective. Like you live in San Diego, California, right. It's freaking gorgeous here. It's one of most beautiful places on the planet. It is. Yeah. You've been to some nasty places. Um, I think in like, if we're going to be like, oh, Yin and Yang and you know, balance of life and crap, um, with the amount of evil that you've seen, you've seen the sheer amount of BD, you know, he married the same woman, got a beautiful family, you know, you've been in, had an amazing career, run a great company.

Speaker 2:          00:12:05       Yeah. You saw horrible things too. But like if somebody's going to come and talk to us about our perspective on life, you know, and like, oh, you don't really understand if you, you know, if you spent time in France, like bitch, I have, first of all, second is I'm not talking about France, even though Paris just got their ass kicked and then the train, which would have been like a complete massacre. Oh, that would have been, um, yeah, I understand. And you don't understand until you've been with me too. Like Kazakhstan or the packy Afghany border. Shut your fucking face Jackie. Uh, okay. To cuss on here cause that was that. Sorry. You, you can, uh, you can swear if you feel the need to. I'll try not to. When I said I was running late, as I was walking out the hotel, uh, to come here, I got grabbed by some people and like, man, I'm getting some great feedback about your presentation yesterday. Did you know that you said Fuck 18 times? And I was like, I thought it's about 10 thank you. So is that a positive or negative feedback?

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       All in one of the podcasts we talked about swearing and we talked about it for like 17 minutes. Yeah, because, and my basic point was I try not to swear on the podcast. The reason I try not to is because this is going to be out there forever and it, my kids are going to listen to this and other humans are going to listen to this. And so I think, man, I'm going to try not to swear and I do swear sometimes, but I try not to, but sometimes it's needed and I believe in you let in the last statement it was needed. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       I'm going to also try not to agree, but sometimes you put the exclamation mark at the end of a sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       Sometimes it's needed, you know, sometimes it is. All right. Anything else on that? We're just kind of get warmed up.

Speaker 2:          00:13:55       I know. First question, we're just like, well I hate session begins at war for 15 years. Yeah. It

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       was a coming out of the gate strong. So getting into America a little bit. Next question. I love this country. Thoughts on current military law enforcement, self defense techniques and what you both would incorporate to make better? Hmm, that's a super broad question. You know, I'll narrow it down. Okay. And I've talked about it a little bit on the podcast, but you got cops, police who have a hard job. I'm miserable. Do you never do it? I'd be in jail. I could never do it. Never would want to do it. Would you say to me? Yeah dre. I mean just dealing with dealing with the dregs of society, you know, for 14 calls and then the 15th call, you're going to you some domestic violence. And I mean just, it's just a horrible hard job. And then you have these shootings where quote unquote innocent people get shot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       And sometimes they are. I mean I've seen some of these police shootings, there's no way I can approve it and I am all about killing bad guys and some of the shootings you just say man that comp and I and I always look at it the same way and I say that cop didn't have the training they needed and I, what really hurts is that I know how to train. I know what to do to make them better and get them better at that. I know you do. I don't have the money. They don't have the time. You don't have the money. They don't have the time. A lot of times they don't even have the experience within the department of someone that knows how to train people mentally cause that's what it is. It's mental preparation of getting someone ready to handle these scenarios because it's just an unknown scenario.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       That's what it is. And one of my worst examples is this guy pulls up to a seven 11 it's all, it's all body camera, the guys, the whole thing's on video. The guy gets a call, there's a guy with a gun and stuff. 11 pulls up in his cruiser, the seven 11 gets out of his car, sees a guy walking away, starts yelling at him. The guy's wearing a hoodie. The guy's walking away from him. He's the cops, yelled at him, freeze, freeze priests. That guy doesn't freeze and find these yelling at. He's standing the cops standing in a wide open, holding his gun out, you know, priests, priests, and finding. The guy turns around and looks at the cop, reaches his hands in his pockets. Boom, cops shoots him. Guy Falls down, falls the curb roles. He's on his stomach. Cop comes over, rolls over, starts to search him.

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       He finds, pulls his head, pulls his hood off. He's got headphones in, reaching in his pockets. He's got an iPhone on and he was just sitting there listening to music. Couldn't hear the cop turned around, reached in his pocket, turn off the iPhone and you know, the cop who got the call, there was a guy with a gun and it takes you reaching for a gun. Dustin guy died, bled out, and you can hear the cop. The cop felt horrible, you know, once he realized that, he's like, come on buddy, it's going to be okay. I'm gonna get you. You mean just like the classic things that I've know you've heard before of like, I want to save this guy's life and it's not gonna happen. And what I know is that that guy going into that situation from the get go, if you think someone's got a gun, don't stand out in the open and talk to them.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       Get behind cover and stand back and you, you'll stay behind your car, get on your cruiser, get on your loudspeaker and look at him and watch him and see what he's doing and see if there's a real threat. But don't expose yourself to by standing out in the middle of the open where if he does have a gun he's going to get yet. Yeah. And those are simple things that you know you could do to improve the training. What you have to do is you have to put people in stressful situations during the training and that's what we did in the seal teams. I know that's what you guys do in the SF is you get put in these horrible stressful situations where everything is getting destroyed. You're getting shot with paint ball and they're blowing smoke grenades up at all. Frags hit you. They do that in the trainings that when you get in combat, you're not freaked out and you can handle this situation train hard so you bleed less. You know, it's like, it's pretty simple. And uh, but we, we do

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       in Austin, we do a stress test a week. Sometimes it's barbell stuff on the range and kit where we're doing like Olympic lifts to a sprint and then you pick up your gun and shoot, um, or it slung and you do like a five mile run. And as soon as you step on the range, it's like 500 targets. You're just running down the line. Um, that's so, I know, and it feels normal for my heart rate to be pounding so that I can't hear anything besides my own beating heart in my ears, sweat dripping into my eyes, sweat dripping on my optics, my grip being jacked up because it's covered with sweat and you know, a little bit of blood cause I tripped and fell on my face, you know, like, and that seems normal. If I went to a range and shot in like a vacuum, you know, like where it's like air condition and like guys, like, all right, um, no, you can't shoot faster than one round a second and know drawing from the holster.

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       So let's just, you know, have a good time here. I would know what to do. I'd be like, this is really uncomfortable. Um, can somebody just start screaming at me and throwing something at me so I could just at least shoot, you know, 100%. Um, the training for that, my brother's a police officer. My Dad's a police officer. I went to the police academy in [inaudible] 99. Um, and how was astounded? I was a kid. I was 21 years old. I was astounded at how they were not prepared for anything. One was like, all right, how about this, all 20 of you try to get cuffs on me? Yeah. Didn't happen. No. Now my wrists were bloody, you know, I had a cough on my leg. I have one cop on my arm but I had like six or seven of them cuff together and there's like, there's like 18 or there's 12 of them yet left and they didn't know what to do.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       You know this is a 21 year old kid and it's not their fault. Just like you said, they just don't have the training. Yeah. With that said, if a cop tells you to get on the ground, get on the freaking ground, talk to them about it later and I get it. Like you're, you know the constitution so well and you're like the greatest lawyer about, you know, legal criminology, shut up, lay down and just figure it out later. Or have your lawyer do it. If you can't afford a lawyer, just have talked to sergeant afterwards. Yeah. Just give those guys more training. And you got to do the right kind of training. You got to do the, I think you got to do force on force, man on man training. And it was the last time that a municipal police department did a force on force training.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       You should be doing it all the time. All the time. Cause we even heard of a department doing it. That's horrible. Sim, Serta, whatever. I mean, whatever. Whenever you're going to use, you got to have people, humans, other humans that are maneuvering on you, that are reacting to you, that are drawing on you or they're not, or they're raising their hands or they're pulling out their cell phone or they're running scared. So when you did force on force in the seals, um, who do you use as your op for seals? See other CIS dude. And is there nothing better than,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I mean, who wants to win? Everybody. Everybody wants to win. So like we at Fort Bragg would use like 82nd airborne or would you use another SF group? Dude. And that's, I mean, if there are any second guy like this is their chance, they're going to do everything that they can to shoot an SF guy. You know, if it's a, if it's another SF guy, then the, the level of competition, that competitive nature like, oh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, we're going to do, I'm an amble Shum. We're going to crawl up into the ventilation and try to shoot him in the top of their heads from the, from the air conditioning. You know, they're like taking quickie saws and cutting the ventilation open. I mean it's gangster gangster and you know what? That's what's, what's great about that is guess what the enemy does. The same thing with the moves does, they're just not as good.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       They built false walls, they build trap trap doors. They do all that stuff. And I was, had a, had a group that was going through their land warfare training in the seal teams and they actually failed. And so we were retreading them make and go make them them go through it again, go through their FTX is their field training exercise, these big giant training exercises. We've all kinds of chaos and they were doing their first re retreads. They're trying to pass the exercise this time. And I go out there and I'm listening to their brief and I'm watching her duty to rehearsal and they get done with rehearsal and they all come together and the senior enlisted guys kind of putting out some word and he looks at me and he goes, Eh, Hey Jocko, do you got anything to say to these guys? And I wasn't really expecting it, you know, so I said, no, this is 40 40 man seal element. And I said, yeah, I got something to say. You guys are going to go out there against six other guys. There's 40 of you, you guys got machine guns, grenades, and there's 40 of you. I said, go out there. And when they start shooting at you hunt those motherfuckers down and murder them.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       And they're like, yeah. And so the troop walks away and they're all fired up. And then the, the senior enlisted guy in the senior officers standing there and they said, hey man, thanks for, thanks for, you know, getting her guys fired up. I think that really helped them out. And I said, you should hear what I'm about to go tell my guys, which was my guys that were to go against them because I would give my guys all kinds of rewards. Anybody that they could kill I, they would capture bodies. Anybody could get into perimeter. They would just completely what you're saying, they were just completely mud. Suck them, draw them into the most chaotic situations. And the point of all this conversation is that you're going against other human beings and other human beings that are going to do unpredictable things. And that's what makes the training challenging.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       And that's what makes life challenging. That's what makes these situations challenging in a real scenario is you don't know what these people are going to do. How many, how many times have you been dealing with some, you know, enemy or or unknown and you're like, what in God's name is this person doing Iraq or Afghanistan? I didn't, I didn't fight in Afghanistan. But in Iraq you'd be looking at someone going, Oh, this person is insane. What are they doing right now? Why are they doing that? They're going to die if they, you know, it's, it's

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       crazy. Yeah. That's the thing about humans is there humans, you know, there's like points of departure from logic, you know, and they live in chaos and some people can't even live without chaos. And then we're going into a place where cultures are different languages or different, you know, what is the norm is different and we're trying to enact what we think is normal. And they're like, Bro, you're, you're crazy. I'm like, no, no, you're crazy. I'm like, no, it's, yeah, it's all poor cops. Yeah. So, and you know what you can do if you're a cop though and you don't, you're forced doesn't have the money for this or they're not doing this. You can absolutely train. You can actually absolutely train in Jujitsu, in MMA, in fighting. So you get more comfortable and more confident in those situations. And the other thing I've said to do in the past, his man, yeah, I know it sounds lame, but watch some youtube videos.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       Watch some youtube videos of these, of bike. The thing that I just described, watch that youtube video and say, I watched youtube videos in combat and before combat, you know what I watched before youtube? I watch war movies, but documentaries. Yeah. So I could watch these guys in action and get, see what was happening in their faces because you can watch people on Youtube, watch these perpetrators and start to understand human nature better just by watching what they're doing. Just grow your mind, grow your brain a little bit. And if you wanna get better at shooting dry fire, yeah. I spend 90% of my, my practice time of shooting, um, without bullets in my gun, you know? And there's like a few grand masters that are out shooting me right now. Yeah. So dry fire. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       These are good questions. Yeah. The Internet, the Internet's going onto number three. This is not voting welfare time. Okay. For those of you that don't know, they recently removed bayonet training, dammit. Yeah, I know Tim. I'm sorry. But they removed bayonet training. What makes the Green Grass Crow? Do you know what makes the green grass go? Thought it was banned at Cheyney? No blood, blood, blood, blood. If blood blood. That's what it does. That's the motto. Okay. And so the question was, and I, I guess I put this in here just for entertainment value. Would you have kept bay in that trading in, that's the question. And it says w does it sell warrior spirit are not, um, Tim Kennedy your opinion, please. I don't even want to dignify this question with a response. I don't. Um, it's so infuriating. So yeah, I get it. We're not going to have bayonets on 80 fours.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       You know, we are in an army now that tactics are dictating that, that's not how we're going to train. With that said, during bayonet training, it doesn't give you a thirst for blood, but gives you an understanding of what war's like. And war is chaos. War is hell. War is ugly wars, disgusting wars, violent. Most of all, it's violent and bayonet training while you're running around a fixing your band net and show what makes the green grass grow blood but blood. Nick's green grass grow. Yeah, that sounds primal. It is primal wars. Disgusting. And you have to one, understand it. And maybe have trained in it so that you can appreciate what it's going to be like. So when you get there the first time you've seen crazy and chaos and anarchy and rage is there is not there. It's in training nuggets. That's pussy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       Exactly what we've just talked about. You know, it's exactly what we just talked about and the other, this is what that question happened made me do Tim crunched up is coconut water can ah, within the statement of that question. And the other piece of this is Tim said in that, I'll go ahead and call it a little bit of a rant. He said that war is crazy and chaotic and evil and disgusting and savage and in a way when you're in war you have to become that and you can't just become it from nowhere. You have to develop that mindset over time. Like I'm a bad ass. That's not how it works. It doesn't work that way. And so this type of training, which I would call primal, truly, even with people use that word all the time, primal, I'm actually using it in its in its proper terminology, usage, primal training.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       I'm taking a tool used to kill things and attaching it tool, a tool that's used to kill things. Um, so I can practice with a tool stacked on top of another cool tool about how to kill things. And then you're going to take that thing and you're gonna, you're gonna slam it into a thing that looks like a person. Yup. Upset to get him used to it over and over in your shoulders going to hurt and your hands are going to hurt, you know, and like you're going to have blisters and cut your hands up, up against your gun. He didn't realize you had to hold it that way and you're made to make the mental note that I'm not going to hold up against my shoulder at that time next time because I can't feel my shoulder. You know, like these are good lessons learned. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's keep the Bain at training, bring it back. Bring it back. Next question, can you instill the will to kill and the will to die in soldiers without a corollary? Nihilism. Yes. And we get a direct answer from Tim

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       [inaudible] movie.

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       The next question we had kind of already talked about it when we said, you know, in the contrast of things like your life I think is a personification of how to do that. You know, if you can't have beauty with, unless you know what ugly looks like. True. You know you can't have hot if you don't know what cold feels like. You can't have evil without good. And I don't think that you can teach people how to, let's say if we're just teaching everybody how to be like murderer killers, um, you know, soldiers that can just, we're not making robots. We're showing them how to do something and the reason that they can do it and not be complete psychopathic murderers. Occasionally one slips through. I'm not saying that, but not very often. It's because the humanity of us. Like what, what is the thing that's stopping us from killing, you know, Echo Charlie here cause I'm highly trained.

Speaker 2:          00:30:41       You are, um, you know, it's our humanity, you know, and that's an and my appreciation, my beautiful wife and my kids, you know, and Loving Austin, Texas and barbecue and motorcycles, like that's normal to me. So when I have to go and deploy and see disgusting things and you know, make mistakes like throwing grenades into a room with women and then having to live with that the rest of my life, the reason that I'm still saying is because I know what right is because of ethics and morality and humanity. So yeah, that's, that's how we, and you can do it. It's because guys, intelligent guys that, that end up in units like the ones that you were in can understand what the difference is.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       Yes. Yes. And I think that, I think that this is something new that is, again, referring back to the culture of America that a lot of people starts to slip away. But, but you gotta remember those 2000 men that lined up in rural California? Sure. So, sure. There was a little handful of them that were like, oh cool, I'm going to go kill some people. But there was a lot of people that saint hammer to go out and protect freedom. And so I think it's not only something that you instill in, you work on through the training and like through the training that we just talked about of stabbing or shooting man shape targets or even better when you're using simulation. I mean you're shooting at other people. It instills in you that you can do that. But I think the values, the American values that we're taught as people growing up in this country are they do respect life. They do respect freedom and the the right for the pursuit of happiness. The things that you just talked about, barbecues, motorcycles, wife, kids, those are things that we respect.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       And I'm sure you've been in the situation. I know I've been in it many, many times of where you're taking the, the man from the house, either you killed them or you're taking them away. Yeah. And he's not going back and he's not going back. That's one of those things where, you know, as just as a, as a person you're looking at, you're looking at the wife and kids and you know, you're kind of thinking yourself, well, you know, you married the wrong guy, but you do feel bad for them. Absolutely. I mean, Hey, sorry, you're, you're one of the most beautiful kids on the planet. Your Dad's not coming back. Oh, your dad did the wrong thing. But that dad would also hide behind those kids were in a ball on that. Absolutely. Strap a bomb to him himself. Absolutely. It's not the same type of human note that it's not, you know, we are, it's not, it's absolutely not.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       And that was one of the most, that was the APP. That was absolutely one of the most disturbing things that, that my guys would have to deal with, was it surgeons using kids as shields and thank God I had some really good snipers that were able to kill guys that were literally using kids as human shields. Yeah. We had a guy walking towards us wearing a bomb vest and we were using thermal imagers and he had his kid in front of him and he was trying to cover, because we heat signature. He was trying to cover himself so we could get close enough and he's holding his kid out. Like, take my kid, take my kid. And the only reason was he was trying to cover the distance so he could hurt us with his bomb vest, which had glass and shrapnel and nails and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       Yeah. So period. His body, who's going to use the bodies of water? Impulse charge. Um, so no, it's not naive that I'm saying they're not the same humans as us. They're not, they do not fit for me to see their same human, you have to have the same value for human life. Um, when you, when I watch marines jump on top of Afghan and Iraqi kids trying to protect them from a bomb going off, not using the kid as a bomb jumping on top of, they're not American kids. These are marines or navies or army guys jumping on top of local kids. Indigenous kids to save them different understanding of what humanity is. Yeah. So we get it. Your question. Great question. You can do it. Yep. And you can definitely, and we have done it as a nation and we are doing it and we are continuing to do it. I don't think we've had a stronger military, um, ever guys coming out of 15 years of war. The experience and the training, um, while we have been shrinking for the past five years, money wise, it's given us a, we've had to fight wars the war differently and now, now I don't think there's, I'm talking like Spartan Samurai or even the World War Two era America. Like that's the type of generation of warriors that it's small. It's like 0.5%. Um, but they're, they're, yeah, yeah, no doubt.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       Next question. Number five. Exactly. How much better our green berets then the seals at what

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       I think we have to the first just like me at, at, you know, 21 years old. I didn't understand the difference. Um, so every special mission unit has a pretty well defined mission and all of them are different. Um, I would never want to get in a gunfight with a bunch of navy seals on a boat, anywhere near the water. I mean, within like miles of water, it would be, it's just a catastrophe. Um, I also don't think that there's any been on the planet besides special forces that can do a force force multiplier. Like weekend. You can take 12 of us, you can drop us in Venezuela, leave us there for six months. And we probably overthrew the government and place the president, the new president in place and running the economics, the Wa, the power plants, the commerce, um, transportation. And like each of us, the 12 of us, uh, have like married at least four or five Venezuelans. It'd be like, that's, that's, people don't understand like why we have to speak other languages, why we have to go through economic and, um, you know, geopolitical classes. It's because we're different, you know, like the missions are different. What we're supposed to do is different. Um, and because of a different mission, we end up with different products and those products are a groups of dudes that are the baddest dudes. The planet on the planet

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       for what they have to do. Yeah, and I mean I left that question in there for a couple of reasons. Number one was because it was, I thought it was kinda funny whoever wrote whoever wrote that at a sense of humor and you know the real question, you know, which is still, to me it was just about really defining and I'd, I'd say the exact same thing that you'd say, I would add this to it, you know? Yes. You know, you look at Rangers, you look at seals, you look at Greenbrae, you, you look at Mar soc and everyone's got their own little specialty of what they're really good at and as a whole they'll, there'll be better at that than the other group. And then within the seals, within the rangers, within the, within SF you got different levels of guys that are in there.

Speaker 1:          00:38:23       I know you probably worked with some seals that you thought, what are these guys? And you probably work with some guys that will, you said, damn, I'd love to love to work with those guys. And same thing with me. I've worked with some SF guys that I, to myself, man, these guys are just, these guys are unbelievable. I would do anything for these guys. And sometimes you look at and you go, oh, I wonder how these guys make it through. You get to teams, I get to teams that'd be like, did you really pass selection dude, that's one thing that's really hard for the American public to understand is that there is, and I've explained this a bunch of times on the podcast, that there's a bell curve. Just like any other organization. There's the top guys that are, you know, bad, totally bad ass guys.

Speaker 1:          00:39:02       It just made it through. And then there was a bunch of guys in the middle that are totally solid guys that get it done all the time. And then there's a bunch of guys that just, they barely got through and they skate and that's, you know, that's part of the way it is. But one thing I can tell you for sure is the special operations community. I don't limit my respect for the special operations community alone. For me working with the army, the conventional army guys, the Marine Corps, marines, I, they're always good. They're always good. They're there consistently. Your rifle company. Awesome. Can I please work with you? Because you just wanted like a bunch of pit bulls. They'd been like locked up in a cage and they just get prodded every once in a while and maybe they go into like tear something apart and they get thrown like some raw meat and I call this just good, you know, do I get it?

Speaker 1:          00:39:49       What do I, where do I get to kill to get another piece of this meet? The Marine Corps really is an outstanding organization and then there's units within the army that are unbelievably just squared away professional, and they have a heritage behind them of glory, for lack of a better word. And so I'm a huge fan of the entire military of the entire US military. It'll be like you, are you proud to be a seal? Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah. I'm proud of proud to be a green baret when army plays Navy, like I don't know crap about football, you know? But I'm like, go just for crying out loud, beat navy for once in this decade or damn near century. To be honest with you, I literally don't care. And the biggest, when we were in Ramadi working with the army and with the Marine Corps, those guys, the sacrifices that they made were so they were so just impressive date day what these guys did and you know we had, of course we do have better training, we do have better gear and yet those Marine Corps platoons and companies would be out there doing, I mean they're, first of all, they're living in the city.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       You know, we're going back to a little fog. We got a little bit of video games and internal walls. Huge walls. Great Gym. Yeah, protein powder. Exactly. Those guys don't do any of that. They don't have any of that. We airdropped a pallet of porn and protein to a fire base that a bunch of marines that like saved our lives when we were like knocking on their gate at two o'clock in the morning where we weren't, we were like 200 meters away and we didn't want them all to murder us and they were going to like, please let us

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       in. Um, our air won't come pick us up. And we got in there like, you guys haven't eaten t rats and they're like, Yay, we've been pretty much a gun fight every single night. And you're like, yeah, they were taking you guys, carry you guys. God bless all of them. No doubt about that. Next question, we'll American Roe, that's rules of engagement continue to become more bureaucratic and cumbersome or will the u s regained the will to win? Ah, ah. First of all, the guys there have the the will to win and they'll, they'll wait to tell people, shoot at them. Not like, not like near them like you, like as the Roe is. Um, not like it used to be. If somebody shot and you heard the gunshot, that's like getting shot at, but now we have to be able to actually say that we were shot at, that's like bullets snapping past your head.

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       Like that's hearing the Wiz and then the crack that's close. That's what we pretty much have to have. Um, Roe. So, so just let me put some context around that because we don't have, not everyone that listens. This is in the military. Let me put some context around what Tim just said. That's freaking ridiculous. That means you're waiting until you're about to get killed before you take action. If you're waiting for rounds, because when rounds are snapping over your head that that means you're, you're under suppressive fire just about, you can no longer maneuver. So this is like waiting until for a civilian. This is waiting until the knife is at your throat before you decide to defend yourself. That's, that's what Tim's talking about. Yeah. It'd be like a salesman being like your commission based salesman and you see a potential client come in, but you're not allowed to engage him.

Speaker 2:          00:43:25       You're not allowed to. You actually have to wait, let him pick up the product and then walk over to you and ask if he can buy it and almost have the customer be walking out the door. Had he already set the product down right before you're allowed to talk to him, that's when you're allowed to engage him. Does that make sense from a sales perspective? Yes. That does echo Charlie wisdom thrown down. I'm so not good. Not Good. Uh, we'll see. First of all, the rules of engagement, there are not going to be the same here. So I think some places like Afghanistan and Iraq have been capitalizing on and now Syria on our rules of engagement. I know Africa is Africa is like, okay, we know the Americans are only allowed to go to the last concealed cover position and they're not allowed to directly engage in less.

Speaker 2:          00:44:20       They have been actively fired. So they'll be like, oh, there's the Americans over there. We're not going to shoot at them so they can't shoot back. We'll just kill all the Africans who they're there to help. They're like intentionally doing this and they're pretty clever about it. The book of Romp. Um, but then right now with the radicalized cells here, the fanatic Muslims that think that they're going to come here and be able to do that node, Bro, remember Pearl Harbor, remember the Alamo, remember nine 11 shit will be different if you think you're going to come here and play around Roe

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       will not exist. Nope. No, not here.

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       Don't, don't, don't.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       There's a lot of political correctness that steer stuff from time to time gets people killed. It does. It does. You know, one of the things that's coming up a lot in the news right now, and we got asked them questions about it, is women women coming into combat roles inside the military, which, you know, first of all, credit to the women that have served in the wars. And I've seen women, I've seen women in Ramadi rolling out on Cassie facts to go out and help my guys. Yeah. God bless him. Fearless, fearless, brilliant, awesome. Totally capable of their respective jobs. Full credit. And then there's a limitation in my opinion as to where you would want to intentionally assigned women too,

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       is that women could do that. We could never do that is true. I'm in South America. I want to get some Intel. I can go into a bar and work it for a month before I get one informative. I just spent, you know, $20,000 of taxpayer dollars. Yeah. You stick girl in there an hour. Yep. Has, she has 10. She like, you suck, you suck, you suck, you suck. You suck. I'm awesome at this. I'm just put a hundred pounds on her back and throw out of the back of an airplane. I love women.

Speaker 3:          00:46:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       Their legs are going to break. Yeah. It's a, just a biological factor of what is it? Muscular skeleton. Anatomy. Anatomy. There you go. Thank you. And uh, they're built differently and thank God they're built differently cause I could never give birth know, eat their way. Tell her that I are there. We are like what? What right now is like the, you know, we were talking about at the pinnacle of exercise. Uh, well, one really good way to judge would be the crossfit games. Very well rounded athletes that have to have strength, endurance, agility, et cetera. And are there different standards for men and women? There are different standards for men. Water. Yeah. So are we going to have different standards in let's say special forces selection? I would hope not. Okay. So if we had the same standard, um, you had given an example of the crossfit games.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       Yeah, I mean it was, it was interesting. I was watching the finals of the crossfit games. It was last year I think. And the event the made, the finals men went first, it was 10 guys or something and they came out in the first they had to do multiple physical activities. The first one was a pegboard link. What you had, it was her heart. Yeah. There are the wrestling room. They had him in the wrestling room. You had him in school and you couldn't go home until you did it. And this one was, I want to say it was 15 feet tall. So it's a pretty tall pegboard and they had to sell. The guys come out, they have to go up a peg board and back down. They get done with that. They have to jump on a, on a rower and row a certain amount of calories and they got hers.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       Then they moved down the line and they're picking up and cleaning. I think they are cleaning or cleaning and jerking weights that were increasing in weight as they went towards the end and there was a 10 minute maximum time to complete this evolution. So the guys come out, boom, they go, they all go hard. It's hard. They climbed the pegboard, they come down the road, the road, they lifted weights, they're done. Everybody finishes. They give the guy in the first place. Okay, cool. Then it's the girl's term and the, and they have it set up for the girls. They're doing the same thing. They make the weights a little bit lighter, but they have the same basic concept and the girls come out and these girls, they look as big and strong as I do or you do, and I'm not kidding. These girls are beasts.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       They're amazing across. The athletes are beautiful and they come out and out of the eight or 10 girls that goes into the first thing and hits the pegboard, only one of them can make it up. They're tough. And the other seven or eight or nine athletes can't even get up it. And then the girl, it took her so long to get up the peg board that when she got to the roller, she was exhausted. She got done with the rower and she didn't complete the rest of the course because she ran out of the 10 minute time limit. Yeah. And to me, I'd never really had thought too much about the physicality. I always figured, you know what? You get a girl that's in good enough shape. Maybe they could make it through some of the training that is required for special operations. But when I saw that, it really did leave an impact on me mentally of how different it is.

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       And I'll tell you another thing. I was at my gym several years ago and I hadn't rolled with a girl, a Jujitsu for a long time. Right. Maybe played around and all of a sudden we had a girl that was coming into town that was a, a black belt in Jujitsu and was a multi time world champion and great technique. And, and so I said to me when I was going to run, so we were on the mat and she's like, you know, hey, you want a role? And in my mind I thought to myself, okay, you know what? I got to bring my a game right now. Yeah. I mean this girl's a world champion. She's not a small girl, you know, I mean, she's 160 165 pounds. And you know, if you make a mistake against 165 pound black belt, you're going to tap. That's it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       So I say to myself, you know what, I gotta, I gotta be careful. I've got to kind of bring my a game here. And we shook hands. And as soon as I like grant and was g, as soon as I touched her g and she touched mine, I just realized there's no way that she could ever submit me. Yeah. I mean, unless I just was completely, it just wasn't going to happen because she just didn't have, she just doesn't have the strength. Yeah. Well, I want to talk about that. Um, you know, how long have you been doing martial arts school? 20 something years. I was just talking about this the other day. Like we can within a second of touching somebody, have an idea about what they can do. I mean, within seconds, like this isn't just like you, you know, in this misogynistic, sexist way.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       Um, we're all in with his girl. Um, she doesn't have a chance after I touched her, that's not what it was. This, this is like one of the best grapplers on the planet and a navy seal and amazing black belt and an instructor that legitimately had the row, the revelation, like realized that this isn't possible. Yes. And Actually Echo, you described a story last week. The first time he ever, he was a white belt and the first time I ever trained with Dean lister, as he said, as soon as he touched him, as soon as you locked up with him, he goes, Oh shit. I can't do anything. It's this guy. And so I failed to mention that, that yes, when you're a grappler, as soon as you tie up with someone second you go, Oh, oh, this is gonna be tough. This guy doesn't really know anything.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       You even know things like, Hey, I've got to watch out for this guys, you know, head position or he's really good. You can feel all that just by a clinch. Yeah. And so, yeah, that's what I, so I should've stated that, but as soon as I made contact with her, I said to myself, wow, I was, uh, I was mistaken because this is no factor. So let's say one in a thousand women could make it through one of our respective selections, um, which I think might be a little unrealistic. Honestly, I'm thinking more of like one in 5,000 could, could do it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       That still doesn't mean that they should be there. I'm not saying they shouldn't or they should. We have to see what it can't be is dictated that we have to do it. And then second, we can't change anything. Otherwise it undermines the entire idea of being special. If you have a special unit and there's a special requirement to be there, that requirement has to stay the same. If you're going to then change that requirement, you've then changed the unit and then you've undermined the woman earning her chance to be there. It's going to change the chemistry. It's going to change how the team is going to function. Um, not for the worse, not for the better. We just don't know what that's going to be. Yeah. And it's not just, first of all, it's not just special operations. It's not just military. I mean it's any job that requires physical strength.

Speaker 1:          00:53:53       That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about physical strength. And if you can't maintain, if you can't do what the job requires, if you're a firefighter and you can't pull yourself up a ladder with Karina, uh, 80 pound rope on your back or 80 pound hose on your back, you shouldn't be able to have that job. And yeah, so it's just one of those, it's one of those really tough things because, hey, I got, by the way, I got three daughters, right? I got one son and three daughters. Believe me, I want my daughters to be successful and I want whatever, have every opportunity they possibly can. But I'll tell you what, something else I do not want. My daughter's going onto the battlefield. If they can't pull one of their buddies out from the street, if they're, if they've been shot. How much do you weigh?

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       230 pounds. So you way to 65 to 70 with kid on, oh, more than that. Yeah. Our kids gotten lighter. Okay. So like my, my plates, um, my first deployment or 24 pounds, now they weigh five pounds. The whole thing, like the actual Bot just to place. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, so you're saving, you're saving off, torn on tears in there. Okay, nice. Just stuff's getting lighter. Nice. Yeah. But they're not going to pick up 285 pounds and I'm can happen. It's not going to happen. I'm normally a 220 pound guy and I love, I'm a Garan grenade carrying maniac. So while my kid is normally like 20, 30 pounds, I had didn't have a backpack with like 20 grenades. Cause sometimes I'm like I'm going to Flash Bang this room. And sometimes I'm like, I'm going to Frag it cause I don't want to deal with sin side.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       You know, you get guys like you and I appreciate when someone like yourself takes a certain artistic perspective when it comes to combat and you say to yourself, you know what? These little fragmented aids, I liked them. I like what they do. They're so little, they're so mean. They're so little and they're so brave. And I liked that. I like, I like people that have that artistic expression that they utilize it combat to express themselves. It's a beautiful thing. So for an opportunity, but that's, that's the uh, that's the political correctness and bureaucracy, bureaucracy in the military. Not a good thing. Geez. Here's another one. How do you stay positive?

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       Having seen the absolute worst in humanity? No Man. Easy. I have a beautiful Brunette. I'm going to do a huge alliteration here. Beautiful Brunette busty babe that's banging in the bikini that will drink bourbon with me. Boom. Yeah, boom. Yeah. Nice. Um, so yeah, I have heard kids in women's scream that I threw a grenade into the room. They're having their dad shoot from, um, get nightmares from it. Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:01       Yeah. I've seen doc donkeys go down wells because the village lied to us. Yeah. I've watched bombs get dropped on entire villages where I knew that there are people like not bad people. They were good people, near bad people and watched the all the buildings crumble. Um, I love life. I love my wife. I love my kids. I love a sunset. I appreciate art. I play the piano. I wish I could appreciate beer. Don't have a palate for it. But like everything about life is that much sweeter because I know how nasty and ugly it is. And if at any point, I forgot why I fight and I forgot what Wright was and I forgot, um, what humanity is, I'm done. The moment where I was like, I want to go kill something. I'm good at it, I'm good at war, there's nothing else I'm good at.

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       And there's that temptation because you're good at something. You want to go do more of it to go and spend time doing that. If I ever had that, well that realization that I'm actually doing that, I'm done. I turned my gun in, I'd go be a salesman, I tried sell Kias, I don't care. Now that I'm talking smack about Tia Kias, I'm just, or a Hyundai whatever. And this is a subject that comes up that I think people want to understand in the civilian world. And you've definitely nailed a perspective that I think most guys feel. And I would say on top of that is that war wallet does expose you to the worst part of humanity in my mind. For ever. I W I don't think I will ever see anything as moving or as beautiful as

Speaker 4:          00:59:08       men

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       rolling out into a horrible place day after day, night after night, risking their lives directly, indirectly

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       for their country, for the civilians that are there that they're trying to protect and for each other. Yeah. And to, to go to memorial service after memorial service and realize that these are, and again, you know, I always try and remind everybody that listens to this, that when I say memorial service, I'm not talking about a dog tag and some body in a uniform. I'm talking about a kid talking about person and a person that sacrificed everything in, in everything, everything they are and everything they ever will be. And so yes, war, we'll show you the worst part of humanity. But that right there is an incredible part of humanity. And I don't care about the politics of it, I don't care about any of that. But you're talking about men that will give their lives for their friends. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       And when I have that in the back of my mind, then that makes it very easy for me to stay positive. Very easy for me to wake up in the morning and say, I'm going to do my damn this today to live a good life. Yeah. And do some good things and trying to honor those guys.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       So I don't think war makes you worse. I think war makes you better.

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       No services. Those memorials. They're not like just some dude had a, a young, a young guy and his wife was like, you know, why don't you bring them back to me? You know, do you want, it's like to lose him, you know? Do you know what we had? You know, you didn't know him. I was like, bitch, please. I didn't. I sat there and took it, you know, like what do you, what do you think we sit there and talk about as we're staring at a tree for 12 hours. Yeah. You know, I know what your farts smell like woman, you know, I know what his favorite panties were on you. You know, I know every single kid name of it all through your kids when their birthday is, you know, you don't think, you think you know him better than I know him. How much time did you spend with them in the past five years? You know, day and night, 60 hours straight taking his blood, you know, being covered in it. Like we know like this isn't just some memorial, you know, did the sacrifices that you're talking about? Yeah, it's, there's a different level of, you know, we're talking about intimacy, the brothers and when we say it's about the dude standing next to us, it's the, it's not just subdued, you know, it's not some cliche line in a movie. Yeah. Like these are dudes when we say would die for him, it's for a reason. It's because we've no, it never known somebody that close and never will forever and they're the best dudes on the planet.

Speaker 3:          01:02:49       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       you're right over there. Echo Charlie. Yes. Getting heavy for sure. But kind of used to it though for sure. Used to do when he starts talking I'm just like what is the next word? There's too much space cause I can't take it anymore. Shit.

Speaker 3:          01:03:10       Yeah. All right,

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       let's bring it back to you a little bit. I won't say it later question, but a little bit of a, of an easier question. If a non fighter wants to learn physical self defense, where and how can they start? First of all in your head, stop calling yourself a non fighter, whatever that is. Every bore, every dude that comes out of the vagina and in my opinion has the capability to be a fighter if he just so chooses to be. And I think every dude is a fighter. So first turn the switch on. Stop being a pussy. All right. Sorry. Go ahead. No, that's actually a factual information. Or men are predators were predators. Yeah, we've got the dates right here. The eyes, our eyes are in the front of our head. Right? Thought other than the top or the side. They're not on the side over here. We're watching out for the attack or the Predator. The Predator. Yeah. So you're, you are correct. I can see wait right here. I can't even see what's right here.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       I turned my head, so yeah, that's okay. That's good. Start with a mindset. Where are you going from there? Um, so w you're asking the question. It's really, to me, just a choice. Anything's better than nothing. And then of the whatever that anything is, then there's degrees of better. There's, I don't think there's like a right or wrong, you know, you could do Krav Maga, you could do Muay Thai, you can box, you can do Jujitsu. Hell, crossfit has self defense now, but anything is better than nothing. But then the degrees of what that is get, you know, I think a little bit better for me, the foundational martial arts are always the best to start wrestling, boxing, Muay Thai, Jujitsu. Yep. You know, you, you step up a against a guy that has a little bit of knowledge in any one of those therapy in the ass and let alone if he has a little bit in all of them or he's really good at one of them. In this case you're asking by, he'd go into sleep. Yup. Yup. Or you've, you've heard me say the same exact thing actually. Yeah. Do you do too?

Speaker 1:          01:05:19       I would say start with Jujitsu. Uh, the reason is you already have a natural defense for someone trying to strike you. And that is runaway. You know, if someone said, if you're coming at me and you, you got a knife or whatever, I'm going to run from you. Yeah. It's okay. It's defense. I'm being defensive. I'm running away from you. That sucks. No, no. I'm saying like if somebody came 100% green with you, I was like, hey bro, give me your wallet. And just like gotta catch me first. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Travels a few [inaudible] have to defend yourself is if I grab a hold of you and now you've got to know how to grapple some kind of grapple, right? You gotta be able to get out of that. And so that's why I say start with Jujitsu and then for me boxing only because I think it's easier to learn than when we tie failing and you want to learn a little bit of basic striking and then moy, Tai and wrestling, I mean, you can just get, start getting into them too.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       But there's the, the beautiful thing is in America right now, there's all these places to train. There's a Jujitsu school and every, every city, every quarter. I mean I live in San Diego, so I guess it's actually completely out of control here. I could have taken you on a tour of like 74 totally legit to do Jitsu places in San Diego and now they all have Moitai. They all have boxing, all that. I mean everyone's doing everything. Yeah. And so what do you think about like the self defense oriented martial arts? So would you be talking about like Krav Maga? I think those are good augments. So I, I think once you have a base of Jujitsu, boxing, wrestling and Muay Thai, then I think cool now learns from Krav Maga because they're going to start looking at weapons or start looking at knives. I think it's good, but I think from the beginning I would rather invest my time in the, the big four.

Speaker 1:          01:07:04       Yep. I understand. Agree to get the foundational pillars. Right, right. Then you can build anything you want on that. Speaking of that, there's someone that asked about SD response. I'd like to hear more about SD response and if Jocko is going to be involved at lunch today, he took me to barbecue and I was like, dude, you have to come to one of these. She's like, I do these. And I was like, I know, but ours are filing in Texas, you know? Then when we're done we'll hop in a helicopter and go play. You got you lowered me down to Texas like 47 times today. It's going to happen as shit. Like everything. I like food shooting, working out Jujitsu machine guns. I mean, yeah. I said I might not come back once I get down there and we'll, we'll take a camera and we'll fill most of it and you're going to see Chaco, like we're going to hook him into the side of a little bird. And um, so people get mad sometimes when I talk about hunting, you know, until you, um, come and do it. Shut your face. Um, the farmers, their pay us to either exterminate the animals or I we've used when you're going to come and stay at my house, yeah, we're gonna eat elk. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       we're going to eat bison. You know, we're gonna eat some remarkable bear. Nice. And, um, not a lot of wild pig because the pig, their tastes like toilet. Um, well I get mad when you talk about hunting because I want to be doing it instead of you. Ah, tell you that. Talk about, talk about, because the people, the people that might not know about the SD response thing, the sheepdog response sheepdogs, it's all about, um, so sheepdog, it was a phrase coined by, um, Colonel Grossman, and he used it as this metaphor that, um, you've got the sheep, which is like the normal people and they just kind of cruise around eating grass and living their lives and they're naive about the predators that are out there. Then you have the wolfs and those are the things that want to get the sheep grass doesn't taste good when he got canines, the using your hair.

Speaker 2:          01:09:14       And, um, so the wolves want to eat the sheep and there's nothing that would stop them. And this is in the reality of kind of, I think the millennial generation is we've got a bunch of sheep. Um, well I mean if like the sheep war really tight pants, flannels had beards and never carried an axe before. Didn't know how to change your oil, didn't know how to break down a gun, didn't know how to clean an animal, let alone kill it. Um, if those were the sheep, then that's what we have. The thing that separates them is the sheep dog and the sheepdog is genetically more similar to the wolf than anything else. It has the same natural instincts. Um, the only differences that it likes sheep not dead or blood in their mouth. It likes keeping the sheep alive. Um, so that's what sheepdog is. We give people skills to make them be the hardest person somebody ever tries to kill. So if you're going to go and get in a gun fight with somebody that's come from a sheepdog course, you better be damn good. If you think you're going to go hands on and start tussling with a guy that, or a lady that's finished sheepdog better plan on it being bloody and violent. Cause when they come and they way they finish that course, we have requirements for you to finish that course. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       people are afraid of their own blood, but not one of our students. They've seen it, they've seen it on top of the person that they're training with, you know, um, and it's not this frightening thing. It's like cool. The fight just got started. Uh, so that's what it is. It's, um, we are putting confidence and technique and skills into people about being hard to kill. Yeah. And I took a look at some of the videos and stuff and it's something that people have been actually asking me for and I'm in the process of setting it up. But I think

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       that the videos I saw looked awesome and you know, anybody that can get to one of those courses no matter where you are, cause it's the, it'll cover anybody on the spectrum. Right. Like I could go and I'm going to get something out of it. Yeah. Andy, someone on the complete other end of the spectrum like echo could go. Not True.

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       Can I bring guys like Jake signs? Alex Acosta. Um, Tim Bhutto, Blake Hays. So just in that group we have a couple of professional competitive shooters. Um, so every time I do one, you're getting better. I'm getting better. Yeah. Like I'm trained with Alex Acosta. Right. But my point was you have, you have women that ever shot a gun before in that classroom. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. And you both are first. We've only done two civilian classes. We'd been doing military and law enforcement for a minute and we're like, man, we, we, it's unfair in this society that we're at now. It's sad that we have to give, like we see the things that, you know, I think it would be a huge disservice for you not to share the wisdom like you do, um, to a society that is now vulnerable. So that, that was like, it's selfish for us not to do this.

Speaker 2:          01:12:25       And it's, I think inhumane. So when our first two civilian courses, both courses had people that had never shot a gun before. Now I'm not encouraging you to come to a sheepdog course if you've not ever shot a gun before. Cause it ends up being a huge, um, painted them but for us, because then don't have to put somebody with you the whole entire time. And that instructor could have been used to help other people get better. So it's a little bit shallow, selfish. So if you're gonna come to a shoot course, I'm not going to say no. You know, you got to learn this stuff to say alive. You have people on trains that just walk out of bathrooms with machine guns. They w they go do a Christmas party in San Bernardino and start mowing people down. Like this is a different era, right? Like we can't, we can't.

Speaker 1:          01:13:09       And and the, and the cops and law enforcement cannot be everywhere all the time. And the, what's the average response time in America for minutes? Six minutes. And that's if you're in like a night in a city with a lot of cops in it, you go out to some rural area. Yeah, you're talking days. We're talking like 20. Yeah. So you are like it or not. Here's the reality. You are your first line of defense and you might be your only line of defense. So invest in yourself and learn some skills.

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       Have you got money and you're going out there and you're buying a $2,000 gun. Don't buy a $600 gun and then come spend 1400 bucks and train with you. You know, cool and play jockey. You know like you, you need, you need a $500 gun and $100 site until you get to a pretty high level, you know, like stop wasting your money,

Speaker 1:          01:14:04       get the skills, get the skills. What I think that thing a sound awesome and I'm sure I'll be doing something with it. Having my good times. Okay. Next question for both of you. I would like to know the most influential book and why the, you've got many influential books. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:14:29       Yeah, I mean one book, I think the idea of always searching for knowledge is more important than the actual single book. I mean I read, right now I'm reading this book on the war of electricity. It was AC versus DC. Huge Electric Chair. Yeah. It's a great story. Like it's a great story. It's almost split the nation. Yeah. They're like direct, current or alternate current, but w direct current, so much more powerful because I can take a little bit, uh, 12 volts and I can kill an elephant, but it takes 120 volts to do the same thing. So, you know, Edison, you know, he put it, he backed the wrong thing and he was too proud to admit it. Um, and so I'm learning a ton one about maybe putting your belief in the wrong thing and how you had, how damaging it can be, um, and how much damage you can do it if you're that fix gold stubborn, you know, or just set in your ways and how important it is to be able to always be a fertile soil that searching for more nutrients. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       there's, there's no doubt about that. And I think that that's one thing that's been common out of this podcast is I got soaked cause I review books on the podcast and I get all these people now tell me, read this book, read this book. I'm reading more right now than I did when I went to college and I was an English major in college. I got people who just sent, I'm getting books, I'm getting books in the mail. Oh, somebody want a troopers. Just sent me a lone wolf. He's like, Hey, I sent you a book. This is two volumes, so 700 pages each. I said, man, that's going to be on my list, but that's going to be a brutal read. I mean that's going to be heavy, but yeah, absolutely. Reading all the time, uh, is what it definitely happened to me. I know, we know echo has been on a reading rampage, big time, direct result of the podcast. A nice story. Anybody adding been asked this question? I, there's only one book that I refer to all the time as the most influential book I've ever read, which is about face by Colonel David Hackworth. And I've read it many times and I always go back to it because it's a great book about a war in leadership and that's why I read it all the time. But I got it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       Stack of books to read fiction ever. Barely. So I actually read, I split my time between fiction and nonfiction and I get a ton. I love, especially in the Times that we're in right now. I'm reading like French Revolution era stuff. I love learning about the why of the thing. You know, why countless times the French people over through the government why they went and they started beheading the rich class, um, why they went and hung or then built the GTA, or if there's the why of the thing, not the, how I get that, you know, and whether it's like Alexander Dumas or Victor Hugo, you know, it's like, um, I get a lot out of that. And then I also get a ton of wisdom, you know, when I'm reading like the Count of Monte Cristo, when that priest was digging with, um, you know, who would then in the metamorphosis as he's crawling through those tunnels and emerges then as the count, the amount of wisdom that, that, that, that priest gave him about ruling government's.

Speaker 2:          01:18:11       Um, I look at that for our government right now, right. And it's profound. So, um, I don't limit myself while I love reading nonfiction and learning, you know, like, I like the book I'm reading right now. Uh, all based in real fact, marketing, science, engineering. Um, I love going back and it's not, it's not brain candy, you know, it's not, I'm just sitting here chewing on, you know, some crap. Uh, did I get any reading romance novels I get a lot from, so I split my time between fiction, nonfiction, 50, 50. Yeah, I don't. And I sometimes I'll try, look, somebody will tell me about a great fiction book. Yeah. And I might give it a try, but in my perspective, you know, you're talking about the, what was the why I always like to figure out, like when I read about war, I like to think about the psychology of what's happening with the guys, especially from a leadership and a follower perspective of what guys were thinking. Because that to me it was always the most fascinating thing about what was going down was we got to get all these guys to do this. Or my boss is trying to get me to do that. And how does that work in these most intense scenarios? So from Tim Kennedy, get out there and read.

Speaker 4:          01:19:38       Next one,

Speaker 2:          01:19:40       love to hear Tim's thoughts on combatives how grappling changes in full kit with multiple people, et cetera.

Speaker 4:          01:19:46       Hmm hmm. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       Uh, it doesn't change and you know, like the basic fundamentals of how to punch somebody's remains the same. You give, so like the bodies to me as a chassis, right? It doesn't matter what you put on me, you can give me more or you can take away less. My, this chassis is still a killing machine right now. The only thing that changes is my lethality. The type of damage that I can do. Um, there's like a Honda Civic, right? Just it can go fast or it can run down the road and gets 38 miles to the gallon. Right. But you can change out the exhaust or you can put some nitrile or you can put in some wheels, you know, eventually what was just a vehicle that could drive down the road, can drive down the road kind of fast. So it's just a basic chassis that you can expand or detract from.

Speaker 2:          01:20:38       So this chassis, this particular one, um, so I don't normally head, but people, if I'm wearing an ops core helmet, I'm ahead button machine. I was like, what'd you say to me? Headbutt you know, and I was like, oh yeah, we're gloves that have like carbon fiber across the knuckles, brings the bitch slapped back, you know, like, no. Again, I'm not being a misogynist. I do not encourage people to ever bitch slap. And I realized that's a sexist term. But if I ask you question and you lied to me, know that I want to hurt you in the first place. I believe the politically correct term is the Stockton slap. This talks to slap the back of the pimp slap. Okay. Um, or maybe more. So really it doesn't change. The skills remain the same. You're just adding kind of the damage that I can do with the more equipment that you give me. Yup. That's it. Pretty simple question. I don't even have anything to add.

Speaker 2:          01:21:36       Next one. Cheaters, PD use in MMA and elsewhere. And then plan of action. Defense for homeless person. Just threw a bunch of questions in there. His work on range 15. Oh yeah. And we definitely got to talk about range 15. I'm naked in it. That's, so originally I was supposed to be wearing a loincloth, um, but had been sweating so much that when I tore my pants off, so went the loin cloth. It was like actual real, um, skin of an animal and it was like furry, uh, and skin when you get it wet. Hunters know this, it deteriorates. And as did my loin cloth, so when I tore my pants off to fight Zombie Randy couture, I'm not giving anything away because we really do fight. And, um, so with my loin cloth, so tell people about the movie naked range 15 and Tim Kennedy naked, um, is going to challenge everybody's perspective as to what a veteran is.

Speaker 2:          01:22:41       Um, I think there's, I don't know what it is where people look at veterans and they're like, they're damaged goods, um, PTSD or actual physical impairment or, uh, just the mentality of they've gone through training that I haven't, so that person's now a freak. Uh, not even dimension the, the climate that I think is encouraged from the government to treat us differently. Um, this movie is not very gingerly. Got To cover those topics. It will absolutely offend what I think to be about 70% of this, of this country. From what you told me about the movie today, I'm going to go ahead and up that number to 90% and I'll tell you what, what, when you were telling me about the movie today, so what's, who made it? What's his name? Primary. So Matt, best at best, Nick Paul Massano Matt Best owns a company called an article 15 range or up is our company.

Speaker 2:          01:23:45       So that's why it's called range 15, article 15 and ranger out, um, pretty clever name. Very, very creative army for us. That's army. Sorry. Listen, you fell a sophisticated cosmopolitan and we all were officers in the military. Um, so uh, Matt and nick or the masterminds behind that, Matt is our main character. He's our hero. Numero Uno. Right. And He's good looking, man. I, I've seen a couple of things that he's done. He's obviously a funny guy. And they put together this movie, they did it through Indie Gogo, which is some sort of a crowd funding, a deal where you get money from people, you know, and the, it's the public, the public just gives money. And you raised how much money? I've got a few million, a few million dollars to make this movie. And then we had like people from then we had like sponsors, people that are in the community that believed in the product, like Gerber knives, who I'm sponsored by, um, weapons manufacturers.

Speaker 2:          01:24:42       We had like people that make, um, Hazmat suits a coffee maker. Awesome. And they're like, we just want this movie to be made. And then people in Hollywood wanted, when they saw that we were like breaking the mold because Hollywood is stuck. It's a cesspool of inhumanity and selfishness and greed. That's what that industry is, that it's, it's, it's damn near eval when everybody that has been suffered has been suffering by that. The Organization of what Hollywood is, saw that a bunch of veterans that didn't give anything and we're like, we're gonna make a movie. And it's going to be the most offensive movie and everybody in this whole city, Hollywood is going to hate it. They started helping us to like, wait, it takes a few hundred thousand to rent a red camera. We'll give you three for you to use. The whole time we had guys that were like $2,000 a day type, um, directors and directors of photography that would step up and be like, I'm just going to volunteer my time for three weeks. And you're like, so we can't pay you the 50 grand for a week that you normally make or the for the, for the shot. And they're like, it's cool. Yeah. So there is something, when you were telling me about the movie today, this is what I think about

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       what you told me. There is something about special operations community that is very secret. It is something that has never been revealed to the public view. It, it is something that is outside. It's even beyond top secret. This is cla. Highly classified information in a special operations can. We might have to kill you. Echo Charlie and what it is and it's something that I seriously have never seen come out. The public, you guys talk about missions they've done but no one has ever talked about this fact and that is that the special operations community has an insane sense of humor, insane and it, the reason it doesn't get released is because it's in my belief it is not previously been and any way remotely acceptable by the human, by the normal people, by the populous and what you told me that some of the scenes you told me about today, they are going to shock.

Speaker 1:          01:27:05       They are going to shock and everybody from SPEC ops and most guys in the military going to look at him and they're going to laugh and they're going to, they're going to think it's funny. They're going to be laughing so hard and just going to seem normal to us. It's going to be seeing older than me. I'll be like, oh yeah, classic. Of course you're doing that, but I think like you said, I mean Hollywood is going to be beside themselves. They are. They are going to be completely beside themselves. This may start a revolution. I hope so. This may start a revolution and I, I, I, this may start a revolution with what you told me about it today and I know that everybody that's us in this podcast is going to go seek gonna go see this thing immediately and I think it's going to be phenomenal. So I'm looking forward to it when it comes out. The movie is called Range 15 and it's going to be in general release. It's gonna be

Speaker 2:          01:27:56       the nurse. Yeah. Yeah. June, June 15th so the premiere, is it the Military Gi film festival. Memorial Day weekend. And that's going to be in Washington DC. And then two weeks later is the wide release. Right now we're in eight or 900 theaters. That's just gonna keep going and growing. That's awesome. PDS stop using them. Yeah, pretty straight forward. I hate him. I get a lot like you have a big Mesomorph Physique, right? And somebody looks at you, they're like, oh man, look at that big old guy. You know what, what Roids does he use? It's like, it's all hard work. I've been an athlete since I was six years old. You know, my dad was an Olympic level athlete. My brother is like 10 times the athlete that I am. My sister was, she's, you know, she was, she started an athlete even before we were, um, like throw stones at me. You sought a tests every week to military test has all the time still to the day. Like I just get tested. Um, last month I got tested like nine times. I've always been clean. I will always be clean.

Speaker 1:          01:29:15       Yeah. And just for those of you that don't know that for those of you that aren't MMA fans, you fall a lot of guys that weren't clean. Yeah. And that's used. You know, I've since been in the academic community and, and sparring a lot of guys and fighting a lot of guys. I've gone with guys and, and just so everybody understands when someone goes on steroids, you can feel it 100%. You can absolutely feel it. They work, they work, they work, they work, they make you stronger. They make, they make a cover. A couple of faster. And so the fact that you've gone in the, in the cage on multiple occasions and Farc guys that had that massive advantage and you've beaten him, uh, awesome, awesome work. And it's a bummer that, that, that's out there. Yeah. With that

Speaker 2:          01:30:11       self respect, integrity. Yeah. You have more of an outspoken opinion about it, but say then like the next guy. Yeah. I mean, so I've been, I've been a professional athlete for 14 years. Um, like the pride peak of guys dripping anabolic steroids. Like, I mean, not like I used in fight camp. I mean like they took hypodermic needles and shoved them into their eyeballs right before the fight type fights. You know, the vendor delay Silva like Jewish, like he's up on the sh the ring screaming, and he probably hasn't even remembered like the last four days because he's been in a steroid rage leading up to his fight. That was the, that, that is the era of MMA that I came from. Right. And, um, my, so my entire career has been that, and I'm not bitter that like, you know, I, I fought in lost titles. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       and yeah, maybe they would have gone differently had I cheated or they weren't cheating, but that's not what it's about to me. It's, I've been a martial artist since I was since I was a kid. So a martial artist has to do with ethics and integrity and hard work and you're like the pillars of what being a martial artist is and every one of these guys spits in the face of what I think the sport is supposed to personify. All the beauty that exists in martial arts is stripped away every time one of these guys test positive.

Speaker 1:          01:31:45       That's why. Yeah. That's, uh, I'll leave it at that. I'll leave it at that.

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       While we're on it, the next question is why not make one UFC run? Mm, I do it. Yeah. Are there, are you gonna fight again? What's, are you on the schedule? Are they calling you

Speaker 2:          01:32:08       post to deploy in mid May and then at the beginning of June? So I know I'm gonna leave in mid to late May and

Speaker 1:          01:32:18       nope. Again, I got to break some stuff down for some civilians here, right?

Speaker 4:          01:32:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:24       Tim who's doing all this stuff, we sit in the room with me right now, who's got done doing a photo shoot today, who's making movies? He's going on deployment overseas to go hunt down and kill bad guys in a matter of months. I'm retired. Right? He's still doing it and he's doing all this other stuff and he's fighting for the UFC. Now the UFC, I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:32:50       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       you should be the absolute poster boy for the UFC, for the love of God.

Speaker 4:          01:32:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:59       Sorry for interrupting you. Okay. So you're going to go on deployment. Yeah. For your nation.

Speaker 2:          01:33:05       Um, and so my, one of my management, uh, told them that I get back on this date and from this date until this date, which is when I leave again, I'll be 100% down to fight anybody they say. So one last UFC run, I wouldn't even limit it to last. The I'm ranked whatever, six in the war, seventh or sixth or fifth in the world right now. To me, I'm a fight away from a title and um, and I think I can

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       beat everybody above me. And I think you can too. Yeah. Uh, so let's hope that the folks at the UFC pay attention to this. I mean, you got a guy that's a veteran that's a hero, that's a hard worker, that's never let you guys down. Pop and positive that's trained in his ass off. And you know what, besides all that, he's getting ready to deploy again so that you can have the damn UFC.

Speaker 1:          01:34:11       How about when he gets back, you tell him, how much time do you need my brother, you t you tell us when you want to fight and, and who you want to fight. If I was Dana White, I'd be like, Oh, you know what, this whole, this whole UFC schedule is based on Tim Kennedy. I like, that's who we based the UFC schedule sound of that not on what some other person that's not ever served. So hopefully Dana White, if you're listening, my name is Jocko. Give me a shout. I'll lay this out for you and explain to you how this needs to at work. Let's do this. Loan it. Yes, seriously. All

Speaker 2:          01:35:00       importance of recovery within your training program. Cheers.

Speaker 1:          01:35:05       And this is, by the way, this is from a sore necks, you know, the guys that make weight racks. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:35:10       Well, you know, for, for recovery be important. You have to have done the hard work to need it. So I think a lot of people focus on recovery all the time. Um, when they seriously, uh, I, I can't do that today. I'm on recovery day. I gotta gotta cry cryotherapy or ice bath or get a massage or acupuncture, you know, like bitch, go train hard, you know, like these callouses, I cut off, you know, like weekly. It's from hard work, you know, and, and I think recovery is as important as training, but first the training has to be there and it has to be hard enough for it to warrant needing recovery.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       Yeah. Now, I would say when, when I'm, when I was training fighters, I don't do it a lot anymore, but when I was trained UFC fighters, it was so obvious when they were overtrained like they'd go from the, you know, they be giving me a hard time on the mat or whatever and all of a sudden I'm just annihilated and I go, yeah, hey day off mango, eat two steaks tomorrow and just relax and easy. But you know, some guys, oh I needed a couple of days off. You don't need a day off.

Speaker 2:          01:36:19       I think it has more to do with lifestyle than recovery. You know, like when people are like, I am just not being able to put that, get the output, the volume that I need to do for work. Let's talk about your life. You know, like we, y'all chasing pussy last night. Oh you were? You were, you were at a strip club. Is that glitter shut? Get Out, get, what have you eaten this week? Tell me, show me your diet. Did you even have a log? No, you don't have a log. Get Out. You know? Well, how much did you sleep last night? Oh, you don't know cause what you drank get out. You know, like when was the last time you had to drink? Oh, last night. Get Out. You know, stop talking to me about recovery. If you don't get it, a lifestyle that's conducive to training, you know, like you want to talk about healthy lifestyle, get eight hours of sleep.

Speaker 2:          01:37:01       Well yeah, I know. Yeah. Hey Jocko. Doesn't sleep a lot. That's all right. That's all right. Eat real food. Stop putting crap in your body. Stop drinking. You don't. You won't drop your testosterone. You were talking about these guys are having huge problems to stop. One stop using steroids to stop drinking. You know, for me, sex day, everyday get eight hours of sleep. Work my ass off. I think that a man for a real athlete, man or woman, they have to go to bed tired. I love that feeling like you are exhausted. You see that bed and you were like, fuck you cannot mean to me. Can I make it? You know, can I make it from the shower to bed? Yeah, that's what you're supposed to feel like.

Speaker 1:          01:37:46       We've talked about that on here and that's, that's one of my favorite feelings in the world

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       of I get to the end of the night and I'm barely hanging on through dinner. By the time I get done with dinner, I'll just, Oh God, I can't wait to crow. Wife starts talking. You're like, Baby Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah. You hear the words, but I don't know what you're saying. Yeah. You know, so I, yeah, that's, that's great input. Sleep, eat right. It's, you can work, man. Humans can do a lot of the body is so adaptive. So you've got people that can run ultra marathons and he got people that can deadlift thousands of pounds the, and we're the same species. Right. You know, we have people that can like paint the Mona Lisa and there's people that can go and murder villages, same species, you know, like it is an adaptive thing as long as you train it properly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:38:48       Next question. What are the, what are the best qualities, SLAs, skills? A person needs to be a great soldier. Slash. Fighter. And are these the same?

Speaker 2:          01:39:02       I think that there are some qualities in each that compliment each other. Um, for example, the regimented schedule of the military does good things for somebody that wants to aspire to be a fighter because most fighters are selfish little pricks that are super lazy and they don't understand what it takes. Dedication wise to little things like setting your alarm, being on time to work out, writing a journal as to what you're eating. I'm not chasing pussy all night long and that you should go to bed like those. That's discipline. That's, that's what that is. That's that word. Um, and a lot of military, not all guys, but a lot of the military teaches discipline. So that is a characteristic that would compliment somebody that aspires to be a fighter. And then fighters, you know, like yes. Obviously you're learning skills, technical skills that could be life saving. Um, you know, just like you getting comfortable with sweating, you're getting used to hard work and you know, so some of those things are nice, but um, yeah. So there's some things that that do well. I think being a good soldier can make you a better fighter and some things about being a good fighter can make you a better soldier.

Speaker 1:          01:40:26       Yeah. I think, uh, for me the biggest quality that would transfer both back and forth soldier fighter, and I'll go ahead and throw one more on there and that's been in a leadership position, but to me it's humility and I think what makes a soldier of fighter a leader the most important quality that they can have, his humility, because the minute that you're not humble is minute that you stop training as hard as you can. So the minute you say, you know what, I don't need to do that extra workout today. That's a lack of humility because you're thinking, oh, I already got this, I got this in the bag from a leadership position, same thing. I don't really do train my guys hard. I don't need to show up earlier than my guys because they already respect me. No, you need to earn that respect every day.

Speaker 1:          01:41:15       And so for me, always humility is the most important characteristic of a person because you're not also not learning what's, you're not humble. I don't need, I don't need to roll today. I'll read the whole, I didn't need to get on the pads today. How did you swing that kettle bell today? I'm already good. Get humble yet humble or you're gonna get humbled, dude. Boom. That's ranger rupture. Sorry. Let me, let me put this in my phone real fast. It'll be recorded too. When you can refer it back to you. I don't want you to keep it. I want to keep it. Okay. We got all kinds of tee shirts, sayings that come out of the podcast each time. Be Humble or get humbled. Take the high road or the high road of Tq. Yeah, that's another good one.

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       Saved. Okay. All right. Humility right there. Last learning from external social thievery of his, um, intellectual property. I didn't trademark it yet. I'm sure you'll cut me up. Giant fat check for the thousands and thousands of tee shirts that gets sold with that on it. Uh, okay. Last question. And I think the reason this question is in here is because a lot of people that listen to this podcast, they're trying to get better, try to improve themselves, they're trying to do good and we all, and we got people of all ages. This one in particular says if giving a high school graduation speech, what would you advise 18 year olds navigating their first, their next steps? Would you tell an 18 year old, oh man, um, be humbler gambled. Damn. I know, dude, we need to make a t shirt that says no, I am, um, you don't have another way that this question gets phrased. And from what the story you told tonight, what would you tell yourself if you could tell your own 18 year old self, what would you tell yourself? Do something that you don't know if you can accomplish. If I'm going to climb a mountain, yeah, I could go up to, you know, mission St Louis Obispo, which is like a 2000 foot mountain and I'm pretty confident I could claim that, you know, um, Mount Whitney without some training. Honestly, we've kind of challenging. Um, you know, obviously a k Everest Dif, different beasts could do it. Do,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       do that, do that thing that you don't know if you can do stop being afraid of hard work. That's the thing that's gonna really determine success or failure. One is your desire to actually do it and then to the commitment that it will take to achieve it. Stop being scared. Go and do it. That's what I'd say

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       my statement.

Speaker 4:          01:44:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       And I put it right on top of that. I would say that not only do you want to stop being scared and do that thing that you don't know if you can do or not, but you know what you gotta do is you've got to start taking the steps now. Because when you're 18 years old, your life seems like it's going to last forever. And I will tell you right now, it's not gonna last forever in those years go by like a summer's Day. And the next thing you know, you look up and you're 36 years old or you're 44 years old and that time's gone. You cannot get it back. You cannot get time back. So those dreams that you have, those goals that you have, don't put them off another second one, not one second. Get on them and go out and make them happen. Starting right now.

Speaker 2:          01:45:43       Yeah. Like you got anything else for the night? Tana? Mike Schur suspended. She can't drop them. But if you could, that's what I would've done. I just be like, I'm out. You got anything else? Dude, this is awesome. Thanks man. Thanks for coming on. You're inspiring. Preciate it, you're, you're inspiring to all nations. Uh, Echo. You've got anything? I thought it was interesting how a lot of the stuff, actually, most of the stuff that Tim was talking about was like what we were just kind of recently talking about in terms of the reading stuff. Yeah. The stop drinking stuff. The, um, obviously the hard work stuff or whatever. But it was, it was, I thought that was interesting. So I subscribed to this idea of like, I prefer a dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery. And the only reason that that you can have that is from individual responsibility for you to have freedom.

Speaker 2:          01:46:42       It's, there's not this construct. You actually have to take the work and do the work that's associated with it and see what I mean? He's laughing right now because one of my sort of mantras in life is discipline equals freedom. And the more discipline you have, the harder you work, the more effort you put into it, the more freedom you're going to have. And so as you're describing this philosophy, it's something that we literally say on every, it's a, it's a chapter in the book that I read what I just said. Like whoa. Everything you're saying is like locking in exactly with like, Whoa, whoa. He's been saying Amen. Jocko. Amen. You, it, we actually have a shirt, one of the two only two shirts we have. One is discipline equals freedom. You don't be humble or get humbled for ranger up to make. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:47:30       What about what else on it? Oh yeah. On it. Yeah. You know all about [inaudible] trainer. I train there two days a week. Utilize, I utilize their self. What do you use? Um, shroom tech. See she room, I swear. Like, um, so I'm like a pretty sight. I think I'm a scientific guy. Um, so when I'm using something I'll have like measurable, tangible numbers. I can do x number of reps, reps or rose, like how many calories can I burn and 10 minutes on shroom tech or off shroom tech, all things being the same, same day of the week. Same. Pretty much diet, same similar weight. Um, it's more what am on trim tech. I don't know if it's placebo. I know when I go in and I roll, there's nights where I'm like tuckered out. Um, and then there's nights where I'm lunchroom tech and I'm just like, I want another round.

Speaker 2:          01:48:25       Anybody else got another round? And that's what to say, the later rounds, you really feel it as the rounds go on. Any other so on it? Yeah.

Send it Brian Stann in you 2016 is it too late? I realized the delicates or the delegates are about to be distributed to a bunch of bitches.

I want Brian, Stan, and Jocko Javier as my two president. I don't know. After today. You might have a little flood in there somewhere too.

Speaker 1:          01:49:58       Nope. Nope, nope. Awesome. Wait, seriously though. Thanks for coming on. Appreciate sweet sharing with everybody and most of all, thank you for your service to this nation can never thank you enough for what you've done.
