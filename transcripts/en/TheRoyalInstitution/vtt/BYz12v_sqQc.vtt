00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.210
Another kind of
group that does seem

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.730
happiest is people who
report being satisfied

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.210
with their relationships.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.422
So that's both romantic
relationships but, also,

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:11.880
in terms of people who have
lots of friends, who spend lots

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.650
of time with their
friends, this is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.150
one of the biggest predictors
of who is happy and who's not.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.320
It's basically your
personal relationships.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.370
So you see here that people
who say that they're satisfied

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.130
with their relationships report
being much happier than people

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.500
who report not being satisfied.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.850
Now, another one is money.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.820
And money gets people really
interested about happiness.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.410
Because in many
ways, we don't really

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.110
like to think that money
leads to happiness.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.300
You know, we have
this idea that, oh,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.010
you can't buy happiness.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.320
Happiness comes from within.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.020
I still don't really understand
where the idea came from.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.130
Because, to me, if you
look across countries,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430
rich countries are happier
than poor countries--

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.420
quite straightforward.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.360
Within countries, if you're
poor within a country,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.640
then you're less happy that if
you're rich within a country.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.760
So at least
cross-sectionally, that's

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.620
if you measure
one point of time,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.890
money does lead to happiness,
especially at the low end.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.350
So especially for
those people who

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
earn little amounts of money,
even very small increases

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.830
can dramatically improve
people's well-being.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.960
But it's not just
about having money.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.490
There is also
increasing evidence

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.550
about how you use your money
impacts your happiness.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.400
So if people use
their limited budget,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.460
which we all have a
limited amount to spend,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.970
if we spend more of it on
experiences and not stuff,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.750
then people seem to be happier
from those experiences.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.350
If we spend more money on
others rather than just buying

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.300
stuff for ourselves, we
seem to be happier as well.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.610
So even though we can't wave a
magic wand and become richer,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.860
maybe we can allocate
our spending differently

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.639
to try and improve
our happiness as well.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.180
Another one is
fulfilling employment,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.972
that if people feel in
control of their lives,

00:01:56.972 --> 00:01:59.430
if they feel that they are
doing something they're good at,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.300
that's another super strong
predictor of who is happy

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.000
and who's not.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.880
Now, I think I know what
you're all thinking now.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.630
I think what you're thinking
is, this is just too easy.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.960
Like, all you're telling me
is, I need to get really rich.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.960
I need to have amazing
relationships both romantically

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.100
and otherwise.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.620
I need to find a job that
I'm, like, kickass at

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.610
and that I find really-- feel
in control and fulfilling.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.920
Like, I'm just going to go home
tonight and be much happier.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.620
But the thing is that actually
it's a bit more complicated

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.530
than that.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.390
And the reason it's
more complicated

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.780
is because of this thing
called hedonic adaption.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.660
Now, basically,
hedonic adaption,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.010
it's not a good or a bad thing.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.840
But it changes what it means
to try and pursue happiness.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.140
If we're trying
to become happier,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.820
then hedonic adaption
can be your enemy.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.840
So let me explain.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.200
Basically, everything
that we do,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.440
everything that changes in
our lives, we just adapt to.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.520
That's what the
human condition is.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.510
We're supposed to
be good at adapting

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.840
to changing environments.

00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:06.840
And that's the same
with happiness.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.150
So even though
things that we think

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.210
might really impact our
happiness, we just adjust.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.420
So within a few years, no matter
kind of what happens to us,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.980
we seem to go back
to a set point.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.600
So if you think about marriage,
you think that maybe--

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.430
I showed you that
relationships matter.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.880
Maybe if we get married, we're
going to be much happier--

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.400
but, no.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.914
We're happier a bit beforehand.

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:30.330
And we're really
happy on the day.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.410
That's awesome.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.440
And then [BLOWS RASPBERRY]
back to normal.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440
No, marriage, not
really helping.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.050
Birth of a child?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.900
Again, pretty
awesome just before.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.090
Pretty crappy just afterwards.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.980
But again, we just adjust
back to the set point.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.210
Even when really
terrible things happen,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.940
even when really awful things,
like the death of a spouse,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.934
we do adjust back
within a few years.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.100
You can even see there's
someone who's a bit happier

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.319
at the end there, but
that depends on gender,

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.860
and it depends on
a few other things.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.160
But basically, we just
adapt to what happens to us.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.700
Now this has really
important implications

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.840
for us pursuing happiness.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.210
Because if we try to
pursue happiness but then

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.540
we know that we
adapt every time,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.490
then we need to think about how
big the changes are that are

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.110
happening in our lives.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.550
If we win the lottery tomorrow,
but then we adapt to that,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.270
and in a couple of
years' time we're

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.190
back to normal
levels of happiness,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.280
then we can't really
win the lottery twice.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.490
So really, it's about steady
changes, steady gains.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.580
People will be much
happier if they slowly

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.680
increase their income
over time than if they

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.536
had some massive windfall.

00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:44.160
And similarly with
other areas of life,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.580
slow goal fulfilment that feels
like you're making progress

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.640
is going to make people
happier than big changes.
