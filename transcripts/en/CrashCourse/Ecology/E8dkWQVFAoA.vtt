00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.580
If being alive on earth was some kind of contest,
humans, I think, would win it hands down.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.000
As a population of organisms, we're the Michael
Phelps of being alive,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.480
only we have like 250,000 times more gold
medals.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.559
Last week, we talked about exponential growth,
when a population grows at a rate proportional

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.630
to the size of the population, even as that
size of that population keeps increasing.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.350
Well, since around the year 1650, the human
population has been undergoing probably the

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.320
longest period of exponential growth of any
large animal in history ever.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.780
In 1650, there were about 500 million people
on the planet.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.340
By 1850, the population had doubled to 1 billion.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.220
And it doubled again just 80 years after that,
and doubled again just 45 years after that.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.560
We are now well past 7 billion and counting.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.820
So think about this:

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.740
today, there are 80 year olds who have watched the population of their species on earth triple.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.600
So why is this happening? And how? And how
long can it go on, because it's kind of uncomfortable?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.960
[Theme Music]

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.860
Let's say you're shopping for dinner, and bear with me, we're going to relate it back to ecology in a second,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.390
but you've got a lot of choices at your grocery store, you could buy five packs of ramen for a dollar,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.560
or you could buy some fancy ravioli made by Italian nuns out of organic pasta for like $20 a pound.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.860
They're both noodles, they're both food, but
you know, with the ramen, you get more,

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.380
whereas with the handmade stuff, it tastes
better -- higher quality. What do you do?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.880
It's a perennial problem in nature, and in
our lives, satisfying the two competing impulses:

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.729
Do I have more or do I have the best? Quantity
or quality? Tough choice.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.689
Although we're not really aware of it, all organisms make a similar choice through how they reproduce.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.380
In ecology, we size up who chooses quantity over quality by something called the R vs. K Selection Theory.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.140
The R vs. K Selection Theory says that some organisms will reproduce in a way that aims for huge exponential growth,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.840
while others are just content to hit the number
of individuals that their habitat can support,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.340
that is, the carrying capacity, and then stay
around that level.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.000
Species that reproduce in a way that leads
to very fast growth are called R-Selected Species

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.120
because R is the maximum growth rate of a population when you're talking math-talk, as we learned last week.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.300
The very-strongly R selected animals make a lot of babies in their lifetime and just hope that they make it.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.320
If some of the babies get eaten or something,
no biggie, there are others where those came from.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.140
On the other hand, K-selected species only make a few babies in their lifetime and they invest in them very heavily.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.280
K in math language is carrying capacity, since
K-selected species usually end up living at

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.879
population densities closer to their carrying
capacity than R-selected ones.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.639
Of course, things aren't so cut and dry in nature as most animals aren't very strongly K-selected or R-selected.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.559
It's actually, you know, a spectrum.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.420
Some organisms, usually small-ish ones, reproducing more on the R side,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.819
and others, usually larger ones, on the K
side. Most species are somewhere in the middle.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.530
So the reason I'm telling you this is to drive
home how bananas it is that humans have gotten

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.330
to the population size we have.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.739
Because we tend to reproduce way on the K-selected
side of the spectrum,

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.470
we're pretty big mammals, usually only have
a few kids during our lifetimes,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.080
and those kids are a total pain in the butt to raise, but we put a ton of resources into them anyways.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.629
So even though humans reproduce K-selected-ishly,
for the past few centuries,

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.260
our population growth curve has been looking
suspiciously like that of an R-selected species.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.489
And exponential growth, even for R-selected
species, usually does not go on for 350 years.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.220
Well, how did this all happen?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.700
Well, the short answer is that humans figured out how to raise our carrying capacity so far indefinitely,

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.860
and we did this by eliminating a bunch of
obstacles that would have made our numbers

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.239
level off at a carrying capacity a long, long
time ago.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.559
These obstacles you will recall are limiting factors, and we managed to blast them to pieces in a few different ways.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280
First, we've upped our ability to feed ourselves.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.409
Our crazy rapid population growth started
in Europe around the 17th century because

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.840
that's when agriculture was becoming mechanized.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.360
And fancy new farming practices like the domestication
of animals and crops were increasing food production.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.310
From Europe, those agricultural practices
and their accompanying population explosion

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.920
spread to the New World and to much of the rest of the world by the mid-19th century.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.189
Another game changer for the human population
came in the form of medical advances.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:21.539
Anton van Leeuwenhoek, father of microbiology,
all around really smart guy,

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.589
was the first modern scientist to propose
the germ theory of disease in 1700,

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:29.469
and even though it took about a century and
a half for people to take it seriously,

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.180
it revolutionized human health, leading to
things like vaccinations.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.419
Suddenly, people stopped dying of stupid, avoidable stuff as they had been for thousands of years,

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.279
which meant that everybody lived longer, childhood
survival rates improved,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.831
and those kids went on to make their own babies
and get very, very old.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.480
And we also increased our carrying capacity
by not being so disgusting.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.380
We figured that you can't just sit around
in your own poop and live to tell the tale,

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.199
so sewage systems became a thing.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.119
In Europe, at least, it started around the 1500s, but they weren't widely used until the 1800s,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.039
and we all benefited from that.

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.339
And, finally, we've gotten a lot better at
living comfortably in inhospitable places.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.100
That is to say, people have been living in
deserts and tundra for thousands of years,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.840
but in the 20th century we expanded the human
habitat to pretty much everywhere in the world,

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.439
thanks to heating and air conditioning and
warm clothes and airplanes

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.689
and trucks that bring food everywhere from
Svalbard, Norway to New South Wales.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.400
So for all those reasons and more, humans have been able to avoid that old party pooper carrying capacity,

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.639
which is good, 'cause I don't like it when
people die, it's just, it's just a downer.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.779
And a lot of smart scientists and mathematicians
and economists have argued that each person

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.639
born in the past 350 years has not only represented
another mouth to feed, but also two hands

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.139
to work to raise the human carrying capacity,
just enough for themselves and a teensy bit more.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.039
So then as our population grows, our carrying
capacity grows right along with it,

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.379
like some really steep escalator going up
and the ceiling just above our heads,

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.699
and if it stayed there, we'd all get squished
but it keeps moving.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.779
But of course, this can't go on forever.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.379
The human population does have a carrying
capacity, it's just that nobody's sure what it is.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.179
Back in 1679, it was Leeuwenhoek himself who
was the first to publicly hazard a guess about

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:15.699
the Earth's carrying capacity for humans,
guessing it to be around 13.4 billion people.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.240
Since then, estimates have ranged from 1 billion
to 1 trillion, which is one thousand billion,

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.440
so that seems a little extreme, but the averages
of these estimates are from 10-15 billion folks.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.140
And we need a lot of obvious things to survive
-- food, clean water, non-renewable resources

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:33.629
like metals and fossil fuels --

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:39.089
but everything that we consume requires space,
whether it's space to grow or space to mine

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.969
or produce or put our waste.

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.309
So a lot of ecologists make their estimates
of how many people this planet can handle

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:46.839
based on an ecological footprint,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:52.599
a calculation of how much land and how many resources each person on the planet requires to live.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.500
That footprint is very different depending
on where you live and what your habits are.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.400
People in India use a lot fewer resources
and therefore, space, than Americans for example.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.240
Meat eaters require a lot more acreage than
vegetarians;

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.739
in fact, if everybody on the planet ate as much meat as the wealthiest people in the world do,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.020
current food harvests could feed less than
half of the present world's population.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.460
So despite the fact that the earth is a very
big place, space is a real limiting factor for us,

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:22.309
and as our population grows, there will probably
be more conflict over how our space is used.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:27.619
For instance, if there really were a trillion people on the planet, everybody would have to live, grow food on,

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:32.219
and poop on, a 12-by-12 meter patch of ground,
about half the size of a tennis court.

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.559
So it could be that you could fit a thousand
billion people on earth,

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:39.149
but I can guarantee that those people would
have a hard time getting along with each other.

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:42.550
But how about we stop thinking about ourselves
just for a moment?

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.849
As we take up more space, we also leave less
space for other species,

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.520
and as we use resources like trees and soil
and clean water,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.000
that reduces the amount available to all kinds
of other organisms.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.520
This is why biologists say that we are currently
living through one of the biggest extinction

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:01.189
events in recent geological history.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:04.229
We're outcompeting other species for the very
basics of life.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:10.960
And eventually, or in the case of oil and water, already, we're starting to compete with ourselves as a species.

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:14.279
So serious stuff here, but here's a little
glimmer of hope:

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:18.809
unlike some other animals, a lot of our actions
are based on a little thing called culture,

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:22.240
and human culture has brought about some huge
changes in the last 50 years.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.600
The fact is, even though the human population
continues to grow,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:31.189
the rate of population growth actually peaked
around 1962 and has been declining every since.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:34.310
At its peak, the human population was growing
at about 2.2% per year,

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.050
and these days, it's declined to about 1.1%
and it's still falling.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.760
Families in most industrialized countries
are getting smaller and smaller, but why?

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:45.379
Well, part of that has to do with women.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:49.019
As women in developed nations get more education,
they're having babies later in life,

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.449
and when an animal doesn't reproduce to its
fullest potential --

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:55.790
meaning it doesn't start having babies as
soon as it's like, sexually able to --

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.879
that animal is going to have fewer offspring.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.690
Also, if you get women more choices and more
education,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.240
they might be more liable to choose a second career in astrophysics rather than becoming a mother.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.580
Another reason for the falling population growth rate has to do with the way that we live our lives.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.600
Back in the early 20th century, more of the world worked on farms, and maybe ate their own food.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.060
Kids were a real asset to a farm back then;

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:21.269
it's a good example of that idea about more
hands doing more work to increase the carrying

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.720
capacity of the human population.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.680
Yeah, kids were an extra mouth to feed,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.920
but they were also a really important work force and you could just feed the kids the stuff you were producing.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.899
That's what we call a positive feedback loop;

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:35.699
as the population grows, the workforce gets bigger and the place, as a result, supports more of us.

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:38.139
But these days, that's not happening so much
anymore.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.280
More and more people are living in cities where you don't need kids to help with the crops,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.260
so fewer people are having them, because:

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.940
a.) they cost a lot of money to raise,

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:50.160
b.) they're not bringing in money like they
were back on the farm,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.900
and c.) a lot of people have access to good birth control, so they don't have as many "oops"-children.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.120
All these factors together are forming a negative
feedback loop,

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:02.100
the effects of reproduction in this case work
to slow down the rate of reproduction.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.970
But just because our population's growth rate
is decreasing doesn't mean that this juggernaut

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.440
of humanity is going to stop anytime soon.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.200
In addition to reminding us that the rules of ecology apply to us just like any other organism,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.020
human population is important to think about because we kind of need to do something about it.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.900
And I think pretty much every other species
on the planet would agree with me on that.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.379
