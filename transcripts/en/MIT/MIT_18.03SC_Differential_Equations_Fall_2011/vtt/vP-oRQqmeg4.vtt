00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to start.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.383
We are going to start studying
today, and for quite a while,

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:42.685
the linear second-order
differential equation with

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:46.904
constant coefficients.
In standard form,

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.232
it looks like,
there are various possible

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:55.452
choices for the variable,
unfortunately,

00:00:55.452 --> 00:01:01.836
so I hope it won't disturb you
much if I use one rather than

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:06.409
another.
I'm going to write it this way

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.944
in standard form.
I'll use y as the dependent

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.836
variable.
Your book uses little p and

00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:16.049
little q.
I'll probably switch to that by

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.058
next time.
But, for today,

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:22.476
I'd like to use the most
neutral letters I can find that

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:25.207
won't interfere with anything
else.

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:28.742
So, of course call the constant
coefficients,

00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:33.000
respectively,
capital A and capital B.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.804
I'm going to assume for today
that the right-hand side is

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:40.550
zero.
So, that means it's what we

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.497
call homogeneous.
The left-hand side must be in

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:49.473
this form for it to be linear,
it's second order because it

00:01:49.473 --> 00:01:53.591
involves a second derivative.
These coefficients,

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:57.538
A and B, are understood to be
constant because,

00:01:57.538 --> 00:02:02.000
as I said, it has constant
coefficients.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.214
Of course, that's not the most
general linear equation there

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:08.857
could be.
In general, it would be more

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:12.357
general by making this a
function of the dependent

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:15.071
variable, x or t,
whatever it's called.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:18.714
Similarly, this could be a
function of the dependent

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:21.500
variable.
Above all, the right-hand side

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.428
can be a function of a variable
rather than simply zero.

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:30.000
In that case the equation is
called inhomogeneous.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.094
But it has a different physical
meaning, and therefore it's

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:36.494
customary to study that after
this.

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:40.094
You start with this.
This is the case we start with,

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:44.258
and then by the middle of next
week we will be studying more

00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:47.364
general cases.
But, it's a good idea to start

00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:49.270
here.
Your book starts with,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.082
in general, some theory of a
general linear equation of

00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:55.552
second-order,
and even higher order.

00:02:55.552 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm asking you to skip that for
the time being.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.518
We'll come back to it next
Wednesday, it two lectures,

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:06.373
in other words.
I think it's much better and

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:10.356
essential for your problems at
for you to get some experience

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:14.473
with a simple type of equation.
And then, you'll understand the

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:16.464
general theory,
how it applies,

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:17.858
a lot better,
I think.

00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:21.709
So, let's get experience here.
The downside of that is that

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.360
I'm going to have to assume a
couple of things about the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.950
solution to this equation,
how it looks;

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.000
I don't think that will upset
you too much.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.845
So, what I'm going to assume,
and we will justify it in a

00:03:37.845 --> 00:03:42.228
couple lectures,
that the general solution,

00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:47.552
that is, the solution involving
arbitrary constants,

00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:51.936
looks like this.
y is equal-- The arbitrary

00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:56.111
constants occur in a certain
special way.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:03.000
There is c one y one plus c two
y two.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.267
So, these are two arbitrary
constants corresponding to the

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.019
fact that we are solving a
second-order equation.

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.942
In general, the number of
arbitrary constants in the

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:15.324
solution is the same as the
order of the equation because if

00:04:15.324 --> 00:04:18.649
it's a second-order equation
because if it's a second-order

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.974
equation, that means somehow or
other, it may be concealed.

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:25.356
But you're going to have to
integrate something twice to get

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:26.789
the answer.
And therefore,

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.000
there should be two arbitrary
constants.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.791
That's very rough,
but it sort of gives you the

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:38.229
idea.
Now, what are the y1 and y2?

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.708
Well, as you can see,
if these are arbitrary

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:48.020
constants, if I take c2 to be
zero and c1 to be one,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.541
that means that y1 must be a
solution to the equation,

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:57.708
and similarly y2.
So, where y1 and y2 are

00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:02.128
solutions.
Now, what that shows you is

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:05.990
that the task of solving this
equation is reduced,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.379
in some sense,
to finding just two solutions

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.847
of it, somehow.
All we have to do is find two

00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:17.812
solutions, and then we will have
solved the equation because the

00:05:17.812 --> 00:05:22.463
general solution is made up in
this way by multiplying those

00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:26.561
two solutions by arbitrary
constants and adding them.

00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.423
So, the problem is,
where do we get that solutions

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:33.569
from?
But, first of all,

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.453
or rather, second or third of
all, the initial conditions

00:05:38.453 --> 00:05:42.465
enter into the,
I haven't given you any initial

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:45.691
conditions here,
but if you have them,

00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:49.790
and I will illustrate them when
I work problems,

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.238
the initial conditions,
well, the initial values are

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:59.470
satisfied by choosing c1 and c2,
are satisfied by choosing c1

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.979
and c2 properly.
So, in other words,

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.666
if you have an initial value
problem to solve,

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:14.187
that will be taken care of by
the way those constants,

00:06:14.187 --> 00:06:19.708
c, enter into the solution.
Okay, without further ado,

00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:25.854
there is a standard example,
which I wish I had looked up in

00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:30.333
the physics syllabus for the
first semester.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:35.125
Did you study the
spring-mass-dashpot system in

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:39.293
8.01?
I'm embarrassed having to ask

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:40.242
you.
You did?

00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:44.750
Raise your hands if you did.
Okay, that means you all did.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.099
Well, just let me draw an
instant picture to remind you.

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.551
So, this is a two second
review.

00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:54.556
I don't know how they draw the
picture.

00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:57.640
Probably they don't draw
picture at all.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.464
They have some elaborate system
here of the thing running back

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.678
and forth.
Well, in the math,

00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:10.090
we do that all virtually.
So, here's my system.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.470
That's a fixed thing.
Here's a little spring.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.751
And, there's a little car on
the track here,

00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:21.638
I guess.
So, there's the mass,

00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:27.411
some mass in the little car,
and motion is damped by what's

00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:32.285
called a dashpot.
A dashpot is the sort of thing,

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:35.603
you see them in everyday life
as door closers.

00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:40.027
They're the thing up above that
you never notice that prevent

00:07:40.027 --> 00:07:43.640
the door slamming shut.
So, if you take one apart,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.548
it looks something like this.
So, that's the dash pot.

00:07:47.548 --> 00:07:51.898
It's a chamber with a piston.
This is a piston moving in and

00:07:51.898 --> 00:07:54.995
out, and compressing the air,
releasing it,

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:57.723
is what damps the motion of the
thing.

00:07:57.723 --> 00:08:02.000
So, this is a dashpot,
it's usually called.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.233
And, here's our mass in that
little truck.

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:09.255
And, here's the spring.
And then, the equation which

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.779
governs it is,
let's call this x.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:15.722
I'm already changing,
going to change the dependent

00:08:15.722 --> 00:08:19.823
variable from y to x,
but that's just for the sake of

00:08:19.823 --> 00:08:23.293
example, and because the track
is horizontal,

00:08:23.293 --> 00:08:27.000
it seems more natural to call
it x.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.609
There's some equilibrium
position somewhere,

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:34.302
let's say, here.
That's the position at which

00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:38.666
the mass wants to be,
if the spring is not pulling on

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:42.443
it or pushing on it,
and the dashpot is happy.

00:08:42.443 --> 00:08:46.304
I guess we'd better have a
longer dashpot here.

00:08:46.304 --> 00:08:50.669
So, this is the equilibrium
position where nothing is

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:53.606
happening.
When you depart from that

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:57.383
position, then the spring,
if you go that way,

00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:02.000
the spring tries to pull the
mass back.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
If it goes on the site,
the spring tries to push the

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.156
mass away.
The dashpot,

00:09:09.156 --> 00:09:14.549
meanwhile, is doing its thing.
And so, the force on the,

00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:19.450
m x double prime.
That's by Newton's law,

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.549
the force, comes from where?
Well, there's the spring

00:09:24.549 --> 00:09:29.254
pushing and pulling on it.
That force is opposed.

00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:34.843
If x gets to be beyond zero,
then the spring tries to pull

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:39.256
it back.
If it gets to the left of zero,

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:42.895
if x gets to be negative,
that that spring force is

00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:46.462
pushing it this way,
wants to get rid of the mass.

00:09:46.462 --> 00:09:50.392
So, it should be minus kx,
and this is from the spring,

00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:54.832
the fact that is proportional
to the amount by which x varies.

00:09:54.832 --> 00:09:58.180
So, that's called Hooke's Law.
Never mind that.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.034
This is a law.
That's a law,

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.103
Newton's law,
okay, Newton,

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:06.445
Hooke with an E,
and the dashpot damping is

00:10:06.445 --> 00:10:11.140
proportional to the velocity.
It's not doing anything if the

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.039
mass is not moving,
even if it's stretched way out

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:19.496
of its equilibrium position.
So, it resists the velocity.

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:24.031
If the thing is trying to go
that way, the dashpot resists

00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:26.419
it.
It's trying to go this way,

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:30.000
the dashpot resists that,
too.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.549
It's always opposed to the
velocity.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:35.026
And so, this is a dash pot
damping.

00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:39.470
I don't know whose law this is.
So, it's the force coming from

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.456
the dashpot.
And, when you write this out,

00:10:42.456 --> 00:10:45.807
the final result,
therefore, is it's m x double

00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:49.596
prime plus c x prime,
it's important to see where the

00:10:49.596 --> 00:10:52.947
various terms are,
plus kx equals zero.

00:10:52.947 --> 00:10:56.079
And now, that's still not in

00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:59.066
standard form.
To put it in standard form,

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:03.000
you must divide through by the
mass.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.441
And, it will now read like
this, plus k divided by m times

00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:10.402
x equals zero.
And, that's the equation

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:13.051
governing the motion of the
spring.

00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:17.571
I'm doing this because your
problem set, problems three and

00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:21.779
four, ask you to look at a
little computer visual which

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:26.298
illustrates a lot of things.
And, I didn't see how it would

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:30.116
make, you can do it without this
interpretation of

00:11:30.116 --> 00:11:33.000
spring-mass-dashpot,
--

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.312
-- but, I think thinking of it
of these constants as,

00:11:37.312 --> 00:11:41.624
this is the damping constant,
and this is the spring,

00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:46.517
the constant which represents
the force being exerted by the

00:11:46.517 --> 00:11:50.082
spring, the spring constant,
as it's called,

00:11:50.082 --> 00:11:54.726
makes it much more vivid.
So, you will note is that those

00:11:54.726 --> 00:11:57.795
problems are labeled Friday or
Monday.

00:11:57.795 --> 00:12:01.526
Make it Friday.
You can do them after today if

00:12:01.526 --> 00:12:07.000
you have the vaguest idea of
what I'm talking about.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.623
If not, go back and repeat
8.01.

00:12:10.623 --> 00:12:16.350
So, all this was just an
example, a typical model.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.675
But, by far,
the most important simple

00:12:20.675 --> 00:12:25.000
model.
Okay, now what I'd like to talk

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.610
about is the solution.
What is it I have to do to

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:37.045
solve the equation?
So, to solve the equation that

00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:41.308
I outlined in orange on the
board, the ODE,

00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:44.657
our task is to find two
solutions.

00:12:44.657 --> 00:12:49.936
Now, don't make it too trivial.
There is a condition.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.387
The solution should be
independent.

00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:58.360
All that means is that y2
should not be a constant

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.687
multiple of y1.
I mean, if you got y1,

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:06.677
then two times y1 is not an
acceptable value for this

00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:10.820
because, as you can see,
you really only got one there.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.500
You're not going to be able to
make up a two parameter family.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.566
So, the solutions have to be
independent, which means,

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:24.092
to repeat, that neither should
be a constant multiple of the

00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:26.624
other.
They should look different.

00:13:26.624 --> 00:13:32.116
That's an adequate explanation.
Okay, now, what's the basic

00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:34.703
method to finding those
solutions?

00:13:34.703 --> 00:13:38.622
Well, that's what we're going
to use all term long,

00:13:38.622 --> 00:13:41.600
essentially,
studying equations of this

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.225
type, even systems of this type,
with constant coefficients.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:50.144
The basic method is to try y
equals an exponential.

00:13:50.144 --> 00:13:54.612
Now, the only way you can
fiddle with an exponential is in

00:13:54.612 --> 00:13:57.356
the constant that you put up on
top.

00:13:57.356 --> 00:14:03.000
So, I'm going to try y equals e
to the rt.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.242
Notice you can't tell from that
what I'm using as the

00:14:08.242 --> 00:14:13.283
independent variable.
But, this tells you I'm using

00:14:13.283 --> 00:14:16.106
t.
And, I'm switching back to

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.433
using t as the dependent
variable.

00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:22.760
So, T is the independent
variable.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.498
Why do I do that?
The answer is because somebody

00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:31.027
thought of doing it,
probably Euler,

00:14:31.027 --> 00:14:36.673
and it's been a tradition
that's handed down for the last

00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:42.033
300 or 400 years.
Some things we just know.

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:46.587
All right, so if I do that,
as you learned from the exam,

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:50.165
it's very easy to differentiate
exponentials.

00:14:50.165 --> 00:14:54.231
That's why people love them.
It's also very easy to

00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:58.298
integrate exponentials.
And, half of you integrated

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:03.015
instead of differentiating.
So, we will try this and see if

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:07.000
we can pick r so that it's a
solution.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.363
Okay, well, I will plug in,
then.

00:15:09.363 --> 00:15:12.761
Substitute, in other words,
and what do we get?

00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:16.602
Well, for y double prime,
I get r squared e to the rt.

00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:19.926
That's y double prime

00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:22.732
because each time you
differentiate it,

00:15:22.732 --> 00:15:25.687
you put an extra power of r out
in front.

00:15:25.687 --> 00:15:27.534
But otherwise,
do nothing.

00:15:27.534 --> 00:15:33.000
The next term will be r times,
sorry, I forgot the constant.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.060
Capital A times r e to the rt,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.399
and then there's the last term,
B times y itself,

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.834
which is B e to the rt.

00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:44.617
And, that's supposed to be
equal to zero.

00:15:44.617 --> 00:15:48.582
So, I have to choose r so that
this becomes equal to zero.

00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:51.295
Now, you see,
the e to the rt

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:54.913
occurs as a factor in every
term, and the e to the rt

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:57.626
is never zero.
And therefore,

00:15:57.626 --> 00:16:01.730
you can divide it out because
it's always a positive number,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:07.727
regardless of the value of t.
So, I can cancel out from each

00:16:07.727 --> 00:16:10.909
term.
And, what I'm left with is the

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:16.454
equation r squared plus ar plus
b equals zero.

00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:19.636
We are trying to find values of

00:16:19.636 --> 00:16:24.272
r that satisfy that equation.
And that, dear hearts,

00:16:24.272 --> 00:16:29.000
is why you learn to solve
quadratic equations in high

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.363
school, in order that in this
moment, you would be now ready

00:16:34.363 --> 00:16:41.000
to find how spring-mass systems
behave when they are damped.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.782
This is called the
characteristic equation.

00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:52.843
The characteristic equation of
the ODE, or of the system of the

00:16:52.843 --> 00:16:57.284
spring mass system,
which it's modeling,

00:16:57.284 --> 00:17:02.637
the characteristic equation of
the system, okay?

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:08.558
Okay, now, we solve it,
but now, from high school you

00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:14.984
know there are several cases.
And, each of those cases

00:17:14.984 --> 00:17:17.879
corresponds to a different
behavior.

00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:22.097
And, the cases depend upon what
the roots look like.

00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:25.819
The possibilities are the roots
could be real,

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.045
and distinct.
That's the easiest case to

00:17:29.045 --> 00:17:31.939
handle.
The roots might be a pair of

00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:36.972
complex conjugate numbers.
That's harder to handle,

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:40.753
but we are ready to do it.
And, the third case,

00:17:40.753 --> 00:17:45.027
which is the one most in your
problem set is the most

00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:48.643
puzzling: when the roots are
real, and equal.

00:17:48.643 --> 00:17:53.575
And, I'm going to talk about
those three cases in that order.

00:17:53.575 --> 00:17:57.849
So, the first case is the roots
are real and unequal.

00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:02.616
If I tell you they are unequal,
and I will put down real to

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:07.047
make that clear.
Well, that is by far the

00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:11.311
simplest case because
immediately, one sees we have

00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:13.785
two roots.
They are different,

00:18:13.785 --> 00:18:17.026
and therefore,
we get our two solutions

00:18:17.026 --> 00:18:19.926
immediately.
So, the solutions are,

00:18:19.926 --> 00:18:24.788
the general solution to the
equation, I write down without

00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:29.991
further ado as y equals c1 e to
the r1 t plus c2 e to the r2 t.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.187
There's our solution.
Now, because that was so easy,

00:18:38.187 --> 00:18:42.868
and we didn't have to do any
work, I'd like to extend this

00:18:42.868 --> 00:18:48.123
case a little bit by using it as
an example of how you put in the

00:18:48.123 --> 00:18:51.325
initial conditions,
how to put in the c.

00:18:51.325 --> 00:18:54.938
So, let me work a specific
numerical example,

00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:59.782
since we are not going to try
to do this theoretically until

00:18:59.782 --> 00:19:04.316
next Wednesday.
Let's just do a numerical

00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:07.095
example.
So, suppose I take the

00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:11.635
constants to be the damping
constant to be a four,

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:16.546
and the spring constant,
I'll take the mass to be one,

00:19:16.546 --> 00:19:19.789
and the spring constant to be
three.

00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:24.329
So, there's more damping here,
damping force here.

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:31.000
You can't really talk that way
since the units are different.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.857
But, this number is bigger than
that one.

00:19:33.857 --> 00:19:35.928
That seems clear,
at any rate.

00:19:35.928 --> 00:19:39.285
Okay, now, what was the
characteristic equation?

00:19:39.285 --> 00:19:41.857
Look, now watch.
Please do what I do.

00:19:41.857 --> 00:19:45.714
I've found in the past,
even by the middle of the term,

00:19:45.714 --> 00:19:50.000
there are still students who
feel that they must substitute y

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.928
equals e to the rt,
and go through that whole

00:19:53.928 --> 00:19:57.357
little derivation to find that
you don't do that.

00:19:57.357 --> 00:20:02.261
It's a waste of time.
I did it that you might not

00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:06.532
ever have to do it again.
Immediately write down the

00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:10.302
characteristic equation.
That's not very hard.

00:20:10.302 --> 00:20:14.992
r squared plus 4r plus three
equals zero.

00:20:14.992 --> 00:20:17.840
And, if you can write down its

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.101
roots immediately,
splendid.

00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:23.954
But, let's not assume that
level of competence.

00:20:23.954 --> 00:20:29.063
So, it's r plus three times r
plus one equals zero.

00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:33.000
Okay, you factor it.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.126
This being 18.03,
a lot of the times the roots

00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:39.322
will be integers when they are
not, God forbid,

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.240
you will have to use the
quadratic formula.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.533
But here, the roots were
integers.

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:47.312
It is, after all,
only the first example.

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:50.230
So, the solution,
the general solution is y

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.260
equals c1 e to the negative,
notice the root is minus three

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.970
and minus one,
minus 3t plus c2 e to the

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.000
negative t.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.139
Now, suppose it's an initial
value problem.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:06.755
So, I gave you an initial
condition.

00:21:06.755 --> 00:21:11.090
Suppose the initial conditions
were that y of zero were one.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.332
So, at the start,

00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:16.621
the mass has been moved over to
the position,

00:21:16.621 --> 00:21:18.938
one, here.
Well, we expected it,

00:21:18.938 --> 00:21:22.899
then, to start doing that.
But, this is fairly heavily

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:25.141
damped.
This is heavily damped.

00:21:25.141 --> 00:21:30.000
I'm going to assume that the
mass starts at rest.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.680
So, the spring is distended.
The masses over here.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.962
But, there's no motion at times
zero this way or that way.

00:21:37.962 --> 00:21:40.516
In other words,
I'm not pushing it.

00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:44.572
I'm just releasing it and
letting it do its thing after

00:21:44.572 --> 00:21:46.826
that.
Okay, so y prime of zero,

00:21:46.826 --> 00:21:49.380
I'll assume, is zero.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.211
So, it starts at rest,
but in the extended position,

00:21:53.211 --> 00:21:56.892
one unit to the right of the
equilibrium position.

00:21:56.892 --> 00:22:02.000
Now, all you have to do is use
these two conditions.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.357
Notice I have to have two
conditions because there are two

00:22:06.357 --> 00:22:09.186
constants I have to find the
value of.

00:22:09.186 --> 00:22:11.556
All right, so,
let's substitute,

00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:15.608
well, we're going to have to
calculate the derivative.

00:22:15.608 --> 00:22:18.284
So, why don't we do that right
away?

00:22:18.284 --> 00:22:22.948
So, this is minus three c1 e to
the minus 3t minus c2 e to the

00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:27.000
negative t.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.319
And now, if I substitute in at
zero, when t equals zero,

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:34.382
what do I get?
Well, the first equation,

00:22:34.382 --> 00:22:38.701
the left says that y of zero
should be one.

00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:41.136
And, the right says this is
one.

00:22:41.136 --> 00:22:43.570
So, it's c1 plus c2.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.654
That's the result of
substituting t equals zero.

00:22:47.654 --> 00:22:49.774
How about substituting?

00:22:49.774 --> 00:22:53.465
What should I substitute in the
second equation?

00:22:53.465 --> 00:22:56.842
Well, y prime of zero is zero.

00:22:56.842 --> 00:23:01.162
So, if the second equation,
when I put in t equals zero,

00:23:01.162 --> 00:23:05.324
the left side is zero according
to that initial value,

00:23:05.324 --> 00:23:12.000
and the right side is negative
three c1 minus c2.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.735
You see what you end up with,
therefore, is a pair of

00:23:15.735 --> 00:23:19.974
simultaneous linear equations.
And, this is why you learn to

00:23:19.974 --> 00:23:24.284
study linear set of pairs of
simultaneous linear equations in

00:23:24.284 --> 00:23:26.870
high school.
These are among the most

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.672
important.
Solving problems of this type

00:23:29.672 --> 00:23:33.695
are among the most important
applications of that kind of

00:23:33.695 --> 00:23:37.000
algebra, and this kind of
algebra.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.461
All right, what's the answer
finally?

00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:45.942
Well, if I add the two of them,
I get minus 2c1 equals one.

00:23:45.942 --> 00:23:49.884
So, c1 is equal to minus one
half.

00:23:49.884 --> 00:23:54.307
And, if c1 is minus a half,

00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:57.576
then c2 is minus 3c1.

00:23:57.576 --> 00:24:02.000
So, c2 is three halves.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.014
The final question is,
what does that look like as a

00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:14.551
solution?
Well, in general,

00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:17.921
these combinations of two
exponentials aren't very easy to

00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:20.640
plot by yourself.
That's one of the reasons you

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.128
are being given this little
visual which plots them for you.

00:24:24.128 --> 00:24:26.256
All you have to do is,
as you'll see,

00:24:26.256 --> 00:24:28.798
set the damping constant,
set the constants,

00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:31.162
set the initial conditions,
and by magic,

00:24:31.162 --> 00:24:34.000
the curve appears on the
screen.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.631
And, if you change either of
the constants,

00:24:40.631 --> 00:24:48.210
the curve will change nicely
right along with it.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:57.684
So, the solution is y equals
minus one half e to the minus 3t

00:24:57.684 --> 00:25:06.684
plus three halves e to the
negative t.

00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:11.478
How does it look?

00:25:11.478 --> 00:25:16.695
Well, I don't expect you to be
able to plot that by yourself,

00:25:16.695 --> 00:25:19.478
but you can at least get
started.

00:25:19.478 --> 00:25:23.478
It does have to satisfy the
initial conditions.

00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:28.608
That means it should start at
one, and its starting slope is

00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:32.000
zero.
So, it starts like that.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.371
These are both declining
exponentials.

00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:40.201
This declines very rapidly,
this somewhat more slowly.

00:25:40.201 --> 00:25:44.940
It does something like that.
If this term were a lot,

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.041
lot more negative,
I mean, that's the way that

00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:54.236
particular solution looks.
How might other solutions look?

00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:57.426
I'll draw a few other
possibilities.

00:25:57.426 --> 00:26:00.706
If the initial term,
if, for example,

00:26:00.706 --> 00:26:04.625
the initial slope were quite
negative, well,

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:09.000
that would have start like
this.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.553
Now, just your experience of
physics, or of the real world

00:26:12.553 --> 00:26:15.794
suggests that if I give,
if I start the thing at one,

00:26:15.794 --> 00:26:19.535
but give it a strongly negative
push, it's going to go beyond

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:22.651
the equilibrium position,
and then come back again.

00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:26.205
But, because the damping is
big, it's not going to be able

00:26:26.205 --> 00:26:29.010
to get through that.
The equilibrium position,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.815
a second time,
is going to look something like

00:26:31.815 --> 00:26:34.577
that.
Or, if I push it in that

00:26:34.577 --> 00:26:37.993
direction, the positive
direction, that it starts off

00:26:37.993 --> 00:26:41.476
with a positive slope.
But it loses its energy because

00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:44.893
the spring is pulling it.
It comes and does something

00:26:44.893 --> 00:26:46.798
like that.
So, in other words,

00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:49.624
it might go down.
Cut across the equilibrium

00:26:49.624 --> 00:26:52.055
position, come back again,
it do that?

00:26:52.055 --> 00:26:55.472
No, that it cannot do.
I was considering giving you a

00:26:55.472 --> 00:26:58.823
problem to prove that,
but I got tired of making out

00:26:58.823 --> 00:27:01.648
the problems set,
and decided I tortured you

00:27:01.648 --> 00:27:05.000
enough already,
as you will see.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.461
So, anyway, these are different
possibilities for the way that

00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:14.957
can look.
This case, where it just

00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:20.677
returns in the long run is
called the over-damped case,

00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:24.703
over-damped.
Now, there is another case

00:27:24.703 --> 00:27:30.000
where the thing oscillates back
and forth.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.847
We would expect to get that
case if the damping is very

00:27:33.847 --> 00:27:37.195
little or nonexistent.
Then, there's very little

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:41.470
preventing the mass from doing
that, although we do expect if

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.531
there's any damping at all,
we expect it ultimately to get

00:27:45.531 --> 00:27:48.737
nearer and nearer to the
equilibrium position.

00:27:48.737 --> 00:27:51.872
Mathematically,
what does that correspond to?

00:27:51.872 --> 00:27:55.007
Well, that's going to
correspond to case two,

00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:59.887
where the roots are complex.
The roots are complex,

00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:03.061
and this is why,
let's call the roots,

00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:08.209
in that case we know that the
roots are of the form a plus or

00:28:08.209 --> 00:28:10.697
minus bi.
There are two roots,

00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:13.442
and they are a complex
conjugate.

00:28:13.442 --> 00:28:16.273
All right, let's take one of
them.

00:28:16.273 --> 00:28:20.820
What does a correspond to in
terms of the exponential?

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.337
Well, remember,
the function of the r was,

00:28:24.337 --> 00:28:30.000
it's this r when we tried our
exponential solution.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.462
So, what we formally,
this means we get a complex

00:28:34.462 --> 00:28:38.180
solution.
The complex solution y equals e

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.851
to this, let's use one of them,
let's say, (a plus bi) times t.

00:28:43.851 --> 00:28:47.012
The question is,

00:28:47.012 --> 00:28:51.474
what do we do that?
We are not really interested,

00:28:51.474 --> 00:28:56.680
I don't know what a complex
solution to that thing means.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.886
It doesn't have any meaning.
What I want to know is how y

00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:07.000
behaves or how x behaves in that
picture.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.669
And, that better be a real
function because otherwise I

00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:14.815
don't know what to do with it.
So, we are looking for two real

00:29:14.815 --> 00:29:17.669
functions, the y1 and the y2.
But, in fact,

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:20.252
what we've got is one complex
function.

00:29:20.252 --> 00:29:22.902
All right, now,
a theorem to the rescue:

00:29:22.902 --> 00:29:26.708
this, I'm not going to save for
Wednesday because it's so

00:29:26.708 --> 00:29:30.864
simple.
So, the theorem is that if you

00:29:30.864 --> 00:29:36.021
have a complex solution,
u plus iv, so each of these is

00:29:36.021 --> 00:29:40.127
a function of time,
u plus iv is the complex

00:29:40.127 --> 00:29:45.188
solution to a real differential
equation with constant

00:29:45.188 --> 00:29:49.198
coefficients.
Well, it doesn't have to have

00:29:49.198 --> 00:29:53.209
constant coefficients.
It has to be linear.

00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:59.034
Let me just write it out to y
double prime plus A y prime plus

00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:04.000
B y equals zero.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.207
Suppose you got a complex
solution to that equation.

00:30:08.207 --> 00:30:11.424
These are understood to be real
numbers.

00:30:11.424 --> 00:30:15.797
They are the damping constant
and the spring constant.

00:30:15.797 --> 00:30:20.335
Then, the conclusion is that u
and v are real solutions.

00:30:20.335 --> 00:30:23.387
In other words,
having found a complex

00:30:23.387 --> 00:30:28.172
solution, all you have to do is
take its real and imaginary

00:30:28.172 --> 00:30:31.967
parts, and voila,
you've got your two solutions

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:37.000
you were looking for for the
original equation.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.963
Now, that might seem like
magic, but it's easy.

00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:43.894
It's so easy it's the sort of
theorem I could spend one minute

00:30:43.894 --> 00:30:46.793
proving for you now.
What's the reason for it?

00:30:46.793 --> 00:30:50.724
Well, the main thing I want you
to get out of this argument is

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:54.332
to see that it absolutely
depends upon these coefficients

00:30:54.332 --> 00:30:56.523
being real.
You have to have a real

00:30:56.523 --> 00:30:59.164
differential equation for this
to be true.

00:30:59.164 --> 00:31:03.491
Otherwise, it's certainly not.
So, the proof is,

00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:06.473
what does it mean to be a
solution?

00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:10.333
It means when you plug in A (u
plus iv) plus,

00:31:10.333 --> 00:31:14.719
prime,
plus B times u plus iv,

00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:17.526
what am I supposed to get?

00:31:17.526 --> 00:31:20.596
Zero.
Well, now, separate these into

00:31:20.596 --> 00:31:24.631
the real and imaginary parts.
What does it say?

00:31:24.631 --> 00:31:29.807
It says u double prime plus A u
prime plus B u,

00:31:29.807 --> 00:31:35.157
that's the real part of
this expression when I expand it

00:31:35.157 --> 00:31:39.318
out.
And, I've got an imaginary

00:31:39.318 --> 00:31:43.151
part, too, which all have the
coefficient i.

00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:46.807
So, from here,
I get v double prime plus i

00:31:46.807 --> 00:31:51.621
times A v prime plus 
i times B v.

00:31:51.621 --> 00:31:57.149
So, this is the imaginary part.
Now, here I have something with

00:31:57.149 --> 00:32:02.320
a real part plus the imaginary
part, i, times the imaginary

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.886
part is zero.
Well, the only way that can

00:32:05.886 --> 00:32:11.236
happen is if the real part is
zero, and the imaginary part is

00:32:11.236 --> 00:32:15.726
separately zero.
So, the conclusion is that

00:32:15.726 --> 00:32:19.445
therefore this part must be
zero, and therefore this part

00:32:19.445 --> 00:32:23.496
must be zero because the two of
them together make the complex

00:32:23.496 --> 00:32:27.082
number zero plus zero i.
Now, what does it mean for the

00:32:27.082 --> 00:32:31.000
real part to be zero?
It means that u is a solution.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.685
This, the imaginary part zero
means v is a solution,

00:32:34.685 --> 00:32:36.925
and therefore,
just what I said.

00:32:36.925 --> 00:32:39.960
u and v are solutions to the
real equation.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.440
Where did I use the fact that A
and B were real numbers and not

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.547
complex numbers?
In knowing that this is the

00:32:47.547 --> 00:32:51.088
real part, I had to know that A
was a real number.

00:32:51.088 --> 00:32:54.629
If A were something like one
plus i,

00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:57.953
I'd be screwed,
I mean, because then I couldn't

00:32:57.953 --> 00:33:02.000
say that this was the real part
anymore.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.805
So, saying that's the real
part, and this is the imaginary

00:33:07.805 --> 00:33:12.796
part, I was using the fact that
these two numbers,

00:33:12.796 --> 00:33:17.481
constants, were real constants:
very important.

00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:20.842
So, what is the case two
solution?

00:33:20.842 --> 00:33:26.750
Well, what are the real and
imaginary parts 

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:31.231
of (a plus b i) t?
Well, y equals e to the at +

00:33:31.231 --> 00:33:37.365
ibt.
Okay, you've had experience.

00:33:37.365 --> 00:33:42.179
You know how to do this now.
That's e to the at

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:47.247
times, well, the real part is,
well, let's write it this way.

00:33:47.247 --> 00:33:51.724
The real part is e to the at
times cosine b t.

00:33:51.724 --> 00:33:54.934
Notice how the a and b enter

00:33:54.934 --> 00:33:58.397
into the expression.
That's the real part.

00:33:58.397 --> 00:34:03.297
And, the imaginary part is e to
the at times the sine of bt.

00:34:03.297 --> 00:34:07.301
And therefore,

00:34:07.301 --> 00:34:10.276
the solution,
both of these must,

00:34:10.276 --> 00:34:13.901
therefore, be solutions to the
equation.

00:34:13.901 --> 00:34:18.084
And therefore,
the general solution to the ODE

00:34:18.084 --> 00:34:21.895
is y equals, now,
you've got to put in the

00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:26.171
arbitrary constants.
It's a nice thing to do to

00:34:26.171 --> 00:34:29.611
factor out the e to the at.

00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:32.585
It makes it look a little
better.

00:34:32.585 --> 00:34:39.000
And so, the constants are c1
cosine bt and c2 sine bt.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.791
Yeah, but what does that look
like?

00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:45.651
Well, you know that too.
This is an exponential,

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:49.099
which controls the amplitude.
But this guy,

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:53.780
which is a combination of two
sinusoidal oscillations with

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.803
different amplitudes,
but with the same frequency,

00:34:57.803 --> 00:35:01.991
the b's are the same in both of
them, and therefore,

00:35:01.991 --> 00:35:04.865
this is, itself,
a purely sinusoidal

00:35:04.865 --> 00:35:09.441
oscillation.
So, in other words,

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:15.608
I don't have room to write it,
but it's equal to,

00:35:15.608 --> 00:35:20.363
you know.
It's a good example of where

00:35:20.363 --> 00:35:27.944
you'd use that trigonometric
identity I spent time on before

00:35:27.944 --> 00:35:31.388
the exam.
Okay, let's work a quick

00:35:31.388 --> 00:35:33.586
example just to see how this
works out.

00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:36.595
Well, let's get rid of this.
Okay, let's now make the

00:35:36.595 --> 00:35:39.082
damping, since this is showing
oscillations,

00:35:39.082 --> 00:35:42.669
it must correspond to the case
where the damping is less strong

00:35:42.669 --> 00:35:44.578
compared with the spring
constant.

00:35:44.578 --> 00:35:47.702
So, the theorem is that if you
have a complex solution,

00:35:47.702 --> 00:35:50.537
u plus iv, so each of these is
a function of time,

00:35:50.537 --> 00:35:53.603
u plus iv is the
complex solution to a real

00:35:53.603 --> 00:35:56.380
differential equation with
constant coefficients.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.983
A stiff spring,
one that pulls with hard force

00:35:58.983 --> 00:36:01.586
is going to make that thing go
back and forth,

00:36:01.586 --> 00:36:05.000
particularly at the dipping is
weak.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.621
So, let's use almost the same
equation as I've just concealed.

00:36:09.621 --> 00:36:12.424
But, do you remember a used
four here?

00:36:12.424 --> 00:36:17.121
Okay, before we used three and
we got the solution to look like

00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:19.696
that.
Now, we will give it a little

00:36:19.696 --> 00:36:23.333
more energy by putting some
moxie in the springs.

00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:26.742
So now, the spring is pulling a
little harder,

00:36:26.742 --> 00:36:30.000
bigger force,
a stiffer spring.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.137
Okay, the characteristic
equation is now going to be r

00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:40.857
squared plus 4r plus five is
equal to zero.

00:36:40.857 --> 00:36:43.862
And therefore,
if I solve for r,

00:36:43.862 --> 00:36:49.096
I'm not going to bother trying
to factor this because I

00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:54.428
prepared for this lecture,
and I know, quadratic formula

00:36:54.428 --> 00:37:00.147
time, minus four plus or minus
the square root of b squared,

00:37:00.147 --> 00:37:05.382
16, minus four times five,
16 minus 20 is negative four

00:37:05.382 --> 00:37:09.206
all over two.
And therefore,

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:13.428
that makes negative two plus or
minus, this makes,

00:37:13.428 --> 00:37:15.841
simply, i.
2i divided by two,

00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:19.460
which is i.
So, the exponential solution is

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.768
e to the negative two,
you don't have to write this

00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:26.698
in.
You can get the thing directly.

00:37:26.698 --> 00:37:31.782
t, let's use the one with the
plus sign, and that's going to

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:36.693
give, as the real solutions,
e to the negative two t times

00:37:36.693 --> 00:37:41.691
cosine t,
and e to the negative 2t times

00:37:41.691 --> 00:37:46.000
the sine of t.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.229
And therefore,
the solution is going to be y

00:37:51.229 --> 00:37:58.283
equals e to the negative 2t
times

00:37:58.283 --> 00:38:04.000
(c1 cosine t plus c2 sine t).

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.049
If you want to put initial
conditions, you can put them in

00:38:08.049 --> 00:38:12.453
the same way I did them before.
Suppose we use the same initial

00:38:12.453 --> 00:38:15.650
conditions: y of zero 
equals one,

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.699
and y prime of zero equals one,
equals zero,

00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:22.043
let's say, wait,
blah, blah, blah,

00:38:22.043 --> 00:38:24.956
zero, yeah.
Okay, I'd like to take time to

00:38:24.956 --> 00:38:30.000
actually do the calculation,
but there's nothing new in it.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.150
I'd have to take,
calculate the derivative here,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:40.301
and then I would substitute in,
solve equations,

00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:44.684
and when you do all that,
just as before,

00:38:44.684 --> 00:38:50.712
the answer that you get is y
equals e to the negative 2t,

00:38:50.712 --> 00:38:55.753
so,
choose the constants c1 and c2

00:38:55.753 --> 00:39:01.780
by solving linear equations,
and the answer is cosine t,

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:07.698
so, c1 turns out to be one,
and c2 turns out to be two,

00:39:07.698 --> 00:39:11.516
I hope.
Okay, I want to know,

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:15.631
but what does that look like?
Well, use that trigonometric

00:39:15.631 --> 00:39:18.013
identity.
The e to the negative 2t

00:39:18.013 --> 00:39:21.622
is just a real
factor which is going to

00:39:21.622 --> 00:39:24.005
reproduce itself.
The question is,

00:39:24.005 --> 00:39:28.481
what is cosine t plus 2 sine t
look like?

00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:31.513
What's its amplitude as a pure
oscillation?

00:39:31.513 --> 00:39:35.411
It's the square root of one
plus two squared.

00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:39.237
Remember, it depends on looking

00:39:39.237 --> 00:39:41.909
at that little triangle,
which is one,

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:44.796
two, this is a different scale
than that.

00:39:44.796 --> 00:39:47.828
And here is the square root of
five, right?

00:39:47.828 --> 00:39:50.066
And, here is phi,
the phase lag.

00:39:50.066 --> 00:39:53.026
So, it's equal to the square
root of five.

00:39:53.026 --> 00:39:57.213
So, it's the square root of
five times e to 

00:39:57.213 --> 00:40:00.606
the negative 2t,
and the stuff inside is the

00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:06.158
cosine of, the frequency is one.
Circular frequency is one,

00:40:06.158 --> 00:40:10.808
so it's t minus phi,
where phi is this angle.

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:13.133
How big is that,
one and two?

00:40:13.133 --> 00:40:16.703
Well, if this were the square
root of three,

00:40:16.703 --> 00:40:20.689
which is a little less than
two, it would be 60 infinity.

00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:24.758
So, this must be 70 infinity.
So, phi is 70 infinity plus or minus

00:40:24.758 --> 00:40:29.144
five, let's say.
So, it looks like a slightly

00:40:29.144 --> 00:40:32.972
delayed cosine curve,
but the amplitude is falling.

00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:35.806
So, it has to start.
So, if I draw it,

00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:39.558
here's one, here is,
let's say, the square root of

00:40:39.558 --> 00:40:43.234
five up about here.
Then, the square root of five

00:40:43.234 --> 00:40:47.599
times e to the negative 2t
looks maybe

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:51.427
something like this.
So, that's square root of five

00:40:51.427 --> 00:40:54.490
e to the negative 2t.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.009
This is cosine t,
but shoved over by not quite pi

00:40:59.009 --> 00:41:02.314
over two.
It starts at one,

00:41:02.314 --> 00:41:06.334
and with the slope zero.
So, the solution starts like

00:41:06.334 --> 00:41:08.730
this.
It has to be guided in its

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:13.369
amplitude by this function out
there, and in between it's the

00:41:13.369 --> 00:41:15.920
cosine curve.
But it's moved over.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.017
So, if this is pi over two,
the first time it crosses,

00:41:20.017 --> 00:41:24.423
it's 72 infinity to the right 
of that. So, if this is pi 

00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:27.670
over two, it's pi over two plus 
70 infinity where it crosses.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.000
So, it must be doing something
like this.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.781
And now, on the other side,
it's got to stay within the

00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:40.765
same amplitude.
So, it must be doing something

00:41:40.765 --> 00:41:43.598
like this.
Okay, that gets us to,

00:41:43.598 --> 00:41:48.645
if this is the under-damped
case, because if you're trying

00:41:48.645 --> 00:41:54.223
to do this with a swinging door,
it means the door's going to be

00:41:54.223 --> 00:41:59.093
swinging back and forth.
Or, our little mass now hidden,

00:41:59.093 --> 00:42:04.317
but you could see it behind
that board, is going to be doing

00:42:04.317 --> 00:42:07.935
this.
But, it never stops.

00:42:07.935 --> 00:42:11.225
It never stops.
It doesn't realize,

00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:16.741
but not in theoretical life.
So, this is the under-damped.

00:42:16.741 --> 00:42:21.967
All right, so it's like
Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

00:42:21.967 --> 00:42:25.451
That's too hot,
and this is too cold.

00:42:25.451 --> 00:42:30.000
What is the thing which is just
right?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.193
Well, that's the thing you're
going to study on the problem

00:42:37.193 --> 00:42:40.666
set.
So, just right is called

00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:46.248
critically damped.
It's what people aim for in

00:42:46.248 --> 00:42:51.457
trying to damp motion that they
don't want.

00:42:51.457 --> 00:42:58.527
Now, what's critically damped?
It must be the case just in

00:42:58.527 --> 00:43:03.583
between these two.
Neither complex,

00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:08.530
nor the roots different.
It's the case of two equal

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.893
roots.
So, r squared plus Ar plus B

00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:17.038
equals zero
has two equal roots.

00:43:17.038 --> 00:43:20.501
Now, that's a very special
equation.

00:43:20.501 --> 00:43:24.855
Suppose we call the root,
since all of these,

00:43:24.855 --> 00:43:30.000
notice these roots in this
physical case.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.357
The roots always turn out to be
negative numbers,

00:43:33.357 --> 00:43:37.413
or have a negative real part.
I'm going to call the root a.

00:43:37.413 --> 00:43:40.491
So, r equals negative a,
the root.

00:43:40.491 --> 00:43:43.219
a is understood to be a
positive number.

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:45.877
I want that root to be really
negative.

00:43:45.877 --> 00:43:50.073
Then, the equation looks like,
the characteristic equation is

00:43:50.073 --> 00:43:53.640
going to be r plus a,
right, if the root is negative

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.207
a, squared because it's a double
root.

00:43:57.207 --> 00:44:01.474
And, that means the equation is
of the form r squared plus two

00:44:01.474 --> 00:44:07.000
times a r plus a squared equals
zero.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.536
In other words,
the ODE looked like this.

00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:15.576
The ODE looked like y double
prime plus 2a y prime

00:44:15.576 --> 00:44:18.051
plus, in other words,

00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:22.914
the damping and the spring
constant were related in this

00:44:22.914 --> 00:44:26.628
special wake,
that for a given value of the

00:44:26.628 --> 00:44:30.695
spring constant,
there was exactly one value of

00:44:30.695 --> 00:44:36.000
the damping which produced this
in between case.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.539
Now, what's the problem
connected with it?

00:44:39.539 --> 00:44:42.302
Well, the problem,
unfortunately,

00:44:42.302 --> 00:44:46.618
is staring us in the face when
we want to solve it.

00:44:46.618 --> 00:44:51.712
The problem is that we have a
solution, but it is y equals e

00:44:51.712 --> 00:44:56.892
to the minus at.
I don't have another root to

00:44:56.892 --> 00:45:01.500
get another solution with.
And, the question is,

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.285
where do I get that other
solution from?

00:45:04.285 --> 00:45:06.785
Now, there are three ways to
get it.

00:45:06.785 --> 00:45:09.285
Well, there are four ways to
get it.

00:45:09.285 --> 00:45:12.571
You look it up in Euler.
That's the fourth way.

00:45:12.571 --> 00:45:16.785
That's the real way to do it.
But, I've given you one way as

00:45:16.785 --> 00:45:19.428
problem number one on the
problem set.

00:45:19.428 --> 00:45:23.285
I've given you another way as
problem number two on the

00:45:23.285 --> 00:45:26.071
problem set.
And, the third way you will

00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:28.928
have to wait for about a week
and a half.

00:45:28.928 --> 00:45:33.000
And, I will give you a third
way, too.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.780
By that time,
you won't want to see any more

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.857
ways.
But, I'd like to introduce you

00:45:39.857 --> 00:45:43.901
to the way on the problem set.
And, it is this,

00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:47.769
that if you know one solution
to an equation,

00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:51.549
which looks like a linear
equation, in fact,

00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:54.274
the piece can be functions of
t.

00:45:54.274 --> 00:45:59.637
They don't have to be constant,
so I'll use the books notation

00:45:59.637 --> 00:46:05.000
with p's and q's.
y prime plus q y equals zero.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.888
If you know one solution,
there's an absolute,

00:46:08.888 --> 00:46:13.037
ironclad guarantee,
if you'll know that it's true

00:46:13.037 --> 00:46:17.098
because I'm asking you to prove
it for yourself.

00:46:17.098 --> 00:46:21.592
There's another of the form,
having this as a factor,

00:46:21.592 --> 00:46:24.444
one solution y one,
let's call it,

00:46:24.444 --> 00:46:28.419
y equals y1 u is
another solution.

00:46:28.419 --> 00:46:33.000
And, you will be able to find
u, I swear.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.354
Now, let's, in the remaining
couple of minutes carry that out

00:46:37.354 --> 00:46:41.564
just for this case because I
want you to see how to arrange

00:46:41.564 --> 00:46:44.975
the work nicely.
And, I want you to arrange your

00:46:44.975 --> 00:46:48.532
work when you do the problem
sets in the same way.

00:46:48.532 --> 00:46:52.306
So, the way to do it is,
the solution we know is e to

00:46:52.306 --> 00:46:56.298
the minus at.
So, we are going to look for a

00:46:56.298 --> 00:47:00.000
solution to this differential
equation.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.970
That's the differential
equation.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:08.633
And, the solution we are going
to look for is of the form e to

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:12.068
the negative at times u.

00:47:12.068 --> 00:47:17.082
Now, you're going to have to
make calculation like this

00:47:17.082 --> 00:47:20.702
several times in the course of
the term.

00:47:20.702 --> 00:47:23.488
Do it this way.
y prime equals,

00:47:23.488 --> 00:47:27.387
differentiate,
minus a e to the minus a t u

00:47:27.387 --> 00:47:33.236
plus e to the minus a
t u prime.

00:47:33.236 --> 00:47:37.153
And then, differentiate again.

00:47:37.153 --> 00:47:39.736
The answer will be a squared.

00:47:39.736 --> 00:47:43.540
You differentiate this:
a squared e to the negative at

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:47.057
u.
I'll have to do this a little

00:47:47.057 --> 00:47:50.215
fast, but the next term will be,
okay, minus,

00:47:50.215 --> 00:47:53.947
so this times u prime,
and from this are you going to

00:47:53.947 --> 00:47:57.464
get another minus.
So, combining what you get from

00:47:57.464 --> 00:48:00.693
here, and here,
you're going to get minus 2a e

00:48:00.693 --> 00:48:05.000
to the minus a t u prime.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.757
And then, there is a final
term, which comes from this,

00:48:08.757 --> 00:48:11.054
e to the minus a t u double
prime.

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:15.159
Two of these,
because of a piece here and a

00:48:15.159 --> 00:48:19.126
piece here combine to make that.
And now, to plug into the

00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:21.492
equation, you multiply this by
one.

00:48:21.492 --> 00:48:24.484
In other words,
you don't do anything to it.

00:48:24.484 --> 00:48:28.659
You multiply this line by 2a,
and you multiply that line by a

00:48:28.659 --> 00:48:32.000
squared, and you add them.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.673
On the left-hand side,
I get zero.

00:48:34.673 --> 00:48:39.048
What do I get on the right?
Notice how I've arrange the

00:48:39.048 --> 00:48:43.341
work so it adds nicely.
This has a squared times this,

00:48:43.341 --> 00:48:47.392
plus 2a times that,
plus one times that makes zero.

00:48:47.392 --> 00:48:50.956
2a times this plus one times
this makes zero.

00:48:50.956 --> 00:48:56.060
All that survives is e to the a
t u double prime,

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.382
and therefore,
e to the minus a t u double

00:48:59.382 --> 00:49:04.000
prime is equal to zero.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.981
So, please tell me,
what's u double prime?

00:49:06.981 --> 00:49:09.090
It's zero.
So, please tell me,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.927
what's u?
It's c1 t plus c2.

00:49:11.927 --> 00:49:14.181
Now, that gives me a whole

00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:17.818
family of solutions.
Just t would be enough because

00:49:17.818 --> 00:49:22.036
all I am doing is looking for
one solution that's different

00:49:22.036 --> 00:49:24.581
from e to the minus a t.

00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:28.218
And, that solution,
therefore, is y equals e to the

00:49:28.218 --> 00:49:32.000
minus a t times t.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.238
And, there's my second
solution.

00:49:34.238 --> 00:49:37.992
So, this is a solution of the
critically damped case.

00:49:37.992 --> 00:49:42.397
And, you are going to use it in
three or four of the different

00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:46.584
problems on the problem set.
But, I think you can deal with

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:50.917
virtually the whole problem set,
except for the last problem,

00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:51.917
now.
