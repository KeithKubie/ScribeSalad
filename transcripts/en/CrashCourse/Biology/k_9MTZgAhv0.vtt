00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.420
You're a miracle.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.699
Did you know that?

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.569
Today we're going to talk about
animal development and

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.069
the miracle of life.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.410
The process that animals go
through to turn, like,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.139
a sperm cell and an egg cell
into a multi-cellular

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.369
organism is incredible.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.800
It's not just incredible,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.170
it's unbelievably,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.460
transcendentally magnificent, man. Magnificent!

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.430
And dudes... the thing is:

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.970
we're all just,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.320
like, tubes!

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.210
OFFSCREEN: Dude, no edge.
HANK: I know.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.100
So, animals.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.859
They come in all sorts of shapes
and sizes and smartnesses

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.909
and things. And in our infinite
wisdom, humans have come up with

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.229
a system of classifying animals
based on how similar they

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.979
are to each other.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.899
Today we're going to be talking
about some differences between

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.089
animals at the phylum level, here,
which happen at the earliest

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:01.879
stage of development.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.199
That's because a bunch of really
big decisions are made within a

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.990
few moments of the sperm
fertilizing the egg,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.030
and how this early embryonic
groundwork is laid makes a big

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.590
difference when it comes to what
kind of amazing multicellular

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.340
being you're going to end up being.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.840
Or, you know, not so amazing.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.280
Hello, sea sponges!

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.430
Animal phyla range from the very
simplest, like sea sponges,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.930
to the more complicated.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.600
Signs of an animal's complexity
include how symmetrical it is,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.899
how many organs it has,
and how specialized its cells are.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.149
A sea sponge, for instance,
is a total freakin' mess

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.500
symmetry-wise and doesn't really
have any organs to speak of.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.229
In fact, if you were to blenderize
a live sea sponge and then leave

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.049
the sponge smoothie to settle
overnight, you'd wake up the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.270
next morning to find that the
surviving cells had found each

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.850
other and were reforming
themselves into a sea sponge again.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.960
Try doing that with any
other animal and-

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.880
-actually, NO.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.810
DO NOT TRY DOING THAT
WITH ANY OTHER ANIMAL.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.840
My point is, most animals are more
complicated than sponges, and an

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.439
animal's complexity has everything
to do with what happens in the

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.109
first couple of hours
of its development.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.229
And here's a neat rule of thumb:
the more complex an animal is,

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.840
the more it resembles a tube
with some different stuff

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.129
layered around it.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.019
And now's when you're like,
"Uh, Hank... uhh, what?"

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.209
Okay, so here's the deal:

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.200
A really important clue indicating
that you're dealing with a complex

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.390
life form is how many layers of
tissue it makes in its very early

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.730
stages of development. Sea sponges
make just one, things like

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.769
jellyfish and corals make two,
and all the more complicated

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:28.599
animals make three.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.700
So, the early stages of development
are similar for most animals.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.069
Remember, sperm cells and egg
cells are both gametes,

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.909
haploid cells that only carry
one set of chromosomes.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.700
Once the sperm fertilizes the egg,
the two haploid cells fuse their

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.700
information together and form
a zygote, one beautiful diploid

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.709
cell with two sets of chromosomes
that contain all the instructions

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.510
needed to create a
new living thing.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.970
Which is, of course,
totally far out.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.330
Fast forwarding to like an hour
and a half after fertilization:

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.319
The zygote has started dividing
and cleaving through mitosis,

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.680
resulting in 2, 4, 8, 16 cells
until it creates a solid ball

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.099
of 32 cells. This is
actually a morula.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.650
Or more-ah-luh.
At least according to this guy.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.470
LAPTOP: more-ah-luh, or more-u-luh.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.239
And the morula actually looks a lot
like a raspberry, or a mulberry,

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.939
which is what it's
named after in Latin.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.599
Mmm, juicy! Morula pie!

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.420
Oh god.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.709
They're going to
ban us from schools!

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.019
As more cells are created,
the solid wad of cells begins to

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.689
secrete a fluid that forms a
space in the center,

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.569
resulting in a hollow
sphere of cells called a blastula.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.569
Okay, so pay attention, because
here's where we get down

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.569
to the real business.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.799
Most animals that you just sort
of think of off the top

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.950
of your head have a mouth, right?
And by the same token,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.769
most of them have an anus.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.530
Yeah, go ahead and get your
giggles out because I'm going

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.189
to be saying anus
a lot in this video.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.549
For example, right now!

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.000
ANUS.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.140
So most animals have
a mouth and an anus.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.420
Wait for it:

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.920
Unless you're a sea sponge!

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840
Sponges don't have a
mouth OR an anus.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.129
And there are also other animals
like your sea anemones,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.530
your jellyfish, your corals,
that have just one hole that

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.230
serves as both mouth and anus.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.450
Aren't you glad we're a little
bit more complicated than that!?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.980
It's worth noting that these
animals have radial symmetry.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.880
All their junk kind of radiates
out from a central point that is

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.329
their mouthhole-slash-poohole,
and that is a little bit more

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.009
sophisticated than having no
symmetry at all, like a sponge,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.070
but just barely.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.400
I mean, their anus and their
mouth are the same thing.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.389
But more complex animals,
with the notable exception

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.949
of the echinoderms like starfish
and sand dollars exhibit

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.009
bilateral symmetry: We have
two-sided bodies that

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.650
look the same on both sides.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.770
Something else we have in common
is we have an anus that is,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.770
get this, in a different
place than our mouth.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.150
This separation is pretty key,
because it means that we as

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.020
animals are basically
built around a tube,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.580
a digestive tract, with a mouth at
one end and an anus at the other.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.759
The process of forming this tract
is called gastrulation,

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.190
and it's kind of a big deal.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.220
So, when we left our little
blastula, it was still just

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.669
hangin' out, a little, round,
hollow ball of cells.

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.729
Gastrulation begins when an
indentation starts to form at

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.660
a single point on the blastula.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.660
This place on the blastula that
starts to invaginate, or fold in

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.500
on itself, is called
the blastopore.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.630
Now for animals whose mouth and
anus are the same thing,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.490
this is where the development
stops, which is why they only

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.680
have one hole for
all their business.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.110
But in everything else,
the invagination continues

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.960
until the indentation makes its
way all the way through and opens

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.530
on the other side, creating what
is essentially a hollow bead

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.580
made of cells.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.560
Now we have a gastrula!

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.440
Now, two different things can
happen at this point,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440
depending on what kind of animal
this is going to be. It can either

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.039
be an animal whose mouth is the
orifice that's formed by the

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.870
blastopore, called a protostome,
or one whose anus is the structure

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.229
created by the blastospore,
a deuterostome.

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.610
Guess which one you are.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.979
Write it down.

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.610
I want to see your guesses.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.130
Chordates, that is to say all
vertebrates and a couple of our

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.160
relatives like starfish,
are deuterostomes,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.130
meaning we were once just a
butthole attached to a little

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.460
wad of cells.
And that includes you.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.210
And me.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.590
Congratulations!

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.990
And hopefully you're getting the
idea here: The formation of the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.610
digestive tract is the first thing
that happens in the development

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.000
of an animal, and it happens to
every living thing, whether it's

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.639
going to be a tardigrade
or a polar bear or a T Pain.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.160
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE!

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.539
Now so far the little hollow bead
of cells is basically two layers

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.759
of tissue thick: an outer layer
called the ectoderm, and an inner

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.710
layer called the endoderm.
These are called your germ layers.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.009
For those organisms that stop
developing at this point,

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.220
with that classy mouth-anus combo,
they only get two germ layers.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.940
They're called diploblastic,
and they were born that way,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.870
it's totally OK.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.970
But for us more complex animals,
whose mouths are separate

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.030
from our anuses-

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.650
Yes!

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.599
we develop a third layer of tissue,
making us triploblasts.

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:57.840
Here, the ectoderm is going to end
up being the animal's skin, nerves,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.690
spinal cord and most of its brain,
while the endoderm ends up forming

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.270
the digestive tract: the esophagus
and stomach and colon and stuff.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.800
And in addition, some of the cells
start breaking off between the

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.490
endoderm and the ectoderm and
form another layer called

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.240
the mesoderm.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.720
These will eventually end up as
the muscles, circulatory system,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.509
reproductive systems, and
in the case of vertebrates,

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:18.250
most of the bones.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.910
So what's our embryo looking
like now? Awesome. From here,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.599
this little guy is going to go on
to fulfill his destiny as a

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:26.800
ladybug or walrus or whatever.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.330
And now this seems to me like a
great time take a look at a

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.720
completely disproven theory that
biologists hold in the highest

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.759
contempt, but which is actually a
kind of useful way to think about

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.979
the way an animal embryo develops
into fully-formed animal.

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.879
Plus, it makes for a great

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:43.660
BIOLO-GRAPHY!

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:50.660
Back in the mid-1800's a German
zoologist named Ernst Haeckel

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:57.370
tried to prove what we now refer
to as Recapitulation Theory.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.419
Basically, and this is not basic
at all, recapitulation theory

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.949
states that "ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny."

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:05.569
Eh?

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.300
In other words, ontogeny,
or the growth and development

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.800
of an embryo, recapitulates,
or sums up, phylogeny,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.509
which is the evolutionary
history of a species.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.110
So this means, for instance,
that a human embryo over the

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.330
course of its development,
will go through all the

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.210
hundreds of millions of years
worth of evolutionary steps

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.800
that it took for a single-celled
organisms to evolve into a

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.349
fully-tricked-out person.

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:31.539
Haeckel was a contemporary
of Darwin, and On the

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:34.790
Origin of Species made a giant
impression on him, especially

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.750
a section of it that notes how
cool it is that all vertebrate

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.800
embryos look pretty similar
to one another, regardless of

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.280
whether they're a mammal
or a bird or a reptile.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.000
Darwin, however, cautioned that
this probably wasn't a very good

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.100
way of reconstructing the
history of evolution, he just

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.970
thought it meant that the
embryological similarities

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.960
were evidence of common
ancestry between species.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.330
Well, Haeckel was kind of a spaz,
and he definitely heard the first

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.020
part of Darwin's idea,
but not the rest.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.550
So Haeckel jumped on this idea
and very quickly wrote a couple

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.340
books about how the development
of an embryo mirrors the

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.790
evolutionary development
of adults of a species.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.320
Which is exactly what Darwin
said was not happening.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.260
Anyway, Haekel did spend a lot
of time looking at embryos

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.280
and observed that the slits
in the neck of the human embryo

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.480
resembled gill slits of fish,
which he took to mean that we

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.710
must have at one point
had a fish-like ancestor.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.500
He drew tons of figures of
different animal embryos in

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.840
different stages of
development to prove his theory,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.220
and his illustrations of embryos
started to make their way

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.420
into textbooks all over the world.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.610
Haeckel is exactly the sort of
person who really ticks other

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.590
scientists off because real
science-loving scientists

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.220
like to sit and think about
stuff and find out all the

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.630
problems with an idea before
they start publishing books

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.630
about it.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.010
And here Haeckel was,
firing off volume after volume,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.070
and before long all the "data"
he had "collected" convinced a

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.690
bunch of other people,
including Darwin actually,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.310
that he was onto something.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.000
But in the end it turned out that
Haeckel was kind of fiddling with

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.090
his drawings of embryos to make
the data fit his

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.940
Recapitulation Theory,
instead of, you know,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.730
making the theory
to fit the data.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.860
But by that time,
everybody already

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.550
knew about the theory,
and if there's anything harder

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.420
than teaching people something,
it's unteaching them something.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.170
So, here we are, almost 150 years
later, and we're still talking

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.960
about the Recapitulation Theory.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.570
But that might have less to do
with the stubbornness of

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.260
a bad idea than it does with the
fact that it actually makes a kind

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.250
of sense when you don't
take it literally.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.610
At some point in our embryonic
development, humans actually do

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.320
have gills slits like a fish,
and tails like a dog or a pig

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.360
or a jaguar, and webbed fingers
and toes like a frog.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.950
So while it's not true that
every zygote re-enacts all

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.180
of animal evolution,
the way that an animal

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.100
develops does reminds us
that we are, in fact,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.380
related to other Chordates.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.420
And we all start off
as just a tube.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.470
A mouth at one end,
an anus on the other.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.540
Which is pretty freakin' amazing.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.210
Thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Biology.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.530
If you're confused about any of
the anus-anus that we covered

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.600
today you can go back
and watch that now.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.690
If you have any questions for us,
you can leave them down in the

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.460
comments below or

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.270
Thank you for watching,
and we'll see you next time.
