00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.186
- [Voiceover] My question to you is,

00:00:02.186 --> 00:00:04.567
"Which of these two values is greater?"

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.557
22.9%?

00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:10.631
Or, the square root of 0.45?

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:12.347
And I encourage you to first try to see

00:00:12.347 --> 00:00:14.553
if you can think about
this without a calculator.

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:18.433
And then use a calculator
to see which one is larger.

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:21.365
Let's first try to do
it without a calculator.

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:23.453
So one thing that you
could try to say is--

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:24.566
Well look--

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:29.806
You could say that 22.9%

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:30.837
that's going to be less than--

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:34.274
I'm just gonna pick an
arbitrary number here.

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:36.701
Let's say that's less than 30%.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.896
So that's going to be less than--

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:39.533
and I picked 30% because it's

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.677
easy to calculate 30%,
or the square of 30%.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.659
So that's less than 30%.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.664
Or, it's another way of
saying that's less than 0.3.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:52.162
0.3

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:56.457
And then, we can try to
compare 0.3 to this thing here.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:59.580
And if 0.3 is less than this,

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.203
well, then 22.9% is going
to be less than this

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:04.535
'cause it's less than 0.3.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.693
So why don't I change the problem to that?

00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:08.467
Let's compare 0.3--

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:10.325
0.3

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:14.471
to square root-- to the square root of--

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:16.512
let me do that thing pink color--

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.900
to the square root of 0.45.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.840
And now I can use the squaring technique.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.158
What happens if I square
each of these quantities?

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.558
If I square this, 0.3 times 0.3,

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:32.520
let's see, three times three is nine.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.855
But you're multiplying two things

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.213
that each have one digit to the right,

00:01:35.213 --> 00:01:36.838
so you're gonna have
two digits to the right.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.044
So it's going to be .09.

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:41.935
And if you were to square this over here--

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.640
I'll just keep using the white--

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.917
if you were to square
this right over here,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:46.253
what's that going to be?

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:49.515
Well that's just going to be 0.45.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:53.299
So .09 is clearly less than 0.45.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.453
Or, 0.3 squared is clearly
less than square root of--

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:04.084
0.3 squared is less than the
square root of 0.45 squared.

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:08.325
And so we know that 0.3
is going to be less than,

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:13.288
is going to be less than
the square root of 0.45.

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:16.764
And so now we can say that 22.9%,

00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:18.517
if it's less than this,
and this is less than this,

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:22.390
well 22.9% must be less than that.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.378
Now another way you can do it,

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.373
you could take out a calculator--

00:02:25.373 --> 00:02:26.674
you could take out a calculator.

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:28.856
I'll do that. Just for kicks.

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.819
So let me get the calculator out.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.813
So, 22.9%, that's the same thing as--

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:39.560
that's the same thing as 0.229.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.452
So we really just want
to compare this quantity

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.577
to the square root of 0.45.

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:44.970
And there are two ways we can do it.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.293
We could do it the way I started.

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:50.107
You could square this and see
if it's greater than 0.45.

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:51.657
So let's do that.

00:02:51.657 --> 00:02:52.770
You could just square it.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.514
And you see "no."

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:57.099
This is 0.05.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.229
Which is clearly less than 0.45.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.371
And so that would validate this.

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:03.054
Or, you could do it the other way around.

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:04.157
You could just use your calculator

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.212
to calculate the square root of this.

00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:08.157
So you could say

00:03:08.157 --> 00:03:10.897
0.45

00:03:10.897 --> 00:03:12.574
and then take the square root.

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:14.759
The square root of this
value right over here

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.582
is approximately--

00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:19.830
is approximately 0.67.

00:03:20.962 --> 00:03:25.962
So this thing right over
here is approximately 0.67.

00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:28.566
Which is approximately 67%,

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.247
which is clearly greater than 22.9%.

00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:33.349
So a bunch of ways that
you could approach it.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.845
It is nice to be able to estimate things.

00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:36.530
Think in your head.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.746
So that if you didn't have
access to a calculator

00:03:38.746 --> 00:03:40.627
you could get a general sense of,

00:03:40.627 --> 00:03:44.343
"Hey, would you rather have a 22.9%

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.665
off the price of something?"

00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:48.847
Or, maybe some type of
new store could say,

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:52.341
"Hey, sales! Square root
of 0.45 off of all goods."

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:53.398
I don't know.
(chuckles)

00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:54.803
That can be an interesting thing.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:56.938
Could be very confusing for customers.

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.756
But, anyway. Hopefully this was helpful.
