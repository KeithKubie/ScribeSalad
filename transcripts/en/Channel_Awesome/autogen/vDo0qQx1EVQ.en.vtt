and the speed lines are going it's like
 

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.260
and the speed lines are going it's like
well technically that's not slow-mo

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.270
well technically that's not slow-mo
 

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.280
well technically that's not slow-mo
because the speed lines are going like

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:16.290
because the speed lines are going like
 

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.110

yeah and they set it up again very much

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:00.690
yeah and they set it up again very much
 

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.680
yeah and they set it up again very much

has now that motivation that that's the
one thing I'm shocked they didn't do

00:23:10.129 --> 00:23:10.139
one thing I'm shocked they didn't do
 

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.480
one thing I'm shocked they didn't do
more than this because that feels like

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:11.490
more than this because that feels like
 

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.019
more than this because that feels like

changes her mind a little bit I love
that battle between mind and body

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500
that battle between mind and body
 

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.919
that battle between mind and body
literally mind and body and I thought

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:33.929
literally mind and body and I thought
 

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:35.149
literally mind and body and I thought
that would have been interesting when

00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159
that would have been interesting when
 

00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:36.560
that would have been interesting when
she got the berserker and this like it

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:36.570
she got the berserker and this like it
 

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.360
she got the berserker and this like it
kind of changed her around too but it

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:38.370
kind of changed her around too but it
 

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.340
kind of changed her around too but it
did it doesn't quite she's already kind

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:40.350
did it doesn't quite she's already kind
 

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.850
did it doesn't quite she's already kind

of on her way there and it's still good
 

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.440
of on her way there and it's still good
progression but I thought that is such

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:45.450
progression but I thought that is such
 

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.590
progression but I thought that is such
an interesting element and even the big

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600
an interesting element and even the big
 

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.620
an interesting element and even the big
bad guy the one that she's hunting for a

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:51.630
bad guy the one that she's hunting for a
 

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.029
bad guy the one that she's hunting for a
while they tap on that in the manga to

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039
while they tap on that in the manga to
 

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:55.220
while they tap on that in the manga to
think he talks about you know way became

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:55.230

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.049
think he talks about you know way became
when he got his body or you know going

00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059
when he got his body or you know going
 

00:23:57.059 --> 00:23:59.690
when he got his body or you know going
from mind to mind body to body and how

00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700
from mind to mind body to body and how
 

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.580
from mind to mind body to body and how
it changes you and it's like that would

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:01.590

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:46.320
get it but I think that was such a
clever way because she is a robot now is

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.330
clever way because she is a robot now is
 

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.850
clever way because she is a robot now is
she a robot but she's one that's like

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:47.860

everywhere but like I see her and it's
like who's that and so I really think

00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:56.919
like who's that and so I really think
 

00:32:56.919 --> 00:32:58.560

that is a stylistic choice it came from
 

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.520
that is a stylistic choice it came from
a fact that early on I think it was an

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:29.530
a fact that early on I think it was an
 

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.440
a fact that early on I think it was an
homage to basically Tezuka and other

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:31.450
