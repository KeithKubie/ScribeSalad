00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:06.000
 I think it is necessary to transcend the prevailing borders 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 Changing the rules of the game 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.820
 I grew up in a farm 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.050
 My childhood was wonderful 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.630
 Because I grew up next to my father and worked in the field 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.890
 One of the things I learned 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.310
 The meaning of working throughout the day 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.900
 I think the farmer can be described as an entrepreneur 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 So I wanted to become an entrepreneur 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.280
 I decided to study computing for mobile devices 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.930
 I met my partner at work 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 I liked jogging 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.500
 We had the idea of ​​creating something in this area 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.070
 We want to help people change their lives 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.990
 Physical fitness affects all the activities we practice 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.820
 So we left our jobs and founded Runtastic 

00:00:58.622 --> 00:01:02.710
 The sport jogging feature connects you with the other person 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.116
 So jogging with my daughter was wonderful 

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:07.420
 Do you want to continue? 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.800
 Yes, we can 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.300
 I was 40 years old when I started running 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.110
 The whole thing began with a challenge 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.780
 My daughter, Alexis in the jogging race recorded 10 km 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.090
 I was very angry 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.120
 I told her I would run 5 kilometers to show my support 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.060
 She told me it was not so easy 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.192
 But I accepted the challenge and ran 5 kilometers in full 

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:28.650
 In her first marathon 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.237
 I achieved first place in Nashville 

00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.820
 I used a Runtastic application to help me 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.767
 In the marathon ran within 3 hours and 30 minutes and succeeded in it 

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.850
 I enjoyed encouraging my daughter to me 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.319
 Every 30 minutes approx 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.860
 I was running next to her 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.025
 I know the distance I have made and what remains until the end 

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:45.900
 And since I started running 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.820
 I have done all kinds of races 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.030
 Currently I'm training for the second marathon 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 I learned from jogging that I could do a lot 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.590
 I am proud to be her daughter 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.410
 Which is why I continue running 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.120
 And for her I would have stopped running 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.578
 Alexis began to look for half-marathon races 

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:08.139
 I support her and ask her to determine where we will go 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.330
 Let's run him together 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.074
 We encouraged each other so we did not protest to anyone else 

00:02:13.074 --> 00:02:14.490
 Evolution of my business 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.940
 Much in previous years 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.340
 Now it has more than 200,000 employees 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.657
 And received 220 million downloads 

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:22.880
 We still aspire to much 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.900
 After our partnership with Adidas 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.910
 We want to move on to the next level 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.635
 Technology gives us great ideas 

00:02:30.635 --> 00:02:32.930
 Google Play was a great partner for us 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.380
 Using Google Play technologies 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.350
 We've been able to experiment with apps and re-experiment in an innovative and fast way 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.510
 That's what we wanted to create a product 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.860
 Great for users 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.020
 It also helps us to innovate 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.590
 It's great to see users develop their lifestyle 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.300
 They are capable of achieving things they have never been able to achieve 

00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:53.830
 Here is the opportunity to do so.
