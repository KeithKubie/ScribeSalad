00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.969
The third of Kruchten's diagrams is the process view, and here we're

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.120
very specifically getting into what concurrently executing processes or

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.438
threads exist and how executed, execution is divided among them.

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:20.660
Primary means for conveying this is the UML deployment diagram.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.680
Here's an example that we saw before where there are two

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.620
major concurrently executing components and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.230
some indication of how they're communicating with each other
