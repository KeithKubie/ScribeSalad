[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.110
MARIO CARPO: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.460
Thank you for the invitation.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.710
Thank you for organizing this.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.150
Can you hear me?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.410
Yes.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.930
Thank you in advance
for your patience--

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.650
going to be very boring.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.250
I am very jet lagged.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.450
I may fall asleep while I speak.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.550
If that happens, just
bring me a cup of coffee.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.380
You, in compensation,
in the audience,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.800
you may fall asleep anytime.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.160
So I guess I have to tell you
something on new direction

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.260
in computer-aided design--

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
how advanced computation,
electronic computation,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.890
has changed--

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.830
is changing architectural
design or architecture

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.100
in general, which is the
subject of my last book, which

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.080
is on some chairs.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.140
Now, I understand
that most of you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.560
are not architectural students,
nor architects, nor designers.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.860
That's right?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.970
Who is an architect here?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.170
Raise your hand.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.910
Well, you're a minority.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.168
[LAUGHTER] What
are you doing here?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.290
So that's good.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.270
So I will just make a short,
more general introduction

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.935
to bring in my topic.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.730
What do-- let me bring in my
pictures, which are somewhere.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.440
Oh, yes.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.650
I see it.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.540
Oh, yes.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.640
It's there.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.920
What do architects do?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.630
That's a very general query.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.300
You know since
you're an architect.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.640
Ask any architect.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.420
They will tell you we build.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.310
We do buildings, big buildings,
well, when we manage--

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.510
when we are successful.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.320
Most of the time, we do not
manage, but that's the idea.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.720
We make buildings.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.440
Well, that's the idea, but it
is not actually, literally,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.820
technically right, because
we, architects-- we

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.940
do not lay bricks.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.700
We do not cut stone.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.460
We do not carve wood.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.610
We do not pour concrete.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520
We do not dig foundations.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.050
We do not any of these
technical, physical, material

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.060
stuff.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.120
Yes, we build buildings,
but we build buildings

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.630
by making drawings of buildings.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.480
We make drawings, not buildings.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.540
We make drawings,
clean drawings.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.170
We give them to the builders,
and the builders, they,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.500
will make the
buildings we design.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.170
We do not make.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.990
The designers do not build,
and the builders, they

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.460
are not allowed to design
or to change our design.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.220
The kind of drawings
we give to the builders

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.880
are called blueprints, because
once upon a time, they were

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.980
blue, and they were printed.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.710
Now they're no longer blue,
and they're no longer printed.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.010
But we still call
them blueprints.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.190
And it is thanks to blueprints,
to these kind of drawings,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.910
that our profession
is not a craft.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.340
It's a liberal art, an
intellectual activity.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.760
We do not climb on scaffoldings.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.560
We do not toil in the
snow, or in the rain,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.910
or in the heat of summer.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.480
We work in clean offices with
heating, ventilation, and air

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.590
conditioning.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.380
And we are, most of the
time, even better paid

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.920
than the actual workers who make
the actual buildings happen.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.760
That's the advantage of
being a notational art.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.150
We build by notations-- by
making drawings, drawings which

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.660
eventually become buildings,
but we do not actually

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.540
make the buildings.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.330
This is the advantage.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.370
A disadvantage is
that, if you think

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.740
of a way a building
happens, we can only

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.160
build that of which
we can make a drawing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.450
If we cannot draw it, they,
the builders, cannot build it.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.660
We are at the mercy of
the notational tools

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.290
we have at our disposal
to notate a building.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.350
If we cannot draw it,
they cannot build it.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.230
Now some geometrical shapes--

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.860
come on-- like this one
are very easy to notate.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.660
That's a shoe box.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.590
You make-- eight points
is enough to notate it--

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.340
or three points
and three vectors.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.690
That's a really very easy
drawing to make, so that way,

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.130
notation is easy.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.250
But think if what you
want to build that potato.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.280
Now, since I was cooking last
night, I can actually show you.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.430
Oops.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.490
This is what I have in mind,
this awesome British potato.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.180
If you want to build that
potato by notations--

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.890
plans, elevations,
and sections--

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.250
think of how many
drawings you have to make.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.100
Each one of these points--

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.260
not one of these
points is aligned.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.020
So you have to make a huge
number of sections in plans,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.750
elevation, et cetera, et
cetera, because each point has

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.690
to be notated individually
and separately-- millions

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.930
and millions of point,
which will take millions

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.000
and millions of
drawings, which will take

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.380
a huge amount of time,
which is possible,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.050
but it's not very practical,
because it takes too long.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.510
So to build the shoe box,
it only takes eight points.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.830
To build the potato, you must
make thousands and thousands

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.100
of drawings, each
slice, each section,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.370
being different with different
points notated and measured in,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.800
XYZ, in three dimensions, which
takes a heck of a lot of time--

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.870
which is one of the reasons why
potatoes were very seldom built

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.090
in the history of architecture
until computers came.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.890
Because this kind of repetitive
boring operations, notating

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.380
each point-- xyz, three
measurements-- if you

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.070
have to notate 4 million points,
for us, it takes a lot of time.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.510
A computer does it in
the blink of an eye.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.980
So as of the early '90s,
when computer-aided design

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.720
became to be
affordable, you would

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.940
expect that architects start
building potatoes like crazy,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.210
because there have been for
centuries, a pent up demand

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.120
for potatoes which
was never fulfilled,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.460
because potatoes were
impossible to grow and build.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.680
They are easy to make.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.930
I could make this potato
in clay with my own hands.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.876
That's easy.

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:55.500
But if I want to make
plans, elevation,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000
and section to scale--

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.850
to give a blueprint to the
builders to build the potato,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.130
that takes a long time.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.892
That was impossible
until 20 years ago--

00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:05.225
not impossible, but impractical.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.890
But now it's possible,
so you would expect

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.100
but as of the early '90s
or mid-'90s to see potatoes

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.940
everywhere.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.480
And if you google--

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.240
you know what it means, right--

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.970
digital architecture, or
computational architectural,

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.060
or parametric
architecture, you will find

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.680
a mosaic of this kind of stuff.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:35.340
And they are potato-esque, but
they are not real potatoes.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.570
Because they are
around and smooth,

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.170
but they are streamlined,
and technological, and clean,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.080
and almost mathematical.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.240
A potato is rough
and disorderly.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.890
These are not potatoes.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.080
They are something else.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.020
And as of the early '90s--

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.419
well, this is closer to
a potato but still not--

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:04.960
don't ask me which
kind of a building

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.210
this is, because it ain't one.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.270
But it's still not
a potato, because it

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.097
is too smooth and too precise.

00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:12.930
You can understand that
there is mathematics

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.110
in that, which isn't in this.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.450
In the mid-'90s a colleague of
mine came out with a suitable

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.010
catchy term.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.820
They decided to call these
new kind of digital shapes,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.500
blobs, taking inspiration from
this science fiction movie

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.880
from the '50s.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.320
And so, for a while, these
potato-esque digital stuff

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.120
were called blobs.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.210
Today, they are called--

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.670
oops-- parametric or
parametric design.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.880
But in truth--
and that's the way

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.420
I often tell the
story to my students.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.480
If we look at the
actual timeline

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.830
of how these things came to
happen, these are not potatoes.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.060
These are not blobs.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.220
These are fish.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.370
Because it all started
with this big fish,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.740
which you may have seen if you
go to Barcelona on the beach.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.950
Above the beach,
not in the water--

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.640
over the beach, there
is this huge metal fish

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.220
floating in mid air.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.610
This was built by Western
architect Frank Gehry,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.660
and this was the first time
Frank Gehry used software

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.130
for computer-aided design
for which, eventually,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.020
it became famous--

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.460
a star architect which he is
now, but which he wasn't then.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.340
And how is it that to build a
fish, Frank Gehry, at that time

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.280
already a well-known architect,
decided that he should

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.620
use computer-aided design?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.520
And which kind of software
did he think he would need?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.500
Well, think of it.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:59.270
His problem was to model the
streamlined curve of the shape

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.850
of a skin of a fish.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.700
And his argument was why is the
fish so streamlined and smooth?

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:13.490
Because it moves in water the
way a boat moves in water,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.800
and the boat, the
hull of a boat,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.910
has the same streamlined lines.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.890
For a long time-- this is
a 17th century drawing--

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.160
shipbuilders have
had the technique

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.670
to make these curvy
pieces of wood

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.310
at the point of contact
between the hull

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.530
of the boat and the water.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.210
Imagine the frame of a boat in
timber is given its structure.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.930
And then you have to
nail this slat of timber

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.030
to the frame of the boat.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.130
And they have to be
smooth, because that's

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.720
the point of contact
of the water.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.480
With a boat, when the
boat moves in water,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.280
there is friction, or drag.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.580
And if the slat of
timber isn't smooth,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.200
the boat will start to
rock, and it will slow down.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.790
And this timber curvy
slats of the hull,

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.650
they have a name in English.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.420
Since the 17th century, they
are called splines like a line

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.020
but sp before sp, splines.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.850
In the dictionary,
you find this word

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.770
in use as of the 17th century--

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.050
technical term used
by craftsmen who

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.760
were building the hull
of boats by curving

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.710
with artisanal skills--

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.060
and each one, they did
in a different way--

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.850
these slats of
timbers, so that they

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:40.680
would connect a given number of
fixed points in the smoothest

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.020
continuous way.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.630
Now the line of the stream--

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.820
the line where the
hull of the boat

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.870
touches the stream of
the incoming water--

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.960
the line of the stream
is called the streamline,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.270
so this is the principle
of streamlining.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.650
That's where it comes from.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.200
The line of the stream,
that's the streamline, which

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.160
has to be smooth to
avoid friction, or drag.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.180
And boats were built
this way for a long time,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.430
and airplanes are
built this way too.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.590
Because aerodynamic
and hydrodynamic

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.240
have the same principles.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.030
This picture was made in
the mechanical engineering

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.390
department of Cornell
University doing World War II.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.880
This is a team of engineers
designing the curve

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.100
of the wing of a fighter plane.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.140
And we were still using the
same artisanal technique.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.600
They are obtaining the line
of this curve by craft.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.950
It all depends on the elasticity
of the material you're using,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.260
so the kind of
timber you are using.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.400
If you choose, I don't
know, pitch pine,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.990
you get a certain curve.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.870
If you use fir tree or
oak, a different one--

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.670
if you use as a same
material and you bent rubber,

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.460
you get a different color.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.420
If you use melted
mozzarella cheese,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.510
it would be a
different curve still.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.570
That's the way it was then
even during World War II when

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.600
airplanes and wings of
airplanes were mass produced,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.580
but they still did it
in this artisanal way.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.140
And so, in the '50s and
'60s, the automobile industry

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.590
kept doing it by hand.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.590
Oops.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.730
This is probably the most
famously streamlined automobile

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.040
of all times.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.650
Who knows the name of this car,
just for my personal curiosity?

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.480
Perhaps your
grandfather owned one.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.520
Who knows it?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.400
AUDIENCE: A DS?

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.060
MARIO CARPO: Say that again.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.101
AUDIENCE: Is that the DS?

00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:40.370
MARIO CARPO: It's the DS,
DS, which in French means

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.930
the divinity [INAUDIBLE] S--

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.060
designed in the early '50s.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.730
By the way, this
masterpiece of French design

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.990
was entirely designed
by an Italian engineer,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.840
and it came into
service in '56 or '57.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.750
That was the car of General de
Gaulle, et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.310
But all this was made by hand.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.240
And the way design was made,
when this car was produced,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.140
was entirely artisanal.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:13.240
The curves, the folding
curves, of the body of the car

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.690
were made first
in clay, and then

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.450
when the final design
of the car was ready,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.440
it was made in hard wood.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.270
There was no
blueprint of this car,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.390
because nobody could have
made all the drawings

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.360
necessary to make all these
curves-- in plans, elevation,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.460
and section was too complicated.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.410
And so, the actual
design of the camera

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.000
was a model of a car in timber
kept in an atomic shelter

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.490
somewhere in central Paris.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.070
So, you know, it was the Cold
War, so if something happened,

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.550
the design would stay there.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.190
And when engineers needed
to drive blueprints

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.890
for any practical reason,
they went to the basement

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.485
into the atomic shelter, and
they measured the wooden model

00:14:57.485 --> 00:14:58.990
in scale one to one.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.810
They took the measurements out,
and they derived blueprints

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.870
as needed when needed.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.900
It was laborious.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.550
It was entirely artisanal,
which is why in the late '50s,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:15.300
simultaneously at Citroen
and at Renault also in Paris,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.950
the engineers,
designers, and the CEO

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.910
of two companies called their
top engineers and said, listen,

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:22.990
guys.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:26.370
We know how you do it, by hand.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.910
This has been done
that way for centuries.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.730
Now you-- them speaking
to their engineers.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.810
You are the best
engineers in the world.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.210
The French always
think they are.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.730
Now shouldn't there
be a way to notate

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.110
these curves using calculus,
x and y, a function-- the way

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.520
we learned it at school.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.820
We can notate parabolas,
hyperboles, ellipsis, circles,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.660
you name it.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.020
Why should we not be able to
notate any curve whatsoever

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.890
in 3D just using three
letters and a little bit

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.350
of coefficients and
parameters-- mathematics.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.180
Could you not do
it mathematically,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.830
so it is more precise?

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.840
And one day-- one
day, who knows?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.700
We may even use
computers to do that.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.950
We don't have them now,
but one day we may.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.370
And so, two teams started to
work in complete secrecy--

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.342
one at Citroen, one at Renault--

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:17.410
with the same
assignment, find a way

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.960
to notate this
using mathematics.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.480
We now know the name of the
team leader at Renault--

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.450
and the name of the
team leader at Citroen

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.810
remained unknown
for a long time.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:34.740
It's a fascinating chapter
in technological history.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.990
These people evidently
knew each other.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.380
They had studied in
the same schools.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.677
They probably did the military
service in Nigeria together.

00:16:43.677 --> 00:16:46.260
And their wives were probably a
member of the same rotary club

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.120
in central Paris.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.690
But they had to work in
secret and in competition.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:57.450
And we know that the Renault
team came up with some results

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.390
sooner.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.220
It was the early '60s, when
they made a famous demonstration

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.619
in front of the CEO of
Renault. They took a signature

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.829
on a banknote--

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.240
where it is, you know, the
signature of the head cashier

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.130
of the Banque de France,
a doodle full of circles.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.200
And they showed that
we have translated

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.140
that random curvy
doodle into formulas,

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.900
and they fed these
formulas into a plotter.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.780
The plotter made the
drawing of the signatures

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.300
at the different scale,
and then at another scale,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.500
and then at another scale.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.190
Because the point is a
mathematical notation

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.430
has no scale, so it was
the same at every scale.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.500
And it was a fantastic and
persuading demonstration.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.930
And the CEO of Renault,
as to Pierre Bezier,

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.280
that was the top
engineer at Renault--

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.920
said good, fantastic.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.970
Great work.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.520
How long did it take
your team to translate

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.370
that doodle into mathematics?

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.590
Two years.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.780
And how long would
it take to notate

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.830
the whole body of a car
using the same mathematics?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.430
22 years.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.972
Well then, that's
not very practical.

00:18:09.972 --> 00:18:12.013
But they said, no, it
isn't if you do it by hand,

00:18:12.013 --> 00:18:13.650
but one day computers will come.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.526
And then they will
do it very fast.

00:18:15.526 --> 00:18:16.650
Do we have these computers?

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.370
No.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.220
Will we have these computers?

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.770
No.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.430
Are we going to
buy any computer?

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.350
Has anyone have any
computer in France?

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.850
No.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.935
Perhaps the Americans
do, but we don't--

00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:30.180
he says, well then,
shoot yourself.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.610
That's what I presume
the CEO told to Bezier,

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.780
publish his pure mathematics,
no practical use--

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.220
publish it in some wacky
mathematical journals

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.710
and good luck, which they did.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.360
They published it, 1966,
but only a few years later,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.720
computers did come.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.724
And so, these mathematics
was then open source,

00:18:49.724 --> 00:18:50.390
as we would say.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.800
It had been published--
scholarly journal.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.840
Anyone could use
it, and everyone

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.890
started using it like crazy.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.040
Renault, they built
their own software

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.620
for computer-aided
design called Uniserve.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.800
In France, an aircraft
maker, Dassault,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.830
developed its own
CATIA software.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.000
In America, McDonnell Douglas,
General Motors, and Boeing

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.730
started to use it.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.570
Boeing improved upon
it significantly.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.990
They generalized the
mathematical notation

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.560
into something called
NURBS, Non-Uniform Rational

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.610
B-splines--

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.790
which in school of engineering
is an acronym meant to stand

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.030
for No One Understands
Really B-splines--

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.380
which means it's complicated.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.390
The work at Citroen
was actually,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.700
we now know,
mathematically better.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.250
But the leader-- the
bosses at Citroen--

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.530
a private company.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.960
Renault was state-owned--
decided that it

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.430
was an industrial secret.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.590
They kept it in a
safe for 20 years,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.596
so nobody could do
anything with it.

00:19:52.596 --> 00:19:55.830
Pierre de [INAUDIBLE] is
the name of the other guy.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.190
These kind of curves are
now called Bezier's curves,

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.390
from the name of Pierre
Bezier, or NURBS.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:11.460
Fast forward to 1991 or '90
when the office of Frank Gehry

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.260
had that problem I told you.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.390
They wanted to design
that fish, and they

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.500
knew or [INAUDIBLE] with
some reason that not really

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.070
shipbuilders but aircraft
makers would have

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.300
the technology they
needed, because they

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.220
knew part of the story.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.130
And so, Frank Gehry
was in Los Angeles.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.170
McDonnell Douglas
was-- and still

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.530
is not called McDonnell
Douglas-- south of Los Angeles,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.180
so they made a phone call
which is not recorded.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.150
But we can imagine
something like that.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:46.200
Consider that in 1990-'91,
Frank Gehry was not yet a star

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.970
architect.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.513
He was known among
the architects,

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:51.540
but people outside
the profession

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.280
didn't really know about him.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.200
So imagine the call--

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.040
office of Frank Gehry to
the technological office

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.260
of McDonnell Douglas.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.410
[INAUDIBLE] office
of architects.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.030
We have to build a big fish.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.520
Can you help?

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.330
Sorry, guys.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.740
You have the wrong numbers.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.840
We are not in the fish
building business.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.660
We do birds, big
birds, airplanes.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.700
And [INAUDIBLE] yes, but
the mathematics is the same.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.120
And [INAUDIBLE] yes, sure.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.140
My name is Napoleon.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.030
Good luck.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.370
But Frank Gehry didn't
take no for an answer.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.040
He tried again--
called the MIT--

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.940
his friend, Bill Mitchell,
then head of architecture

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.376
at the MIT--

00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:33.250
one of the founders of
computer-aided design.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.050
He said, oh, don't
try with those.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.550
You know whom you should
call-- these crazy guys

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.460
at Dassault in Paris.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.640
They made these fantastic
fighter jet, the Mirage,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.480
so expensive that no army
can buy it except the French.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.150
And they have this
fantastic software

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.250
for designing splines,
which is called CATIA--

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.470
so complicated that no engineer
can use it except their own.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.661
Call them, they
may have something.

00:21:59.661 --> 00:22:01.660
And he did call them, and
they said, sure, sure.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:08.070
A fish, seashells, the
snakes, elephant tusks,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.590
all kinds of organic
cures, that's our business.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.060
We would be happy to help.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.295
A team of Dassault engineers
went to Los Angeles.

00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:16.170
They worked together.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.120
They simplified CATIA to make
it suitable to architectural

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.730
design, and they
produced something

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.000
which was used to make
the fish you have seen.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.570
Frank Gehry liked
that stuff so much

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:34.280
that he kept using
CATIA and building fish.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.690
He has been building
fish all over the world,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.500
and he's now famous as the
most famous fish builder

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.970
in the history of architecture.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.450
The original fish-- I know it
from, Frank Gehry, himself,

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.190
it was actually meant
to be a carp, which is--

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.650
I think it's OK,
considering my family name.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.530
It doesn't look like a
carp, but then immediately

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.110
after he built, of course,
the Guggenheim Bilbao

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.770
using the same software,
CATIA, simplified

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.580
for architectural purposes.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.590
And he went on building the same
kind of spliney fishy curves

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.430
all over the world.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.270
This is the Guggenheim Bilbao
integrated in '96 or '97,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.540
but this is the Philharmonic
in Los Angeles a bit later.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.610
This is very recent.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.670
It is in Paris.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.580
And this is now Gehry's
signature style--

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:25.240
the style of a fish, because
of the spline modeling software

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.360
he's using.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.090
Now he was so successful in
using this adaptation of CATIA

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.430
for architectural
purposes that he

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.020
copyrighted a simplified
version of CATIA for architects.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.600
We call it Digital Projects.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.460
He founded an
independent company

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.820
called Gehry
Technologies, providing

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.447
fish making to other companies,
who didn't have the expertise.

00:23:50.447 --> 00:23:53.030
And he made so much money with
this company, which eventually,

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.380
he sold the company--

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.600
which is now an independently
owned company still called

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.070
Gehry Technologies-- but
owned by another company--

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.810
to do that.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.800
Most normal offices of
architecture and students

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.510
in school cannot use CATIA.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.400
It's too complicated
and too expensive.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.970
They use cheaper, simpler,
crappier software,

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.980
who include some of the
same spline modeling tools

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.455
called Rhino, Maya, formZ.

00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:24.080
You may have heard
some of these names.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.380
They have all been developed
in the course of the '90s,

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.750
and they are now
universally used.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.780
So all these, if
you look at them

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.850
after the story I told you, you
should not see them as blobs,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.205
but you should see them as fish.

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:39.420
Look at this fish.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.010
This is fish-- fish.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.670
Some of them were never built.
Some of them were built.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.190
This looked like a Photoshop,
but this is a real building.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.409
This is a real building too.

00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:49.700
This looks like a real
building, but it was never built

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.040
and never will be, et
cetera, et cetera--

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.040
fish, fish design.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.340
Now the problem is if you go
to my school over there one

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.060
mile in that direction or to
a handful of other schools

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:08.300
which are from the avant
garde of design innovation,

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.770
and you look at what our
students or my colleagues

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:14.050
have been doing for the
last five or six years--

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.470
and this is a selection
of what they do--

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.720
they do not look
like fish at all.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.140
The style is
completely different.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.556
This is what I call, in my
book, the second digital style.

00:25:23.556 --> 00:25:26.270
It's disjointed, disconnected,
broken, fragmentary.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.780
Continuity has been
replaced by discreteness.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:29.780
It is not smooth.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.160
It is rough.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.640
And I was trying to
explain to my students.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.870
Well, this is what one of
my colleagues has done.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:42.590
Since I tell the story
with metaphors or analogs--

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.380
the potato, the fish--

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.010
I was looking for another
animal to describe this.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.885
And they thought it
would be a sheep.

00:25:50.885 --> 00:25:53.740
The problem is with my accent--

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.870
and many of my
students also speak

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.300
English as a foreign
language-- if I say sheep,

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:03.310
no one will ever understand if
I mean the boat or the animal.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.940
So I had to find
something easier,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.965
so I decided to call it a dog.

00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:10.900
It looks like a
dog a little bit,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:15.280
but I was teaching American
during the foreign.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.390
American students are demanding
more than our British students,

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.730
and so when one of the students
came to me after class--

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.960
professor, which kind of
dog do you have in mind?

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.940
And the students
produced this vignette

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.860
showing that not all dogs
look like that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:42.220
See, this is a modernist
dog, which is streamlined

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.664
as if it were a fish.

00:26:43.664 --> 00:26:45.830
You know, everything in
this picture is streamlined.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.500
It's a model in this picture.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.700
And you will see
the fish itself.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.635
So now the dog
looks like a fish,

00:26:51.635 --> 00:26:54.670
and the fish looks like
a ballistic missile.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:59.200
And because the modernism
was all about streamlining.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.199
Everything is
streamlined, even the dog.

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:01.990
The fish is normal.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.410
It's streamlined by nature.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.600
The dog shouldn't
be, but it was made.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.010
Now this is the
dog I have in mind.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.700
This is a postmodern dog, which
gives an idea of complexity,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.150
and, you know,
discreteness, and messiness.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.130
This is clean, but I would
imagine that in normal life,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.920
this dog is actually
quite dirty.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.380
So this is what is going on.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.470
So the question is since
evidently computer-aided design

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.270
is driven by the tools-- the
technical tools we are using

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.450
and then by the
performance of the machines

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.900
we are using, why is it that the
style of computer-aided design

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.990
has shifted from fish
making to dog making?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.920
Was the software of
the '90s more fishy,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.410
or is the software today
more inclined to being dog?

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.600
As you probably
know, computers still

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.720
do today what they did 20 years
ago, or even 30 years ago,

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.555
or 20 years ago.

00:27:54.555 --> 00:27:58.570
But we are much faster, and
more powerful, and cheaper.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.540
For the last 5 or 10
years, we got so used

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.300
to this wealth of
data that we even

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.790
invented a new
definition to define

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.570
this new data rich environment.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.420
We call it big data--

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.550
to define this notion
that, for a long time,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.750
data was supposed to
be rare and expensive.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.570
Now it's ubiquitous and cheap.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.670
It's a big, you
know, upheaval of

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.160
the anthropological
condition of humankind

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.100
from the beginning of time,
still 10 years ago, we always

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.410
needed more data than we had.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.830
For the last few years,
it is, as we always had,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.720
more data than we need.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:42.950
So we call this big data, or
we have a number of other terms

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.970
to define the same machine
learning, deep learning,

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:46.910
artificial neuro--

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.951
which I don't know what
it is-- blah, blah, blah.

00:28:48.951 --> 00:28:50.180
Or you can read all this.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:55.460
And there is a notion
that some of these

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.060
may somehow be already
related to an idea

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.060
of artificial
intelligence, which is odd

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.270
because, for people
my age, we used

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.030
to think that artificial
intelligence was something that

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.852
would come one
day in the future.

00:29:10.852 --> 00:29:12.560
And now we are being
told we have already

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.890
been using it for the last five
years without even knowing,

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:16.990
which is odd.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.650
And I don't know what
artificial intelligence is.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.450
Perhaps you know.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.840
You will tell me
after during coffee.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.000
But I can tell you
what is starting

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.610
to happen in design
when we start

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:33.860
to use some of this big data,
or deep learning, or machine

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.130
learning, or even
artificial intelligence

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.110
tool in the ordinary
practice of our work trade.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.640
And I will show you a couple of
examples to give you an idea.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.210
Since we are talking
about curves,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.000
which is why I gave you
this long introduction,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.780
this is the normal
human mathematical way

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.212
to notate a curve.

00:29:52.212 --> 00:29:53.420
We will studied it at school.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.780
This is a parabola.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.720
And the magic of calculus is
that with-- two letters x, y--

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.820
and three coefficients, or
parameters, numbers-- a, b,

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.380
and c--

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.680
we notate an infinite
number of points.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.390
How many points
sit on this curve--

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.770
a huge number of them, an
infinite number of them.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.640
But a simple line of
plain mathematical script

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.090
as long as this is enough
to notate all the points

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.230
we need that sit on that curve.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.990
That's the way we do it.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.790
That's a very
brilliant way to do it,

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:29.090
because it compresses
a huge amount of data

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:33.050
into a very short clean
and memorable notation--

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.620
so memorable that I
studied 100 years ago,

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.960
and I still remember it even
though I really never used it.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.860
But this is the way we do
it, and this is increasingly

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:50.390
the way a machine, or artificial
intelligence, would do it--

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:55.850
not by using the function
but by making a long list--

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.050
a long list of points.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:01.760
For each x, there is a y,
which is located on that curve.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.870
And you make that list.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.630
And I remember making this
list, when I was a high school

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.010
student, to check that the point
really sat on the parabola--

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.630
that you cannot notate
every point that way.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.270
The purpose of
scripting the function

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.790
is precisely that you do not
need to indicate each point

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.340
one by one, because the
script indicates them

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.460
all in a single line.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.720
But for a computer, from a
computer's point of view,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.670
making a list of 1,000
points, or 1 million points,

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.500
or 1 billion points
is not a big deal.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.550
It is for us, because we
cannot work with that list.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.880
But a computer can manipulate
a list of 1 billion points

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.370
in the blink of an
eye, which is indeed

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.430
what is already starting to
happen in architectural design.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.840
Because if you look at
this, a famous fish,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.320
built recently by Zaha Hadid--

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.060
well, when she was still alive--
one of her last buildings

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.580
before she died
tragically two years ago.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.050
It's huge.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.060
It's the biggest fish
ever built, I think.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.880
You can see it from the
moon with the naked eye.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.110
It's enormous.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.530
But the mathematical
script is more--

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.710
just two lines or three lines
of script or perhaps a bit more,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.450
but it is mathematics.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.580
You can recognize that
it is mathematical

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.850
because this curve,
this streamlined curve,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.320
looks familiar.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.400
This is something that
we recognize something--

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.780
ours, because we know the
mathematics underpinning it.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.180
It has been around
for quite a long time.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.150
Calculus was invented at
the end of the 17th century.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.170
Bezier's mathematics
between 1958 and 1964,

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.390
you don't need computers
to use that mathematics,

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.190
but with computers,
it's ran faster--

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.960
because more affordable.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.740
That's, you know-- they weren't
as we knew it even though it

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.870
is a bit bigger
than what we used

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.760
to do using that kind of tools.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.965
If you look at this--

00:32:51.965 --> 00:32:53.850
built recently by
Michael Hansmeyer--

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:58.700
a 3D-printed grotto using the
biggest to-date commercial 3D

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.310
printer.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.230
You can 3D print a single
block in the size of a room.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.170
And each part of these
3D-printed structure

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.150
is printed as a voxel.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.340
A voxel is a little
unit of matter,

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.260
which is calculated
individually and separate.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.270
It's like an atom in
three dimensions, xyz--

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.160
the smallest unit of this
volumetric composition.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.780
And if you look at
it close up, that's

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.530
the belly of that grotto.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:34.200
This grotto was made by 3D
printing 4 billion voxels,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.430
one by one--

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.360
each one notated,
calculated, and fabricated.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.050
For each voxel, there is a
notation and a calculation,

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.270
for billions of them.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.660
We couldn't work that way,
because if we print out

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.810
that list, it would
start here and finish

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.700
in another continent.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.820
But a computer can run that
list in the blink of an eye,

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.310
so this way of working,
which is absurd for us,

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.730
makes perfect sense
for a machine.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:10.710
Because we can not work that
way, but the machine can.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.040
And if this composition
looks a bit weird, and wacky,

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.780
and strange, there
is a reason for that.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.030
It is already the expression
of an intelligence

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.940
which is not ours.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.489
This is the outward
and visible sign

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:27.239
of an inward invisible logic
at play, a logic which is not

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.429
the natural logic of our mind.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.679
It is the artificial
logic of a machine.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.260
A machine can do that,
because the machine thinks

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.540
in a way which is different
from the way we think.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.179
If we use a formula,
we don't do that.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.429
If we use a list of
points, we could do that.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.760
But how many points can
be manipulated by hand

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.170
or using a slide ruler?

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.469
Not many.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.550
These are 4 billion
points, and it shows.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.100
It is a complexity,
or richness, of data,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.670
which the machine can
manage, but we can't.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.630
This is the way
the machine thinks.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.090
That's not the way we think.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:04.210
Another example-- this
is not a Photoshop.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.180
It was actually built
in Germany, Stuttgart,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.760
by Achim Menges.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.330
And it is a small pavilion.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.540
It was built in a public space.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.570
And this being Germany,
before you build it,

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:20.230
you need permission from the
local office for something,

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.560
which has to validate your
structural calculation to make

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.760
certain that this building would
withstand the wind of x knots

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.200
and will also withstand the
weight of certain [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.070
of snow--

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.190
something like that.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.090
So you have to provide
structural calculation, which

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.000
have to be validated
by a public office,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.680
to certify that the
building is safe--

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.000
structural calculation,
structural design.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.320
How do you think this building,
which is made of filaments,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.060
was calculated?

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.980
Using these
structural formulas--

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.950
these are the formulas
I studied at school--

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.680
to the limit-- with a lot
of effort of imagination,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.320
we could use these mathematics
and this engineering

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.580
to calculate each filament
individually, but there, again,

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.160
probably 4 million
filaments in that shell.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.100
So if you want to calculate
each filament individually,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.320
in principle, it is possible.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.000
In practice, it
would take six years.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.200
So we would not really do it.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.670
Yet the structure
was calculated,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.660
but how did they do it?

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.620
Not using traditional structural
formulas-- using something

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:35.460
called finite element analysis,
the computational version.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.590
I shall not go into
details which, by the way,

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.930
I don't know very well myself.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.450
But the way it works is
that you see on the screen

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.700
a simulation of a
structure, and you

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.840
simulate in the simulation
a certain load--

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.460
wind, or snow, or whatever.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.850
What you see on the screen
is that part of the structure

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.140
starts to blink red--

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.110
what time is it?

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.500
At what time did I-- yes.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.720
Well, we are on time.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.940
It started blinking red, on the
screen, the part that we break.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:11.750
So what you do?

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.650
You tweak it.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:15.110
And you change it, and you
try again another load--

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.380
and if you blink
red, somewhere else--

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.620
and again and again.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.930
And you try and you keep
trying until you see something

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.471
on the screen that
doesn't blink red.

00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:23.720
Everything is green.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.572
That means it will not collapse,
so that's the good one--

00:37:26.572 --> 00:37:27.530
the one you will build.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.370
The problem is you have to keep
trying, and trying, and trying.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.520
And you have no clue as to
which trial will give the best

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:39.680
result. The trials are fast,
because they are in simulation,

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.090
which is why, to make
the progress even faster,

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.800
we ask the machine to
keep trying automatically.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.540
And we can call
that optimization.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.760
Machine keeps trying,
and trying, and trying.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.980
And the machine does, say, 1
million trials in one hour,

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.740
and chances are that some
of these will be good.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.400
And the one which the machine
finds will be among the best.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.410
One of them will be
built, but nobody

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:10.860
knows which changes will
give the best results.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.030
How do you think this was
calculated before it was built?

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.490
It was calculated,
but it was calculated

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.950
the way I told you-- by
simulation and trial and error

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:20.580
on the screen.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:26.710
Why does this one structure
stand up and the 9,999 just

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.200
tried in computational
simulation didn't?

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.860
Nobody knows it, least
of all is designers.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.210
And yet we know--

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.890
and yet we know that
it will stand up,

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.120
which is why we can build it.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.880
Because in simulation,
we know it did withstand.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.480
So what we call simulation
and optimisation is

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.680
massive computational
trial and error--

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.860
try, and try, and try,
and try, and keep trying.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.980
Or in another way is
the art and science

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.850
of finding good solutions
without knowing why they work.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:08.070
So in a nutshell, it is
already evident that artificial

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.450
intelligence-- and this is
artificial intelligence,

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.000
which to some extent it is--

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.940
it works.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.800
We can already use it to
solve problems we couldn't

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.060
solve in any other way.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:23.340
But it works in a way which
is different from the way we

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.210
would work.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.944
It already shows
a logic at play,

00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:28.110
which is different from the
logic of our mind, which

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.870
is probably a good reason
to call it artificial.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.960
Because our organic intelligence
would not solve problems

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.950
that way.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.390
The artificial intelligence
of a machine cam

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.050
already solve problems
in a different way, which

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:43.290
in many cases is the
only way to solve

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.580
problems of a given complexity.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.070
So yes, it works, but it works
in a way which we may find--

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.150
well, which is different
from the way we think,

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.120
which is probably one
reason why we should call

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.850
this intelligence, artificial--

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.780
because the organic logic of
our mind doesn't work that way.

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.540
Think of what we did not do.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.840
In the case of a function,
we cannot calculate 4 million

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.370
points one by one.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.800
The machine does, and
the machine does it.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.400
In the case of
structural design,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.010
we cannot run 4 million
trials in a sequence,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.300
because it would take forever.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.410
But the machine does
it in 20 minutes.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:26.130
So trial and error, which
is a very stupid strategy

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.180
for humans, is a very good
strategy for the machine.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.410
If I look for a formula to
put all these into tag line,

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.110
I don't have to look very far,
because you people have already

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.480
found it 14 years ago
when you launched Gmail

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.670
with this type of
search, don't sort.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.240
Because if you think of what
I just told you, what we do--

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.130
we humans-- we sort.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.410
We take data, and
we organize them

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.290
and structure them to make them
smaller, and more functional,

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.630
and more understandable.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.040
That's the way our mind,
and traditional science,

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.930
and mathematics always worked.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.720
A computer can search so
fast, but this sorting

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.000
is often unnecessary.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.520
Because by the speed
of the processing

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.270
of the simple sorting process,
sequential, a computer

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:15.680
can find the best solution,
but we with our slow searching

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.620
would.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.260
Think of names in
a telephone book

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.490
or in a telephone directory.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.580
1 million names, we have to
sort them alphabetically,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.600
so we know where our name
is when you look for it,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.180
and we don't have to read
all the names to find

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.070
the name we're looking for.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.720
But a computer can do just that.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.570
The computer can read 1
million names in two seconds.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:41.640
So our sorting, which
is indispensable for us,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.070
is unnecessary for the
machine, because the machine

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.240
can search so fast that the
preliminary sorting, which

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.390
we need, is not
necessary for them.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.055
Think of books in a library.

00:41:53.055 --> 00:41:55.980
We put books on a
shelf for following

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.210
a system of logic
of classification,

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.840
so we know where certain
subject is when we look for it.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.700
We put things in
certain places, so we

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.960
know where things are
when we look for them.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.640
So the shelf mark
or the code number--

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.720
if you're looking for a book
on architecture, Renaissance,

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.190
the 16th century
Florence churches--

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.170
it's a formula, a shelf mark.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.980
And with that number,
you go to that shelf,

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.480
and you find the
book you're looking

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.060
for without having to
read the titles of all

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.220
the books in the library--

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.420
which would take forever.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.790
A computer can do it.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.080
And with virtual reality,
we can do that as well.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.680
Think of-- instead of
using a librarian--

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.920
when all the books come in, you
tag them with radio frequency

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.810
identification-- a little chip--

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.300
then you put them in a
huge mountain, no sorting

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.050
whatsoever.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:46.050
Then you fire all
your librarians,

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:50.300
and you buy a pair of
virtual reality glasses.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.550
And when you're looking for
that book in that mountain

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.140
and saying, where is that book?

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.380
And you would see blinking
red in your field of vision,

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.630
so you don't need
librarians to sort,

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.400
because the machine can search.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.690
Search or sort?

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.090
We sort-- human intelligence.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.370
Computers search--
artificial intelligence.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:12.610
But that's not my cup of tea.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.550
To go back to my
cup of tea, which

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.420
is potatoes, and
fish, et cetera,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:21.960
it is evident that our
computational design,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.870
it's a fascinating
testing ground already

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.630
for artificial intelligence,
because the stuff we do

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.180
is so simple and so cheap.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:34.680
And the software we use is
so, you know, elementary.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.180
And we do physical stuff--

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.830
the feedback loop, you know, the
verification is also immediate.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.070
Start in the morning,
and by the evening

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:50.590
we know if it will stand up,
or if it will break down.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.920
And we know what we
would look like--

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.490
verification is faster probably
than in many other trades

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.030
and professions, which
is why we can probably

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.590
redesign as some architects.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.920
We can probably intuit
the spirit of this game

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.110
sooner and faster than
many other professions do,

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:09.390
because we have an
immediate physical feedback.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:10.980
If it falls down,
it doesn't work,

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.810
so we have to try another.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:20.250
So if we are lucky, we can hope
to glean the spirit of the game

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.670
sooner and perhaps better than
some other professions do,

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:28.200
but the problem is
this is not our game.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.620
This was never our game.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.310
It was never meant
to be our game,

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.870
because this is your game.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.380
You came up with it.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.570
We didn't.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.840
So this is where I should stop
speaking and start listening.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.110
I think we have still
a few minutes for that.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:43.925
Thank you.

00:44:43.925 --> 00:44:48.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.956
HOST: So we have 10
minutes for questions.

00:44:53.956 --> 00:44:56.944
Yeah, right here.

00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.438
AUDIENCE: You had
so many choices.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.170
Hi.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.390
You said you actually
were an expert

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.460
in classical architecture.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.710
How do you see this as an
evolution of what the Greeks

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.500
and Romans were trying to do?

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.990
Because there's are quite
mathematical as well,

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.070
their architecture.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.440
Do you think this is just
the evolution of that,

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.610
or is this something
totally different?

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.580
MARIO CARPO: Well,
architecture is always

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.180
at the mercy of the tools
we use to make it happen.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.680
That's inevitable.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.570
To some extent,
every expression is

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:30.350
at the mercy of the tool
we use to manifest it.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:32.380
You can think that
language is natural,

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.035
but in fact, when your ideas are
manifested through the alphabet

00:45:36.035 --> 00:45:38.805
or through syntax,
the tools that you

00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:41.640
use to communicate feedback
on the kind of message

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.950
you can, you know, transmit.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:47.610
This feedback loop is inevitable
in every human expression.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.220
In the case of architecture, if
you compare it with painting,

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:56.080
the technical bottleneck
is more determinant.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.660
Of course, a painter
is at the mercy

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.810
of the kind of canvas he's
using and the technology

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:03.970
of the colors he's
putting on the canvas,

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.086
but you can think that
that technological--

00:46:07.086 --> 00:46:11.200
the limitation, it's not
much if you compare it

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.110
with the technical implication
of building a big building.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.030
And we are particularly
at the mercy

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.040
of tools of
quantification, because we

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.350
have to measure a building
before it is built,

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:22.206
and that was always
the case in Greek,

00:46:22.206 --> 00:46:23.830
and Roman, and
classical architecture--

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.660
not so much for
costing or estimate,

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.220
which is important today,
but for proportions,

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.730
which, for them, was a
matter of vital importance.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.990
And evidently, if you look at
Roman or Greek architecture,

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:38.120
you can glean, from the way
the buildings are built,

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.780
the kind of tools
of quantification

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.140
they used to make it happen,
which was not number based,

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.990
because the Greek and Roman
didn't have good numbers,

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:48.430
and they didn't trust numbers.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.350
It was all based on geometry.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:54.040
What we would solve
by using, you know,

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.570
Hindu-Arabic numbers--

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.420
which evidently we didn't have--
the numbers they had were crap,

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:01.030
and so they couldn't use
them to calculate anything.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.670
But their geometry
was first class.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:04.990
We still use it.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:09.040
So all that quantification
was achieved through Euclidean

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:13.520
geometry tools, whereas the
arithmetic number-based tools

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.420
we use today didn't yet exist.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.430
You know, the Greeks
always mistrusted numbers.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.790
They preferred geometry
were all in the compass,

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.250
the typical tool of the masons.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:30.580
The quantification of
the proportional harmony

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.820
of those buildings derived from
that use of geometry, which

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.090
is why neoclassical architecture
as of a 17th century

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.290
or 18th century-- which
is number-based and not

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.670
geometrical determined-- from
a distance, it looks the same.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.940
But if you look at it
with the eye of an expert,

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.790
you can tell that
it's no longer Euclid.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:50.360
It is numbers.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.980
Those numbers were
pure arithmetics.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.640
The story I've told you
is how quantification

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.850
shifted from
algebra to calculus,

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:04.480
because this is what Bezier
and the French teams did.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.400
In a sense, that
was the culmination

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.110
of the dreams of
Western mathematics,

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:12.310
because with Descartes,
Leibniz, and Newton,

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.020
we could not eat conics--

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.130
you know, parabolas, hyperboles,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.850
With Bezier, it was, in
a sense, the culmination

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:23.980
of the dream of
mathematicians of all time.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.980
You can notate, using
a mathematical script,

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.850
everything.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:31.140
A cloud in the sky, a
flower in the field,

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.210
any shape and form in
nature can be scripted

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.280
as a mathematical notation.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.770
Of course, we didn't need to
notate the cloud or a flower.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.690
We need to notate
the body of a car.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.840
And it was complicated, but
with computers, it became easy.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.940
Which is why when
computers became available,

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.580
first thing we did-- we didn't
use them to make potatoes.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.980
We used them to make fish,
because that's mathematics,

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.780
and there is no
mathematics in a potato.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.150
We call this freeform,
because there is

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:57.140
no mathematics embedded in it.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.970
And in a sense, that dog,
the last part of my story,

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.220
is closer to the
potato than the fish.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.300
So in a sense, we are
getting back to a potato,

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.860
but with a delay of 24 years.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.550
But the feedback loop
back to your question--

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:15.190
at every point in time, the
kind of architectural shapes

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:16.720
and form you see--

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.910
if you look at it as an
historian of science,

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:22.920
you can read in
the physical shape,

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.790
the tools of
quantification which were

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.580
essential to make it happen.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.100
That doesn't mean that I can
do that for every period.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.300
I can only do it for some
little passages in it,

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.058
but that's the game.

00:49:41.785 --> 00:49:44.026
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
an interesting historical

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.205
introduction.

00:49:52.205 --> 00:49:55.830
I have a followup question
to the previous one.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:59.040
Could you please feed
the work of Gaudi

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.540
to these fishes, dogs, and
the straight lines story?

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.190
MARIO CARPO: Could you do what?

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:13.456
AUDIENCE: Could you please put
the work of Gaudi into this?

00:50:13.456 --> 00:50:15.330
MARIO CARPO: The work
of Gaudi, Antoni Gaudi?

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.940
AUDIENCE: Yes, yes-- into
this this scheme of fishes,

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.990
and the dogs, et cetera?

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:22.620
MARIO CARPO: Well, Gaudi was
a very important reference

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.570
of the beginning
of a digital term

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.820
in the '90s, because Gaudi--

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.290
who is not a dog and not a fish.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.810
It doesn't belong to any
historical parameters,

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:35.570
because it was a one off.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:39.120
It was an isolated genius,
who due to a remarkable set

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.570
of circumstances was allowed
in Barcelona to make something

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.010
happen, which is a miracle--

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.730
which should in theory
never have existed.

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.270
He wanted to reenact the way
of building of medieval master

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:55.647
builders, so he was
building without notations.

00:50:55.647 --> 00:50:57.480
In the Middle Ages,
architectural blueprints

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.620
did not exist.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.376
Craftsmens, there
was no separation

00:51:00.376 --> 00:51:02.000
between the designers
and the builders.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.240
The master builders were
conceiving and making

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.300
at the same time
on site on the fly.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:14.730
And in 1890 until 1910, Antoni
Gaudi in industrial Barcelona

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:18.050
wanted to revive due to
his ideology, to his faith,

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.770
to his inspiration--
wanted to revive

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.230
the medieval way of building.

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:23.860
He didn't want to
revive a style.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.330
He wanted really to revive
a social organization

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.580
of a medieval
building site, so he

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.160
wanted to devise a
way of being where

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.960
there's no designer
separated from the builder.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.390
The builder is a
master builder, who

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.530
decides every day what
is going to build.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.760
In an industrial world,
you cannot build that way.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.850
But in Barcelona,
at that time, he

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.940
found illuminated
sponsor, who decided

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.410
that he should build a
big cathedral that way--

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.500
to the superior glory
of god, which he did.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.320
And the building
is still going on,

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.210
because a medieval
cathedral, since it

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:00.054
has no design has no
beginning and no end.

00:52:00.054 --> 00:52:02.220
So long as there is someone
who is willing to build,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.470
the building will keep growing.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:08.070
And as of the mid-'90s,
someone I know, Mark Burry,

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:12.250
took on from where Gaudi stopped
using computer-aided design,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.690
because he thought with some
reason that using CAD/CAM--

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.940
computer-aided design and
computer-aided fabrication--

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.780
it is easier to reenact the
medieval way of building.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.210
Because if you work
with computers,

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:27.580
you can design and make
almost at the same time,

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.740
because you're using
the same machine.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:33.660
The same tool that puts
a picture on the screen

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.760
can print it out,
so the separation

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.910
between designer and
maker is compressed

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:40.360
by the tool you're using.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.840
So in a sense, this
use of a computer

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.710
is more medieval than modern,
which is why they are now--

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.620
they are now still building
the Sagrada Familia

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.510
using computers-- in a sense
continuing and interpreting

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.100
Gaudi's dream of
reviving the Middle Ages.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.340
It's a fascinating story.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.564
Thanks for bringing it up.

00:52:59.564 --> 00:53:04.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
which technique Gaudi

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:09.740
used to some sketches.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.750
I think that, even though
he built recently by himself

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:21.100
and leads the process, he had
some drawings of cathedral.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.390
MARIO CARPO: He had
diagrams not blueprints,

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.510
because stereotomy, which is the
medieval technique for cutting

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.300
stone, you can not represent it.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:33.250
But there are ways to teach
to the artisans how to do it.

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.630
And in the case of some
complicated curves,

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:37.740
he actually used
catenary models,

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.180
which we are still using,
to determine the shape

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.160
of some arches and their load.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.130
And in that, he was
probably bringing

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:48.080
in a technology which the
medieval builders would not

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.600
have known.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.260
So he was probably tweaking
his own rules a little bit.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.440
But I don't think there
are drawings by Gaudi.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.510
Diagrams, yes-- sketches made
after the building has been

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.150
built, yes-- but blueprint, no.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.070
Because that is contrary.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.900
It goes contrary to his spirit.

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.910
A blueprint is an
instruction, which

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:10.610
a thinker gives to a maker.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.380
In the medieval
scheme of things,

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.460
that separation does not exist.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.700
If you build, you
think and make.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.980
As an artisan, you
don't have a blueprint.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.260
You don't receive a
blueprint to execute.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.050
You decide, every
day in the morning,

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.170
what you will do during the
day, because that's medieval.

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:30.680
The architectural profession,
which I described,

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.720
was invented in the
Renaissance when

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.140
the humanists, a bunch of snobs,
decided that designers should

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:40.250
make and that ideas should have
an intellectual value which

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:45.050
is superior to actual craft,
but that is a modern invention.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:47.540
It was invented in the 15th
century with the Renaissance.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.710
In the Middle Ages, the
separation did not exist.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.305
This is what Gaudi had in mind--

00:54:52.305 --> 00:54:54.180
to revive the Middle
Ages, because he did not

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.080
like modernity even though the
money used to build the Sagrada

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.990
Familia was being earned by the
modern industrial development

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.517
in Barcelona, but
that's the way it works.

00:55:04.517 --> 00:55:08.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.840
Thanks very much for the talk.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.420
There was a sense that
maybe in the '80s and '90s,

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:17.860
maybe with CAD/CAM, other
technologies, or software,

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.650
that some things started
to look quite similar.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:25.180
Like, cars started to
resemble each other.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.080
Like, an Audi looked
like a BMW or whatever.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.840
Do you think, with
AI machine learning,

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.750
that there will be
more of that, or it

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.567
will be that things become more
differentiated in their design?

00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:40.150
MARIO CARPO: It is
true, particularly,

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:43.250
as you rightly point out,
in the case of car design.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:47.200
These kind of curves, the
splines, the mathematics

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.190
was the same in the software
used by all car makers

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.290
at the time, the
software was not.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:55.870
And each software
has its own tweaks.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:57.820
So I'm not
particularly an expert,

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.500
but Greg Lynn, one of the--

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.100
whose work I have shown--

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.240
was very much interested
in car design.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.750
He's a real expert
and connoisseur.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.810
He tells-- I have no evidence
of that-- but by looking

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:16.320
at the body of a car, he can
tell which release of a given

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.550
software was used to make it,
and it is true to some extent.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.570
There are tweaks of each
software which leave traces.

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.240
So sometimes you can tell
which release of Word

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.580
was used to compose a certain
text, because, you know,

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.280
cut and paste works in a
different way or something.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:37.560
So insofar as that
was the early--

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.650
you can do that because
there were probably

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.560
25 kinds of software
being used in the '90s

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:47.170
by all automotive
industry in the world,

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.120
so if you are in that
field, you know them all.

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.250
Now we are probably
moving to an environment

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:56.250
where there is much more
and faster variations

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.470
than adaptations, so
my guess is that game

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.030
of recognizing the indexical
trace of the tools we're using

00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:06.314
is not going to be
that easy anymore.

00:57:06.314 --> 00:57:07.980
Because in the '90s,
there were probably

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.880
25 variations of a
certain software,

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.570
and now there are
probably 1,000.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:14.100
And then, that game is--

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.370
so I think that
complexity, which

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.680
is coming through artificial
intelligence tools,

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.380
will make this kind of
thing lexical transference

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:26.354
of the tool into the traces
of it's use less conspicuous.

00:57:30.054 --> 00:57:30.970
HOST: All right then--

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:31.180
MARIO CARPO: That's it.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.400
HOST: --that's all we
have time for, yeah.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:32.720
MARIO CARPO: Good

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.470
HOST: Thank you very
much for coming.

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:34.428
MARIO CARPO: Thank you.

00:57:34.428 --> 00:57:38.810
