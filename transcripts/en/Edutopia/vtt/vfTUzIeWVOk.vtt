00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:06.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Well, the thousands cube
represents our thousands place.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:08.976
So let's put that right here.

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:18.026
&gt;&gt;Amanda: The Montessori Math approach
works, because it really helps the kids

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:19.686
on each level that they're on.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.136
There is a material made for
kids who can't even count yet,

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.386
kids who can't recognize numbers,
and then also for kids who are ready

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:27.726
to read four-digit numbers.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:29.866
&gt;&gt;Student:
Two-thousand-four-hundred-and-fourteen.

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:35.726
&gt;&gt;Dollie: Montessori Math puts
children on a continuum of lessons

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.846
and the children go from
concrete to abstract.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:41.386
It starts with the lower-level
math lessons,

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:43.606
and it progresses to the most difficult.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:44.536
&gt;&gt;Amanda: So what do you have to do?

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:47.486
You have to put these numbers in
order, and what are you counting to?

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.256
&gt;&gt;Amanda: They have a Control Board that
they use, and they put the little tiles

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:52.866
in order from one to one-hundred.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.446
And then if a child's really
ready, we have an extension to that

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.136
where they write one to one-hundred.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.406
&gt;&gt;Dollie: In a traditional classroom,

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.446
even though you differentiate
instruction,

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:04.806
the teacher has to teach to the group.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:10.216
In a Montessori classroom, you're able
to provide lessons to those children

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.556
on exactly the level that they're on.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:15.706
&gt;&gt;Diana: We're just going to focus
on our multiplying by units first.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:18.596
&gt;&gt;Diana: Every child
has their own workplan,

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:22.176
which means that they're all
working on different things

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.896
at different times in the classroom.

00:01:24.206 --> 00:01:26.746
There might be some similarities,
for example,

00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:30.966
many second years might be learning
multiplication at the same time.

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:32.956
But for the most part,
it's very individualized.

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:34.956
&gt;&gt;Diana: That's right.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:41.356
&gt;&gt;Bella: Here's our Math Shelf.

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:42.996
We could count by sliding the beads.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:45.083
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: I believe that
kids can grasp it much easier,

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:47.996
because we use concrete
materials to teach math.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:48.996
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: Two, three,
four, five...

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:52.206
&gt;&gt;Phyllis: The Golden Bead lesson
begins with "This is a unit.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.046
And then this a ten.

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:56.356
And a ten is ten of the units."

00:01:57.256 --> 00:02:01.466
And then we build the hundreds square,
and we build the thousand cube,

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.546
and they get that understanding
of what those numbers mean,

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:06.106
and not just saying those numbers.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.106
&gt;&gt;Rachel: One of the things
that Montessori does so well is

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.186
that it teaches conceptually.

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:13.446
It doesn't just teach a bunch of fact,

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:15.876
it doesn't just teach you
how to remember something.

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:19.516
It teaches you the base concept, and
then you go and apply those concepts.

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:21.106
&gt;&gt;Student: This is a
five long bead chain.

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:23.426
A six long bead chain.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:28.136
&gt;&gt;Diana: When it comes to place
value, our ones, or we say units,

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:31.426
are color-coded in green,
and then our tens are blue,

00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:36.046
and our reds are hundreds, and then we
say, "There's a new family started."

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:39.346
And then it goes to the
thousands, which are green again,

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:40.976
and then the ten thousands are blue.

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:42.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So my answer's
going to be down here, okay?

00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:44.796
&gt;&gt;Amanda: You're going to
count to eight seven times,

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.356
and then we'll count the total,

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.936
and we'll find out what eight
taken seven times is, okay?

00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.726
&gt;&gt;Amanda: Instead of saying
"plus" in Montessori, we say,

00:02:52.726 --> 00:02:54.886
"Two together with two is four."

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:57.376
&gt;&gt;Amanda: One together with six.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.366
&gt;&gt;Amanda: And the same thing
when we do multiplication we say,

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:02.286
"Taken so many times."

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:04.986
When we do subtraction,
we'll say, "Take away,"

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.726
because "subtract" is a really big word.

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.446
But they know what it means
to take something away.

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:10.536
They take away toys from
their friends all the time.

00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:12.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We are going
to share out the number--

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.006
&gt;&gt;Amanda: And then when we do
division, we do "shared out."

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.296
And those words just
make more sense to them.

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:20.476
Once they get the concept, we do
teach them the math vocabulary

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:22.496
that is actually what you use.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:25.526
&gt;&gt;Dollie: As a public school,
you have to find that balance.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:30.396
You have to stay true to the
Montessori Continuum, but you also have

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:33.876
to implement State Standards
on every grade level.

00:03:33.876 --> 00:03:36.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And we're still trying
to make that magic number seven.

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:40.416
&gt;&gt;Diana: If you look at the
curriculum and how it progresses,

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:43.676
then you see that Montessori
covers everything.

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:47.446
And in some ways, it covers more than
what the standards have offered to us.

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:51.486
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I feel like Montessori Math
really increases their confidence,

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:55.096
and helps them to understand
that there's that

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:57.396
"try" mentality involved with it.

00:03:57.506 --> 00:04:00.596
It's not that, "Oh, you got a bad
grade on this, and we're moving on."

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.766
It's, "How can we work
towards that mastery,

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:05.986
and how can we really
fully learn this concept?"
