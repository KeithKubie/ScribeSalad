Hi I am Erik and I am a software engineer
working on Google Chrome extensions.

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.160
In this video I am going to talk about the
user interface for extensions.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.059
Google Chrome's user-interface design emphasizes
"content, not chrome" which means we try to

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.250
minimize the amount of screen real-estate
the browser UI uses in order to allow the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.641
user to focus more on the content of the web.
For Google Chrome extensions, we wanted to

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:28.140
make sure we preserved Google Chrome's minimalist
aesthetic.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.900
Extensions in other browsers have a reputation
for doing things like filling your browser

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.000
with toolbars, or covering every possible
surface of your browser with their UI, leaving

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.559
no room for the content itself.
With Google Chrome extensions, we've decided

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.289
to take the approach that an extension is
only allowed a single UI surface, and that

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.929
UI surface will be minimal.
We also believe that users should control

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.620
where and when extension UI is displayed,
so it should be easy to hide and remove any

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.649
unwanted user interface.
While developing Google Chrome extensions,

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.859
we experimented with a number of other UI
surfaces, and we kept pushing them to make

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.420
them simpler and more minimal.
Those that didn't feel like they fit our UI

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.620
philosophy were eventually cut.
The content-not-chrome philosophy extends

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.220
to the types of extensions that we'd like
to enable as well.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.040
Rather than focusing too much on changing
particulars of Google Chrome's interface,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.580
we've designed the extension system to be
about interacting with the web.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.550
Google Chrome extensions are primarily about
adding functionality to web pages, or providing

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.180
access to or integration with the content
from web sites.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.940
They're not about changing the appearance
of the tabs or rearranging the menus.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.031
The simplest bit of extensions UI is the browser
action.

00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:45.320
A browser action is a simple button that is
added to the main toolbar to the right of

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920
the omnibox.
The extension can change the icon on the button,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.390
depending on the content on the current page,
even animating it.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.030
Extensions can also simply add colored badges
of text over their icons.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.210
These badges are ideal for counters or small
status indicators.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.909
In addition to simply performing actions,
browser actions can also show popup bubbles.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.780
Pop ups are built using HTML and are sized
dynamically based on the contents.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.819
Page actions are similar to browser actions,
but they're in the omnibox and they appear

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.010
and disappear based on the contents of the
page.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.760
Like browser actions, page actions can display
pop ups, but they don't support badges.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.150
The rule of thumb about when to use each is
that a browser action should almost always

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.040
be valid - for example, "blog about this page"
or "show the current weather forecast" - , while

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.120
page actions should only apply to some pages
based on their content - for example "map

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.990
address on this page".
Another approach for extension UI is to use

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.270
the content of the page itself.
This can be the ultimate in the minimalist

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.319
approach, taking up no space in the browser's
chrome itself.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.370
For example, an extension might turn the results
of an image search into a slide show, completely

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.090
using in-page UI.
With the extension system itself, our team

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.690
wanted it to feel lightweight and unobtrusive.
For example, when you install extensions,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.030
they immediately appear and are usable.
You're not prompted when extensions update

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.540
themselves, and you never need to restart
the browser, even when you disable or uninstall

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.921
an extension.
In the future, we will likely provide web

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:32.160
developers with access to more surfaces.
However, we will always do this carefully

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.540
with the user's interests in mind. We welcome
your suggestions in our discussion group.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.270
