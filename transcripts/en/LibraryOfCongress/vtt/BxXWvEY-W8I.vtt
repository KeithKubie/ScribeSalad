00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:10.510
&gt;&gt; Here to read from "The Girl who
Drank the Moon" is Kelly Barnhill.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:01:03.760
[ Applause ]

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.060
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Oh, my.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.720
I'm very concerned I might trip.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.020
That's all right.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.300
If I trip, it won't be the first
time that I have fallen off

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.680 position:56%
of a stage because I am very
klutzy, so I, I apologize right now.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.980
Hello, everyone.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.280
My name is Kelly Barnhill.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.670
I write books with magic in them.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.690
So, before we begin, I know
we have 25 minutes together,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.250
and I don't want to have me
talk too long because I know

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.990
that you guys have
a lot of questions.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.420
Part of being a kid is that you're
basically composed of questions.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.450
I know a lot of you have questions
about how books get written.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.450
I know a lot of you have questions
about where ideas come from.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.690
I know you have questions
about how you can come back

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.230
to the same story day
after day after day

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.150
and make something happen again.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.300 position:56%
So, I, what I want you to do for me
right now is save your questions up.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.350 position:56%
Because I want, I would, my
favorite part of any presentation is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.210
when you guys ask questions
and I answer them

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.650
and we can talk a little
bit about it, okay?

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.240
Now, before we begin, just so
I can get a sense of grades,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600
how many of you guys
are in third grade?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400
How many third graders do we have?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.700
Can you raise your hand?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790
Oh! We have one third
grader, awesome.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880
Two? That's cool.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.180
Three third graders?

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.400
Third grade is a, four, five, wow!

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.600
Third grade is a really good grade.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.380
Well now, I remember
being in third grade.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.360
It was the first time I
learned about Ancient Egypt

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.940
and it was super cool
and kind of blew my mind.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.620
How many of you guys
are fourth graders?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.480 position:56%
How many? Ah, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.890
ten, eleven, twelve, whoa!

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.190
And even more than 12.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.760
There's a lot of fourth
graders here today.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.060
I love fourth graders.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.910
Part of my job, one of
my many jobs that I have,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.140
is I go around to the state
of Minnesota where I live

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.720 position:56%
and I do creative writing workshops.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.730
I do story writing
workshops with kids.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.540
And I will say there
is something magical

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080
that happens in fourth grade.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.170
Fourth graders, I think,
are actually magical.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.540
And they write amazing stories.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.490
Every time, no matter what
kind of school I'm in,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.470
fourth graders are magic.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.900
How many of you guys
are in fifth grade?

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.140
Awesome! Oh, my gosh, so, um, the
fifth grade is an amazing grade

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.680
because you guys are about
to start something brand new.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.890
Right? You're about to
become something else.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.800
You're about to become
middle schoolers.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.320
How many of you are
in middle school?

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.080
Awesome. Well done.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.580
You guys, this is awesome.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.800
Okay, so, this is my book.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.880
It's called "The Girl
who Drank the Moon".

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.920
I love writing books
with magic in it.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.780
This is a story about
a 500-year-old witch

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.650
and a poetry-quoting
swamp monster who may

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.260
or may not be as old as the world.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.260
And a perfectly tiny dragon, who
suffers from delusions of grandeur

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.030
and he thinks he's so giant,
he's bigger than a house,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.060
but actually he's so small
that he fits in your pocket.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.670
And they all have to
raise a magical baby.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.360
That's not really what
the story is about.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.800
It sort of is, though.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.710 position:56%
I wanted to write a story about a
place where, every year, every year,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.560
they participate in a
terrible, terrible crime.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.790
This town, it's called
"The Protectorate".

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.980
It is sandwiched between a bog
that covers half of the world,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.890
you cannot cross, and on one
side, and on the other side,

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.450
there is a very, very
dangerous forest.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.510
It is so dangerous that it is
very difficult to get through it.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.150
And what the people of the
Protectorate believe is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.600
that the reason why that
forest is dangerous is

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.100
because there is a
witch in the woods.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.450
Yes, they say, yes.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.170
There is a witch in the woods.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.440
And the only way to keep
that witch from coming

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.650 position:56%
and destroying them all is that they
have to, every year, take a baby,

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.670
the youngest baby in
the Protectorate,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.730
and leave it in the forest
for the witch to take.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.060
So, they have to sacrifice
a baby every year.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.150
And because of this, because
of this terrible crime

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.830
and because everyone is complicit
in it, the entire Protectorate is,

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.160
it's a sorrowful, terrible place.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.150
They live in this cloud of sorrow.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.460
And because of that sorrow, nobody
really seems to notice the fact

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.010
that the council of elders
owns everything in the town

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.070
and everyone else has nothing.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.250
And nobody seems to
notice that the council

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.280
of elders runs everything
in the town.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.760
And nobody else in the town
has any kind of power at all.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.010
Now, the council of elders,
they don't believe in the witch.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.480
They never have.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.860 position:56%
For them, it's a convenient fiction.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.880
Unpleasant, yes, unpleasant.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.140
But it's convenient for
them, because it allows them

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.060
to maintain this life that
they've always had, right?

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.140
Now, what the council
of elders do not know is

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.500
that there really is a witch.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.800
Her name is Xan.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.410
She's 500 years old, and every
year she comes to the same place

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.130
in the forest and, once again,
somebody has left a baby, a baby,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.840
just sitting right
there in the forest.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.530
And she can't just leave the baby
there, because the baby will die.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.960
So, she does what all of us
would do if we saw a baby

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.780
that has been abandoned
in the woods.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.130
What would we do?

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.550
We'd save the baby, right?

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.920
We'd save the baby, obviously.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.670
And so, she does what any
sensible witch would do.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.540
She gathers the baby up and
over the years she has taken

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.840
certain precautions.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.910
She has brought a blanket,
because, well,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.520
I'm probably going to find a baby.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.000
I always find one every year.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.390
She brings a blanket
to wrap the baby up.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.220
She brings a bottle of
goat's milk to feed the baby.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.830
Now, the forest is very
dangerous and it's very dangerous

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.880
because it's a volcanic landscape.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.350
And so, it's very tricky
to get across.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:21.260 position:56%
Xan knows how, because of cleverness
and know-how and also magic, too.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.520
And, on the other side of the
forest, there's a bunch of cities

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.520
that are called the free cities
that are really pleasant places

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.060
and they don't have
bizarre, terrible things

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.690
that they do every single year.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.010 position:56%
And so, she decides that she's going
to take the baby across the forest

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.590
and find the perfect
family for each baby.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.410
And she carries the baby across

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.760
and she feeds them the goat's
milk whenever the tummy gets empty

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.500
and when the goat's milk runs out,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.700
she does what any sensible
witch would do.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.320
She reaches her hands
up to the night sky

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.330
and she gathers starlight
as light as gossamer.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.680
Well, I can see from your faces
that you already know why.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.080
I mean, starlight is
an excellent baby food.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.530
Ask any witch, right?

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.470
And so, by the time she gets to
the other side of the forest,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:14.640
these babies are star-filled
and blessed and they are funny

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.210
and clever and kind and they
make wonderful daughters and sons

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.600 position:56%
and wonderful brothers and
sisters, and they grow up to be good

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.740
at what they do and
excellent members

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.020
of the community and
wonderful parents.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.020
And they are successful.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.360
And when they die, they die rich.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.700
This has literally been
happening for 300 years.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.930
Now, as this story opens,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.020
certain things don't
happen according to plan.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.900
Things don't happen
in the normal way.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.340
Number one, a mother
fights for her baby.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.350
She fights and she
fights and she fights.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.310
And she kicks and she scratches
and she pulls people's hair out

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.500
and she says, you do not
get to take my child.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.060
Well, everybody says she is crazy!

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.870
She must be insane.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.820
And so, they lock her up in
the tower as the mad woman.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.310
And they take the baby and
they leave it in the forest.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.100
Now, when Xan arrives, oh, sorry.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.280
Another thing that happens that
is not particularly usual is

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.140
that there is a boy who's 12
years old, and his name is Antain.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.600
And Antain is an elder in training.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.550
But he bears witness
to this terrible scene

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.790
of this mother fighting
for her baby.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.940
Normally, people just
give their babies up.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.150
That's just what everybody does.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:42.420
But Antain sees this, and he,
all by himself in trying to hide

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.740
from the adults that he is crying.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.330
And he's so terrified and
horrified by what he's seeing

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.930
that that becomes a
question in his heart.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.710
Why? Why do we do this?

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.350
And can we do something else?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.460
And as he grows, that question in
his heart is going to get bigger

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.010
and bigger and bigger and then
it's going to turn into a plan.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.930
Okay. The third thing that
happens is that Xan the witch,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.660
she comes across this baby and she
wraps the baby up and she notices

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.200
that the baby has a
birthmark on her forehead.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.070
Just in the shape of
a crescent moon.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.260
And as, and it's just
a random birthmark.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.080
There's nothing special about it.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.740
But Xan has one, too.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.040
She has that same birthmark.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.880
And this has never
happened to her before.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.520
She's never seen a baby
who kind of looks like her.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.380
And she feels this sense
of kinship with the baby.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:45.040
And so she finds herself taking
the journey very, very slowly,

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.300
because she wants to show
the baby things and she wants

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.970
to sing the baby a song and she
wants to tell the baby a story.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.530
And she just wants to
look in the baby's eyes.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.880
She's got big, black eyes.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.660
She's a beautiful baby.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.090
And as she goes, she is
giving the baby more and more

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.820
and more starlight every night.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.830
And the baby becomes more and
more and more star-filled.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.350
But what she doesn't notice is
that the moon is getting bigger

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.360
and bigger and bigger,
because that's what moons do.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.700
They wax and they wane, right?

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.730
And then, one night, the
moon is all the way full.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.600
And Xan doesn't notice and she
reaches up to gather starlight

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.600
and she accidentally gets moonlight
instead, and it is sticky and sweet

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.350
on her fingers and she
feeds it to the baby.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.740
Well, I can see from your faces

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.040
that you already can
tell the problem, here.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.290
If a witch gives full
moonlight to a baby,

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.900 position:56%
she enmagics that baby, permanently.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.740
It can't be undone.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.990
This is serious and old,
old magic and so now,

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.940
you've got a baby that's
filled all the way,

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.170
filled to bursting with magic.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.590
And so, anything could happen
with a baby that is this magical.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.590
She could turn her caregiver
into a bunny and she does.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.600
She could make the cradle fly.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.230
She could burst things into flames.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.200
She has no idea what she is doing.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.930
How many of you have
ever met a baby before?

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.340
How much sense does a baby have?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.960
Not very much, huh?

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.980
And so, she can't just
leave this baby with anybody

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.630
because she is dangerous.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.810
And so Xan decides to bring the
baby home and bring the baby up.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.100
So, she goes to her home in
the forest where she lives

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.560
with a poetry quoting
swamp monster who may

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.190
or may not be as old as the world.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.880
And a perfectly tiny dragon who
suffers from delusions of grandeur.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.860
And they become a very loving,
albeit very strange, little family.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.350 position:56%
But here's the thing about children.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.830
And you guys are all kids,
so you know this already.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.660
Children grow.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.450
Children grow.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.840
And as they grow, the questions
inside of them get bigger

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.170
and bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.370
And so, in the Protectorate,
we've got Antain who starts

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.180
out to be twelve years old
at the beginning, and then,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.010
eventually becomes a young man.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.700
And his question of
why, why do we do this?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.100
That is going to get
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.230
until he has a family of his own

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.400
and has some really big
problems in front of him.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.710
And Luna, Luna, the
girl who drank the moon.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.160
Luna with this incredible
magic inside her,

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.660
she is going to get bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:39.740 position:56%
And the questions about her life and
why it is that she has these dreams

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.330
of a black haired woman
standing at the roof of a house

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:48.820
with her hair flying all around her
yelling, "She is here, she is here,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.710
she is here!", and meanwhile,
there's the madwoman in the tower

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:59.910
who is making maps of impossibly
strange places that also say,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.090
"She is here, she is
here, she is here!".

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.820
And as the story progresses,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.610
all of these threads
start to come together.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.910
So, that is my book.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.130
I was going to read
you, just 109 minutes?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.430
Okay, I have 10 minutes left.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.130
I'm going to read you just a
tiny bit and then I'm going

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.480
to have questions from you guys,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.780
because I know you
guys have questions.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.100
Okay, that sound good?

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.090
One of the things that is fun
for a fantasy author who used

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.800
to be a theology major
is that you actually get

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.900
to make a brand new world and you
get to write things like this.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.350
Where is it?

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.650
Oh here we go.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:55.740
In the beginning, there was
bog and bog and bog and bog.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.490
There were no people,
there were no fish.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.450
There were no birds or beasts
or mountains or forests or sky.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.940
The bog was everything.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.150
And everything was the bog.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.030
The muck of the bog ran from one
edge of reality to the other,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.050
it curved and warbled through time.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.960
There were no words,
there was no learning,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.640
there was no music
or poetry or thought.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.730
There was just the sigh of the
bog and the crick of the bog

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.100 position:56%
and the endless rustle of the reeds.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.970
But, the bog was lonely.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.990
It wasnted eyes with
which to see the world.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.370
It wanted a strong back
with which to carry itself

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.780
from place to place to place.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:49.950 position:56%
It wanted hands to touch and legs
to walk and a mouth that could sing.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.230
And so, the bog created a body.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:58.270 position:56%
A great beast that walked out of the
bog on its own stong, boggy legs.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.450
And the beast was the bog,
and the bog was the beast.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.740
And the beast loved the bog.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.460
And the bog loved the beast.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.190
Just as a person loves the image
of himself in a still pool of water

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.330
and looks upon it with tenderness.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:19.050
The beast's chest was full of
warm and life-giving compassion.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.420
He felt the shine of
love radiating ourward

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.940
and he wanted words to
exspress how he felt.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.190
And so, there were words.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.830
And then the beast wanted those
words to fit together just so,

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.060
just to explain his meaning.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.170
He opened his mouth,
and a poem came out.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.990
Round and yellow, yellow
and round, the beast said.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:51.090
And then the sun was born,
shining just overhead.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.240
Blue and white and black and gray,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.250
and a burst of color at
dawn, the beast sang.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.650
And then the sky was born.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.900
The creak of wood and the softness
of moss and the rustle and whisper

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.420
of green and green
and green and green.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.510
And then, there were forests.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.720
Everything you see,
everything you know,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.360
was brought into being by the bog.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.510
The bog loved us and
we loved the bog.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:30.410
[ Applause ]

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.390
There are microphones
right over there,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.950
so if anybody has a
question, I want to answer it.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:51.990
It will have to go way down,
because you guys are short.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.290
Hi!

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.590
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.890
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill:
What's your question, hon?

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.190
&gt;&gt; I have two.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.490
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Okay.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.790
Go ahead.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.090
&gt;&gt; Why did you decide
to write this book?

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.390
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barhnill: Oh,
really good question.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.300 position:56%
Why did I decide to write this book?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.110
Well, I was out for a run one day,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.530
and I had a vision
of a swamp monster.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.360
And he had four arms
and wide, damp jaws.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.800
And eyes that moved
independently of each other.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.410
And he was holding a daisy in
one hand, and he recited a poem.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.950
And it was actually the last
poem that is in the book.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.850
YOu know, there's all
kinds of poems in the book.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.760
And the very last poem
was from that one day,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.150
and I did not change
a single word of it.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.870
And so, I ran home, and I
wrote the poem down on a card.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:40.080
And then, I wrote on
the back, Swamp Monster.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.590
And then I got a box, because
all of my books start with a box,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.380
and i put the card into the box
and then I thought, oh dear,

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.710
this is a book somewhere.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.930
And it took me two
years of just thinking

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.970 position:56%
about Blerk the swamp monster to try
to figure out what the story was.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.270
So, that's why.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.570
Thank you.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.390
What's your other question, honey?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:11.150
&gt;&gt; Why, when those babies were
filled with stars they grew bigger?

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Oh, because
starlight is very special, you know?

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.560
Stars come to us from a very,
very, very far ways away.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:25.140 position:56%
And so, as it moves through space
and time, it becomes kind of blessed

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.610
in the world of this story.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.910
So, that's why.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.210
Good question!

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.130
Next question, yeah.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.490
&gt;&gt; Was there anyone in
your life who inspired you

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.320
to write the character of Luna?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.020
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Of
Luna, really good question.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.720
So, one of the things
that I liked about Luna is

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.820
that she is a prickly girl.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.060
She is impatient and sometimes
frustrated and has a lot

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.580
of questions and knows that people
aren't giving her straight answers

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.880
all the time.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.780 position:56%
And it fills her with, she's
motivated by her own hunger to know,

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.800
as well as her own tenderness
of the people around her,

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.080
as well as her frustration
of not knowing things.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.610
And for me, I mean, Luna reminds
me a lot of my own daughters.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.540
She also reminds me
a little bit of me.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.020
And because i sometimes,
when I was here age,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.420
when I was eleven I
had a temper, too.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.000
And so, so, I see a lot
of myself in her, too.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.300
So, great question.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.600
Thank you.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.190
Ah, yeah.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.210
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
poem in the book?

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Oh, well, I mean,

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.540
probably my favorite poem is the
very first one that Glurk gave me,

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:39.580
it is the last poem in the book,
the heart is built of starlight

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.910
and time, a pinprick of
longing, lost in the dark.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.350
An unbroken cord linking the
infinite to the infinite.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.930
I wish upon your heart,
and that wish is granted.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.430
Meanwhile, the world spins.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.940
Meanwhile, the universe expands.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:21:00.750
Meanwhile, the miracle of the heart
is realized in the miracle of you.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.170
So. Anyway.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.470
Thank you.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.770
Yeah.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.070
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.710
My first question is, who is your
favorite character in the book?

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.010
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Oh, you know,

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.690
I would say probably my favorite
character in the book is Fyrian.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.000
Which, I have to be
careful about saying that,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.580
because I almost wrote him out.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.010
And, because I was worried that
he was a disruptive character,

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.460
and I was worried that I would
have to take him out of the story.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.240
And so, I sent my editor
an email saying,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.430
I'm worried that I might
have to get rid of Fyrian.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.080
And she wrote back in one second,
and she said, oh, don't you dare!

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.520
So, I had to figure out
how to like make him,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.710
I had to change some things in the
book to make his character work.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.110
And so, as a result, I feel this
great tenderness towards him,

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.270
because I had to work so
hard to keep him there.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.030
So. Anyway, that's probably why.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.330
Thank you.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.550
Yes.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:56.520
&gt;&gt; Where did you get the
inspiration for Fyrian?

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.820
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: For Fyrian?

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.570
You know, I, I think that,
you know, I mean, partially,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.310
what's funny about
Fyrian is that he,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.380
I wrote him before
I got our new dog.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.200
We have a dog who's
a black labrador.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.900
His name is Serious Black.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.290
He is nothing like his namesake.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:16.210
He would not last 5
minutes in Askaban.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.930
But, but it's funny
because there's so much

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.470
of my dog that is like Fyrian.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:27.640
He just wants, he wants to be
part of the group all the time.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.850
And but Fyrian is also a lot like
this kid I used to babysit for,

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.490
actually, who thought he was much
bigger, like he was this tiny,

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.680 position:56%
tiny little kid, but he would always
tell people he was 7 feet tall.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.210
So, he comes a little
bit from that kid, too.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.510
Great question.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.810
Yes?

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.110
&gt;&gt; What made you choose the ending?

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.670
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Oh,
really good question.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.730
You know, I'm not even really sure.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.950
I mean, for me, I don't do a
lot of planning with my books.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.870
The ending is the ending because
that simply was the ending, right?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:06.110
The, usually I can't
see any other way.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.310
So, you follow the
story where it leads,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.650
and sometimes that
simply is what it is.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:18.260
So, so yeah, I was happy about
it, though, because I don't

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.320
like endings that are too neat.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:29.710
And I wanted, because in the end,
I think, I think that there are no,

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.630 position:56%
like, heros and villians, that
there's only, you know, good choices

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.570
and bad choices and that all of us
have, it's incumbent to all of us

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.120
to make good choices, right?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.220
And so, even people
who are villanous

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.990
in the story have the opportuinty
and have the responsibility

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.830
to make a good choice, right?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:51.190
So, anyway, there, most
of my books end in sort

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.560 position:56%
of similarly sort of ambiguous ways.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.930
So. Yes?

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.690
&gt;&gt; What was your reaction
for getting the call

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.020
from the Newberry Honors?

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.020
&gt;&gt; Kelly Barnhill: Well!

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.640
[Laughter] Well!

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.780
So, when you, here's
the thing that happens

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.450
when you win a Newberry Award.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.490
They call you at 5:00
in the morning.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:18.140
And some people, some people have
an inkling that it might be them,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.540
they might get that call.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.390 position:56%
And so, they are very smart and
they actually, like, wake themselves

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:27.990
up so they don't sound like
a moron when they talk.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.010
But what happened to me is
that I had no idea at all,

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:35.690
so I was deep asleep,
and then my phone rang.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:39.880
And it was really loud, because
my kids had, a few days before,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.040 position:56%
changed the ring tone of my phone to
be the theme song to Wonder Woman,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.370
the old '70s TV show
And it's all, you know,

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.180
like lots of like '70s funk.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.960
It's a really great theme song.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.440
And so, that was the sound that
woke me up at 5:00 in the morning.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.620
And I answered the phone and
I didn't know who it was,

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.730
because it wasn't a
number that I knew.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.430
And I was worried that something
terrible had happened to,

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.730
like, a family member.

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.030
Because, I'm Irish Catholic.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.330
I've got a million family members.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.630
But you never know.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.070 position:56%
And so, I answered the phone, and
on the other side was this room full

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:20.660
of super cheerful librarians who
were, like, they were so excited,

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.390
and they're cheering for me.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.370
It took me a while to, like,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.160
actually process what
they were saying.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.910
And all i could say in return
was a bunch of nonsense.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.330
Just garbledy nonsense.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.150
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
a sign that says Wrap it Up.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.080
Which means I can't listen
to all your questions,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.910
and I want to hear
all of your questions.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.060
However, those of you who still
have questions, if you want them

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.970
to be answered, I want
to answer them.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.700
So, there's two ways to do that.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.780
One, I am going to go over to the
signing line, so you can come over

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.600
and ask me your questions then.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:57.290
Also, my website is
Kelly Barnhill dot com.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.780
The contact button goes
straight to my email.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.810
You ask me whatever you want,
and I will answer it for you.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.930
Okay? Guys, you were amaxing.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.230
What a great audience!

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.510
A pluses to everybody!

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:22.620
[ Applause ]
