00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.099
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.515
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: And so we
both have a set of cards today,

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:10.890
and we're both going
to be asking questions.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.022
It could be a disaster,
or it could be magical.

00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:16.480
MATIAS DUARTE:
Normally, your stage

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.830
is one where you're critiquing
products, end results.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.690
What would you say
to this audience

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.897
if you have an opportunity
to talk before they actually

00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:27.605
create a product?

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:31.800
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: What I would
say is, don't do focus groups.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520
Make a product that you think
is awesome and that you love.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.220
I think the best design,
the best products,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.740
come from really smart
people just trying

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.540
to solve their own problems,
trying to solve problems

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.230
that they really
deeply understand.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.350
I guess what I'm saying
is follow your heart when

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.490
it comes to design.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.406
Matias and I thought it
would be great to have

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:53.669
mimosas in the morning onstage.

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:55.210
MATIAS DUARTE:
Terrible or brilliant.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.350
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: I don't
know if it was a great idea,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.370
but they are quite delicious.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.830
MATIAS DUARTE: I don't think so.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.230
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: You can always
design your spread across lots

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.750
of different products, lots
of different breakpoints,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.590
so how would a company
the size of Google and one

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.476
that has historically,
not known for design,

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:09.850
how do you get
everybody together

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.430
and start collaborating
on good design that is not

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.960
just beautiful and
useful, but that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.750
is aligned across all
these different silos?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.540
MATIAS DUARTE: I
think all large design

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.727
problems have to be
tackled by groups.

00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:26.310
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Does material
design become a bible at Google

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.440
for how you do design?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.780
MATIAS DUARTE: It
becomes a guideline.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.570
That's actually
one of the things

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.580
I think is really
interesting about creating

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.770
guidelines and
creating structures.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.580
There's a very fine
balance between giving

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.570
too little guidance and actually
not helping people and giving

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.904
so much guidance that you
become kind of a straitjacket.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.570
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Do
you worry that we're

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.010
simplifying too much in design?

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.510
MATIAS DUARTE: I
think what you want

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.590
is a framework that
allows you to have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.960
the conversation about
how you could simplify.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.190
I think there's many of
these different axes that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.100
are going to be radically
changing how we think

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.130
about our design practice, that
are going to be challenging all

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.290
the things that we think
are the fixed points of what

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.524
it is that we do as designers.

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:15.940
Basically, in the
exact same way I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.220
think that you were saying
you were a print designer

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.920
and you thought you
knew how this worked.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.840
Print, I know how to
make beautiful things.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.564
And all of a sudden when it's
responsive, mind blown, right?

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:28.480
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Yeah,
Matias, thanks so much.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.540
MATIAS DUARTE:
Thank you so much.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.790
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Thanks, guys.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.990
