00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.300
Despite the fact that Wilson
had just won reelection in 1916

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.420
based on a platform of keeping
the United States out of war,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.640
by April of 1917,
the administration

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.149
had decided that Germany
had gone too far.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.630
And in particular,
had gone too far

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.440
with the unrestricted
submarine warfare.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.600
So this right over
here is a picture

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.560
of President Wilson on
April 2, 1917, giving a war

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.490
message to Congress
as to why the US needs

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.810
to declare war on Germany.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.790
And April 4, Congress passes
the resolution to declare war.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.000
And then the President
approves it on April 6.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.586
So by early April, the United
States was at war with Germany.

00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:49.460
Which is a good time to
start thinking about,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.214
why did all of this happen.

00:00:51.214 --> 00:00:52.630
Now, the things
that are typically

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.129
cited, and these
are the things that

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.790
are inflamed public opinion in
the US and that many of which

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.040
were cited by President
Woodrow Wilson.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.570
And in this tutorial
that this is

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.630
part of on
khanacademy.org, I put

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.440
the entire text of his speech,
which I highly recommend

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.260
reading to see all of the
things the President Wilson

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.704
cited in his speech.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:13.120
But just as a summary of that,
the things that tend to get

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.010
cited most often are the
unrestricted submarine warfare

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.070
on the part of Germany.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.960
And particular cases
or the most cited

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.522
example of that is the
sinking of the Lusitania.

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.480
The Germans had stopped
doing that for a little

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.310
under two years.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.120
But then, as we enter into
1917, they began doing it again.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.430
And it also made the
Americans quite angry

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.340
to realize that the
Germans were trying

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.010
to incite the
Mexicans against them.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.250
So you have the
Zimmerman telegram.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.660
Zimmerman telegram
is also a reason

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.770
that the Wilson administration,
and why people in general,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.600
were fairly angry about things.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.260
Now, on top of that,
there were atrocities

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.860
committed by the
Germans in their march

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.830
through Belgium as
they were trying

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.210
to execute on the
Schlieffen Plan.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.690
So Belgian atrocities.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.380
And these were earlier in the
war in 1914, which immediately

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.530
made many Americans not
like what's going on.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.450
Belgian atrocities.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.570
And to put on top
of that, the British

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.370
were able to leverage the
Belgian atrocities to fairly,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.350
to execute a fairly effective
propaganda campaign in America.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.100
Now on top of that--
and this is something

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.200
that Wilson speaks very
strongly about in his speech--

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.420
is the notion of
fighting for democracy.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.650
And what you have here, in the
First World War, the Central

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.150
Powers.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.560
You're talking about
the German Empire,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.370
you're talking about
the Austro-Hungarians.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.700
These are monarchies.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880
These are emperors who
are controlling it.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.950
And even though the
UK, the United Kingdom,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.724
was nominally a kingdom,
it was really a democracy.

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:02.140
At least for those
who could vote.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.290
We're not talking about
the entire British Empire.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.230
So UK is functionally a
democracy, democratic.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.650
And so was the Third
French Republic.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.030
And so was France.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.830
So there's this
argument that the US

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.120
is fighting for the
representation of people.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.470
Now, there is a more
cynical argument

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.660
that some people have made.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.850
And I think it's reasonable
to give that to due time.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.260
And one of the
cynical arguments,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.120
or more cynical
arguments, is that the US

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.880
had close financial and
trade ties to Britain,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.790
not to mention cultural ties.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.310
Financial ties to the British.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.800
On top of that, you had very
successful British propaganda.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.500
One, talking about the
atrocities in Belgium,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.800
which did actually happen.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.590
But the British
were able to exploit

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.350
this as a propaganda machine.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.900
Successful propaganda.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.640
But they also spread rumors
that after the sinking

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.630
of the Lusitania
that the Germans

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.570
had their school
children celebrating.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.415
And these were all
made up propaganda.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.802
And then, more
cynical view of why

00:04:10.802 --> 00:04:12.510
the US entered the
war-- and this is true

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.530
of probably most
wars-- is that there

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.360
was a lot of lobbying on
the part of war profiteers.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.137
In fact, in "Little Orphan
Annie," Daddy Warbucks,

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:25.220
the name, the reason why
his last name is Warbucks

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.450
is because he made his
fortune as a war profiteer

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.600
during World War I.
And war profiteers,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.190
these are people who might be
selling arms to the Allies.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.060
Or who might sell arms
to the US government

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.560
if the US were to get into
a war that might somehow

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.690
supply the troops.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.440
And it includes, potentially,
folks on Wall Street.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.180
There were significant
lending to the Allies,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.260
and mainly the Allies,
not the Central Power.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.980
And so the view is
if the Allies win,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.440
those loans are going
to be made good.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.020
And I had the entire
text of the speech

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.920
from Senator George Norris
who was one of five senators,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.320
or sorry, one of six senators
to vote against the resolution

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.920
to go to war.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.150
There were 50 representatives
who also voted against it.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.302
This is a little excerpt
but also in this tutorial,

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:12.760
I have the full
text of his speech.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.790
And I highly, highly, highly
recommend reading that

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.820
along with Wilson's text of his
speech to Congress in his war

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.741
message.

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:23.990
But I'll just read this part
because it does, I think,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.720
point out that the US,
from the beginning,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.060
did have biases that
were more pro-British.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.850
And so this is
part of his speech.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.530
"The reason given
by the President

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.370
in asking Congress to
declare war against Germany

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.390
is that the German government
has declared certain war zones,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.780
within which by the
use of submarines,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.880
she sinks, without
notice, American ships

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.910
and destroys American lives.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.070
The first war zone was
declared by Great Britain.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.720
She gave us and the
world notice of it

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.410
on the 4th day of November 1914.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.190
The zone became effective
November 5, 1914.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.610
This zone, so declared
by Great Britain,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.670
covered the whole
of the North Sea.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.840
The first German war
zone was declared

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.520
on the 4th day of
February, 1915,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.910
just three months after the
British war zone was declared.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.750
Germany gave 15 days
notice of the establishment

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.600
of her zone, which
became effective

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.480
on the 18th day
of February, 1915.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.150
The German war zone
cover the English Channel

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.060
and the high seawaters
around the British Isles.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.470
It is unnecessary
to cite authority

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.570
to show that both of these
orders declaring military zones

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.290
were illegal and contrary
to international law.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.350
It is sufficient to say that
our government has officially

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.000
declared both of
them to be illegal

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.020
and has officially protested
against both of them.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.220
The only difference is
that, in the case of Germany

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.130
we have persisted
in our protest,

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.210
while in the case of
England, we have submitted."

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.180
And I encourage you,
once again, to read

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.220
the text of both Wilson's speech
and Senator Norris' speech

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.480
and come up to your,
with your own decisions.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.940
And it might be a
little bit of both.
