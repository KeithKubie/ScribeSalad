1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,070
The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. People get
too comfortable, you know? It's just, it,

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:08,280
it's only their fans. There's
preaching to the fan base. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,120
We've got like Bill Maher is not changing
anyone's mind. Just like people are,

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,370
people are applauding there.

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,240
They know they're going to apply
before they even get there. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,200
I would never do a comedy club. He
looks in the comedy clubs at all. No,

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm sure he does not. Yeah. Yeah. I
think, yeah. I think you really have to.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah. No, I think so too. Yeah. Well,
he's in this weird category too, right?

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,560
Where he's not just doing comedy.
He's got to do,

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,280
everything has to be political because
this whole thing is about political,

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,190
political shit. Like his show is
his persona, who he is, you know,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,120
he donated $1 million to the Democratic
Party. Like he's, it's all politics. Oh,

13
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,110
all of it. And I can't stand
political humor just because
it's just, it's so easy.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,220
You know?
You're either,

15
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,550
you're either making everyone mad or
you're making everyone really happy,

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,560
but it doesn't really matter like what
the joke is. Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah,

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,050
yeah. It's, uh,

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,940
and then if you're doing stuff about
like the speaker of the house and you're

19
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:10,680
like, God, when someone's like, should the
Mueller report, it's like, fuck man. Like,

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,060
no.
Yeah.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,660
You know who's like super deep into
politics on the right is nick depaulo like

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,910
every time I talked to him yeah.

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,970
And wants to talk about the fucking
Steele dossier. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,980
Let's talk about all this different,
all the Shit Obama did. Well,

25
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,910
how about when Obama did this? Yeah. How
do you know? Yeah, I don't even know this.

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,830
I know that the,
the knowledge of it,

27
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:36,190
like I once got a phone call before
the last election, like a, you know,

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,180
a year ago and they're like,
we want to ask you about like,

29
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,810
how involved would you say are you with
politics? And I'm like, very, actually,

30
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:47,430
I'm pretty passionate right now. Um, and
like, how informed would you say you,

31
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,220
I'm like, I'm at 10, very
informed and then like, okay.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,400
And they start asking me questions and
I did not know what the fuck they were

33
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,640
talking about. Like I hadn't heard of
any of these things. Any of these bills.

34
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,280
Like I have no idea.
I have no idea what's going on.

35
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:02,160
It's like the difference between a
casual sports fan and someone who really

36
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:06,750
understands all the drafts and all the
pics from different colleges and all with

37
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,630
this guy's got potential and this
guy needs to work on this defense.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,720
This is a 40 times. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. The
people who know that combine numbers, Yay.

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,950
Bench press two 24 47 times.

40
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,780
There's people that know that stuff
and like it's exhausting because it,

41
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,600
it's so involved.
Like do you have to,

42
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,330
if you really want to be paying attention
to everything that's going on with

43
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,190
Nancy Pelosi, you know, you gotta,

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,680
you gotta be paying attention
to that all day long.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,090
And most of the people that
do that, they're nuts. Like
you're, you're, it's just,

46
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,540
it's like sports, it's sports, but
in a different way. Like you're just,

47
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,890
this is the thing that you're wrapped
up in [inaudible] although it does shape

48
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:45,840
our world, you know? Yeah.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,390
As far as like right wing comics go
though does not a lot of like Nick Depaulo

50
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:54,150
is the king because he's
actually really fucking funny.

51
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,230
Like he's right wing as
like a person and you know,

52
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,570
he's conservative but he's
also a great stand up comedian.

53
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,200
But did he get more right?
Yes. As he got older. Yeah.

54
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,230
So it wasn't all wet because I remembered
the Apollo. He's one of my favorites.

55
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,220
Uh, you know, when I would see him on TV
as a kid and I know him a little bit now,

56
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,140
but uh, the, the,

57
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,980
the right things seem to come up more
and more in the past 10 years. Yeah.

58
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,660
He was always in, yeah. Angry guy,

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,560
but he became like an old angry guy that's
really into politics as he got older.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,450
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I
guess part of it is like,

61
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,090
it works for them. Like
it's, people love to hear it.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,500
Like there's not a lot of those guys,
like who does this right.

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,920
Have to bank on in terms of like
comics that they could go see good.

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,100
Tim Allen barely.
Does he do standup anymore?

65
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,300
I think he does like,

66
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,450
I think it goes up to the laugh
factory does he thinks yeah. Okay.

67
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,160
So maybe he's one of those guys are like,

68
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,230
when was the last time you want to say
six months ago? You know what I mean?

69
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh yeah. You know what I mean? I don't, I
don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but who else?

70
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,380
Okay, so you got Tim Allen
and Nick Depalo. There's
gotta be more. There must be,

71
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,250
I mean Norton kind of leans right
a little bit more libertarian,

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,640
but he doesn't do a lot of politic jokes.
He'll talk about it.

73
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,980
But when the fuck else is like no one,

74
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,940
but if you want to do like left wing
commander and so you can start with

75
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:24,780
Michelle Wolf and work your way up. Oh
yeah. This, there's millions of them.

76
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,410
Michelle Wolf wasn't even like left wing.
I think the correspondents' dinner,

77
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:31,890
everyone's like, this is a star making
turn. And I think it almost ruined her.

78
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,420
Really? Yes. Because her show,
Netflix was called the break.

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,280
Like it was called the break and was like,

80
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:41,940
we're going to take a break from all
of this and just talk about like other

81
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,670
things going on in the world.
We don't need to be focused on politics.

82
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,430
And after that,
after the correspondence dinner,

83
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:51,720
it was like the opening show was like her
going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders and

84
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:56,640
you're like, oh, you, you got forced into
this. You know, we're not a niche. Yeah.
