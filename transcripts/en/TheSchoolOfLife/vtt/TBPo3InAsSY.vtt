00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Serious people are used to thinking badly of celebrity culture.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.880
They hate how everyone wants to read about

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.640
where the latest big name has been on holiday, or who they're dating.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.700
They say it's silly and a sad reflection of modern civilization.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
Such stern attitudes may sound sensible and noble,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.580
but they are in truth deeply irresponsible.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.660
The impulse to admire and have heroes is an important part of human nature.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.780
Ignoring it or condemning it won't kill it off;

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.820
it simply forces it underground where it lurks undeveloped,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.940
prone to latch onto inappropriate targets.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.060
Human beings need role models.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.400
We therefore shouldn't try to eradicate celebrity culture--

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
we need to improve it:

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.920
bringing a better kind of person to the fore of public consciousness;

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.340
we need better celebrities, rather than no celebrities.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.600
Alexander Lukashenko is a rather evil dictator of Belarus,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.560
but this doesn't mean that he doesn't care, in a way, about making his country a better place.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.680
Recently, he's run a nationwide competition to find a raft of new celebrities.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920
Elena is very good at milking cows.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.920
On her best-ever day, she pumped over 1,100 liters from the herd into the tanks.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.940
And recently, her prowess has been recognized by the government of Belarus.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.620
She is being named officially, 'The Best Milkmaid' of the Slutsk region, which lies just south of the capital, Minsk.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.800
It's like winning a major talent competition on TV in the west.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.240
Elena traveled to the capital to pick up an award from the president himself.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680
She's been in all the papers. Sasha, too, has been on it.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.460
He held the 2015 title of 'Best Welder of the Republic'.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.760
All countries, of course, stage competitions.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.940
We regularly award prizes for excellence at long jump, or throwing darts at a board.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.560
These things are recreational, though,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.600
rather than focused on jobs or the ordinary activities of everyday life.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.300
In Belarus, the ambition is quite different.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.880
Elena and Sasha are national celebrities,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.800
the equivalent of hosts of TV chat shows, supermodels and tycoons in other countries.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.700
They are seen as embodying ideals, to which we should all aspire.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.320
Meanwhile, young couples are encouraged to revere the example set by two other prize winners:

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.900
Natalia and Conan, who've been awarded the prize for Belarus' 'Best Couple in Love'.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.440
The awards handed out in Belarus are not ashamed to stress the virtues of very ordinary people.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.400
The winners become famous, but don't look at all the way we've come to think that famous people should.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.860
Most people in the UK or Germany don't look sufficiently smart or fashionable

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.340
to be able to become famous in those countries.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.220
But Belarus has focused entirely on how good a person is at doing something basic and useful,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.220
like bringing up a family, working in a dairy, or helping make tractors.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.960
These are the country's only criteria of fame.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.100
It's very unfortunate if we associate these kinds of awards,

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.760
which bestow celebrity status for excellence in ordinary things,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960
with an Eastern-European dictator and his oppressive regime.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.820
In fact, the good idea behind these awards is universal.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.420
It belongs as much, in fact more so, in liberal states.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400
The core point is that a lot of things we should care about and need to take seriously

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.020
are not currently well-treated by the media machine that creates celebrity culture.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.240
But that's no reason to despair over the idea of celebrity.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.680
We should take more seriously the task of creating good celebrities--

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.640
good in the sense that one would be honoring people who demonstrate, with particular clarity,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.580
virtues that need to be more common in society.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.040
As part of this new venture to create better celebrities, one might, for example, set out prizes for:

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.620
the introvert who most successfully managed to communicate what he/she felt to their partner,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.720
the child who most generously forgave their parents,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.940
the worker who most intelligently diffused in fighting at the office,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.420
and, perhaps the biggest prize of all, the husband who best learned to control his temper and say sorry.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.380
We don't need to stop having celebrities-- we just need to put some slightly more helpful ones in front of our eyes.
