[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:08.300
MARTIN: Please join me in
welcoming Mitch to Google.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.136
MITCH DOBROWNER: Thanks.

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:10.635
Thanks.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.934
Thanks, Martin.

00:00:15.934 --> 00:00:18.100
And I still want to keep
this a secret just in case.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.140
I just don't like anybody to
know I actually take pictures.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.310
So anyway I wanted to talk a
little bit about photography,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.420
so at least my world
of photography.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.060
To me, the images that I
show were never really meant

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.620
to be like commercial images.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.880
Or they really were
for me just to document

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.530
my experience of how I
saw the world, pretty much

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.540
for my family, for my children,
kind of to leave something

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.440
behind.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.170
I don't expect to be
here another 50 years,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.920
probably not another
20 years even,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.545
but I wanted to leave
something behind.

00:01:01.772 --> 00:01:03.230
A little bit about
me, even though,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.730
I don't want to
talk a lot about me.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.777
It's more about the work.

00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:07.360
You know I came out
of the East coast.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.270
I grew up there.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.240
Pretty interesting
background, but had

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.060
nothing to do with
art or photography

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.130
or any of those aspects.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.380
And I was introduced probably
when I was about 18--

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.710
and probably getting
into a lot of trouble--

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.170
to the work of like Ansel
Adams and Minor White.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.250
And I had never seen anything
like that before in my life.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.900
So my father in his
kind of way would

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.720
try to get me kind
of grounded in life,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.020
slung me a little
rangefinder camera.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.150
And as soon as I
picked up the camera,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.400
I just felt like
I was electrified.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.790
And I started to take
off and take pictures.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.710
And being on the East
coast, for me at least,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.190
there wasn't a
lot to photograph.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.080
So looking at the
pictures of Ansel Adams

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.690
and starting to study his work,
I got into the wet dark room

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.949
and into film cameras, became
interested in technology.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:15.340
Didn't really want to be
overwhelmed by the technology.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.840
Or I wanted to know
enough about it,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.250
so I started to work in
sensitometry, which was pretty

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.600
much the manufacturing of film.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.500
So I ended up in a lab
with a bunch of scientists

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.180
with silver nitrate and
acetate and a paint brush

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.160
and a bunch of developer
and started to create film.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.050
And then read that stuff
with a densitometer

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.590
and pretty much
understand film, which

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.730
helped me not being intimidated
by the tools that I was using.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.620
So anyway I was also
introduced by somebody

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.060
called Pete Turner at the time.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.380
So I ended up working with
Pete as one of his assistants.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.190
And Pete Turner taught
me at that time just

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.400
to break all the
rules of photography,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.350
never to follow any rules
or anything that anybody

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.670
says unless it's positive.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.980
So he got me into
experimenting with film.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.370
So I would experiment
taking ektachrome type film

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.890
and developing in C-41
which was for development

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.780
in negative film and just
see what those things

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.350
were like, and infrared
photography, shooting tungsten

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.730
film in daylight.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.700
Just breaking every
rule which actually

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.880
led to a grant from Canon
Camera when I was about 20

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.340
that got me out of
New York, thank god,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.070
and into the West coast.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.170
So I started
traveling the country

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.990
and started to
see the landscapes

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.310
that Ansel Adams and Minor White
and Ed Weston had photographed.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.340
And it was a bit
overwhelming to me.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.630
Anyway did a show in
LA when I was about 21.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.100
Met my beautiful wife.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.360
Had a bunch of kids.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.080
Ran a business and gave up
photography for 20 years

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.329
pretty much to raise the
family and raise my children.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.610
And picked up a camera
again probably about 2006.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.470
And again, I was
overwhelmed by what

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.170
I started to see when I started
looking through the camera lens

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.770
again.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.050
A friend had took me
out to Death Valley.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.476
And I became totally involved
with photography again.

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:39.850
So my journey,
this journey, here

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.300
is roughly about 10
years worth of work.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.990
Some of the things about
photography for me are it's

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.020
really about light,
seeing light,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.020
being able to paint with light.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.020
A lot of the stuff in
landscape photography,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.200
at least for me is, we
live, at least for me,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.460
we live in somewhat of a world
that can be sometimes chaotic.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.670
There's a lot of
sensory overload.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.732
And when I go out to shoot
landscapes, first of all I

00:05:23.732 --> 00:05:24.690
see in black and white.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.040
I've always seen
in black and white.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.450
It's an artistic
expression for me

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.400
that allows me at least to
interpret how I see the world.

00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:39.240
But in the painting
of light, it's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:47.260
almost like it's allowing
all the chaos to take form.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.430
So even when I'm out shooting
landscape photography,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.190
there's so many
different compositions,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.390
so many things to shoot, it
allows me to kind of ground

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.470
myself to be able to have
everything that I'm thinking,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.510
everything that I'm seeing,
take a certain form.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.590
It's almost like
seeing in a dark--

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.811
walking into a dark room and
out from the bright sunshine.

00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:21.060
And a lot of times when I go--

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.060
most of times when I go
out to these landscapes,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.410
it takes a couple
of days for me just

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.821
to detach from life in Los
Angeles and everything else.

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.820
They're all good things.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.111
There's nothing bad about that.

00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:33.270
But just to get in the mode
of being a photographer

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.580
and seeing as a photographer.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.620
So usually for the
first couple of days,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.980
I don't really even shoot.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.090
I might scout.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.840
I might just try to get quiet,
try to get back into my body

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.630
again and see the world
in a much quieter place.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.750
A place that has a certain
form, a certain peace.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.500
It's almost like when I'm
standing outside everything--

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.810
I've said it before--
things just get quiet.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.690
Time seems to truncate.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.230
I can hear my heartbeat again,
which is a rare occasion.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.220
And a peace comes over to me
and I can see in a certain way

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.930
when I take pictures.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.717
So I've also, obviously
from some of the things

00:07:16.717 --> 00:07:19.050
you could say have been in
my past have influenced a lot

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.060
by things like science fiction.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.928
Some of the movies
when I was growing up

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:27.386
that were most
important to me were

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:28.802
like my favorite
movie of all time

00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:31.560
is "King Kong," like
the 1933 version of it

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.910
and "The Wizard of Oz."

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.930
Those are the things that
influenced me visually.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.520
So this is like 2006 going
out to Monument Valley.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.150
I became interested
in volcanoes.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.790
This happens to be
an ancient volcano.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.690
What happens with some
of these structures are--

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.300
if you can imagine, I don't
know how many years ago,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.420
10,000 years ago, that is
basically the lava core.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.890
It was covered with dirt.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.280
The dirt erodes
over the lava core,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.180
eventually starts to
erode the lava core.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.020
And I started to
become interested

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.860
in those type of structures.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.350
Most of the times
when I'd go out,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.710
I will go out for
weeks at a time.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.420
I would say photographing
the landscape

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.380
for me is kind of like
photographing a person.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.820
When I'm out there, I never
really take a snapshot.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.350
I know when I
first get out there

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.490
I'm wasting my time if
I'm just shooting away.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.640
I like to usually go out
alone, so it's really quiet.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.760
But I like to understand
the landscape a little bit,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.500
understand it like
if I was shooting

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.659
a portrait of a person.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.870
I wouldn't just not know you,
say hello, take a picture

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.500
and think I was a
great photographer.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.080
Maybe there are
great photographers

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.370
and Leigh Woods of the world.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.810
I don't even think
she does that.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.170
But I like to stay there for
a while just quietly looking

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.000
around, watching
the light, looking

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.740
at the different
compositions until I

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.960
can kind of
understand my subject

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.890
and understand
what the light is.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.600
I always love to go out
in inclement weather.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.300
That's when I see light
being the most interesting

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.780
to me, also low
contrast situations.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.810
Though as a photographer,
it's really interesting

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.940
to shoot in all different
types of situations.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.150
It kind of allows you to
expand your abilities just

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.430
to say this is what
it's giving me.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.540
How can I create an image?

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.890
What am I feeling?

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.930
If I don't get
into that feeling I

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.529
know I'm kind of
wasting my time.

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.070
It's almost like getting into
a zone like a basketball player

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.930
or something when
they get into a zone.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.604
I have to take the time
to get into a certain zone

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:46.770
to be able to take pictures.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.180
There's also things--
this is an interesting one

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.560
because this is Shiprock.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.400
It's also a spiritual
center of the Navajos.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.900
So going out to Farmington, I
went out there with my family,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.370
with my wife and my son.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.470
We were out there,
I think for 10 days.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.550
And there was something
kind of special about this,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.910
something special to be--

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.650
I've spent a lot of
time in southern Utah

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.010
and so forth with
the American Indians

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.050
and especially
with the Navajos--

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.410
and there was something
extremely special

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.989
about this rock.

00:10:25.989 --> 00:10:27.530
And I actually had
seen this picture.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.630
A lot of times
before I go out, I'll

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.840
do research and/or I'll see a
picture in my head of exactly

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.390
what I wanted to photograph.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.780
And in this case, when I saw
the initial pictures of Shiprock

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.000
in my head, I always
saw a rock in motion,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.230
that it wasn't just a rock.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.680
But it was in a live rock.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.890
But what happened is I was out
there, I think for 10 days,

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.310
and never got a picture
that I really liked.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.290
I never got like into that zone.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.600
And I was a little frustrated.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.910
And I think it was the
eighth day, it was cold out.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.460
It was probably 10 degrees out.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.880
I got up at 4:00 in the morning.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.310
It was about 50 mile ride from
Farmington out to Shiprock.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.120
Rock

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.084
And as I got up, I was
like you're an idiot.

00:11:15.084 --> 00:11:16.250
What are you getting up for?

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.625
You stay in bed
with your family.

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:18.290
You'll be cozy.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.500
You're not get any pictures.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.310
Everything's running through
my brain, like what an idiot.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.000
You know?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.465
So I got into my truck.

00:11:24.465 --> 00:11:26.600
And I'm driving out there
with a cup of coffee.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.558
And the whole time it's
like it's getting dark,

00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:30.950
it's like nothing,
what am I doing?

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.840
Wasting my time again.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.920
And I got out there.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.610
And I had scouted this location.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.780
When I got out there,
there was the cloud cover

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.130
had dropped below Shiprock.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.170
And you could not see Shiprock.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.470
And I stood out there, I think
for about six hours, just

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.550
waiting.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.850
And it was a real spiritual
experience for me.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.760
This is a real special picture
for me, because this is both--

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.280
this is the picture
I had seen in my head

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.410
when I was out there.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.910
Besides that, what
it represented to

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.010
me is just tenacity.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.490
That, at least for me,
that if you kind of believe

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.450
in your abilities, you're
tenacious about stuff,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:13.340
and you just don't give up,
you will get what you want.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.440
You don't always, you know?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.850
But this represented
a lot to me.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.860
This is a foundational
picture for me.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.340
This is another kind of
foundational picture for me.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.620
This is the Maze.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.150
This is the border of the
Maze and the Needles District

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.550
in Canyonlands.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.660
The Maze is probably the
area of the United States

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.250
which is probably one of the
hardest areas to get into.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:44.150
So I'm lucky enough to
be a National Geographic

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.906
photographer.

00:12:44.906 --> 00:12:46.280
I have no idea
how that happened.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.670
But they contacted me
and published my work

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.710
and put me up on their sites.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.430
So I hired an outfitting
group out of Moab.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.960
And we took 10
days into the Maze.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.890
And this is like the kind of
area where if you travel--

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.840
and not exaggerating--
like 10 miles

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.942
will take you probably 12 hours.

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:05.900
There's no roads there.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.330
You're rock climbing
the whole way.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.750
And again I'm out there for
10-- this is the 10th day.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.340
And I was a wreck.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.830
I mean I had not taken a
bath or shower or anything,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.280
cleaned up in 10 days.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.370
My hair was like dreadlocks.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.660
I just wanted to go home.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.160
I was exhausted.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.539
And the guy I was with was like,
hey, one more time, you know.

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:27.080
Let's go out.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.920
I have this one place.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.253
We have to get out there like
3:00, 4:00 in the morning.

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:34.250
We have to climb this 1,000
foot mesa in the dark.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.800
And I got this one shot
I want to show you.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.040
Nobody really knows about it.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.660
And I'm like, no, I
don't want to do this.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.770
But I say god damn it--
excuse my language--

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.590
but god damn it, let's do it.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.620
So I went up there and
this was the shot I got.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.620
Which for me was kind
of a culmination of what

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.550
I had seen for the Needles
District in Canyonlands.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.242
I had been there
a couple of times.

00:13:57.242 --> 00:13:58.700
But I had never
got the one picture

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.060
that represented that for me.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.710
Another area, White Pocket.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.620
I took five days out
into White Pocket.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.020
Have no idea how
this was formed.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.040
But obviously it was
under water at some time.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.127
There's actually dinosaur
tracks out a White Pocket.

00:14:18.127 --> 00:14:20.210
In the background it's
something called Brain Rock

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.160
which actually looks like Brain
Rock, a really interesting

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.010
area.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.593
But what I'm trying
to do here is just

00:14:24.593 --> 00:14:26.720
take portraits of the things
that I'm experiencing,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.860
the places that I go.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.321
This is Superstition
Mountain in Arizona.

00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:35.820
We were out there for-- this
one was like four or five days.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.819
I waited four or five
days for that little cloud

00:14:37.819 --> 00:14:40.130
to go overhead because it
was just bright sunlight.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.400
But it took five days to
wait in that certain area

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.094
just to get that picture.

00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:46.885
But again, this is
another ancient volcano.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.390
This is Capitol Reef.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.720
Me and my son went out there.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.360
This is standing on a 2,000 foot
mesa overlooking the valley.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.250
Anyway, something I shot
a couple of weeks ago.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.750
It's actually a
reshoot or something

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.430
I was at out in Lone Pine.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.930
But to me, these images
speak something to me.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:17.590
Each one to me is
like a little child.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.190
And I think even
there was a quote

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.902
that I read from I think
it was Renoir who--

00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:26.985
I'm just going to read it
because I wrote it down.

00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:30.040
And it says, "At the
start of seeing a subject,

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.960
you're always in
a sort of a haze.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.980
But you know perfectly that
what you should see later

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.010
has been there all the time."

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.740
And the same thing
for Monument Valley.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.031
Monument Valley's always been--

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:46.899
it's been photographed
so many times.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:48.440
But I had always
see the picture that

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.356
was a little bit different
of Monument Valley.

00:15:50.356 --> 00:15:53.487
So again I went up there
with a Navajo guide.

00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:54.820
And we took four days out there.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.210
And I learned a lot about the
Navajo culture at the time.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:02.110
And really wanted to take a
portrait of Monument Valley

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.900
that represented
not so much to me

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.507
what the valley was
about, but to the Navajos

00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:08.590
what the valley was about.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.470
What it might have looked
like when they first

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.250
took a look at it.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.460
Also a shot of Monument Valley.

00:16:23.797 --> 00:16:25.380
So I'm just going
to go through these.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.710
All these pictures
basically to me

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.760
speak a special
moment to me in time.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.540
Landscapes are really
interesting for me to shoot.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.960
Actually we'll get to some of
the storm images, which people

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.550
seem to be interested in.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.380
I actually take
it, as an artist--

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.180
that I don't even know if I'm
an artist, but if I am one--

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.810
that the images are
really just shot for me.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.730
I feel really lucky that people
actually just like the images.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.350
One thing about these
images, though--

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.974
and you can see that
out in the lobby--

00:17:03.974 --> 00:17:07.630
is that I'll talk a little
bit about the technologies

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.450
in a moment.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.170
But that for me
these are just JPEGs.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.130
These are proxies of
the final final images.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.010
But the print is really
what my final image

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.829
is, the final vision
for my work is.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.300
So everything I'm
doing, every way

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.839
I'm shooting, everything
about the capture

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.870
and is about what I'm
going to do for a print.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:33.070
So if you do have time, you
can go out later into the lobby

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.170
and take a look at
some of the prints.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.760
This was a reflection of me.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.070
This is Agathla Peak,
which is the center,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.940
the graphical center
of the Navajo Nation.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.690
But what this represented
to me when I saw

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.520
it was "The Wizard of Oz."

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.530
This is like the
Wicked Witch's castle.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.140
You know?

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.839
And I always kind of see those
things when I'm photographing.

00:17:58.205 --> 00:17:59.080
This another picture.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.100
This is the Doll House.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.820
This is out in the
Needles District again.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.450
But to me this is
almost something

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.080
like out of "The Wizard of Oz."

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.310
Some of these places
are extremely remote.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.450
This is the Maze.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.990
The kind of place where
it's really fun to be in,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.550
but you also get--

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.231
I think there's some kind of--

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.660
I don't know what
people call it.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.240
When you're in a
super remote location,

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.802
and there's like nobody
around like 20 miles around

00:18:33.802 --> 00:18:35.510
except maybe the person
that you're with.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.570
And things start to really
get close and truncated

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.860
and you feel like if you're
going to break an ankle,

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.690
you're just going
to die out there.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.270
So a lot of these
locations were like that.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.182
This is Trona.

00:18:51.182 --> 00:18:52.640
I don't know if
anybody knows where

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.082
Trona is, the Trona Pinnacles.

00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:55.790
It's a really outrageous
beautiful place.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.100
It's where I love to
practice photography.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.150
Actually this is
an area that Apollo

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.260
used to practice their moonwalks
before they went to the moon.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.612
So most one of the areas
in California that's most

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:07.820
like the surface of the moon.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.750
But I was lucky enough to be out
there in like-- at that point--

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.120
50 mile an hour winds and
catch a lenticular cloud

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.800
on top of the Pinnacles.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.310
Another shot of Trona
at a different time.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.640
This is driving through
a dry lake bed with water

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.060
up to the middle to
the top of my wheels

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.810
in my four-wheel
drive truck just

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.880
to get up to the Pinnacles.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.870
This is almost an omen to
one of the Ansel Adam shots,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.830
the Hernandez shot.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.080
And just in full
landscape photography.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.390
Every one from me has a story.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.130
This is Goblin Valley.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.680
But at this point, I was covered
with gnats from head to toe.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.790
Everything that was
not covered was bit.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.640
You know?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.489
And I was covered.

00:19:54.489 --> 00:19:55.030
I had gloves.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.738
I had everything.

00:19:55.738 --> 00:19:57.260
My ears were just red.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.235
But I was like I am going to
get the picture that I want.

00:20:00.235 --> 00:20:02.860
I had to wait there covered with
gnats for a little while, just

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.930
to get that picture.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.680
I had to wait for the
light to be right.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.780
Mexican Hat.

00:20:13.364 --> 00:20:14.780
Meanwhile I've
camped out in Trona

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.655
at this time I have
no idea what that was.

00:20:16.655 --> 00:20:19.610
I've heard it was just
a rare occurrence.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.550
This is the light, the sun
was actually rising behind me.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.042
Maybe it was the
dust in the air.

00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:27.500
But it was really interesting
for National Geographic where

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.134
they publish all my work, which
was actually the storm work.

00:20:30.134 --> 00:20:31.550
When they took a
look at the work,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.657
a lot of people when I get
into fine art photography,

00:20:34.657 --> 00:20:36.740
thought that a lot of this
was manipulated images.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.850
And they're actually not.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.600
National Geographic
had taken, at the time,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.827
some of my raw files
and my 16-bit tiffs

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.910
and taken them to their
lab just to make sure they

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.910
weren't even graded too much.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.310
And I'll talk a little
bit about the technology.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.800
This one is a meteor
about to hit the Earth.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.770
When it happens, that picture.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.420
This is actually
a piece of rock,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.610
a piece of ice in Iceland.

00:21:02.224 --> 00:21:03.890
Some people have
looked at that and said

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.990
they could not get a grasp
of exactly what that was.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.950
Iceland is cold.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:14.280
And I was out there in March.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.100
But it was beautiful.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.130
Another shot of Iceland.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.450
And this is a time where--

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.040
I don't mean to be
overly dramatic with it,

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.480
but it was so cold out there
that anything that was exposed

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.087
froze.

00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:33.420
You don't usually get those
kind of clouds on a mountain

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.420
scape unless you're
standing in the wind.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.737
And the ocean is
to your right here.

00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:39.570
And the winds were just
coming off the ocean

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.640
with nothing blocking them.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.550
And my hardest problem
was breathing into a mask

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.370
and having my glasses
just turn to ice.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.480
So I had to figure out
how to photograph that.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.130
One of my lucky
snapshots of this lake.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.450
This one was interesting.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.040
This is Joshua Tree.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.950
This one represented like a
rock family to me, you know?

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.730
This is like the dad's in
the middle with the eye.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.920
The uncle's over
there on the left.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.300
The aunt's on the right.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.154
And the punk kid
with the spiky hair

00:22:11.154 --> 00:22:12.570
is kind of standing
in the middle.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.300
And it's just standing there
in a portrait, you know,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.845
a proud portrait.

00:22:17.845 --> 00:22:19.970
And also just something
that was real simple to me.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.310
It was just like the basic use
of light and shadow and tone.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.730
It was just a very
simple photograph to me.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.320
But I really like
this photograph

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.130
because of its simplicity.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.990
It's just forms and light.

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:38.762
I'll get into another story.

00:22:38.762 --> 00:22:40.470
These stories are just
interesting to me.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.997
This is me my son
going off to Escalante.

00:22:42.997 --> 00:22:43.830
He'll remember that.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.640
He's here.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.990
And we spent like a week
out there in December.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.110
Came through, nothing.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.950
I had no pictures.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:51.870
I froze.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.800
We were going through the snow.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.300
No.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.980
I've got some good pictures but
nothing that I really liked.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.420
And as we were driving home, we
went through the Virgin River

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.520
Gorge and through a snowstorm.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.340
And as we came
out the other end,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.760
we like had to take a break.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.920
We had to actually
use the bathroom.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.574
So we just got out.

00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:15.240
We said before we hit Las Vegas,
let's just take one last break.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.000
And we'll just bolt home.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.040
And I took my camera with me.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.540
My son, we went off hiking
in different directions.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.690
And I heard my son just
say, dad, dad, come here.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.230
You know?

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.380
I came over the ridge.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.720
And this was the picture.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.630
So I was out there for a week,
maybe a little bit longer

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.130
than a week.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.497
Got nothing that I liked.

00:23:33.497 --> 00:23:35.580
And this is I think one
of the last three pictures

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.120
I shot off the trip.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.870
Which again to me showed
that you just never know.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.210
You never know.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.670
If you just stay
tenacious and still

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.437
believe that you could actually
accomplish those things.

00:23:49.437 --> 00:23:51.770
Then I got into storm chasing,
because I always went out

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.997
into inclement weather.

00:23:53.997 --> 00:23:56.330
And I thought that it would
be really interesting to see

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.180
what Tornado Alley was like.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.260
So this is a picture
that came later in my--

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.060
I'm not a storm chaser
and a photographer.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.480
I go out with a friend
who's a storm chaser.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.130
He's brilliant.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.140
His name's Roger Hill.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.100
And this is like I always
saw in the series of pictures

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:22.520
that I was taking that I needed
an iconic tornado picture.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.642
And this was kind of
like a reflection to me,

00:24:24.642 --> 00:24:25.850
again, of "The Wizard of Oz."

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.000
In fact, I worked
at Sony for a while,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.580
Sam Raimi had done a
remake of "Wizard of Oz."

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.070
And the visual effects
supervisor had said, hey,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.580
we heard--

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.329
we were in a room.

00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:38.210
We're looking at all this--

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.400
you know we're doing some
research on like tornadoes

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.771
for the sequence.

00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:42.770
And we saw this picture.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.830
And then somebody in
the room said, hey,

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.380
you know that guy works here?

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.510
You know.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.970
So anyway so I had to
make a big print for them.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.330
And they used this for
some of their research

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.810
on the tornado sequence.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.965
But anyway, this is a really
easy picture to shoot.

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:00.965
We were like a mile and
a half from the tornado.

00:25:00.965 --> 00:25:02.930
It was moving east to west.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.220
It was quiet.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.235
And I could take my
time and compose.

00:25:06.235 --> 00:25:07.610
And again this is
another picture

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.068
that I actually
had seen in my mind

00:25:09.068 --> 00:25:12.450
before I had gone out there.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.230
This is last year.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.530
So a little bit about storm
chasing or about photographing

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.310
the storm systems.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.100
I had never seen anything
like this in my life.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.320
These are real pictures.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.927
These are like real situations.

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:31.010
But coming from the East
coast and going out there

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.300
and seeing this--

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.420
they're just awe inspiring.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.360
There's no way to actually--

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.190
these pictures don't
even do justice

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.960
to what these storm
systems really are.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.740
A lot of the challenge for me
initially for storm systems,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.240
I was set up as a
landscape photographer.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.740
And a lot of the
equipment was using

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.420
was not ready for
landscape photography.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.940
So I had to adapt the first
couple of years, the way

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.650
that I was shooting.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.940
But compositions are
constantly changing.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.350
Light's constantly changing.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.980
There's chaos going off
around all around you.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.190
You have to focus.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.960
The only thing that I listen
to when I'm out photographing

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.460
storms now was
Roger's voice saying

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.920
like we have to get the hell
out of here like right now.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.917
You know?

00:26:19.917 --> 00:26:21.500
And that's the only
thing I listen to.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.690
Because everything else I
just have to really focus

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.610
and get again into that
zone for photography.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.875
It's really helped me
improve as a photographer.

00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:32.750
And the one thing I can
say about photography

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:36.350
for me is I really do think
that my best images are still

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.400
to come.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.290
There was a semi-famous
photographer--

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.890
or at least he
thinks he's famous--

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.500
who I actually met at one
point when I first started.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.370
And he was he was talking
to me and telling me

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:53.990
about how his images look
the same from 1979 into--

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.930
I think at the time
it was like 2007.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.300
How all the transitions
are the same,

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.960
how the pictures look the same,
the compositions look the same.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.960
And I kind of looked at him and
I said, well, have you changed?

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.990
I mean how could your
photographies be the same?

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.235
Have you grown in 25, 30 years?

00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:10.610
And I looked over
at his wife who

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.026
actually kicked
me under the table

00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:13.520
and smiled at me
when I said that.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.790
Because I did not understand
like how as a photographer

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.640
your images either
can't get better or how

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.705
as you grow as a
person, as you mature,

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:24.830
that the visions that you
have and your experiences

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.450
should be reflected
in your work.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.540
This was kind of interesting.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.640
I don't think Lorraine
was with me on this one.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.440
I think ABC News is
with us in this one.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.856
And they thought
it was really fun

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:39.914
to be out there chasing storms.

00:27:39.914 --> 00:27:41.330
And they got out
there and they're

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.704
playing around
with their cameras

00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:44.130
and stuff out in the field.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.520
And this thing turned the
corner and came at us.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.500
And they got
destroyed, the cameras.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.640
This was a huge hailstorm.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.710
It actually did a lot
of damage in Moorcroft.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.320
This is Wyoming.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.856
The interesting picture about
that had happened to me,

00:27:55.856 --> 00:27:57.230
though, is that
that little house

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.780
on the bottom right,
somehow my work

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.840
got into published by
the Audubon Society.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.030
And the "Audubon" magazine
made it to the beauty parlor

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:12.050
in Moorcroft,
population of maybe 200.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.450
And actually the grandson--

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.610
that somehow the
grandson saw that picture

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:17.930
and actually emailed
me and said, you know,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.596
how did you get there
during that storm?

00:28:19.596 --> 00:28:22.940
Can I have some pictures for
my grandma whose house that is?

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.410
And again, it showed me what
a small world we live in.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.700
That this was a
pretty amazing storm.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:33.610
This was the first trip out.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.526
And when I turned to
Roger, I was like, Roger,

00:28:35.526 --> 00:28:37.197
are we going to die?

00:28:37.197 --> 00:28:38.780
And he was like,
don't worry about it.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.430
We'll be fine.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.850
This thing is
actually dissipating

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.480
as it's coming down.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.261
But these images all mean
something special to me.

00:28:48.261 --> 00:28:48.760
You know?

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.490
Me and my wife and my son went
out to Los Alamos one year.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.430
And that summer I went out
and shot the monsoons out

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.274
in Arizona and came
back with this.

00:29:00.274 --> 00:29:01.690
And it was just
that visualization

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.670
of like an experience
that I had in my life

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.402
of seeing kind of the
amazing stuff that actually,

00:29:07.402 --> 00:29:08.860
the history of Los
Alamos that went

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.440
on with the nuclear weapons and
all that interesting history

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.987
that I really didn't
know much about.

00:29:12.987 --> 00:29:15.070
My wife was mad at because
she was trying to paint

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.280
atomic explosions at the time.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.400
So I came back with this.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.400
But I had never experienced
the monsoons before.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.690
Mammatus clouds.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.670
The aftereffect of a
pretty violent storm.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.680
This was a ghost.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.552
This is in the dark.

00:29:36.552 --> 00:29:37.260
I saw this thing.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.960
This is like the monster in
the closet type thing for me

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.060
where the storm is
out in the field.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.060
I could see it every time
the lightning flashed.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.899
So I just had to do the
best to focus and compose.

00:29:47.899 --> 00:29:50.190
Some of the really interesting
things about photography

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.040
is you can get out to
some of these locations

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.625
and you can just blow it.

00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:56.250
You can blow your
exposure, your focus.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.764
You have like one
shot at this stuff.

00:29:58.764 --> 00:29:59.430
This was a rare.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.720
This is a landspout.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.100
This thing was gigantic.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.390
I think this was about--

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.640
they were saying this is
about 2,000 to 3,000 feet up.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.410
It's like if you
look at the bottom,

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.000
you can see some light poles.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.021
I mean some electric
poles on the bottom there

00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:12.145
that give this thing scale.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.970
So I'm just trying to
show with these images

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.950
my experience of being
out there seeing some

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.170
of these amazing phenomenons.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:23.564
This storm to me--

00:30:23.564 --> 00:30:25.980
this looks like "War of the
Worlds" to me for some reason.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.320
But the experience
to me of these storms

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.780
is that what's really
interesting is when

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.640
you see these storms
and they're created,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.920
they have to be created when
the environment's right.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.900
Humidity, the airflow,
all these things

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.690
have to take place
at the right time.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.520
It's almost like the
birth of a person.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:47.460
And when all these
elements come together,

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.530
eventually they start to form.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.680
And they get
unpredictable, initially.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.209
And sometimes
they'll die quickly.

00:30:54.209 --> 00:30:55.500
And sometimes they'll take off.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.780
And sometimes they'll
get super violent.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:02.610
And then essentially they
start to take a form.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:06.000
They start to form into
something that has structure.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.520
And eventually they will
start to lose that form.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.610
And they age out
and they just die.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.360
So as I'm photographing
these storms,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.717
they're actually like
living beings things to me.

00:31:15.717 --> 00:31:17.175
And I'm just trying
to capture, I'm

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:20.970
just trying to do justice
to each one of these storms.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:25.380
Because they'll never be again.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.765
Like these structures, these
storms, these pictures,

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:30.540
I don't have to worry
about another photographer

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:31.441
copying these images.

00:31:31.441 --> 00:31:32.940
They can shoot
storms all they want.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.800
But these storms are once
in a lifetime type events.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.070
And they're just phenomenal.

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.320
So all I'm trying to do here
is to do justice to this.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.445
I love the play of light and
dark and things like this.

00:31:48.445 --> 00:31:51.090
This was a pretty
amazing lightning storm.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.992
Lots of people use
different techniques

00:31:59.992 --> 00:32:00.950
for shooting lightning.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.283
I don't use a lightning trigger.

00:32:02.283 --> 00:32:05.570
I just use long
exposures and luck.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.130
It's the luck of the draw.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.660
But I feel like I need to.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.330
That's the way that
I want to shoot.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.310
I want it to be as
natural as I possibly

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.265
can be with these photographs.

00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:19.870
And I'll talk a little
bit about light.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.260
This is the second time I
ever did sort of a storm.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.270
This was in Nebraska.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.830
And this thing was
probably, maybe

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:32.020
according to some people, the
most violent storm of the year.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.130
Why it's so white
on the bottom is

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.270
there was a long exposure and
multiple lightning strikes.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.070
It's a mesocyclone basically.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.530
So now I'll talk a little
bit about the technology

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.900
and the printing and how--

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.460
before I run out of time--

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.230
how I get to this.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.410
Pretty much going
back to Pete Turner

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:57.530
and breaking all the rules, when
you shot black and white film

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.215
in the day, you used to
load black and white film.

00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:02.780
Shot color film,
you use color film.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.620
Today with digital technology,
digital cameras, most--

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.990
today at least-- digital
cameras in black and white

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.610
are extremely expensive.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.780
But the sensors, the
black and white sensors,

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.320
they're naturally
black and white.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.180
What happens is for the
camera manufacturers

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.800
to build these cameras, they
need to emulate how we see.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.320
So we see, as far as
light waves are concerned,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.510
about between 400 and
700 nanometers of light.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.180
That's how we see.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.994
So when you see there's a
sensor on top of the sensor

00:33:36.994 --> 00:33:37.910
go to a Bayer pattern.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.270
And the Bayer pattern
goes over each pixel.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:46.320
It's filters basically-- two
green, one red, one blue.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.040
That's because our eyes see
more green than red than blue.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.770
So they try to emulate
the way that our eyes see.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.240
They also truncate light.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.540
So the sensors can see-- even
though we see from 400 to 700

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.860
nanometers of light--

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.010
sensors can see between
roughly 300 nanometers

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.806
to about 1,100
nanometers of light.

00:34:03.806 --> 00:34:05.180
So I don't believe
in that stuff.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.790
So I can't take the
Bayer patterns off,

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.750
even though I've tried.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.502
There's a gentleman
out in New Jersey.

00:34:10.502 --> 00:34:11.960
And we've blown up
a lot of sensors

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.710
doing this trying to take
the Bayer patterns off.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.020
But I do take off
anti-aliasing filters,

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.982
which are only made
so there's no more

00:34:20.982 --> 00:34:22.190
array when you take pictures.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.080
I've done this for 10 years now.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.387
It's a big, big deal.

00:34:25.387 --> 00:34:27.220
They think that camera's
sell for more money

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.040
when they take those off.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.099
I also take off the
IR blocking filters.

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:32.929
And in black and
white that allows

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:37.310
me to see in the infrared,
ultraviolet, things

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:41.280
that you can't see
with your natural eye.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.880
It also allows me then to--

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.409
the way that I filter is
based on the environment

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.380
and what I'm looking at.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.960
It allows me to use my
camera as a paintbrush now.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.570
Now I can filter
based on what I'm

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.150
shooting, what the
light looks like, what

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.810
the environment looks like.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.450
It just allows me to use
my camera as a brush.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.580
I'm not somebody who
shines his cameras up.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.010
I usually throw my camera out.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.340
I trash my cameras.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.040
My lenses are more
important than my cameras.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.150
But my cameras are
basically a brush.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.040
If I was a painter, it
would be my paintbrush.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.390
So I filter, basically,
with screw on lenses,

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.190
screw on filters on the
lenses, how I would want to.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.764
I actually had worked with Sony.

00:35:26.764 --> 00:35:28.805
Somehow I won-- it's
another story-- photographer

00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:30.110
of the year for Sony.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.707
And they made a
big deal out of it.

00:35:31.707 --> 00:35:33.290
And one of the first
cameras they shot

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:39.307
was an R1, which was
a mirrorless camera.

00:35:39.307 --> 00:35:41.390
And it made sense for Sony
because Sony had always

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:46.020
invented video cameras which
never had mirrors on it.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.930
So when I was talking
to Sony at the time,

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:51.150
it was like they
discontinued the camera

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.660
and I wasn't happy about
that, because I always

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.260
felt like having a mirror
box in and a camera

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.630
was kind of old school thinking.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.960
So light's coming
through the lens.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.501
It's bouncing over
a bunch of mirrors

00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:02.955
and going through
the viewfinder.

00:36:02.955 --> 00:36:05.330
But you can never see what
you're actually shooting with,

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.800
what you're actually shooting.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.420
It was great for
sports photography,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.910
because it allows
you to focus quickly.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.400
But for landscape
photography, I use the LCD.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.260
So I use the live
view on the cameras.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:19.150
So now when I filter with
like things like an IR lens,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.282
IR filter, which is the opaque.

00:36:21.282 --> 00:36:23.740
So when you shot with that in
film, you have to look at it.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.710
You screw on the filter.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.585
And you could not see
what you were shooting.

00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:29.050
But now I can actually see
what the sensor's seeing.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.960
I can see the direct
feed off the sensor.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.340
So anyway that is
like one of the ways

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.700
that I've adapted my
shooting, my cameras.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.500
Also there's a lot of
techniques as far as printing.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.607
Again everything's important.

00:36:47.607 --> 00:36:49.190
As far as the print's
concerned, there

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.960
is a lot of literature
on the right way

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.960
to shoot with the sensor.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.120
If you think of a sensor, you
usually see things like noise

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.780
in the shadows, that's because
that part of the sensor

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.090
pretty much inputs
the least amount,

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:05.880
the highlights are what has
the most amount of data.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.250
If you shoot with your
histogram to the right,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.670
you're moving your shadows
into a more sweet spot

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.454
on the sensor.

00:37:12.454 --> 00:37:13.870
And you're getting
a cleaner image

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.600
basically when you do a print.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:21.810
So I think all these things,
when it comes down to a print,

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.080
makes a big difference.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.282
Also with printing, the more
that you manipulate an image,

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:32.490
the more data you throw away.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.610
When you're in something like
Photoshop, which is my editor,

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.110
every time you
turning the slider,

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.340
you're throwing data away.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.781
So if you took like a 8 bit JPEG
and you kind of move sliders

00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:45.030
around in Photoshop and took
a look at your histogram,

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.155
it looks like a tooth comb.

00:37:46.155 --> 00:37:48.280
That's because you've
thrown away all that data.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.685
So now I'm working
with raw files--

00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:56.850
and I think Ansel Adams
always said that pretty much

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:01.890
the original capture for
him, the film negative, kind

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.334
of represented, the
beginning of the journey.

00:38:06.334 --> 00:38:08.250
But the symphony, the
way it was orchestrated,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.592
was really the way
the print was made.

00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:12.050
PAUL: The score of
the performance.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.470
MITCH DOBROWNER: The
score of the performance.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.136
Thank you, Paul.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:21.960
So really I'm going towards
the performance with this.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.870
But I do need to have the
foundation of the data

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.380
structure to be correct.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.660
This is a little
diffused because I was

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.610
standing in the pouring rain.

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.290
But it was quite a sight.

00:38:42.205 --> 00:38:46.650
Thin printing is a
whole different level.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.600
I've probably spent
tens of thousands

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.960
of dollars throwing away
papers and inks and printers

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.280
and experimenting.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.855
People think that
digital printing--

00:38:54.855 --> 00:38:56.250
I came from the wet darkroom.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.150
So I came from originally
the cold light.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.960
I shot with four
by fives and eight

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.280
by tens cold light
printing, sensitometry.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.430
When I moved into the
digital dark room,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.810
it was completely different.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.480
But it was just as complex.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.470
So to come out with a
digital museum quality print

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.690
was just as challenging
as doing silver printing.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:28.270
Over time, it's taken time to
be able to do all my own prints.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.337
But it's taken time
and energy to be

00:39:31.337 --> 00:39:33.420
able to kind of perfect
the printing process, just

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.800
like a printer of silver prints.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.680
This is interesting.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.930
This was this was a triptych.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:50.390
A different story with my
youngest son which was like--

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.140
this is going back to
family a little bit.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.000
But I asked my son
to come out with me

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.860
storm chasing,
because I wanted him

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.510
to have an experience
with his dad

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.980
that he'd remember for
the rest of his life.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.770
So I wanted to have
a picture of him

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.810
standing in front of a tornado.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:07.380
And he was like,
yeah, dad, right.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.120
Anyway, I don't have
the picture here.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:15.180
But we were standing
in Nebraska and had

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.290
experienced twin tornadoes,
Pilger, Nebraska.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.060
And actually my
son took a selfie

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.146
of himself standing in
front of those tornadoes.

00:40:23.146 --> 00:40:24.520
And he swears he
didn't say, dad,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.644
can we get out of here now?

00:40:25.644 --> 00:40:27.300
But I remember him
saying that to me.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.710
I thought you were kidding.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.750
But this was a triptych.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.440
This is actually hanging in the
National Weather Center now.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.550
They have purchased this.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.766
It's something that they thought
was both scientific to them,

00:40:40.766 --> 00:40:42.390
they had never seen
something like this

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.264
like in stills at that quality,
and also somewhat artistic,

00:40:46.264 --> 00:40:47.430
if you want to call it that.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.167
Just scale.

00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:55.500
This was just a beautiful scene.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.666
Everybody was shooting in
this direction I was with.

00:40:57.666 --> 00:40:59.067
And I looked in that direction.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.760
I'm going to go a
little bit faster here.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.510
That's that same tornado
that the triptych

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.710
was in a different moment.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.410
Then Los Angeles.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.830
I don't want to
run too far over.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.934
But I think Los
Angeles is beautiful.

00:41:22.934 --> 00:41:24.600
I know a lot of people
don't think that.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.460
I wouldn't live here
if I didn't think that.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.960
So I came from the East coast.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.112
When I came over the 405 and
I saw the San Fernando Valley,

00:41:31.112 --> 00:41:32.820
I thought it looked
like Yosemite Valley.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.528
I thought it was the
most beautiful thing

00:41:34.528 --> 00:41:36.400
I had ever seen in my life.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.200
I know where I was.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.180
I pulled off the freeway
at Roscoe Boulevard.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:39.830
I made a right.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.000
I saw a place for rent.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.822
And I moved in there.

00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:44.280
I didn't know where
the hell I was.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.630
I had no idea where I was.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.849
But I had to go back like--

00:41:47.849 --> 00:41:49.890
I don't know how many
years later, 30 years later

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.960
maybe, 25 years
later-- and capture

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.000
that shot of what I felt like
when I first saw Los Angeles.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.792
So people like Paul
were really mad at me.

00:41:58.792 --> 00:42:00.750
Paul represents me in
Los Angeles at a gallery,

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.333
because I didn't
know what I was doing

00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:05.310
when I started in photography
and like fine art photography.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.850
The one thing I can
say is that I've always

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.670
concentrated on the pictures.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.090
I don't want to be famous.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:13.650
I don't fame.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.300
I don't care about all
that stuff, that ego, I

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.710
have to drop all that stuff.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.619
I just concentrate
on the pictures.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.160
But everything that
came to me that I

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.220
realized in my photography
actually came to me.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.689
Like Paul called me.

00:42:24.689 --> 00:42:25.230
I don't know.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.450
I never called
you, I don't think.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.740
I have a book by Aperture,
two by 21st Editions.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.730
I think I have a show
in Dubai right now.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.410
Everything came to me.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:41.940
And the thing that to exhort
anybody about that with

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.730
is I just focused
on the pictures.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.230
I just wanted to
take good pictures.

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.140
It was my art.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.390
It was really important to me.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.550
It was spiritual to me.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.890
It was like everything
that I'm about is

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:55.650
reflected in these pictures.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.050
People talk a talk.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.860
And people are really nice.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.360
I love people.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.780
But it's not about that.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.100
It's about this kind of
work, it reflects me.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.640
And the other photographers
that are out there in the world,

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.470
those pictures reflect them.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.900
And the pictures that you
would take reflect you.

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.550
And I think that it's
important to be able to drop--

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:21.510
for me it was important to
drop a lot of what was worldly

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.340
about the world
when I take pictures

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.480
and just focus on this quiet
place that I can get into.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.104
The City of LA
actually came to me--

00:43:29.104 --> 00:43:31.020
I don't know how they
came to me and found me,

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.010
but they commissioned
installations

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.560
in the metro systems because
they had never really seen

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.770
people take pictures of LA that
made LA look good, you know.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.820
So these are some
of the pictures.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.700
This is my experience
of Los Angeles.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.270
This is how I feel about LA.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.870
You know?

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:52.290
And I actually do love the city.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.730
I think it's beautiful.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.750
If I could, I wish I
could live 500 years

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.330
and watch-- people
they buy a house

00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:01.960
and they think they own it.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.660
But in reality,
you don't own that.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.552
You're borrowing it.

00:44:04.552 --> 00:44:06.510
If I could take a picture
of this in 500 years,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.968
you'd see the
buildings come and go

00:44:07.968 --> 00:44:12.150
and come and go and build
and decay and come and go.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.194
But the landscape would
say pretty much the same,

00:44:14.194 --> 00:44:16.110
unless we get a large
earthquake or something.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:16.640
You know?

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.440
But otherwise, the
land is precious.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.910
And I think I'm just trying
to reflect that in the city.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.560
So I just think that
I'm pretty honored

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.110
to be at Google talking
about this stuff,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:40.300
because I think Google
is doing some things now

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:45.370
that are both I would
say revolutionary.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.932
But also I think when it
comes to the work that's truly

00:44:49.932 --> 00:44:51.640
being done, I think
it, for mankind, it's

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.950
more actually evolutionary.

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:58.637
I think that we're actually
evolving now into--

00:44:58.637 --> 00:45:00.970
this is in my opinion, I just
think we're still somewhat

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.340
in the dark ages of technology.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.150
I think it's just starting
to accelerate now.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:10.450
50 or 100 years from now who
knows what will take place.

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:13.240
But I do think that I'm
just honored to be here.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.680
So thank you for inviting me.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.850
Martin, thank you.

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:16.557
Thank you, Ben.

00:45:16.557 --> 00:45:17.140
Appreciate it.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.038
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.572
I certainly want to
leave time for questions.

00:45:31.572 --> 00:45:34.090
AUDIENCE: Give
Michael a new mic.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.784
MITCH DOBROWNER: OK.

00:45:35.784 --> 00:45:37.450
AUDIENCE: So Mitch,
I know you've worked

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:38.740
a long time in visual effects.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.940
So what is your opinion
now on the ethics

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.764
of modifying the picture
after you've taken it?

00:45:46.764 --> 00:45:48.430
Because you could
probably save yourself

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:50.080
a lot of time
waiting for the light

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.564
if you just changed
the lighting.

00:45:52.564 --> 00:45:53.480
MITCH DOBROWNER: Yeah.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.450
No, I would just say that
I don't have any judgment

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.200
about anybody who does that.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.160
Knock yourself out.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.520
It's just not the way that
I want to conduct myself.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.340
To me this is what I do, this
is the way I want to do it.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.960
I was talking to Ben earlier
and just saying even with prints

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.066
when I see prints of
all the photographers.

00:46:13.066 --> 00:46:14.440
And I've bought
a couple of them.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.860
And I don't look at a
lot of other photography.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.730
I try to stay in
my little vacuum.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.230
It's a journey to me.

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:28.080
The whole idea of planning
to go to a location,

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.790
to go to a location to
actually shooting a shot,

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.090
to editing the
shot on a computer,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.950
to seeing the first
prints come out,

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.977
to seeing somebody like a
gallery or somebody saying,

00:46:38.977 --> 00:46:41.560
hey, we'd like a print of that,
seeing somebody buy the print.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.890
When that happens, I don't even
let my anybody pack the prints.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:46.090
I usually cut the tape.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:47.430
And I bring it to FedEx.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.237
And it's a journey.

00:46:49.237 --> 00:46:51.070
And I have to kind of
complete that journey.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.140
But that's just me.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.420
So nothing about
manipulating images.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:56.260
Knock yourself out.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.030
It's just not what I want to do.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.960
AUDIENCE: What
about transparency.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.000
Like no one asks--

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.940
no one thinks they have a right
to ask the photographer how

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.250
they got the shot
before the shot.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.080
But most people seem
to want transparency

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.500
in exactly how it was
modified after the fact.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.930
Do you see any essential
distinction there

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.889
or is it all just part
of the artistic process?

00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:17.471
MITCH DOBROWNER: I
think it's all part

00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:18.550
of the artistic journey.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.300
And for me, it was just like
there's a couple of things

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.590
that I was happy about
in my journey, which

00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:35.440
was like somebody like
National Geographic certifying

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.130
that the pictures
weren't heavily modified

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.817
and actually having some
museums collect my prints.

00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.150
Which to me it wasn't about
a museum collecting my print

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.340
because I was so good and
great and all that stuff,

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.850
it was just that I had
reached a place with my art

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.280
that somebody
thought that it would

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.530
go into a collection
for a long time

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:59.950
and maybe be a little bit more
eternal than just temporal.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.591
So and the books were
really important to me.

00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:04.090
The print, I don't
know what's going

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.650
on with print in the future.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.652
You know?

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:09.610
Everything that's going
on in the internet now,

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.380
I was really happy
about the books,

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:16.750
because I think the print
is, to me, is my end product.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.810
It's amazingly valuable to
look at something like that.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.430
I highly respect
all the other ways

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.880
that media is being
interpreted now.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.870
But to me, it was just
the way I was in my DNA

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.600
that the print was
my final product.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.100
You know?

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.600
So.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.735
The bathroom is over--

00:48:42.735 --> 00:48:44.850
AUDIENCE: I know
this is probably not

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.800
going to be one of the best
questions you ever heard.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.800
In fact, it's--

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.620
MITCH DOBROWNER:
Probably the best one

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.120
AUDIENCE: --probably
pretty classic.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.790
What's your favorite
picture that you've

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.002
taken and, well, why?

00:48:58.002 --> 00:48:59.960
MITCH DOBROWNER: That's
a really good question.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.610
My favorite picture I've
taken is the Shiprock picture,

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.950
because it meant the most to me.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.929
In fact, I have it
tattooed on my arm.

00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:08.220
That's how much it meant to me.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.675
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:49:09.675 --> 00:49:11.550
MITCH DOBROWNER: And
that's just because when

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.484
I go through my days--

00:49:12.484 --> 00:49:14.400
it's kind of like a
quarterback in a football,

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.316
if you watch football.

00:49:15.316 --> 00:49:18.280
Sometimes they just have to
look down at the plays going on.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.250
I just need to be
inspired sometimes.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.640
And that picture just inspired
me, not so much the picture,

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.250
but the experience
of capturing it.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.010
AUDIENCE: How did the
experience inspire

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:35.430
you to do what you
exactly I mean to become

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.050
a better photographer or what?

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:37.966
MITCH DOBROWNER: Yeah.

00:49:37.966 --> 00:49:41.320
It taught me about believing
in myself a little bit more.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.740
That when all those things
were going through my mind

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.370
that I couldn't do
something that I just put

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:49.140
my head down and
kept on doing it

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.630
even though that
voice on my shoulder

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.870
was saying that
I couldn't do it.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.480
And I ended up doing it.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.660
I don't think it
was an accident.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.620
So I think what happens
is that maybe there's

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.660
a photography god that says
when I've spilled enough sweat

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.050
and blood on a
landscape photography,

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:17.400
they'll open up and
show me what I came for.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.720
I truly believe that.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.190
Sometimes I think
that you really

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.470
just need to put your
head down and persevere

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.780
through something.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.670
And I drove 1,200 miles for
that picture, just one picture.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.720
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Mitch.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.860
MITCH DOBROWNER: Thank you.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.510
Those were great
questions by the way.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.490
AUDIENCE: I love the
stories about how

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:52.140
you sort of track down the
pictures that you want.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.500
I was wondering
what's the longest

00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.740
time you've spent between coming
up with an idea for a picture

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.960
that you wanted and getting
the shot you wanted?

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.060
MITCH DOBROWNER:
Right now, probably.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.000
So for me in my
personal life, I've

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.600
been working like Dan had
said in like visual effects

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.920
and technology for, I
don't know, 25 years,

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.630
and decided that I had--

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:25.540
I'm going to call it it's
really interesting work.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.450
But it was just time
for me to chase my dream

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:32.560
and get back into my photography
and get into what was

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.850
important for me for my life.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.560
I think life is super short.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.020
We're not here very long,
even if you live to be 100,

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.551
it's just a drop in the bucket.

00:51:39.551 --> 00:51:41.800
I don't even know my great,
great, great grandfather's

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.299
name.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.310
They existed.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.350
They had rougher
lives than I've had.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:51.850
But I've decided like
over the past four months

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.670
that I need to get
back into that zone.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.230
So the world that
I was in before

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.080
had basically sucked my
creativity out of me.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.960
And it was just time to move on.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.130
So some of the pictures that
I showed from the Lone Pine,

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.020
by accident, those--
actually I wasn't

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.520
really there to shoot pictures.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:16.210
It was more like just to start
to get back into that zone--

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.080
were some of the beginnings of
just this next journey that I'm

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:20.837
going to take on.

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.170
And like I said before, I
think you do grow as a person.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.420
And as you grow into
a person things--

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.850
I hope that my images evolve.

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.400
And I always have thought
that my best images will come,

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.150
that I'm not done.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.847
This is just probably the
middle of my journey right now.

00:52:34.847 --> 00:52:36.180
Hope that answered the question.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.320
So right now I'm
getting back into it

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.434
after about a three month break.

00:52:41.434 --> 00:52:43.318
MARTIN: Are there
any more questions?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.040
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoyed your talk.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.490
I liked the way how
you explained your work

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:57.240
through light and spirituality.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.949
I assume the Los Angeles
work is your newest work?

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:01.990
MITCH DOBROWNER: Is what?

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.130
AUDIENCE: Your newest or--

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:04.796
MITCH DOBROWNER: No,
it's not, actually.

00:53:04.796 --> 00:53:06.960
It's some of my older work.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.700
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.590
MITCH DOBROWNER:
Yeah, the one that--

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.330
I never finished the
story about Paul,

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.330
like that first shot which I
labeled like civilization--

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:18.720
I'll back it up a couple--

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.130
this shot.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.296
I think I shot that in 2006.

00:53:22.296 --> 00:53:23.670
And why the
galleries didn't like

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:26.152
it is that I did
an edition of 100.

00:53:26.152 --> 00:53:29.070
And the galleries are like you
can't do an edition of 100,

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.750
you're edition of 5.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:33.024
You sell it at like
a zillion dollars.

00:53:33.024 --> 00:53:34.440
And 100, how are
we going to sell?

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:38.510
So that edition's at
like 92 of 100 now.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.250
So they're wrong.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:39.916
They were wrong.

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:42.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.810
So anyway, because people
related somehow to that image.

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:47.910
I mean when I first
showed it to some friends,

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:49.140
they were like, oh nice.

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.860
And they were like wait a
second, those buildings?

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.735
I thought they were just
trees and mountains?

00:53:52.735 --> 00:53:54.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.770
When you look at this
image, you could kind of

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:01.740
blend it into your
landscape photography

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:05.820
and out of a sudden, gosh,
there is a skyscraper

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.720
or kind of a house.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:13.110
So but the difference between
the landscape photography

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:15.330
or the natural
landscape photography

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:19.500
and the urban landscape
photography you do here

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.790
is that I think you
photograph from the ground

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.672
in the landscape but here
you have this overview right?

00:54:26.672 --> 00:54:27.630
MITCH DOBROWNER: Right.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.420
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
is it from a helicopter

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.030
or always from skyscrapers?

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.185
MITCH DOBROWNER: It's
from Mulholland Drive.

00:54:35.185 --> 00:54:36.060
AUDIENCE: Mulholland?

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:36.560
All of them?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.976
MITCH DOBROWNER: And we only
live five minutes from there.

00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:40.600
So it's really easy
for me to get to.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.599
And a lot of times when
I was photographing LA--

00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:45.480
just the honest truth, not this,
but some of the other ones--

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.580
is that I couldn't get out
into the Southwest and to Utah.

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.510
Or I couldn't get out.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:52.650
It wasn't storm season.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.410
I just was itching to
get out and photograph.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:57.870
So I just grabbed the
camera on a stormy day

00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.580
and just run up the
hill and just see

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:05.910
if I see something of the
city that I really love.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.960
So yeah.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.560
So a lot of these were
just because like I

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.320
was itching to shoot and I
couldn't get out of town.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.690
And it was just time.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:20.100
And the city is really to me
beautiful during the rains,

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.450
during the rainy season.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.851
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:23.350
Thank you.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:24.183
MITCH DOBROWNER: OK.

00:55:28.292 --> 00:55:29.000
BLAIR: Hi, Mitch.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.452
MITCH DOBROWNER: Hi, Blair.

00:55:30.452 --> 00:55:32.660
BLAIR: What did you mean by
when you said you got out

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.700
to practice shooting?

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.640
MITCH DOBROWNER: Well
I think sometimes--

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.400
like now if there's a break.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.550
Let's say I've had a couple
month break between shooting.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:51.470
Say a basketball player,
and the finals are tonight.

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.600
I'm sure LeBron
practiced this week

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.060
before he's getting
ready to shoot

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.680
or he's getting ready to play.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.960
So with photography, for
me, it's the same thing.

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.250
I have to kind of warm up.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:04.460
I have to get into that mode.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.700
It's almost meditative to me.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:12.231
So during the day,
it could be chaotic.

00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:13.230
There's things going on.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.190
I got to go food shopping.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:15.260
I've got to do something,
go walk the dog,

00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.430
and all this other stuff.

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.650
That's fun, actually
walking the dog.

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.660
But I have to get
into that mode.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.270
I have to feel that mode again.

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:26.430
And sometimes I can't remember
what that mode feels like.

00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:29.360
So I know when I go out Trona--

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.051
which I actually haven't been
out to in a little while.

00:56:33.051 --> 00:56:35.300
But I'm going to plan on
going there as soon as we get

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.880
the next change in weather--

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.880
that I can get quickly
into that zone there.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.091
There's nobody out there.

00:56:42.091 --> 00:56:43.090
There's no people there.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:44.510
It's quiet.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.520
It looks like another
planet out there.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.170
And it just allows
me to kind of get

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.650
into that zone of photography to
see like a photographer again.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:54.485
Usually what I do to
start to actually practice

00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:58.094
for that is when I walk around,
I start to look at compositions

00:56:58.094 --> 00:56:59.510
and practice being
a photographer,

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:02.984
even though I don't
have a camera with me.

00:57:02.984 --> 00:57:04.400
So that's what I
meant by practice

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.760
is just to start
to kind of practice

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.820
dribbling a basketball, practice
you know swinging the bat, just

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:14.030
practice getting back
into that quiet place

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.790
where I can kind of
feel myself get grounded

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:18.634
and ready to photograph.

00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:26.150
MARTIN: Could we thank
our speaker one more time?

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:27.275
MITCH DOBROWNER: Thank you.

00:57:27.275 --> 00:57:28.600
[APPLAUSE]
