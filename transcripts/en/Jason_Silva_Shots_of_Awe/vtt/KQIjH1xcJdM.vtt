JASON SILVA: What's up
"Shots of Awe" fans?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.356
Jason Silva here,
letting you know

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:09.610
that July is creativity
month here on "Shots of Awe",

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.490
which means that every video we
post will be about creativity.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.422
It'll be about exploring
that liminal trance states,

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:21.220
that magical borderland
between dreams and reality,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.720
that space in which
we connect the dots.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.740
We'll fall down the rabbit hole,
we'll fall through the looking

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.180
glass, it will be amazing.
