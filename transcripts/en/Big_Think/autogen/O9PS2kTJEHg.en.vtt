tremendous amount of attention three

trillion dollars sitting on corporate

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440
trillion dollars sitting on corporate
 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.500
trillion dollars sitting on corporate
balance sheets why is that I think one

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510
balance sheets why is that I think one
 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.570
balance sheets why is that I think one
of the reasons is regulation one of the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580
of the reasons is regulation one of the
 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.189
of the reasons is regulation one of the
reasons is if you're the CEO of a

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199
reasons is if you're the CEO of a
 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.499
reasons is if you're the CEO of a
company and you know that in the future

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509
company and you know that in the future
 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.659
company and you know that in the future
the cost of employing people is going to

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669
the cost of employing people is going to
 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.839
the cost of employing people is going to
go up because healthcare legislation you

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849
go up because healthcare legislation you
 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.310
go up because healthcare legislation you
know that you've heard that your taxes

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
know that you've heard that your taxes
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.380
know that you've heard that your taxes
are likely to go up you know that the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
are likely to go up you know that the
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.909
are likely to go up you know that the
cost of capital is likely to increase

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919
cost of capital is likely to increase
 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.100
cost of capital is likely to increase
for lots of reasons Basel three is one

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110
for lots of reasons Basel three is one
 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.650
for lots of reasons Basel three is one
of them thin reg potentially has that

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660
of them thin reg potentially has that
 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.690
of them thin reg potentially has that
impact as well the fact that there's a

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700
impact as well the fact that there's a
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.030
impact as well the fact that there's a
wall of debt coming due also for all

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040
wall of debt coming due also for all
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.670
wall of debt coming due also for all
those reasons you're certainly thinking

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680
those reasons you're certainly thinking
 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.280
those reasons you're certainly thinking
I want to put some cash aside otherwise

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290
I want to put some cash aside otherwise
 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.050
I want to put some cash aside otherwise
look I think the different rules

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060
look I think the different rules
 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.150
look I think the different rules
different regulations have an impact on

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160
different regulations have an impact on
 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.800
different regulations have an impact on
different industries certainly thin reg

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810
different industries certainly thin reg
 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.800
different industries certainly thin reg
a lot of the regulations are still being

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810
a lot of the regulations are still being
 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.570
a lot of the regulations are still being
thought about and have not been

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580
thought about and have not been
 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.100
thought about and have not been
implemented that'll be key for the next

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110
implemented that'll be key for the next
 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.250
implemented that'll be key for the next
several years and but that clearly will

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260
several years and but that clearly will
 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.170
several years and but that clearly will
have an impact on operations that used

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180
have an impact on operations that used
 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.270
have an impact on operations that used
to be for example at banks that will now

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280
to be for example at banks that will now
 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.160
to be for example at banks that will now
become independent or go into other

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170
become independent or go into other
 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.649
become independent or go into other
institutions and clearly healthcare will

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659
institutions and clearly healthcare will
 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:09.940
institutions and clearly healthcare will
have an impact there was an interesting

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950
have an impact there was an interesting
 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.010
have an impact there was an interesting
article in The New York Times yesterday

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
article in The New York Times yesterday
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.990
article in The New York Times yesterday
about the mergers that are occurring in

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000
about the mergers that are occurring in
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.050
about the mergers that are occurring in
the healthcare space in part because the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
the healthcare space in part because the
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.370
the healthcare space in part because the
healthcare reform was designed to

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
healthcare reform was designed to
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.550
healthcare reform was designed to
encourage more collaboration within the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
encourage more collaboration within the
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.290
encourage more collaboration within the
healthcare industry and part of that

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300
healthcare industry and part of that
 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.360
healthcare industry and part of that
collaboration is occurring through

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370
collaboration is occurring through
 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.670
collaboration is occurring through
mergers so I definitely think that the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680
mergers so I definitely think that the
 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.219
mergers so I definitely think that the
recent legislative changes will produce

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229
recent legislative changes will produce
 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.890
recent legislative changes will produce
significant regulatory impacts which

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900
significant regulatory impacts which
 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.830
significant regulatory impacts which
will then produce a business impact

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600
certainly I think that today if your if

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610
certainly I think that today if your if
 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.790
certainly I think that today if your if
your goal is maximum employment the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800
your goal is maximum employment the
 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.110
your goal is maximum employment the
possibility that there will be a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120
possibility that there will be a
 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.540
possibility that there will be a
significant tax increase and the fact

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550
significant tax increase and the fact
 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.460
significant tax increase and the fact
that the cost of capital could increase

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470
that the cost of capital could increase
 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.950
that the cost of capital could increase
and the fact that employment that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960
and the fact that employment that
 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.050
and the fact that employment that
employing workers could be more

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060
employing workers could be more
 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.670
employing workers could be more
expensive because of health care reform

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680
expensive because of health care reform
 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.340
expensive because of health care reform
all those things are likely to make a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350
all those things are likely to make a
 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.770
all those things are likely to make a
number of companies less likely to hire

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780
number of companies less likely to hire
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.530
number of companies less likely to hire
workers on the other hand others might

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540
workers on the other hand others might
 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.060
workers on the other hand others might
argue that there are societal benefits

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070
argue that there are societal benefits
 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.040
argue that there are societal benefits
from all three that's a fine argument to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050
from all three that's a fine argument to
 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.840
from all three that's a fine argument to
make it's just important to understand

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850
make it's just important to understand
 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.680
make it's just important to understand
the realities from both perspectives

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.920
I think that the reality is because of

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
I think that the reality is because of
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.240
I think that the reality is because of
the legislation that's already been

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250
the legislation that's already been
 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460
the legislation that's already been
passed there's likely to be a fair bit

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
passed there's likely to be a fair bit
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.200
passed there's likely to be a fair bit
of regulation implementing that

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210
of regulation implementing that
 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.480
of regulation implementing that
legislation and that'll happen going

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490
legislation and that'll happen going
 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.670
legislation and that'll happen going
forward you know one of the things that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
forward you know one of the things that
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.890
forward you know one of the things that
often you see in government is when you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900
often you see in government is when you
 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.230
often you see in government is when you
can't legislate you regulate and so I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
can't legislate you regulate and so I
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.910
can't legislate you regulate and so I
think that that you might see in other

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
think that that you might see in other
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.670
think that that you might see in other
areas too increased regulation what I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
areas too increased regulation what I
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.500
areas too increased regulation what I
hope though and I think you're seeing

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510
hope though and I think you're seeing
 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.680
hope though and I think you're seeing
some of it you saw in the last election

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
some of it you saw in the last election
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.660
some of it you saw in the last election
is that policy leaders will stop and

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670
is that policy leaders will stop and
 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.780
is that policy leaders will stop and
think about the fact that they really do

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
think about the fact that they really do
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.190
think about the fact that they really do
want jobs created in this country which

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
want jobs created in this country which
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960
want jobs created in this country which
I believe they do and they'll think

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970
I believe they do and they'll think
 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.840
I believe they do and they'll think
about what is the impact of uncertainty

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850
about what is the impact of uncertainty
 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.250
about what is the impact of uncertainty
what is the impact of changing rules on

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260
what is the impact of changing rules on
 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.720
what is the impact of changing rules on
people's willingness to invest versus

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
people's willingness to invest versus
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.670
people's willingness to invest versus
leaving cash sitting on their corporate

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
leaving cash sitting on their corporate
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.710
leaving cash sitting on their corporate
balance sheets and that's something that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720
balance sheets and that's something that
 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.600
balance sheets and that's something that
I hope then could hopefully make that

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610
I hope then could hopefully make that
 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.460
I hope then could hopefully make that
regulation some of which we know is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470
regulation some of which we know is
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.640
regulation some of which we know is
coming more flexible and more reasonable

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650
coming more flexible and more reasonable
 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.980
coming more flexible and more reasonable
and less likely to have a negative

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990
and less likely to have a negative
 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.220
and less likely to have a negative
impact on the economy
