00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.820
By now you know how important it is
to create goals and look at metrics.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.970
But other than tracking those goals,
how do you affect them?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.760
Your routine,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.180
as a marketeer at a startup should
be based on trial and error.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.620
Experimentation and iteration is
the most important thing for a startup.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.219
Let's hear what some of our
experts have to say about this.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
&gt;&gt; We did some sort of
behavioral studies of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.730
what a new user to YouTube,
how they utilize the service.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.260
And it typically, what we would see

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.110
would be the first time they would come
visit this site would be through some

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.590
kind of viral marketing that may be they
saw one of their friends share a video.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.510
Maybe it was on Myspace, maybe it
was an email, check out this video,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.010
this was really funny.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.680
But the first time generally it
doesn't really stick with them,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.240
they don't remember this site,
maybe they'll remember the site.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.090
They will remember this site, but

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.800
they won't remember the site that it
came from, because I think we get that

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.020
all of the time where people would
just be sharing the instant messages

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.900
through emails, just check this thing
out on the Internet, it's very funny and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.280
you see it, you laugh and
then you close the browser window.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.200
But I think the second time, there
would be another time where somebody

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.890
would share this, another video.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.730
Maybe it'd be somebody else sharing and
then after a few times visiting

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.940
the site, it starts kind of, the logo
starts kind of thinking in a bit,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.880
the sort of domain names start
sinking in a little bit.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.700
And what we would see is that people,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.850
they themselves would type in
YouTube.com into the browser and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.610
they would actually go
to the site themselves.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.740
And then from there, It's about
sort of uploading their own videos,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.120
finding their own videos and sharing it,
so it kind of spreads out that way.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.503
But we've always kind of looked at it
required a lot of sort of effort with

00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:57.239
the design of the site to be able to say
within the first five seconds, that's

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.728
the amount of time window that you have
to be able to really grab the users.

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:06.142
And so there was a lot of work that was
done on the related videos on the right

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.666
side, because the video that you were
sent may not be interesting at all, or

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:12.696
may not be up your sleeve in terms
of what you'd be interested in,

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:14.928
but something on the right
side would grab you.

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:19.062
Same thing on the front page, there
would be ten videos, so we're always any

00:02:19.062 --> 00:02:23.148
page on YouTube there was always one
link away from starting another video.

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:26.939
And so in case you got bored,
instead of closing your browser, I think

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.925
psychologically it's always easier to
kind of spend more time on a site,

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.840
rather than closing the browser and
going to do work.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.780
And so there's always something
that's within one click

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.520
that can start another video and
if you don't like that, again,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.620
then there's another,
one click away from another video.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.350
One significant

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.178
part of YouTube is not the first video
viewed but the subsequent video.

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:56.400
That whole experience and so
whether, and we've different

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.860
metrics giving us different times, but
it has been as high as something as, or

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.050
it has been as low as sort of
the average length session of YouTube is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.180
like 12 minutes, but it's been as high
by some metrics as 28 minutes and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.300
that's incredible when you consider
the average length of the videos.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.170
Whatever, 30 seconds to minutes and
so well,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.110
one important part of that is and
not the first video.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.760
We're assuming that people
are already getting to the site but

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.760
how do you get them to watch and
click on the second video and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.890
then after that how do you get
them to click on another video.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.570
And more importantly cause like if
they get disappointed by that second,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.320
third video how do you still get them
to click on the fourth, fifth, sixth,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.040
seventh video.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.930
And the solution to that,
partly, is the related videos

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.450
on the right side and we always put that
high because that was going to be your

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.980
channel to get into more content,
but then the follow-up question.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.390
And this is where we had the smartest
engineers at YouTube working on this day

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.310
end, day out, which was how do you
populate that related to video?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.230
One idea of thinking about
the content on YouTube, is you can

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.710
think about it and sort of almost
different islands that are connected.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.660
Somehow, but different islands, they're
islands about sort of singers and

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.220
the different types of
genres of artists out there.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.959
And then there's islands of sort of
movies, there's islands that related to

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.700
fashion and food and there's islands
that's more directed towards kids.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.890
So there's all these different islands,
some of them are bigger,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.590
some of them are continents and
some of them are tiny.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.570
But people are very
passionate about that and

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.050
they're all interconnected with graphs
and if you can visualize that then it's

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.370
kind of what if you are watching
a single video on one of these.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.020
Maybe it's a big continent and
maybe it's a small island.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.170
What do you populate with all
the other videos on the right side?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.600
And the obvious approach is if you're
watching a content about cooking,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.070
everybody on the right side
is more about cooking and so

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.160
it's all within the same island.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.293
But what if by the fifth video they're
just sick of watching cooking videos,

00:04:57.293 --> 00:04:59.658
how do you get them to
watch something else?

00:04:59.658 --> 00:05:03.423
And so we realized early on, but there
was a lot of testing involved with this,

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:07.258
is, what if we actually start stuffing
in different types of content in there.

00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:10.898
So what would be coming back from
search results would be the things that

00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:14.380
are most related with this video is
obvious it's going to be cooking.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.950
But let's just say artificially we
take out 50%, 75% of this content.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.570
We just make it so it's impossible
to show more than 25% related

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.250
videos is cooking, then you start
actually feeding in this other content.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.460
Maybe we find out that people that are
interested in cooking also like soccer.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.280
And so we start actually putting in 10%

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.350
of the videos which
are related to soccer.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.510
And started playing around with this and
so

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.630
maybe people that are interested
in this abstraction of soccer and

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.870
sports if they're watching sports
videos maybe they're also interested in

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.190
watching football or maybe they're
interested in watching tennis.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.590
And so we started playing
around with this idea,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.970
what percentage is tightly related
to the video that you're watching.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.600
How much of it is, it's not unrelated
ever, but there was a algorithm

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.880
that went behind, how do you actually
create this sort of loose relationship?

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.020
They're still related, because we do
know that people that watch this content

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.910
also watch this content.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.810
But it would be hard to explain if you
didn't look at what the actual watching

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.800
sessions and patterns are to be able to

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.000
create that connection between
say food and football.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.200
Well, that's probably
an easy one to create, but so

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.470
we started doing a lot of
research along these lines and

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.800
trying to create algorithms to be able
to better guess as to people that

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.310
are watching this video would also be
interested in watching this video.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.370
But it took a lot of theories and
testing those theories,

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.910
and pushing stuff out live and
seeing what the users would actually do,

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.010
and tweaking and
tweaking and tweaking that.
