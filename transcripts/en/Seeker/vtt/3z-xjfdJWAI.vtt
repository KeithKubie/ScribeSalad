00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.120
Why does everyone get so hung up about having
to take a drug test?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.220
If you’re not on vitamin B pills or sleep
aides or ibuprofen or had a poppy seed muffin

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.640
you have nothing to hide!

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.480
What’s up science junkies, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.220
If you’re applying for certain jobs or life
insurance, you may have to take a drug test.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.070
In some states here in the US applicants for
government assistance have to pass a drug

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.070
test as well.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.830
That’s a bit of a controversial topic but
regardless on where you stand on it, you probably

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.559
agree that someone who isn’t using illegal
drugs shouldn’t be denied a job or insurance

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.460
or aid just because the test they took resulted
in a false positive.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.319
So these drug tests had better be pretty foolproof,
right?

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.010
Well they may not be up to snuff.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.020
It’s estimated they produce false positives
in 5-10% of cases.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.329
Judy Stone of Scientific American estimated
that taking into account normal drug use rates,

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.520
about 9 out of every 1000 people will test
positive for a drug they have not taken.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.010
Part of the reason these tests sound a false
alarm is because the list of things that set

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.899
them off is surprisingly long.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.190
The painkiller Ibuprofen can cause a test
to show positive for marijuana, barbiturates,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.930
or benzodiazepines.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.130
Cold remedies, hay fever remedies, diet pills,
and nasal decongestants can show up as amphetamines.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.250
If you like to unwind with a poppy seed muffin
and a gin and tonic, the poppies or quinine

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.750
in the tonic water can both trip the alarm
for opiates.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.440
And of course eating foods with hemp seeds
or taking vitamin B supplements derived from

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.740
hempseed oil can have trace amounts of THC,
the active ingredient in marijuana.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
There are many varieties of drug tests and
they all have their strengths and weaknesses.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.640
Ideally they strike a balance between accuracy,
cost, and invasiveness.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.590
Like a blood test is the most accurate, but
a lot of people have a problem with needles.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.390
Hair tests aren’t as invasive but they can
be expensive, depending on how many substances

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.750
they’re looking for, and some shampoos can
throw off the scent.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.520
By far the most common method uses urine samples.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.390
The test uses immunoassays, which are biochemicals
that bond to specific macromolecules and give

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.890
off an indicator reaction.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.270
They’re pretty accurate but not perfect,
so positive results often undergo a second

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.270
test.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.070
A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry test
analyzes another urine sample, usually taken

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.110
from the original.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.609
The sample is pushed through a tubular column
by helium gas, and certain drugs pass through

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.590
it at certain known speeds.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.499
Once it gets to the end of the column, it’s
fragmented with ionization and the fragments

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.920
are sorted by mass.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.950
Again, certain drugs have specific and known
fragmentation patterns, so these two tests

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.459
together can give scientists a pretty solid
idea of exactly what chemicals are present.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.799
The test is more expensive, but the positive
results are rarely wrong.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.370
Not all drug tests are designed to see if
someone has been using: some are designed

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.939
to test if an object has been in contact with
illicit substances, or if something is a drug

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.939
itself.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.840
Law enforcement uses these when investigating
drug dealers, but they aren’t perfect either.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.170
In 2003 a college freshman flying home for
the holidays was stopped in a Philadelphia

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.139
airport because she had condoms filled with
white powder in her bag.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.609
She claimed it was flour, a gag gift from
girlfriends and that she squeezed them for

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.719
stress relief, but sadly the tests didn’t
vindicate her, coming up positive for opium

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:02.989
and cocaine.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.279
She spent 3 weeks in jail and could have gone
to prison for 20 years had more accurate tests

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.279
not cleared her name.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.669
I’m sure she realizes her mistake now, but
for all of you out there let me just reiterate:

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:18.230
do not bring white powder in condoms through
airports, it looks a little suspicious.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.160
So certain innocuous drugs can trip a drug
test, but that’s not the only risk.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.169
For why mixing certain drugs can make you
dead, you can turn to Trace over here.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:36.359
Do you 
think the margin of error is good enough,

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.809
or is just one innocent person losing their
job unacceptable?

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.280
