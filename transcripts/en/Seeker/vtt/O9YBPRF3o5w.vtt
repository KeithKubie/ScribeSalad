00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.640
NASA's rovers on the surface of Mars are revealing answers to some of the biggest questions

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.659
about our nearby planetary neighbor.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
And driving this rover – that is, on average, 225 million kilometers away from Earth –

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.440
requires robust technology and years of development.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.260
And it's about to get even more advanced 
with Mars 2020.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.580
VANDI: Even though the rovers do so much,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.980
the computing power we have on board
is actually fairly limited.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.500
The average phone a person carries has far more computation than we have onboard the rover.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.260
And the reason is because there's a lot of radiation,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.100
so we have to use computers
that are radiation-hardened.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.280
Dr. Vandi Verma has worked for over eleven years developing and operating Mars rovers

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.520
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.920
VANDI: To send the commands to the rover, we send a fairly compacted set of instructions.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.420
When we uplink the sequence to the rover,
everything goes through the Deep Space Network.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.380
And to get the data back, we transmit it to orbiters, which are actually just in Mars orbit.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.140
And then those orbiters transmit it
through the Deep Space Network.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.940
In fact, we actually have programs on our phones

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.180
so that whenever the data comes down,
you get a little summary.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.920
We have a lot of different ways
we parse the data, summarize it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.780
and depending on what happened,
we may dig into a particular area more or less.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.320
While we're doing all this, the science team
is having a discussion

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.920
on what to do next.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.660
Given the distance between Mars and Earth, NASA can't joystick the rover's every move.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.080
So rover planners like Dr. Verma  have to map
the rover's entire day of sequenced movements

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.000
perfectly.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.700
VANDI: The biggest concern is, 
'is the rover going to be safe?'

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.200
There's imprecision in the data, and in the positioning.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.940
So you have to take into account that,
'I am placing this delicate lens

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.860
within proximity of this other rock. If it was off by five millimeters, is that a hazard?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.080
That's sort of what we look for, are those situations.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.900
It's a lot of fun.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.940
Over the last 20 years, each mission has
built on its predecessor,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.340
enhancing the critical engineering and design of rovers like Sojourner, Spirit,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.000
Opportunity, and Curiosity.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.700
And Mars 2020 will be no exception.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.560
VANDI: With Opportunity, we were coming across sand a lot more on Mars.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.940
We had a situation where the rover was driving along,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280
and by the encoders, as you measure,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880
it's thinking it's covering all this distance and it kept on moving

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.020
but it's just embedding itself
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.320
Based on that, we developed
the visual odometry technique,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.400
which allows us to use cameras to take an image,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.800
take another image, and if the rover hasn't moved we'd be able to see that the features have not moved

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.720
between those images.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.100
For 2020, we wanted to be able
to drive even more precisely,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.040
and we needed to do visual odometry even faster.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.879
So we now have a dedicated computer, 
so that it's so fast

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.540
that we don't have to think about it.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.220
Now this allows scientists
to get into more challenging terrain.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.560
Mars 2020 will also include a series of major firsts.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.289
VANDI: After we land, we're going to
deploy this helicopter

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.700
which is as large as the size of a softball.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.200
It'll fly for short durations and it's solar powered,

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.329
and we'll be able to get data from it.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.069
So this is the first time we've had a helicopter on Mars, and that will be really exciting as well.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.580
And perhaps the most exciting step will be bringing extraterrestrial samples back to Earth.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.340
So what's really incredible with Mars 2020 is that we're going to collect a core this time of the sample.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.060
The rover will store the sample cores in tubes and deposit them at precise coordinates,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.960
known as sample cache depots.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.220
Detailed maps will be provided for future missions to retrieve them and return to Earth.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.680
VANDI: And once we get that sample on Earth,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.200
it's going to be quite incredible.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.600
And then they will actually be sent
to labs all over the world

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.020
and it'll probably be decades
that they will be analyzing that.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.860
Mars exploration has come a really long way.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.400
We now know about seasons on Mars;

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640
we know how methane migrates.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.460
So there's so many ways in which

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.200
the history of Mars and Earth are so intertwined.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.080
What is it that caused Mars to today be this arid environment,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.080
and how does that relate to Earth,
which is teeming with life

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.920
and this beautiful blue planet?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.600
And that has opened up a whole new area
of science and understanding

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.400
and allowed us to analyze these details very carefully.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.860
Humans are definitely someday going to be on Mars,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.080
and the rovers are making discoveries that will make that possible

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.039
and make decisions on how we do that.
