00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.410
 . 

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.670
 What I would like to do now in this presentation is a set of 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.470
 Examples of very simple discrepancies 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.710
 But its real value, I think, will take you to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.750
 Real understanding of discrepancies 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.390
 So let's start with the first example 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.590
 If we have x - 5 &lt;35 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.480
 Let's see if we can find all the x values ​​that are 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.940
 Check this equation 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.370
 This is one of the differentiated characteristics 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.000
 In the equation, we have one solution, or at least 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.220
 In equations that we have solved 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.150
 Either in the future, you will see the equations possess more 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.250
 Of one solution 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.150
 But in those that we just solved, we found value 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.310
 x specific 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.350
 In Variants, there is a complete set of x values ​​that 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.720
 Check this variance 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.930
 If what we are told is: What are all x values ​​that are when 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 Subtract 5, the output will be less than 35? 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 Indeed, we can think about it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690
 I mean 0-5 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.290
 This is less than 35 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.310
 -100-5 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.750
 Less than 35 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.160
 5-5 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.300
 Less than 35 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.750
 So clearly there are many x values ​​that will achieve this 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
 But what we want to do is get a solution 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.060
 Includes all these x values 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.640
 The method of values ​​in this way is considered the same as that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.960
 We solve any equation 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.610
 We want to put x statements, in this case, on 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.720
 The left side 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 So I'll get rid of this -5, and I can do it 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 By adding 5 to both sides of this equation 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.350
 If I can add 5 to both sides of this equation 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.930
 This will not change the variance 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 Will not change the signal of less than 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 If something is less than something else, something + 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.720
 5 will remain less than the other thing + 5 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.580
 If we have x on the left side 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.500
 These 5 and 5 are deleted 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.730
 x &lt;35 + 5, ie 40 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.190
 That is the solution 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.010
 In order to visualize a set all the numbers are 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.340
 Represent it, let me draw a line here 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.760
 Let me draw a line here 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.280
 I will put it around - suppose this is 40 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.250
 This is 40, 41, 42 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.730
 And then we move to less than 40 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.389
 39, 38 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.240
 You can continue to be less than 40 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.700
 Will continue indefinitely in both directions 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 Any x less than 40 will achieve it 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.950
 It can not equal 40, because if x = 40 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.010
 The 40 - 5 = 35 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.130
 It is not less than 35 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.820
 If x must be less than 40 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.590
 To make this clear on the line of preparation, put a circle around the 40 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620
 To make it clear that we will not include the 40 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.020
 But later we can parse everything under 40 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.010
 If we include everything less than 40 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.770
 In the solution group 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.240
 If everything you shaded in yellow we will include it in 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.040
 Set Solution 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.530
 If 39, 39.999999 league, it is very close 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.240
 Of the 40, we include it within the solution group 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.370
 But the 40 did not 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.630
 That's why we put that open circle around 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.850
 Let us solve another example 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.095
 Let me give it another color 

00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:06.860
 Suppose we have x - let me write it in this 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.360
 Upper-right corner - 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.320
 Suppose we have x + 15&gt; = 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.570
 -60 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.220
 Notice that we now have greater than or equal to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.110
 So let's solve it the same way we used to solve 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.830
 That example is there 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.360
 We can ask 15 from both parties 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.800
 I prefer to change the code 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.680
 Here you add the 5, on the same line 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.460
 You can also pool or subtract 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.480
 The line is so 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.130
 If I ask 15 of both parties, I will ask 15 of them 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.170
 Here, throw 15 from here 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.450
 I have x left side 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.110
 Because I clearly have 15-5 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.420
 It is deleted 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.850
 We get x&gt; = -60 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.000
 - 15 = -75 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.050
 If something is bigger than or equal to something else, if 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.830
 I took 15 of this and so, the signal was bigger than or 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.760
 Equals will still exist 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.320
 If the solution is x&gt; = 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.950
 75 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.995
 Let's represent it on the line of preparation 

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.060
 Let me draw a line here 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.310
 I will have - suppose these 75, and those 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.310
 74, those -73, and those -76 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.450
 and so on 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.870
 I can continue to set stuff 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.280
 Now, x&gt; = -75 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.590
 If x can equal -75 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.470
 Thus we can complement it, because we have a larger signal 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.840
 Of or equal to 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540
 They noticed that we did not make it as empty as that 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.090
 But we have completed it because it can be equal 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.870
 -75, or even greater 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.015
 If greater than or equal to 

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:52.340
 We will highlight everything above 75 as well 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.160
 If the solution set is in orange 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.200
 We can clearly continue on the right. x 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.970
 It can be worth a million, and can be worth a billion 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 It can be anything 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.220
 It has to be any big number, as long as it's bigger 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.090
 From or equal to 75 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.080
 Let's solve more 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.940
 Suppose x - 2 &lt;= 1 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.650
 Again, we will put x on 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.440
 The left side 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.830
 Get rid of these 2 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.400
 Let us add 2 to the two extremes of this equation 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.410
 + 2 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680
 The left side becomes x 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.400
 Our signal is less than or equal to 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.130
 It will not change by adding or subtracting the same thing 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.140
 For the two extremes 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.740
 Then that 1 + 2 = 3 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.010
 If x &lt;= 3 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.960
 Any x value of less than or equal to 3 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.120
 Will achieve the equation 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.640
 So let us help it 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.180
 I will try any x value of less than or equal to 3 and 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.160
 Check yourself from it's really check this out 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.740
 Differentiated 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.760
 I should not call it an equation 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.790
 It's mixed 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.520
 So let me represent the solution package 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.140
 Suppose this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.830
 That is -1, -2 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.020
 If x must be less than or equal to 3 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.480
 Can equal 3, so we will shade the point 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.920
 Or less than 3 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.730
 If this solution set is in pink 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.286
 Anything less than or equal to 3 

00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:21.640
 And check it out yourselves 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.670
 If x = 3, we will get 3 - 2, which is equal to 1 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.170
 This is true because it can be less than or equal to 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.950
 If we put 2.999999-2, we will get 0.999999, which is 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.920
 Less than 1 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.500
 You can continue experimenting with any of these settings at 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.280
 Set this pink solution 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.370
 Let's solve more 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:49.830
 Suppose we have x - 32 &lt;= 0 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.160
 In the same way 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.275
 Let us add 32 to both sides of this equation 

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:57.360
 Add 32 to both sides of this equation 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.820
 The left side becomes x, and 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.650
 The right side is less than or equal to 32 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.800
 Very direct 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.110
 The same principle is used when representing this equation 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.250
 We draw a line of numbers 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.200
 If this is 32, this is 33, this is 31 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.140
 I can continue to add numbers larger and less than 32 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.000
 For the solution group, everything will be less than or equal to 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.410
 So we can - it can equal 32, or less 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.580
 So we include everything less than that 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.790
 Remember, the reason we included him, ie 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.960
 The reason why 32 solutions are acceptable for this 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.090
 The original variance, is a signal of less than or equal to 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.040
 Here, we have no less than or equal to, and for this 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.890
 The 40 were not part of the solution group 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.333
 .
