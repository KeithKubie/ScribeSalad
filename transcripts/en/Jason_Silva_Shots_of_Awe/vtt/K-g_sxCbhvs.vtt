[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.440
There's a magnificent
idea by Steven Johnson.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.410
He says our thoughts
shape our spaces.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.170
Obviously.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.186
We build cathedrals
and skyscrapers

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:24.980
and townhouses and beach houses.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.830
And guess what?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.040
He says, our spaces
return the favor.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.500
Those spaces we build, the
architecture of happiness,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.460
as Alain de Botton writes,
the spaces we create in turn

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.070
inform, shape, sculpt our
subjective experience.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430
There is a feedback loop.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.640
We script intention
into our designs.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.670
And those designs,
in turn, script

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270
our subjective experience.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.810
Our ability to create
virtual future possibilities,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.810
both for ourselves
and for others,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.370
to create future spaces,
to inform future thoughts,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.490
to build a thinking room,
to build an idea lab,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.500
to build a creative playground,
to build a backyard that's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.120
going evoke being a child
playing in the yard,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.950
I mean, even the space
we're in right now,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.780
the serene water, the perfect
temperature, the hue coming

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.830
from that sky, the fact that
we went around the bend,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.920
we're surrounded by green,
there's no other way

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.230
to enter the space
we're in, creates a kind

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.270
of womb-like, serene
space, mood, reality,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.270
it's such a wild idea
because, again, going back

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.480
to Steven Johnson,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.430
to realize the freedom that
we have to compose our lives,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.260
what Timothy Leary calls the
"vertigo of freedom," right?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.190
Whoa!

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.160
I can actually shape this thing?

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.588
This chaotic ride is a blank
canvas for me to beautify?

00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:55.600
It's fulfillment.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.762
It's awe.

00:01:56.762 --> 00:01:58.904
It's Henry Miller's
blade of grass

00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:00.320
that, when given
proper attention,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.740
becomes a magnificent
world in itself.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.550
There is so much to inspire us.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.180
And to realize that we
are bound by no limits

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.560
in order to drink that
inspiration, it's there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.780
for the taking, were
we to just exercise

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.340
a little discretion,
a little discernment,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.250
flex those creative
muscles and make it happen,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.490
we engineer, literally,
our own divinity.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.890
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.490
Yeah.
