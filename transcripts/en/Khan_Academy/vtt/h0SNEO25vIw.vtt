00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.019
We've got triangle ABC here.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.320
It looks like a right triangle.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
We can verify that it is because
it satisfies the Pythagorean

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.820
theorem.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.595
8 squared is 64 plus
15 squared is 225.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:16.090
64 plus 225 is 289,
which is 17 squared.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.000
So it satisfies the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.280
So we know that this right
over here is a right triangle.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.060
But what they're
asking us is-- what

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.520
is the cosine of
angle ABC, which

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.436
is this angle right over
here plus 60 degrees.

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.810
Now, just like
this, I don't have

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.510
any clear way of evaluating it.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.600
But we do have some trig
identities in our toolkit

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.660
that we could use to
express this in a way

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.590
that we might be
able to evaluate it.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.290
In particular, we know
that the cosine of A plus B

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.270
is equal to the cosine of
A times the cosine of B

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.884
minus the sine of A
times the sine of B.

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:58.550
So we could do the
exact same thing here

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:10.990
with the cosine of angle
ABC plus 60 degrees.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.810
This is going to be equal
to-- and let me just write out

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.010
the whole thing--
the cosine of angle

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.830
ABC times the cosine of 60
degrees minus the sine of angle

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.810
ABC times the sine
of 60 degrees.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
So this right over
here is angle ABC.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.680
This is angle ABC.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.250
And this is 60 degrees,
and this is 60 degrees.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.170
So let's evaluate
each of these things.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.660
What is the cosine of angle
ABC going to be equal to?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll do that over here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960
The cosine of angle ABC.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440
Well, we could go
back to Sohcahtoa.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.490
Let me write it down.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.720
Cosine is defined as the
adjacent-- for this angle--

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.950
the adjacent over
the hypotenuse.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.100
So cosine of angle ABC
is equal to 15 over 17.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.480
So this right over
here is 15 over 17.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.940
What is the cosine
of 60 degrees?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
Well, for there, we have to turn
back to our knowledge of 30,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.570
60, 90 triangles.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.540
So if I have a triangle
like this-- so let

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.230
me do my best
here-- to construct

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.540
a 30, 60, 90 right triangle.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.430
So that's a 60-degree side.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.254
This is a 30-degree side.

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:38.170
We know-- and we've seen
this multiple times--

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.610
if the hypotenuse has
length 1, the side

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.014
opposite the 30-degree
side is one half.

00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:44.930
And then, the side
opposite the 60-degree side

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.840
is square root of 3 times this.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.920
So it's square root of 3 over 2.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.770
So the cosine of 60
degrees-- if you're

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.690
looking at this side
right over here.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.110
And let me write it in a
color I haven't used yet.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.210
So I care about the
cosine of 60 degrees.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.590
The cosine of 60
degrees is going

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.640
to be equal to, once again,
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.740
One half over 1.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.860
it's going to be equal
to one half over 1, which

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.240
is equal to one half.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.260
Now, let's think about the sine.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.240
Now, let's think about
the sine of angle ABC.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.270
So that's this one
right over here.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.250
So we have our
triangle right here.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.390
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.690
So opposite has length 8.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.580
Over hypotenuse, is 17.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.330
So it's equal to 8 over 17.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.860
And then, finally,
we need to figure out

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.870
what the sign of 60 degrees is.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.540
Well, for the 60-degree
side of this right triangle,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.840
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.440
So square root of
3 over 2 over 1,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.946
which is just the
square root of 3 over 2.

00:03:54.946 --> 00:03:56.320
So we have all of
the information

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.030
we need to evaluate it.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.290
So this was the
sine of 60 degrees.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.960
This whole thing is
going to evaluate

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.840
to cosine of angle ABC is
15 over 17 times cosine

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.210
of 60 degrees is one half.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.230
So times one half.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.650
And then, we're
going to subtract

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
sine of ABC, which is 8 over 17.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.680
And then, times
sine of 60, which

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.590
is square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.640
So times the square
root of 3 over 2.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.852
And now, we just have to
simplify it a little bit.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:30.810
So this is going to be
equal to-- if I multiply

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.820
one half times this, let's see.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.180
It's going to be 15 over
34 minus-- and let's see.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.300
We're dividing by 2.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.600
So it's 4/17ths.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.337
I'll write this 4 square
roots of 3 over 17.

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:51.170
And that's about as
simple as I could do it.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.340
If I wanted, I could have a
common denominator here of 34.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.590
And then, I could add the
2, so it could be 8 squared.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.130
So 3 over 34, but that still
won't simplify it that much.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.830
So this is a
reasonable good answer

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.100
for what they are asking for.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.991
15 over 34 minus 4 square
roots of 3 over 17.
