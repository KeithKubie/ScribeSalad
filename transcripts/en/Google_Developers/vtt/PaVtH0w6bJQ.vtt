00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:01.380
MALE SPEAKER: Hi Everybody.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm joined in the studio
today, on-site at Founder World

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.720
in San Francisco, by
astronaut Yvonne Cagle.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.670
Aerospace medical engineer,
electrical, biotechnology

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.050
wearables-- you have a lot
going on right now in your life.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.100
What excites you?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.790
YVONNE CAGLE: What excites me
is the endless possibilities,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.630
that anything is possible.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.800
That when you take
things off planet,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.090
then the sky is no
longer the limit.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.229
And the best part is things that
we discover off planet in space

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.190
oftentimes have real world
applications right back here

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.060
on Earth.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.140
So we can even have the win
in developing and innovating

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.539
even before we step off planet.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.080
MALE SPEAKER: That's
really exciting.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.580
Can you give an
example of something

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.840
that you're working
on right now that has

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.149
that practical application?

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.940
YVONNE CAGLE: Well
we're looking at mission

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.020
to Mars within the NASA
agency, and so we're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.990
studying behavioral performance,
how we can make sure

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.400
that we're able
to have resiliency

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.470
when it comes to behavioral
performance on long duration

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.300
crews.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.330
So we can keep crews
working together,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.400
that we can keep crews sharp
and stimulated in their thinking

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.190
and environment that can be very
isolating and sensory deprived.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.190
And that we can really
make sure that we support

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.810
the reintegration, so
that if, by choice, we

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.890
want to get back in line and go
to Neptune or even Pluto now,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.790
we're up to the task.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.900
MALE SPEAKER: That is
really exciting stuff.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.690
So you're also a professor.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.670
What type of things are
you teaching your students

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.940
that kind of line up with
your aerospace career?

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.773
YVONNE CAGLE: Well, the
most important thing

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:41.460
in behavioral performance is
really thinking out of the box,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.590
and looking at what your tools
are right here on Earth that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.150
might have relevance in
space, and, again, how

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.710
you can use space to
develop a platform

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.580
to demonstrate capabilities
that we need here on Earth.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.310
So for example,
some of my students

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.420
are occupational
therapy students,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.540
and they're using
occupational science

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.650
to use some of the same
strategies and tools

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.230
to rehabilitate challenging
conditions for performance

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.910
and learning, here
on Earth, for crews

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.860
as they go into long duration.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.990
As well as games and
other ways to entertain

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.020
when you're in that kind
of challenged environment.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.520
MALE SPEAKER:
That's really cool.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730
So you just came
off the main stage,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.982
giving the opening
keynote talk at the event.

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.690
What was the message
that you were trying

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.330
to get across to the audience?

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.830
YVONNE CAGLE: The
message was really

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.400
the next big leap is what
our big thinking should

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.290
be about, and
knowing that everyone

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.570
can participate in that.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.220
I myself am working with a
very exciting team of engineers

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.350
in Silicon Valley on
wearable technologies,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.360
finding strategies to
recondition astronauts,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360
and even people here on
Earth who are deconditioned,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.586
infirmed, or just
discouraged-- who

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:54.260
want to either stay or
amplify-- kind of enhance--

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.150
or just get back in the game.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.120
And so the things
that we discover

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.180
are immediately relevant.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.130
And the big message
that I wanted

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.040
to make sure everyone
came away with,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.280
is be bold to dare to engage
your ideas and to innovate.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.900
Because that iteration,
that innovation,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.750
is definitely here on Earth,
available to make space

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.300
for all.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.610
MALE SPEAKER: So this is a
bit of a different event.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.190
It's taking entrepreneurs,
and tech people,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.494
and people really of
all walks of life.

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:31.052
What attracted you to
this event in particular?

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:32.510
YVONNE CAGLE: I
think just the fact

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.260
that there was so much that
was new and cutting edge,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.270
and that there was a community
that's being galvanized around

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.640
this conversation.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.070
And how open everybody is
to sharing their ideas.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.060
So that you can be
absolutely bodacious to think

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.670
and to actually demonstrate
that you can get-- for example,

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.510
in our case-- the equivalent
of two hours of exercise,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.520
both aerobic and anaerobic,
in less than 20 minutes.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.240
That's mind blowing,
but you've got

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.200
to be able to think out
of the box, off planet,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.570
and have the boldness to dare to
go to the edge of that envelope

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.910
and engage it.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.590
And I see entrepreneurs who
have that kind of boldness

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.980
and determination.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.610
And if that's something that we
could pack into a solid rocket

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.506
booster, we would be to
Pluto and back by now.

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:19.730
MALE SPEAKER: That's-- yeah.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.050
So I believe I read
that you had in the past

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.880
worked as a liaison between
big companies like Google

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.450
in a role of figuring out
how you work with their data

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.893
and commercialization.

00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:32.680
What did that role entail?

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.430
YVONNE CAGLE: Wow.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.600
Well, we very much
were-- I should say,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.340
rooted in the environment
and the atmosphere.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.510
So much of our time
was spent trying

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.680
to demonstrate and evolve
tools that could help us

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.110
with clean tech,
with climate change,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.300
being able to detect--
you know-- CO2 footprints.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.510
And, very importantly,
was disaster preparedness,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.470
how we could use imaging
to survey disaster areas,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.010
and triage or prioritize
our resources in order

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.818
to do rescues.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.200
MALE SPEAKER: That's
really interesting.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.080
So, do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.260
YVONNE CAGLE: Well I'm all
about mobility-- mobility

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.830
of the human body, getting
people back to moving,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.390
be it within their
own physiology

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.728
or innovated exoskeletons
or vehicles themselves.

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.516
So for me, when
I think mobility,

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:38.150
I think anything from a
driverless vehicle-- so for me,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.220
that autonomous vehicle with
Google is absolutely amazing.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.880
And you can take that
and you can put it

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.150
into maybe even a space
shuttle that wants

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.600
to land on an asteroid someday.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.610
So it's a great
demonstration capability.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.080
But the most important
lesson I think

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.990
is knowing that we all
have our own spacecraft--

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.330
that we don't really
even need a vehicle.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.220
We are our own craft, and if
we take it to space-- well,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.212
that's Mach 25 all over
the place and back.

00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:09.420
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.250
Well, thank you very much
for joining me today.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.060
YVONNE CAGLE: Great, thank you.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.660
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.660
YVONNE CAGLE: Take care.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.710
