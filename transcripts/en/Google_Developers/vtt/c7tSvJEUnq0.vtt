MEGHAN MEHTA: Hey, Timothy,
we should go After Dark.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.390
I want to go dancing.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.265
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What?

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:10.880
MEGHAN MEHTA: I
want to go dancing!

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.755
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What?

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:13.213
MEGHAN MEHTA: I
want to go dancing!

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.864

right, let's do it!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.873
So I'm an enormous space nerd.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.290
Do you have anything
space-themed?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.200
- We have an awesome spaceship
tattoo that's really cool.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm in.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.220
- I could do it right here.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.762
Is that cool?

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Sure.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460
- Ow.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.910
- So I'm going to put
our unicorn on there.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.970
MEGHAN MEHTA: We got a unicorn!

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.880
Oh, OK, so it says
"eats" over there,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.520
and there's probably food.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.062
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
yeah, you hungry?

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:51.546
MEGHAN MEHTA: The cones of meat.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.010
There's advice?

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.959
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.376
MEGHAN MEHTA: Yeah,
let's do this.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:05.667
- What you do is
you ask a question.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.750
MEGHAN MEHTA: What will I
have for lunch tomorrow?

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.258
So, like, I think I want a
salad, but I really want pizza.

00:01:14.258 --> 00:01:14.758
Hi!

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:15.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.345
Can I hug?

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:17.053
MEGHAN MEHTA: Oh.

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.220
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, so good.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.350
MEGHAN MEHTA: Thank you.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.308
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I'm
a little dusty up here.

It won't come off!

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.470
MEGHAN MEHTA: I don't know,
this might be my new job.

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:12.750
Timothy, thank you so much
for hanging out with me

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.157
during my first I/O After Dark.

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:15.490
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Are you kidding?

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.415
This was tons of fun.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.540
I mean, this is what makes
it a developer festival.
