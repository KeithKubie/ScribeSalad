00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.890
Jesse: All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining
us for another live in San

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.950
Francisco Authors@Google talk. Today we have
Anil Ananthaswamy talking about

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.180
"The Edge of Physics." He is a consultant
 -- or was a consulting editor --

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.470
still is -- for "New Science Magazine" in
London, umm, he was a computer

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.680
scientist I believe for --
Anil: Software Engineer.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.679
Jesse: Software Engineer for about ten years,
uh, he's contributed to "National

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.929
Geographic News". Very, very well educated
in the field but also extremely good

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.330
at relating physics to -- to the rest of us
basically. Umm, prior to moving to

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.521
London, Anil lived in Berkeley. So Anil, welcome
back to San Francisco.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:46.649
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
Anil: Hi, everyone. Can you hear me clearly?

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.660
Umm, it's a double pleasure for
me to be here in, uh, the Bay Area. As Jesse

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.511
said, I used to live here and work
as a software engineer so, uh, about ten years

00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:03.359
ago I moved onto write about
science and, uh, so it's kinda nice to come

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.470
back and start speaking about this
to people that I used to work with. Umm, so

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.260
just to, uh, tell you a little bit
about this presentation, I -- I won't be reading

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.300
from the book. I wanted to
show you some slides of the various trips

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.210
I've made to write the book and these
trips were to some pretty remote parts of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.450
the earth, from the Atacama Desert in
Chile, to Lake Baikal in Siberia in the winter,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.000
umm, to Antarctica and to the
South Pole. Umm, before I start showing you

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.930
the slides, I just wanted to sort
of tell you how I came upon, uh, the idea

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.860
for the book. For the longest time I
wanted to just travel to mountain tops and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.250
write about telescopes and, uh, uh,
it was a very thin idea and I don't think

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.030
any publisher would have really liked
it and it sort of languished like that for

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.200
a long time. And then about 2004,
umm, I became physics news editor for "New

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.040
Scientist" in London and as part of
that I moved to -- I came to Berkeley and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.160
Stanford to meet scientists just to
get a idea of what's happening in physics

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.769
so that I could do my job better.
And -- and it was one of these discussions

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.010
with a cosmologist in Berkeley where
I -- at the end of the discussion with him

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.140
I mentioned to him that I would like
to write about telescopes on mountain tops

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.409
and he planted the seed in my head
saying that, oh, you don't have to stop at

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.519
mountain tops. You can literally go
to the extremes, uh, of this planet where

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.299
there are other experiments that are
also, uh, important for physics and cosmology

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.260
if not more important and that
sort of set the whole thing in motion. And

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.569
I realized I could tell the story of
what's happening in physics and cosmology

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.749
but through the eyes of a traveler
who's going around to these various places

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.819
and talking about experiments rather
than the theory. I mean, the theory is very

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.810
integral to the book. It -- it
makes its presence felt all over the book

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.140
but the heart of the book is really
about the experiments that are, uh, going

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.719
to be necessary, uh, to start sort of
answering some of the very big questions in

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:10.010
physics. And I'll briefly mention
some of the big questions in physic as we

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.691
go along. So let me just move on
then. Uh, the first chapter -- the slides

00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:19.639
are -- that I'm presenting now,
they're organized in a narrative that is,

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.739
uh, as it is in the book. These
are -- these were -- this is not the sequence

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.969
in which I made the actual travels
but, uh, I think they work better if I stick

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:33.870
to the order that I used in the
book. So I started off in, uh, California

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.651
at the Mount Wilson Observatory near
Pasadena and, uh, this is where in the 19

00:03:40.651 --> 00:03:46.290
 -- early 1900s Edwin Hubble discovered
that the universe was expanding. So if you

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.000
think back to the early 1900s, our
conception of the universe was just the Milky

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.450
Way. We had really no idea of
whether there were any galaxies and if there

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.650
were -- if there was
anything else outside the Milky Way. And Hubble

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.029
was the first to really show
conclusively that not only were there are

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.989
galaxies outside the Milky Way but
also that they were moving away from us at

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:18.290
 -- in a very specific fashion. So,
uh, this was, for me, uh, a pilgrimage to

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.040
a very old and venerable telescope
just to see what it's like. So this is the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.880
view of the -- you see the dome of
the hundred-inch telescope. This is atop Mount

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.360
Wilson and you can see this from
Pasadena on a clear day. Uh, I should confess

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.980
this is not my picture because
the day I landed up in, uh, Pasadena, it was

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.830
completely cloudy and raining and I
couldn't see any of this from the outside.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.290
Umm, this is inside the dome. Uh,
this is the hundred-inch telescope that was

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.290
actually used by Hubble to, uh,
figure out the expansion of the universe.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.980
What Hubble managed to do was that he
figured out a relationship between, uh, the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.480
galaxies that are moving away from
us and the distance, uh, that they lie from

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.510
us and if you work backwards in time
using -- using this relationship, this mathematical

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.540
relationship that he came up
with between velocity and distance it became

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.071
very obvious that there must have
been a time in the past where all these galaxies

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:17.890
were at one point, they were
sort of speeding away from each other and,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.450
uh, and that was literally the thing
that laid the foundation for the Big Bang

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.000
Theory. Apart from Einstein's
Equations of General Relativity, uh, this

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.190
is where observational cosmology
began. Umm, I -- I just wanted to show you

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.250
this particular galaxy. It's called
the Sombrero Galaxy. Umm, it's a striking

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.680
picture and it is nothing like what
people like Hubble would have seen. This is

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.400
actually taken with a 4-meter glass
telescope in Chile. The reason I mention -- bring

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.530
this up is because even
before Hubble did his work, there was an astronomer

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.180
called, uh, Vesto Melvin
Slipher who, in the early 1900s in a -- using

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.590
a telescope in Arizona, uh, was
beginning to understand that these galaxies

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.110
were moving away from us. Umm, at
the time, these were not even called galaxies.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.510
We didn't know what they were.
They just looked like clouds in the sky -- they

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.670
were called nebulae -- and he
figured out that these nebulae were actually

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.500
receding and this particular one
was receding at about 1100-kilometers per

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.170
second and, uh, and when, umm, Slipher
mentioned this at a meeting of astronomers

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.861
in 1914, uh, everyone stood up and
clapped because they realized that they were

00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.150
hearing something very momentous
but it wasn't clear what. What Slipher hadn't

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.800
been able to do was figure out
the distance to these galaxies. He just knew

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.780
that they were moving away from us
and then Hubble came along and did much, much

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.180
 -- uh, many, many more
observations and with a much bigger telescope

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.640
at his disposal, he was the one
that figured out that these were moving away

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.740
from us, uh, and they were outside
the Milky Way. And so -- and this is just

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.930
to give credit to Slipher who often
goes unmentioned when we talk of discovery

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.410
of the expansion of the universe.
Umm, this, uh, is -- this was and still is

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.160
the living quarters of the
astronomers. Umm, it's called the monastery.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.500
George Hale, who founded the
observatory in the early 1900s, was fascinated

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.270
by monks and felt that his
astronomers should live like monks, uh, and,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.710
uh, avoid any distractions. So he
had a very sexist rule. He basically banned

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.870
women astronomers from coming and
working there because he thought that they

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.430
would be a distraction to the men.
Umm, and, uh, thankfully by 1950s that rule

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.800
was abolished and it's -- uh, some
very, uh, well-known women astronomers have

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.240
worked there since. Umm, the man
that you see was my guide. He's a 90-year-old

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.000
man who actually was uh, uh, was the
son of a staff astronomer at Mount Wilson

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.580
and he, umm, essentially hobnobed with
Hubble and so he was my living link to Hubble

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.970
which was quite -- quite a lovely
thing. Umm, he's 90 and he still comes up

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:08.470
almost every day as a volunteer guide
to show people around. Umm, and so let me

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:14.810
just back up here a bit. Uh, so what
happened was by the 1930s, uh, Los Angeles

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.970
was getting really big and, uh, light
pollution was beginning to be a factor and

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:24.840
this was -- this observatory is actually not
very far from, uh, the whole region. So George

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:30.400
Hale who built this one, uh,
figured that he needed to build a bigger telescope

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.389
somewhere further inland and
he moved to a place called Mount Palomar,

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:39.089
uh, which is a much higher mountain
and in a much darker region with far less

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:45.080
li -- light pollution at that time --
it's already polluted now. But one of the

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.470
things that happened in mount Palomar
in the 1930s was there was an astronomer -- a

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.459
Bulgarian-born astronomer called
Fritz Zuicki who started studying a cluster

00:08:54.459 --> 00:09:00.189
of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and
he was looking at the speed at which these

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:04.740
galaxies were moving around in the
cluster and those speeds are indicative of

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.589
how much mass there is in the
cluster. So the speeds can tell you, uh, the

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:13.339
gravity of the cluster that's
holding these galaxies together and he figured

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:18.040
out that, uh, just by looking at
these galaxies that there must be much more

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.860
matter in -- in the galaxy cluster
than was visible. So that was the beginnings

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.730
of our understanding that in the
universe there is something else apart from

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.680
normal matter. Normal matter being
the matter that we are used to made of electrons,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.480
protons, neutrons, and the
like, uh, and he figured that there was some

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.240
other kind of matter, something
else that was providing the enormous gravity

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.490
for these clusters that was holding
up -- holding these galaxies together. This

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.279
was 1930s, late 1930s and he, uh, -- no one
really paid attention to it because it was

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:55.720
a fairly outrageous
claim for its time but then, umm, then by

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.399
the 1960s people started actually
making observations of nearby galaxies and

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:04.259
started realizing that indeed what
Zuicki had come up with was actually true

00:10:04.259 --> 00:10:11.819
 -- and that, uh, unseen, uh, aspect of
the universe we now call "dark matter."

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:18.060
And my next trip was to an underground
mine in northern Minnesota to see an experiment

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.820
that is actually trying to detect
dark matter. The reason why it's called "The

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.430
Experiment That Detects Nothing"
is, uh, not to demean the experiment but it's

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.499
basically -- the idea of the
experiment is that it should be built in a

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:37.930
way where all the noise that is
present on earth, from cosmic rays, from ambient

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:43.050
radioactivity, all sorts of
things -- should be excluded from the experiment.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.939
In the sense that you should be able to filter
out everything that could possibly create

00:10:46.939 --> 00:10:52.300
a false signal so that it detects
nothing from the environment and at that point

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.750
if you do see a signal, it will
most likely be a dark matter particle and

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:00.980
I'll talk a little bit more about
that. So the reason why it's inside a mine

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.920
is also because you have to protect
yourself from all the sort of environmental

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.389
noise on the surface. So, umm, and
before I show you slides of the mine itself,

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:16.760
uh, this -- in the 1960s, this is
the Andromeda Galaxy. This was, uh, a galaxy

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.709
that was studied by an astronomer
called Vera Rubin. She's in her 80s now, umm,

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:25.870
and, uh, I went to see her
personally and she was quite amazing. She

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:30.740
talked about this galaxy as if she
was observing it just yesterday and, uh, one

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.779
of the things she figured out was
if you look at the -- if you look at the galaxy

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:38.161
you'll see that there are a
whole host of stars in the very center can

00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:42.620
as you go further and further away it
gets sort of thinner but there are stars all

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.399
the way to the very edge and if you
just apply simple sort of Kepler's laws and

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:52.619
Newton's laws to -- to the motion of
the stars in this galaxy, uh, what should

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:57.680
happen is that the -- the stars at the
very center should be moving really fast and

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.699
as you move away, further to the
periphery of the galaxy, the stars should

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:06.240
start slowing down. It's just like in
our solar system you have Mercury moving very

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.749
rapidly around the sun and as
you move further away all the way to Pluto,

00:12:09.749 --> 00:12:13.579
Pluto actually moves at a very
leisurely pace. That's just simple Newtonian

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:19.069
physics, uh, when she observed the
velocities of these stars, uh, all the way

00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:22.059
to the very edge -- in fact she
went -- they had a good enough instrument

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:26.310
where they can go beyond the visible
edge of the galaxy and just looked at ionized

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.449
hydrogen so the hydrogen was part
of the galaxy and they found that everything

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:34.700
was moving at almost the same
speed, that there was no falloff in the speed

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.009
of these stars as you moved away
from the center. Something was wrong and again

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:44.180
the only explanation is that
there is some matter in this galaxy -- and

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.430
indeed in all galaxies -- that
outweighs the matter that you see almost ten

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.089
to one and that's providing the
gravity that is holding these stars together.

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.889
If that wasn't there, the stars
at the very edge would just fly off and they

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:01.110
wouldn't be there. The galaxy
couldn't be held together. So this was the

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.389
first serious piece of evidence,
observational evidence that -- that the universe

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:11.610
is made of a different kind of
matter, or at least has a predominant component

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:18.309
that is dark matter. And, uh,
so -- so -- this was a trip to the mine. It's

00:13:18.309 --> 00:13:23.040
about four hours' drive from
Minneapolis and as luck would have it I chose,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.350
uh -- I actually flew from San
Francisco to Minneapolis and, uh, it was very

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.350
sunny in Minneapolis and I
landed -- it was very sunny in San Francisco.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.770
I landed in Minneapolis it turned
out there was a blizzard on the way so I literally

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:39.259
had to race north, leaving
the blizzard behind which all added to the

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:44.119
drama, helped in writing the book.
Umm, so this is the head frame of the mine.

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:49.319
This mine is an abandoned iron
mine. It was built in the nine -- 1880s and

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:54.410
it lasted until the 1960s and it
was a very, very good iron ore mine for the

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:59.790
U.S. It was one of America's
premier iron ore mines and, uh, once it was

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.629
abandoned, uh, when it became too
expensive to mine it, it was closed but then

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:07.810
physicists discovered it about two
decades ago and they started building an underground

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.860
laboratory essentially for
experiments which needed to be shielded by

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.790
cosmic rays on the surface of the
earth you go underground. So in this case

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:19.720
you go about a half a mile
underground, uh, using just this shaft. That's

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.740
all there is. It's a -- a cage
that's been operating since when the mine

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:29.369
was functioning. And it takes three
minutes in complete darkness and it's a rattling

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:33.240
ride. I'm -- I have to
confess, I was more than a little scared.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.100
Uh, and, uh, and you come down to the
bottom, the cage opens, and this is the sign

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:46.360
that you see: 2,300 feet below the
surface. And as you look to your left, as

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.410
soon as you get out of the of the
cage is this thing called a "drift tunnel."

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.980
The drift tunnel was the tunnel
that was dug in order to get the ore from

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.009
sort of where the seams were and we
took a ride. This is a 3-quarter mile-long

00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:04.699
tunnel and you go -- go in all the
way and now there are lights but at that time

00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:08.990
they would have been working
without all these, uh, electric lights. And

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.519
you can see these gigantic caverns
that have been left behind by the miners.

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:17.699
The caverns are -- they can have
ceilings up to a hundred feet high, even more

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:23.579
and, uh, so this is inside one of
the caverns. Our guide, umm, lit up this candle

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:28.910
 -- shut off all the lights and
lit up this candle just to show the kind of

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.709
light that the people -- the miners
had to work with. This was it. This was the

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:37.589
light with which they worked with
decades on end. And then I told you as you

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:41.790
turn left you go into the drift and
into the caverns. If you turn right, you see

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:48.860
this. And, uh, it's an
extraordinary laboratory. It's called the

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.529
Sudan Underground Laboratory and
there are two massive caverns that are in

00:15:53.529 --> 00:16:00.519
there. And you have to imagine, there
are tens of thousands of tons of material

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:05.589
there. Each of those -- every piece
has to be brought down in literally cage-size

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:09.149
pieces, piece by piece. So even
the design of the experiment has to be done

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:11.610
so that you can actually dismantle it, put
it

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.910
in that cage, bring it down and -- and assemble
it underground. And that

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.470
particular experiment that you see at the
far end is a neutrino detector, which

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.399
is not what I went to see there, but, uh,
it's -- it's quite an experience being

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:31.529
down there. Umm, so this is, uh, uh, the two,
uh, people who are showing me

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:35.889
around, uh, one of the lab technicians and
a physicist. We're about to step

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:40.220
into the so-called radio frequency room. That's
a room that has been

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.529
electromagnetically isolated from everything
else and that's where the dark

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:49.800
matter detector is placed and you can see
that we are dressing up as if we're

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.040
going into a clean room. In fact, it's worse
than going into a clean room.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.080
Even ambient radioactivity, your bodies are
radioactive enough that the detector

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:05.120
will pick it up. And so, uh, the detector
itself is shielded in, umm, uh, you

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.530
know, inches thick of lead and lead itself
has a radioactive isotope, lead 210,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.690
which decays, so in order to protect that,
uh, sort of decaying lead from the

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.679
detector they have another layer of lead which
was salvaged from ships that had

00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:24.549
sunk off the coast of Europe in -- about 200
years ago. So most of that lead,

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:29.070
that is old lead, the radioactive isotopes
have decayed and they use that to

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.142
shield the experiment from the new lead and
so on and so forth. It's, uh, it's

00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:37.190
a staggering thing. And my tape recorder,
my camera, anything that we were -- I

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.970
was taking had to be wiped clean with alcohol
because even fingerprints -- when

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:47.019
you sweat, there's radioactive elements in
your sweat and if it shows up your

00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:50.820
fingerprint, the detector will pick it up.
So you can imagine how sensitive

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.269
this detector is. So that's essentially what
they're building, something that

00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:59.970
detects nothing. The detectors are, umm, silicones
of -- I mean, crystals of

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.960
germanium and, uh, silicon, they're hockey
puck-sized crystals that are put

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.390
inside this copper tube. This copper tube
is ultra pure. Uh, it's, uh, oh.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.830
Lots of stories about how everything has to
be pure enough that no amount of --

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.360
they are essentially trying to negate any
radioactivity in the vicinity -- this

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.559
thing is then cooled down to near absolute
zero and then shielded with all the

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:29.909
layers of lead and stuff to prevent, uh, environmental
noise. And the idea here

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:34.980
is that dark matter is something that is supposedly
filling up our galaxy.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:40.250
This, like I said, ten -- ten times more matter
in the galaxy that is made of

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.160
dark matter than normal matter. So what that
mean is, earth, as it's moving

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.440
around in the solar system and the solar system
is moving through the periphery

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.460
of the galaxy we are plowing through a sea
of these dark matter particles and

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.279
the hope is that -- and by definition, dark
matter does not interact with normal

00:18:57.279 --> 00:19:01.179
matter which is why we don't see it. We can
only discern its gravitational

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:05.590
influence. Umm, but there is a way in which
you can detective if indeed it's

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:11.659
made of dark matter particles and that is
if a particle were to hit the nucleus

00:19:11.659 --> 00:19:18.260
of say a germanium crystal, or a germanium
atom or a silicon atom. Now, uh,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.019
so these detectors are cooled down to absolute
zero and they're hoping that when

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:26.630
one of these particles hit their germanium
crystal or, uh, silicon crystal, it's

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.230
going to raise the temperature of that crystal
by a few micro Kelvin or it's

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.850
going to induce vibrations in the la -- crystal
lattice and you can imagine how

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.621
sensitive that experiment has to be. So it's
cooled down to near absolute zero,

00:19:38.621 --> 00:19:41.760
shielded by all these things, and that's what
they're doing. They're watching

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.130
for an impact from a dark matter particle.
It's been going on for years and

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:51.670
they haven't seen any yet. Umm, and it's -- but
the experiments are getting

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.200
bigger and more sensitive. So there's hope
that maybe this year or the next

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.500
year something might pop out. I don't know
if you know, but in December there

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:05.419
was a bit of a fuss about this particular
experiment having detected two events.

00:20:05.419 --> 00:20:10.040
About -- after they had done all their exclusions
of environmental noise and all

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.659
the statistical cuts that they need to do,
they were left with two events that

00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:17.620
they couldn't explain and they think it was
dark matter but it's not

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.460
statistically significant enough. There's
a one in four chance that it is still

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.320
noise and for particle physics that's an absolute
no-no. So no one claimed

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.250
discovery but at the same time there was considerable
excitement because it's

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.700
the closest they've come to actually seeing
anything. Now, this experiment is

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.179
trying to do what is called "direct detection"
of dark matter. There are other

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:43.910
ways in which you can detect dark matter and
the other obvious way is indirect

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.570
detection. So if our galaxy is filled with
these dark matter particles, they

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:53.360
will, umm, assemble in regions of high gravity.
So at the center of the Milky Way

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.410
there is a super massive black hole and, uh,
the gravity obviously is really

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.480
high out there and dark matter particles tend
to accumulate there and when they

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.880
are accumulated in very great numbers they
will collide with each other and the

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.340
properties of the particles, theoretically,
are supposed to be such that if they

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.470
collide they will annihilate and create other
particles that we can observe.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.880
And, uh, so there are experiments that are
looking for these -- these secondary

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.440
particles that should be coming out of dark
matter interactions. And I went to

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.419
see another experiment -- this was in Siberia.
They have something called a

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:31.130
Lake Baikal neutrino telescope. Uh, neutrinos
are subatomic particles that are

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.269
very much like dark matters in the sense that
they absolutely do not interact with

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:39.450
normal matter in the way that you would think.
Uh, they -- if you stacked up a

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:45.000
light year of lead, one light year, umm, thick
stack of lead and you fired a

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.320
low-energy neutrino at it it'll probably go
right through it. Uh, so it's --

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.269
it -- you know, the interactions are so, so
little. But neutrinos are real

00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:57.440
particles. We know that they exist, we've
collected them in copious numbers so

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.950
they're not sort of hypothetical particles
like dark matter particles. And if

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.970
dark matter is annihilating at the center
of the galaxy, one of the things it

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.310
should be doing is spewing out neutrinos.
And so these neutrino telescopes are

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.720
looking for this signal and, uh, the way you
would do it, because these

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.440
neutrinos attract so faintly or feebly with
matter, what you need to do is

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:26.030
essentially watch a very gigantic volume of
some detection material. So then

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.870
you have a statistical chance of sort of catching
one of these neutrinos. Uh,

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.389
so if a neutrino were to hit water or ice,
it emits a blue light, something

00:22:35.389 --> 00:22:39.110
called a Cerenkov light, and the idea is if
you can watch for this light, then

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.330
you can reinstruct the energy of the neutrino,
where it came from, and things

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.830
like that. Where do you find such a big volume
of water? Well, lake Baikal in

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.340
Siberia is one such place. It's a lake that's
800-kilometers long, about 40,

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:57.169
50-kilometers wide, if not wider, it's more
than a mile deep, and it's

00:22:57.169 --> 00:23:00.549
absolutely clear water. It's one of the most
pristine lakes that you will find

00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:08.520
in the world. And, uh, so that's where I went
to see -- umm, that's the, uh,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.621
view of lake Baikal from the coast of the,
uh, from the coast where the

00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:18.140
experiment, uh, offices were situated. Offices
is a very loose term. I'll show

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:24.980
you why. Umm, and you'll notice that this
is a frozen lake, umm, and when I

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.500
called up the scientists saying, can I come
and visit you? They said, of course

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.340
you can but you have to come in winter. Uh,
and, uh, this was Siberia in peak

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.740
winter. And the reason why they do this is
that the detectors are essentially

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.970
things called photo-multiplier tubes. Now,
photo-multiplier tubes are -- you

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.929
can think of them as the opposite of television
tubes. So in television tube

00:23:43.929 --> 00:23:48.039
you supply electricity and you get out photons.
In a photo-multiplier tube,

00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:52.340
if -- if it detects photons, it gives you
an electrical signal. That's all --

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.950
in very basic terms that's what they are.
So they've got these giant spheres of

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.990
photo-multiplier tubes that have been submerged
about one kilometer deep into

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:04.270
the lake and they're essentially watching
for a neutrino coming to hit a

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:09.460
molecule of water and trying to look for that
blue light. There are about 228

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.480
of these, uh, uh, photo-multiplier tubes deep
inside the lake. If you are

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.520
working, uh, in summer, or autumn, or something
like that, when the lake is not

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.400
frozen, you would need ships and you would
need submersibles to go down and wire

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.360
these things. The Russians, unfortunately,
have been working on a very tight

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.399
budget, especially after the fall of the Soviet
Union the moneys that have come

00:24:30.399 --> 00:24:34.899
into them are very little. So they work in
winter. They wait for the lake to

00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:39.960
completely freeze over and then they use the
lake's surface as a platform. They

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.539
set up their ice camp on top of the ice, they
cut holes in the ice, they know

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:47.370
where their detectors are under the water
 -- they cut holes in the ice and then

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.179
essentially get their cranes and wrenches
and get the instruments out. They

00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:54.980
have two months to do their work. Any repairing,
any maintenance has to be done

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.769
and then they have to get out before the ice
melts. So it's a pretty amazing

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:02.769
operation. This particular picture, the -- the
line of black darts that you're

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:07.899
seeing is the ice camp and we're about 4-kilometers
from -- from the ice camp on

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:13.080
the near shore. The -- the far shore is 40-kilometers
away and you can -- you

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.821
can imagine the size of those mountains. That's
40-kilometers away. This is a

00:25:16.821 --> 00:25:23.009
picture of, uh, the Russians and some German
physicists working on the ice. And

00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:28.140
I still can't believe that one guy. Uh, I
remember being shocked by him. Umm, he

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.279
was working bear-chested all day long can
those are sub -- you're standing on

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:36.830
ice, one-meter thick ice, uh, and you can
see the buoys that have been pulled

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:41.029
out. These buoys are the ones that are the
very top of the detector. So every

00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:45.460
winter they go there, cut a hole in the ice,
a diver dives in, into fridged

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.919
waters and essentially locates the buoy and
gets it out and using that they haul

00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:55.040
out the so-called string of photo-multiplier
tubes. These -- they're just long

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.970
strings which are all the way sort of 1 kilometer
underwater. And, uh, this is

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.120
a picture of what the photo-multiplier tubes
look like. So, uh, pairs of these

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.840
are essentially strung down into the water.
And, uh, just a scene of how the

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.820
lake looks there. This is the old Trans-Siberian
railway which goes along that

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.350
section of the lake. It's not used by the
Trans-Siberian railway anymore. Uh,

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:24.289
local trains trundle past once a day and they
are the ones that bring in

00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:28.820
supplies. Uh, and the old railway buildings
are the ones being used by the

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.200
scientists for their living quarters. So when
I said "offices" that's what I

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.769
meant. This is one of their office buildings.
It's probably a hundred-year-old

00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:43.990
railway building that's been converted into
their control room. Umm, very, very

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:48.220
basic, uh, umm, living conditions because
they're working on extremely little

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.630
money. You can imagine $20 million spent over
20 years. Uh, this kind of

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.550
science experiment if it's being done in Europe
or America -- and there are

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.059
experiments like this being done -- they will
have already spent about

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:03.920
300 million in a few years and these guys
have spent 20 million in 20

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:08.330
years. And they are a pioneering telescope.
They were the first to detect

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:13.799
certain kinds of neutrinos using a natural
body of water. Umm, this is our

00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:17.740
drinking water. Every morning we would go
to the lake shore, dig a hole in the

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.510
ice, get the Lake Baikal water into a bucket
and so you can imagine it was a

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:26.500
lovely experience, a fairly rough experience,
uh, but then that's what they do

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:32.330
every year. Uh, I was quite, uh, in awe of
their abilities in terms of enduring

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:39.840
this cold. Umm, so on the very last day, uh,
I was, uh, told by my German

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.289
physicist host that since I'd come there for
an adventure I should go sleep on

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:48.580
the lake at night, until then I was sleeping
on the shore and, uh, I thought,

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.889
well, that sounds very good. Uh, and then
he mentioned that be prepared at

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:56.539
the -- in the middle of the night to literally
jump out of his sleeping bag and

00:27:56.539 --> 00:28:00.430
if you're in your underwear to just run out
on the ice in your underwear. I was

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.809
really shocked. I didn't know what he meant.
He said that the ice actually

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:08.379
moves. It heaves, uh, and at daytime you don't
notice it because you're working

00:28:08.379 --> 00:28:12.600
but if you're sleeping and then you start
thinking about it. There's a mile of

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.700
water underneath and this is a massive lake.
It's not a lake, it's a sea and

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.669
there are waves and -- and the ice is constantly
heaving and it's very, very

00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:24.929
frightening apparently and as if that wasn't
enough he also told me, well, and

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:26.490
there are earthquakes out here.
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.919
Anil: And, uh, so by then I was not ready
to go. I -- I really was getting

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:36.500
frightened and I didn't want to go and sleep
on the ice. But a lot of things

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.900
had been set in motion by then and some -- some
person had given up his bed and

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.919
he'd gone to sleep where else. So I made it
there and there was a graduate

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:47.980
student in one of those cabins who was sharing
the cabin with me and he welcomes

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.360
me by saying, oh, don't worry. There are earthquakes
here all the time. As if

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.370
that was meant to reassure me that nothing
happens and, uh, didn't. And so I

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.470
laid out on the bed and the first thing that
caught my attention was the sounds.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:07.440
There were these gunshot-like sounds, whips
cracking or doors getting shut and it

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.129
was the ice cracking. So it was -- the ice
is constantly moving and cracking

00:29:11.129 --> 00:29:16.100
underneath you. There's a mile of water underneath
and by then I was absolutely

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.299
frightened. So I asked him, so, you know,
how do you -- how do you manage to

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:22.720
sleep? He said, oh, as long as there are sounds
you don't have to worry. All

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.240
that means is the ice is just protesting.
It's when the sounds are -- have

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.289
gone, that means the cracks have opened up
long -- large enough that there is no

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:34.560
sound anymore, that's when you need to get
out of here. So suddenly, uh --

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.909
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
Anil: So suddenly the sounds were like a lullaby.

00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:45.390
I actually slept very
peacefully. So anyway, this was an amazing

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.390
experiment.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.659
Uh, from there on to see
the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the "Very

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:58.911
Large Telescope". Very, very
interesting named one. Astronomers, uh, when

00:29:58.911 --> 00:30:02.500
it comes to naming telescopes
seems -- seem to have great imaginations.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.000
Umm, the next one -- the next one in the
line is called the "Extremely Large Telescope".

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.720
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
Anil: And apparently there's one more in the

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.049
works which is going to be called
the "Overwhelmingly Large Telescope" so, uh

00:30:13.049 --> 00:30:14.049
 --
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:17.919
Anil: But reason I went to Chile is because,
uh, the Atacama -- this is flying

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:21.720
into Santiago, the Andes in the background,
from there to a town called

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.680
Antofagasta and then two-hour drive to, uh,
into the Atacama Desert, a pretty

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.290
high place called Mount Paranal, which is
at 9,000 feet. So this is just the

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:36.230
road trip and that's how the landscape looks.
It's just absolutely dry. Uh,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.779
the Atacama Desert is pretty much the driest
place on earth. They have in some

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:43.320
of these regions, especially near where the
telescope is, it hasn't rained for

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.940
decades. There's not a blade of grass, no
sign of life, uh, NASA uses this

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.080
region to -- to do their tests on their Mars
rovers and that's where they're

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.340
building telescopes and you -- you might wonder
why. Well, partly because it's

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:01.129
dry. Water vapor is a terrible thing for telescopes
because, uh, water vapor

00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:05.360
in the atmosphere absorbs light and so you
can imagine light coming to us from

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.730
a galaxy, say, a billion light years away.
So it's traveled billions of years,

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:14.340
and then in the last segment of its trip about
a few kilometers of the

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.159
atmosphere can ruin that light. So the water
vapor can absorb it or the

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:23.170
turbulent layers of the atmosphere can smudge
the light. So essentially what

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:27.450
astronomers constantly try to do is get to
very, very dry regions and also to

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.850
get high about the lower layers of the atmosphere
which is why you find them --

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.340
find them on mountain tops. There are other
climactic regions that are useful.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.830
On the -- on the -- on the shore of Chile,
the coast of Chile which is not very

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.009
far from this place, there's a low -- there's
a cold current called the Humboldt

00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:47.999
Current that flows north along the coast and
that current pulls down the clouds.

00:31:47.999 --> 00:31:51.440
Uh, so there's an inversion layer of clouds
that's created. So when you're

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.629
standing up on the mountain top you don't
see clouds on the top, you see clouds

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:58.639
down below you. And so essentially leaves
the mountain top with about 300 days

00:31:58.639 --> 00:32:03.080
of clear skies. Absolutely cloudless skies.
So imagine you're flying an

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.809
airplane at 40,000 feet and you look down
and you see clouds. Well, that's what

00:32:06.809 --> 00:32:10.879
you see here except the clouds are down at
6,000 feet and the summit of the

00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:15.470
mountain is above that. In that dry region
the astronomers have sort of built a

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:21.679
residence where they stay. It's a subterranean.
Part of it is underground and

00:32:21.679 --> 00:32:27.029
when you step inside this is what you see.
It's one of the most amazing little,

00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:31.290
uh, places. It's very, very humid. They've
managed to sort of put a swimming

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.919
pool in there to keep it humid, uh, because
if you're going to be working there

00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:40.210
for weeks, months on end you need the humidity
so this is the place where they

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:45.389
stay and right outside is -- that's the mountain
on which the telescopes have

00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:50.629
been built. You can barely see the domes at
the top and these are the four, uh,

00:32:50.629 --> 00:32:54.519
telescopes, uh, call -- that make up the Very
Large Telescope. So each

00:32:54.519 --> 00:33:01.680
telescope is 8.2-meter primary mirror and
at the time that they were built --

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.809
and even now -- they're -- they're among the
largest, uh, telescopes in

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:10.490
existence and especially four in such close
proximity. There's nowhere else on

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:15.690
earth you'll find these such telescopes. Umm,
you -- you might recall the, umm,

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:21.970
uh, earthquake in Chile recently and you will
wonder why they would build such

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:27.090
fancy equipment in, uh, in places like Chile.
Well, obviously the skies are

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:30.360
wonderful which is why they want to build
them but at the same time you have to

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.460
deal with earthquakes. And this mirror -- this
is one of the mirrors of the

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.879
VLT -- you can see that shiny bit, that's
8.2 meters across and it's 18

00:33:39.879 --> 00:33:45.279
centimeters thick and the whole thing weighs,
just the mirror, weighs about 23 tons.

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:50.779
And it's so heavy and, uh, relatively thin
compared to its diameter that as the

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:55.460
telescope is moving, uh, sort of from zenith
to our horizon and back and forth

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.889
the mirror is going to warp a bit because
the gravitational force is moving on a

00:33:58.889 --> 00:34:03.870
change as it, uh, it changes orientation.
And that's enough to change the shape

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:08.360
of the mirror enough to mess up your observations.
So actually underneath the

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.079
mirror there are about a 150 pistons that
are constantly pulling and pushing at

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:17.040
the mirror to keep it in shape. So essentially
the mirror is not anchored.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.659
It -- it's floating on these pistons so if
an earthquake were going to happen it

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:24.309
would just rattle around and break, you know?
There's no -- nothing holding it.

00:34:24.309 --> 00:34:28.200
But the amazing thing is that you can't see
it very clearly in this picture but

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.929
there are clamps all the way around the periphery
of the mirror and the moment

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:36.300
they sense a tremor, these clamps hold on
to the mirror, 23 tons of it, and just

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.800
lift it right off the supports and just anchor
it to the superstructure. And

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.900
then the superstructure is designed to just
sway with the earthquake. So the

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:48.080
idea then is that the mirror is not going
to rattle around and it's just going

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.289
to, you know, if the earthquake is not severe
 -- if it's severe enough to damage

00:34:53.289 --> 00:34:57.619
the superstructure that's another thing but
for most earthquakes this will work

00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:03.069
and it has worked in the past. Umm, let me
just, uh -- so the reason I went to

00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:10.270
see the VLT was to understand. I mentioned
dark matter. We don't understand what,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.690
about 90 percent of the matter in the universe
is made of, but about a

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:19.740
decade ago astronomers were looking at, uh,
what I call the supernovae, type one

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.950
supernovae which are just stars that are dying
and they were using these stars

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:29.670
to figure out how the expansion of the universe
has changed over time. You

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:34.000
know, Hubble found out that the universe is
expanding, uh, since the Big Bang

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.810
and then the -- the expectation among, uh,
physicists was that this expansion

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:42.441
should now be slowing down because the gravity
of the matter in the universe

00:35:42.441 --> 00:35:46.880
should be, uh, starting to pull back the universe
in a sense. So if you were to

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.990
observe how the expanse -- expansion rate
is progressing in the recent past, say

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.700
the last few billion years, the idea was that
this expansion rate should be

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.200
slowing down and they found exactly the opposite,
that in the last, uh, few

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.130
billion years the expansion of the universe
instead of slowing down is actually

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:07.900
speeding up. Something is blowing apart the
universe and that something turns

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:14.020
out is the energy of space time itself, that
the vacuum of space, meaning

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.820
everything. This, where we are standing, this
is also vacuum of space. You

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:23.470
know, in between galaxies. Essentially all
of the universe is contained in this

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:29.059
vacuum of space and that fabric of space time
has some energy and when they

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:32.270
total up how much energy that is, it turns
out to be about 3-quarters of the

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:38.710
matter and energy in the universe. So this
pie chart -- now I can show this

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:45.540
happily to a technology crowd without getting
gasps. But, uh, that's our view

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.470
of the universe now. We have dark energy which
is 73 percent, we have dark

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:54.660
matter which is about 23 percent, and normal
matter 4 percent. So all our

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.690
theories so far in physics, theories that
have been verified and confirmed in

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:04.990
experiments can only be vouched for 4 percent
of the matter. The rest of the

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.580
universe, 96 percent of the universe, is a
mystery. Mystery of source. We have

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.119
theories but really we have no experimental
evidence to tell us what dark matter

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:16.350
is, we don't really understand dark energy.
There are many outstanding

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.270
questions about where this, uh, energy of
the fabric of space time comes from,

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.140
has it changed over time, you know, how will
it effect the universe in the

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.910
future, things like that and we really don't
know. So the whole point of this

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:32.810
book was to basically visit various experiments
that are going to start answering these

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.569
questions. And so the big questions, what
is dark matter, what is dark

00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:42.470
energy? Uh, I've just spoken about that. The
other two big things is, uh,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:47.579
reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein's
General Relativity. And quantum

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:50.920
mechanics we know works really well. It's
been verified endlessly by

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.160
experiments but it works at things at the
microscopic level and Einstein's

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.480
General theory of relativity same thing. It's
been verified really well but

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.800
it's a theory of gravity on cosmological scales,
so for large distances. There

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.640
are situations in physics where these two
things have to be combined. Take the

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.750
Big Bang. Uh, the Big Bang the universe was
supposed to be smaller than a

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:16.619
proton if you can imagine that and -- but
at the same time all of the energy of

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:21.619
the universe was compressed in a tiny volume
so it had extremes of gravity. So

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:26.079
you need Einstein's relativity to deal with
gravity but you need quantum

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:29.610
mechanics to deal with the microscopic volumes
and, uh, when you put these two

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.650
together, they don't work. So you have two
pillars of modern physics,

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:37.119
relativity and quantum mechanics, that work
beautifully on their own but

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:40.570
whenever you need to bring them together they
don't. And so there is this

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.150
question to find this theory of what's called
quantum gravity so I talk about

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.530
that in the book. And then there's the physics
beyond the standard model. I --

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.150
I talked about how 4 percent of the universe
can be explained. Well, most of

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.760
that can be explained by this thing called
the standard model of particle

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:58.210
physics which is essentially a theory of all
of the particles of matter,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.200
electrons, protons, neutrons, all of that,
and the forces that act upon them,

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.691
all except gravity and it's a very well-tested,
uh, theory, the standard model

00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:11.760
of particle physics and we know there has
to be things beyond that because

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.390
standard model cannot explain dark matter
for instance, it doesn't have much to

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:19.190
say about dark energy, it cannot reconcile
quantum mechanics with relativity.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.400
So we know that there is physics beyond it.
So again the experiments are

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.810
beginning to provide us clues about that.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:32.619
Jesse: So we can go onto yet another chapter
or we can leave that for those who

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:35.280
still need to buy the book or those who have
already got it. I was wondering if

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.228
you wanted to open it up for Q and A for a
little bit. We have about ten to 15

00:39:38.228 --> 00:39:40.360
minutes left.
Dr. Carlson: I'll quickly run through probably,

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.470
uh, Antarctica a little bit.
Jesse: Sure.

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.000
Anil: So people -- just a quick run through.
Jesse: Sounds good.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.569
Anil: So one of the most extreme places I
went to was Antarctica. This

00:39:49.569 --> 00:39:57.380
is flying from New Zealand to, umm, to McMurdo
station in Antarctica, the U.S.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.910
base. This is the first sighting of the Antarctic
 -- the southern ocean of

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:05.630
Antarctica and the ice flows. This is landing
in Antarctica. Uh, that's the

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.579
plane. Uh, we landed on the Ross Ice Shelf.
You can imagine that plane. It's

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:15.490
a B-17. It lands on the ice shelf, this is
the Ross Ice Shelf which is about

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.730
200 feet thick. It's about the size of France
and, uh, that is summer.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.890
&gt;&gt; [Pause]
Anil: And, uh, we're -- we were taken on a

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:30.810
bus to the station and the bus was
called Ivan the Terebus. Very nice bus. And,

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:35.900
uh, you -- this is just a view
from the American, uh, base. Those are the

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.720
Trans-Antarctic mountains in the
back and in the foreground you can see a hut.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.440
I don't know if it's clear to you
but there is a small hut here. That's a hut

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.470
that was built in 1902 by Robert
Scott in his men when they first landed in

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:50.231
Antarctica and you can go into the
hut and you can still see things like that

00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:53.900
last meal that was being cooked
and -- and the clothes that they wear that

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.640
have been left behind, the biscuit
tins they brought with them from England on

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.220
their ship. Umm, it's so cold that
nothing has gone bad. Even the seal meat that

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.450
they used -- the seal that they
killed is lying outside you could probably

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:10.500
still eat it. Umm, this is a view of
the American base from a hill just next to

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.200
it called Observation Hill and it --
it actually resembles a little mining town.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.049
It's often been said that it
reminds people of -- I haven't been to Montana

00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:22.490
or Wyoming but apparently there
are mining towns that look like that. Uh,

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.670
just more views. There's a volcano
right next to McMurdo called Mount Erebus.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.440
This is the highest volcano --
active volcano in the southern hemisphere,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:36.580
umm, or it's the southern most active
volcano. It's 13,000 feet high and it's active.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.069
It's spewing out, you know,
gas and smoke and all that but there are glaciers

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:44.190
on the top. So you can
imagine what kinds of extremes of, uh, nature

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:47.910
exist in Antarctica. Umm, at the
very top of that hill from where I took these

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.450
pictures is a cross to
commemorate -- I mean, this is in memory of

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:55.490
Robert Scott and his men. In 1911
and 12 they actually made it to the South

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.250
Pole but on their way back they --
they basically couldn't make it back to McMurdo

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:03.450
and they died about -- in their
tents about a 150 miles away so this cross

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:08.180
is in memory of that. I was there to
watch the launch of, uh, an experiment into

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.560
the stratosphere. Umm, this is a --
an experiment that is trying to look for antimatter.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.970
One of the big questions
in cosmology and physics is, where did all

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.570
the antimatter go? The universe,
when it began matter and antimatter should

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.109
have been produced in equal
quantities and ideally they should have just

00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:27.109
annihilated each other and all we
should have been left with is energy except

00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:31.410
we have a universe made of
ostensibly matter. So some -- there are theories

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.580
that there might be galaxies
of antimatter out there and this experiment

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.280
was looking for one. And, uh, it is
launched using something called a long-duration

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.900
balloon. This is the balloon
fabric being laid out on the ice shelf, uh,

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:50.270
and at the very far end, uh, you'll
see two trucks. They -- they have 12 cylinders

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:55.330
each of very, very highly
compressed helium. Umm, and the balloon is

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:59.240
being filled up with helium. It
takes about an hour to fill it up and the

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.829
helium, in the cold of Antarctica, is
compressed. It doesn't expand to its true

00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:07.299
volume. When the balloon actually
reaches the upper stratosphere, about 40-kilometers

00:43:07.299 --> 00:43:12.410
altitude, it, uh, it -- the
helium expands to 1 million cubic meters.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:15.869
1 million cubic meters. You can
imagine the size of that. The balloon is 400

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:20.290
feet across. It looks like half
the size of a full moon when you look from

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:24.670
the ground if you can see it on a
clear day, and you can. Umm, so this is the

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:29.760
balloon just getting filled. It's
an awesome sight and, uh, and that's pretty

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.530
much how the setup looks. And when
the helium has been filled they release the

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:38.359
balloon and it just takes off.
Takes about five hours to get to the upper

00:43:38.359 --> 00:43:40.660
stratosphere and in the upper
stratosphere it just goes around and around

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:45.900
the South Pole for two weeks, the
experiment does its thing, and then they detonate

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.770
an explosive, radio controlled
explosive, the balloon fabric flies away,

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:54.960
and the -- the payload parachutes down
on to the ice and recovering that is another

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.280
story. We won't go into that but,
uh, they have to do all sorts of things to

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.091
recover that. And then from there I
went to the South Pole but maybe we are out

00:44:03.091 --> 00:44:05.230
of time now. So happy to take
questions here.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.690
Jesse: First, let's give Anil a round of applause.
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:14.790
Jesse: So we'll go into a brief Q and A. Unfortunately
we have to be out of

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:16.799
that room in about eight minutes or so --
Anil: Sure.

00:44:16.799 --> 00:44:19.150
Jesse: But if I -- if people would like autographs
or questions afterwards I'm

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.490
sure he'll be willing to stick around. So
if you have questions, please come up

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:27.140
to the mic. I'll start off. You spoke briefly
about how it's a fairly

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:30.760
different type of physics book if for no other
reason because it's typically

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.641
someone involved in the experiment writing
about it and it's usually about a

00:44:33.641 --> 00:44:37.190
successful experiment and this is about experiments
that aren't failures but

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:42.240
they're certainly not, uh, solid successes
just yet per se. Umm, and you also

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.020
talked about physicists having -- almost being
as passionate about setting up

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.510
and executing the experiment as they are about
 -- about eventually finding

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.810
success in order to keep themselves going.
Anil: Yep.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:54.660
Jesse: So, you know, do you have any thoughts
about why you approached it in

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.349
this way and did the scientists have any thoughts
about how you were approaching

00:44:59.349 --> 00:45:03.030
it as well?
Anil: Well, the scientists I met were experimentalists

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.910
mostly. I mean, I did
meet theorists but they form a small section

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.240
of the book. So the
experimentalists were actually very, very

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.700
happy because they don't get exposure
normally. So all the physics books tend to

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:17.799
be about the theorists and the big
theories. So they were actually very pleased

00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:21.560
to be showing me around and
showing me these experiments. The reason why

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.640
I wanted to do it this way was just
because I -- I have a very soft spot for physics

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:31.329
and cosmology in a sense I
think it is one of the loveliest, uh, sciences

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:35.540
out there and has a profound
effect on me and I wanted to communicate that

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:41.520
to people, uh, who normally would
be, uh, put off by, you know, words like "particle

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.350
physics," or "theories", you
know, and stuff like that. And this was a

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:50.090
way in which to reach out to a far
greater number of people by actually talking

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:53.880
of the places and the people who do
these experiments. Umm, so that's in terms

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:59.079
of one angle for the book is just to
broaden the scope of how you tell the stories

00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:03.549
in physics. Uh, the other thing
also was to make a point that physics is actually

00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:07.589
in some sort of a crisis. As
we saw, 96 percent of the universe we haven't

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:15.410
a clue. And the only way these
theories are gonna get verified are from experimental

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:19.930
data and we have a very,
very big shortage of good experimental data

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:23.849
at this point and so this was a way
of saying that this is the next generation

00:46:23.849 --> 00:46:26.549
of experiments that are going to
hopefully lead us towards new physics.

00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:35.280
&gt;&gt; [Pause]Well, I've got a few questions.
Please come to the mic, though, so we

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.680
can hear.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.850
&gt;&gt; Relatively simple question. How did these
get funded?

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:45.820
Anil: Depends. Uh, different agencies like
the South Pole stuff gets funded by

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.200
the NSF mostly. Uh, in fact most of the science
in the South Pole is funded by

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.589
the NSF. The balloon experiments, NASA has
a big say in it, uh, so the balloons

00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:58.369
are actually launched by NASA and the individual
researchers have to make

00:46:58.369 --> 00:47:04.210
proposals so that NASA can then carry their
experiments up. Umm, the dark

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:08.589
matter experiments, I'm sure there is federal
funding, state funding, all sorts

00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:12.880
because the experiment that I went to see
is actually being done by physicists

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.810
mostly based in Berkeley and Stanford. So
I'm sure Berkeley and Stanford have a

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.609
say in the funding and NSF must have some.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:28.520
&gt;&gt; [Pause]
&gt;&gt; Umm, thanks for -- for the talk and especially

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.099
for the pictures. I think
that really makes some of these experiments

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:35.929
come alive and I was just thinking
it would be a great candidate for, like, a

00:47:35.929 --> 00:47:41.020
 -- either a documentary or a
collection of photos to go along with the

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.250
book. Have you looked into that?
Anil: Yeah. So I've put some pictures. I was

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.799
asked that very thing many times
so I ended up putting, uh, pictures on a web

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:53.450
site. So just edgeofphysics.com.
So the pictures are there. Documentaries.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:57.119
Yeah, a couple of television people
have approached but television apparently

00:47:57.119 --> 00:48:02.260
is a very different business. So they
say something and nothing happens for many

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:09.219
years so I'm not -- I'm not holding
my breath on that. I don't know. Umm.

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:14.400
&gt;&gt; [Pause]
&gt;&gt; Umm, in dealing mostly with experimental

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.349
physicists in the course of writing
this book, umm, did you get a good sense or

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:24.440
any sense in general of sort of
where they tended to stand with respect to

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.920
some of the grand unification Theory
of Everything, String Theory, prospects for

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.800
unified physics? Or did they tend
to just sort of compartmentalize themselves

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.119
to their own spheres of study?
Anil: They -- they tend to do both. Depending

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:42.100
on who you talk to on a given
experiment, some people are very compartmentalized,

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.680
they are very focused on the
experiment that they're doing. Umm, the problem

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.190
with String Theory and the
Theory of Everything at this point is that

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.140
they are very far from making
predictions that can be experimentally tested.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:59.740
So I actually just focused on
two things, uh, in the book, uh, that may

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.500
help support String Theory. One is
the possible precise measurement of the curvature

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.819
of space time. There are
certain models in String Theory cosmology

00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:11.980
that predict that the curvature of
space time should be just a slight bit negative

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.109
as opposed to -- we think the
universe is flat right now but there are -- there's

00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:19.049
enough errors in the
measurement that it allows for a negative

00:49:19.049 --> 00:49:23.799
curvature. So that's one. It's not
proof of String Theory. It's just one of the

00:49:23.799 --> 00:49:28.039
possible things that String Theory
cosmology predicts. Umm, it's still disputed.

00:49:28.039 --> 00:49:31.619
Even that is disputed. The
other big thing that actually would be a boost

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:35.349
for String Theory -- again, not
a -- not a proof but a boost -- is the detection

00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:38.380
of something called
supersymmetry. Umm, I talked about physics

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.990
beyond the standard model and, uh,
one of the physics that's, uh, beyond the

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.859
standard model is called supersymmetry
which just says that every particle that we

00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:53.799
know of, electrons, quarks, gluons,
everything, photons, all of them have a partner

00:49:53.799 --> 00:49:57.380
particle, a much heavier partner
particle that existed early in the universe

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:01.520
and has sense decayed and gone away.
We might be able to create that at the large

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.220
Hedron collider. Now, if they
create supersymmetric particle and supersymmetric

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.520
theories start getting
verified, that would be a huge thing for String

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.870
Theory because most String
Theory models require the universe to be supersymmetric.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.170
Again, it wouldn't constitute
proof because the universe can be supersymmetric

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.410
but not stringy. So yeah.
Jesse: All right. Well, and that wraps up

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.180
the time we have. If there are any
other questions, if you'd like to chat about

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:28.200
his book briefly it'll be out in
the lobby for a few more minutes but again

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.079
thank you, Anil.
Anil: My pleasure.

00:50:31.079 --> 00:50:31.799
