00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.390
Hi I'm Sal.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.740
Today we're going to be doing
problem number 5 of

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.530
fall 2009, test 1.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.240
Make sure that you read the
problem in full detail before

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.720
attempting the problem.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.150
And there's also some things
that you should know, pretty

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.040
much background material.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.650
Before attempting the problem.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.030
And that's what I need,
which is W I N.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.260
You will win if you know how to
manipulate these equations.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.750
The first equation is the energy
of two charged species

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.370
as a function of their
internuclear separation.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.350
And the other equation is
a function of just the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.710
separation between two ion pairs
at equilibrium, which is

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.330
given by r naught.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.180
And r naught is just simply the
sum of the radii of the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.070
cation and the radii
of the anion.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.940
So if you look at this
equation there's two

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.940
components to it.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.960
The first component is actually
the component that is

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.100
responsible for the attraction
of your charged species.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.480
And the second component
is the repulsion of it.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.170
Because essentially ionic
bonding happens because of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170
your electrostatic interaction
between an

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.590
cation and an anion.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.990
So with this in mind we can
go ahead and read the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.490
problem and solve it.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.010
So the problem reads
as follows.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.380
On the same graph below--

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.860
and this is the actual graph
that we're going to be doing

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.760
the problem on--

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.510
it says on the same graph
below, for one, BeF2, so

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.460
beryllium fluoride, and two,
BeO, which is beryllium oxide,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.890
sketch the variation of
potential energy with

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.360
internuclear separation arc
between a cation and an anion

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.690
pair in each compound.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.830
The diagram need not to be drawn
to scale however you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.260
must convey the relative
magnitudes of key features.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.430
So the first thing that I would
do is write down my

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.740
compounds that I'm using.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.650
So I'm focusing on beryllium
fluoride, is the first one.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.210
So if I look at beryllium
fluoride, I'm going to look at

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.360
the relative magnitudes and
charges when they're in their

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.410
cation and anion state.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.930
So I know that for beryllium,
beryllium forms a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.690
cation that is 2 plus.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.630
So it has a positive charge of
2, which means that it lost

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.250
two electrons.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:06.490
So I can say that z plus for
beryllium is plus 2 and for

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.140
fluorine, when it's in the
anion state, my charge is

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.670
equal to minus 1.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.190
So 2 plus minus 1.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.610
So with this in mind, you can
take this and it will help you

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.760
solve the problem.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.440
Because like I said, the first
part of the equation is pretty

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.540
much the attraction part, which
involves the product of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.370
your charges.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.960
And I want to go ahead into
the same thing for--

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.440
so this is for BeF2.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.370
And for BeO we have the
oxygen 2 minus.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:57.730
So my anion has a z minus of
minus 2 and my cation just has

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.800
z plus of plus 2.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.740
Now if you look at your
equation over here.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.300
There's two things that will
dominate at certain

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.980
parameters.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.130
Now this value of n is known as
the Born Exponent, and that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.370
has a value between 6 and 12.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.890
So it's always greater than 1.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:24.240
And this is actually what's
nominating your repulsion, so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.250
I'll do some colored chalk.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.110
So for the attraction
part I'll circle it.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.580
And the fact that it's being
attractive means that one of

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.940
these charges has to be negative
that will make the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.390
overall component negative.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.400
Right here because you'll
have q1 times q2.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.560
And in our case if we look up
beryllium fluoride, you have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.220
beryllium 2 plus you have
fluorine minus, so if you make

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.720
the product of those two
you get minus 2.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.100
And you have this other
component, that is the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.360
repulsive part.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.650
So if I was to draw these
independently, not as a sum, I

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.900
know that for my attractive
part, which is the negative,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.710
it should look something like
so, as a function of r.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.470
And my repulsive should look
something like so.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.510
And this makes sense because as
your radius becomes smaller

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:28.150
and smaller then essentially
if you get below 1, your

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.650
potential energy curve
for your--

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.790
the component for
your repulsion--

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.060
spikes up.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.040
So if I was to superimpose
these two, then I should

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:47.470
expect that the curve to
look something like so.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.460
Now this is good because this
is exactly how the curve

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.410
should look.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.240
And there's some characteristic
features here

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.840
that we want to go ahead and
use BeF2 BeO2, draw on the

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720
same diagram to compare
together.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.970
And this point right here on
your r-axis is simply just

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.940
your r naught.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.870
So it's just the sum of
your cation radius

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.390
and your anion radius.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:22.010
And this valley here is your
energy at r naught.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.590
Which is the second
equation that you

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.650
should know how to apply.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.500
So if I want to analyze my
system, how do I know which

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.130
one has a bigger radii
than the other?

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.250
Well I know that my
cation is common.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.670
So in both cases I'm dealing
with beryllium cations.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.150
But I'm dealing with
a different anion.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.290
Now I know that both fluorine
and oxygen anions have the

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.852
same number of electrons, from
looking at the Periodic Table

00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:53.580
of Elements, or their charges
that they have. But fluorine

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.340
has one more proton.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.400
So what that does is that it
allows the fluorine to pull

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.340
the electron cloud tighter
together and that decreases

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.920
your radius.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.460
So just by looking at the
Periodic Table of Elements, I

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.370
can already assume that my
radius for my fluorine should

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.080
be less than the radius
of my O2 minus anion.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.170
So if I look at my system than
I know that if I want to look

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.820
at the internuclear separation,
the r naughts of

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.990
the two compounds, then
I should assume--

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.120
or have an educated
guess based on my

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.630
data that I have here--

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:46.790
that r naught for beryllium
fluoride should be less than

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.570
the r naught for beryllium
oxide.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.550
So this allows you to put the
position of your radius on

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.850
your curve.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:04.140
So I'm going to go ahead and
just redraw the a new axis

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.220
over here just to compare
both of them so you

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.275
won't confuse yourself.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.060
So we know this is the
energy of our system.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.550
And we concluded that our,
that the radius of your

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.170
beryllium fluoride is
less than the radius

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.690
of beryllium oxide.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:38.690
So I can go ahead and mark this
as r naught of BeF2 and

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:44.400
I'll mark that as
r naught of BeO.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.880
So this tells me exactly where
the low point of my potential

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.290
curve should lie.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.120
But how do I know how deep
it sits in the well?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.150
Well that's going to be dictated
by the equation that

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.100
governs the energy
at r naught.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.720
And that's our simple equation
of when it's the

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.090
function of r naught.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.540
And if you look at the equation,
the equation is just

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.840
the product of your
two charges.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.460
So if we come back and we look
at our analysis here, we know

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.950
that if I multiply these two
charges together, you know the

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:26.080
combination of these two,
should be, q1 or q--

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.425
beryllium 2 plus, I'll
call that q1 and I'll

00:09:28.425 --> 00:09:30.070
call this one q2.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.920
The product of these two
gives you minus 2.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:42.080
But for this one, q1 q2
gives us minus 4.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.400
So this tells me that the
electrostatic interaction for

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.450
beryllium oxide is
a lot stronger

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.670
than beryllium fluoride.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.680
And it makes sense because you
have plus 2 and minus 2 being

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.050
attracted to each other instead
of plus 2, minus 1.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:06.460
So on my graph I can assume, I
can guess, that my value of my

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.630
beryllium oxide should sit
lower, more negative, on the

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.160
potential curve than
beryllium fluoride.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.710
So if I designate this as the
low point for my beryllium

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.090
fluoride then my curve for
this system, for that

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.410
particular compound should take
a certain type of shape.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.620
And so again, this is
your energy, the

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.170
bottom point of r naught.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:40.450
And if this is the energy given
to the fact that we have

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.530
a higher magnitude when you
multiply the two charges

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.370
together, then it should sit
lower on the potential well.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.780
And this will be my low point.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:57.710
So my curve should also look
something like so.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.326
So if you were able to do this
on the exam you would have

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.420
gotten full points,
which is good.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.470
And, again the key points about
this problem is just

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.050
knowing what equations to use
by reading the problem.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.390
The problem talked about
internuclear separation, well

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.350
we've learned in class how to
treat those problems and how

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.400
to use equations to be able to
describe the way that the

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.210
energy should look, which
is a good visual.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.440
And by looking at the Periodic
Table of Elements, just

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.360
thinking about how many protons,
how many electrons

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.860
certain cations have, you should
have an estimated guess

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.960
of what your ionic
radius should be.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.120
And with that you can go ahead
and look at the math.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.010
Look where that parameter plays
a role in your equation.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.360
And then decide whether or not
it'll be greater or less or

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.110
what have you.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.870
