00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.469
Well, we're now using the sync adapter, and things are

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.040
working pretty much as before. We want the app to do

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.710
this synchronization cleverly, and we'd like to get rid of

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.780
that old Refresh menu item. Let's start by cleaning up all

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.640
the other routines we have to sync. So we certainly

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.340
don't need any of this other stuff like FetchWeatherTask, or all

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.100
this stuff we did in Sunshine service, and we'll want to clean

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.170
up the manifest accordingly. We certainly don't need either one of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.430
these anymore. And in Preferences, we can just change

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.880
that to sync immediately. So now we're really using this

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.380
sync adapter everywhere. We have a problem though. We're not

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.800
being very smart. The user still has all sorts of

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.070
places where they see an empty list. We want to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.422
sync more intelligently. In Android 2.2 Froyo, Android added the

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:47.890
ability to have sync adapter's sync periodically. We can add

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.580
a helper method to do this in our sync adapter.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.270
The problem is, this method isn't as smart as

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.030
we'd like it to be, it still won't do all

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.800
that cool batching with exact repeating alarms that we'd

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.390
like it to. Fortunately, we've added something that does just

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.010
that, but it's not available until API level 19.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.230
Taking advantage of flexible time to do inexact repeating arms,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.780
let's set some nice defaults for our Sunshine sync adapter.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.665
First we'll add these constants. To make things a little

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.120
clearer in our code let's add another function

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.540
that we'll call when a new account is created,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.148
and here we'll set some important flags. Such as

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:25.309
configurePeriodicSync, the one we

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:29.780
just created. SetSyncAutomatically, without which

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.890
our periodic sync will not be enabled. Since we're

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.830
just starting off let's do an immediate sync, then

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.790
we can call it from a strategic place and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.904
get sync account. Finally, we can make the interface

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.319
to the world a little bit cleaner by

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.880
adding an initializeSyncAdapter function. That's simply makes sure

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.170
that an account has been created. And now

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620
inside of the main activity in the onCreate, we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.140
can just make a call to that new

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.570
function. And it'll make sure that the parameters for

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.990
our sync adapter are set up correctly. let's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630
see if this has any impact on our emulator.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.040
The new version of Sunshine right from the start shows all of current

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.840
weather. For a sync with a sync

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.530
adapter to happen successfully at periodic intervals

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.038
in the background you must: have a

00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:15.620
ContentProvider marked as syncable, enable automatic sync

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.470
for the SyncAdapter, do an initial immediate

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.120
sync, or set an interval in milliseconds.
