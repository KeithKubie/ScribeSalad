00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.900
I want to make little townhouse
shapes with toothpicks.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.370
So this would be
my first townhouse.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.900
I've used 3 toothpicks
so far-- 4, 5, and 6.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.280
So that is my first townhouse.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.280
Now, let me make a little table
here keeping track of things.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.990
So I'll do that in white.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.700
So here's my table to
keep track of things.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:29.210
So this is the number of houses,
and then this is the toothpicks

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.250
that I'm using to
make that house.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.350
So this first house here,
took me 6 toothpicks--

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.319
Now let's make our second house.

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:42.860
And these are going
to be townhouses.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.460
They're going to
share common walls.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.050
So I'm going to
add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.700
toothpicks for my second house.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.310
Now, why did I only
have to add 5 and not 6?

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.810
Well, they shared
a common wall here

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.726
so I didn't have to add
another toothpick here

00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.880
for this left-hand side wall.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.860
So starting with
the first house,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.430
I really just had
to add 5 toothpicks.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.970
I had to add 5 toothpicks to get
to now 11 total toothpicks if I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.550
want two houses.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.040
I think you see the trend here.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.400
What about 3 of these?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.690
Well, this is going
to be another 5-- 1,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.350
2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.550
So we're going to add
5 again and get to 16.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.820
Let's do 4 just
for good measure.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.070
So the fourth one, we're
going to add another 5-- 1,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.130
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.240
So the fourth one, we're going
to add another 5 gets us to 21.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.760
Now, I want to think about,
can we, using this pattern,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.240
figure out how many
toothpicks it would take

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.860
for us to, say, make
50 of these townhouses

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.734
or even 500 of these townhouses,
or even 5,000 of them?

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.400
Now we just have to
look at this pattern

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.430
here and see can we come up
with an equation for each

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.720
of these actual values?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.240
So, for example,
we see a pattern

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.220
that-- well, we
already recognize

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.900
that we started
with 6, and we're

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.620
adding 5 every time
we add a house.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.080
So when you add the second
house, you add 5 once.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.120
The third house, you start
with 6, and you add 5 twice.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.430
The fourth house, you start with
6 and you add 5 three times.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.390
So let's actually
write that down.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.030
So 21 is equal to-- you start
with 6, you start with this 6

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.710
here, and then you add 5
three times, plus 5 times 3.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.110
When you had the 3 houses,
once again, you started with 6

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.820
and you added 5 two times.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.950
Let me do that same color.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.090
And you added 5 two times.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.070
Plus 5 times 2.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.250
When you had 2 houses,
you started with 6 again.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.260
This is equal to 6 and you
added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.840
And then when you had
1 house-- and it'll

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870
fit the same pattern--
you started with 6,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.120
and how many times
did you add 5?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.160
Well, you didn't add 5.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.160
You could say that you
added 5 zero times.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.390
So you might see a
little pattern here.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.950
However many houses you needed,
you take one less than that

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.020
and multiply it by
5, add that to 6,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.940
and you get the
number of toothpicks.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.800
And actually, let
me rewrite this.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.730
So I could rewrite this as
6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.760
I could write this as 6
plus 5 times 3 minus 1.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.740
You could write this as
6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.600
You could rewrite this as
6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
And maybe that makes a
pattern a little bit clearer.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.550
This 4 is right over here.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.000
This 3 is right over here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.240
This 2 is right over here.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.790
And then this 1 is
right over here.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.700
So now, I think we
are ready to think

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.350
about what would happen if
we wanted to make 50 houses.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.890
So let's try to do that.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.300
Let me do that in orange.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.110
This right over here
is our 50th house.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.100
So this is the shared
left wall it has.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.220
This is the 50th
house right over here.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.020
So how many total
toothpicks for 50 houses?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.190
So if we have 50
houses, well, we

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.470
can use the pattern
that we came up with.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.800
It's going to be equal
to, starting with our 6,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.630
the first house requires 6.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.120
And then we're going to add
5 for each incremental house,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.230
so plus 5 for each
incremental house.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.560
And how many incremental
houses are there going to be?

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.680
Well, there are going to be
50 minus 1 incremental houses.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.710
Why minus 1?

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.890
Well, you already built
one of them with the 6.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.650
Then for every extra
one-- so there's

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.440
going to be 49 extra
houses-- you're

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.850
going to add 5
toothpicks apiece.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.570
So this is going to be
equal to 6 plus 5 times 49.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.020
And that is 245.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:30.532
So 6 plus 245 is
equal to 251 sticks.

00:05:30.532 --> 00:05:32.240
And what's really neat
about this pattern

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.490
we just came up with is you
could use it to figure out

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.440
how many sticks you
would need for a million

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.276
of these little
toothpick townhouses.

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:40.776
