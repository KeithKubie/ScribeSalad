00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.119
I remember the first time
that I saw people injecting drugs.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.616
I had just arrived in Vancouver
to lead a research project

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.472
in HIV prevention in the
infamous Downtown East Side.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.626
It was in the lobby of the Portland Hotel,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.536
a supportive housing
project that gave rooms

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.936
to the most marginalized
people in the city,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.706
the so-called "difficult to house."

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.190
I'll never forget the young woman
standing on the stairs

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:46.269
repeatedly jabbing herself with a needle,
and screaming,

00:00:46.293 --> 00:00:47.746
"I can't find a vein,"

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.404
as blood splattered on the wall.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.076
In response to the desperate
state of affairs, the drug use,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.756
the poverty, the violence,
the soaring rates of HIV,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.406
Vancouver declared a public
health emergency in 1997.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.826
This opened the door to
expanding harm reduction services,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.506
distributing more needles,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.300
increasing access to methadone,

00:01:12.324 --> 00:01:16.056
and, finally, opening
a supervised injection site.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.841
Things that make injecting
drugs less hazardous.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.449
But today, 20 years later,

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:27.786
harm reduction is still viewed
as some sort of radical concept.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.716
In some places, it's still illegal
to carry a clean needle.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.477
Drug users are far more likely
to be arrested

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.889
than to be offered methadone therapy.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.236
Recent proposals for
supervised injection sites

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.656
in cities like Seattle,
Baltimore and New York

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.013
have been met with stiff opposition:

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.633
opposition that goes against
everything we know about addiction.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.609
Why is that?

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.228
Why are we still stuck on the idea

00:01:56.252 --> 00:02:02.132
that the only option is to stop using --
that any drug use will not be tolerated?

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.756
Why do we ignore
countless personal stories

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.276
and overwhelming scientific evidence

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.303
that harm reduction works?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.766
Critics say that harm
reduction doesn't stop people

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.439
from using illegal drugs.

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:21.746
Well, actually, that is the whole point.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.626
After every criminal and societal sanction

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.975
that we can come up with,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.911
people still use drugs,
and far too many die.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.896
Critics also say that
we are giving up on people

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.316
by not focusing our attention
on treatment and recovery.

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.716
In fact, it is just the opposite.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.217
We are not giving up on people.

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.516
We know that if recovery
is ever going to happen

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.706
we must keep people alive.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.306
Offering someone a clean needle
or a safe place to inject

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.899
is the first step to
treatment and recovery.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.386
Critics also claim that harm reduction

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.864
gives the wrong message to
our children about drug users.

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:06.244
The last time I looked,
these drug users are our children.

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:10.316
The message of harm reduction
is that while drugs can hurt you,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.226
we still must reach out to
people who are addicted.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.726
A needle exchange is not an
advertisement for drug use.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.746
Neither is a methadone clinic
or a supervised injection site.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.670
What you see there are
people sick and hurting,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.043
hardly an endorsement for drug use.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.896
Let's take supervised
injection sites, for example.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.546
Probably the most misunderstood
health intervention ever.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.246
All we are saying is that allowing people

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.107
to inject in a clean, dry space
with fresh needles,

00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.329
surrounded by people who care

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:47.868
is a lot better than
injecting in a dingy alley,

00:03:47.892 --> 00:03:51.153
sharing contaminated needles
and hiding out from police.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.217
It's better for everybody.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.278
The first supervised injection site
in Vancouver was at 327 Carol Street,

00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:06.126
a narrow room with a concrete floor,
a few chairs and a box of clean needles.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.436
The police would often lock it down,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.190
but somehow it always
mysteriously reopened,

00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:14.594
often with the aid of a crowbar.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.466
I would go down there some evenings

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.725
to provide medical care
for people who were injecting drugs.

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:23.916
I was always struck with the
commitment and compassion

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.796
of the people who operated
and used the site.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.426
No judgment, no hassles, no fear,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.431
lots of profound conversation.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:35.796
I learned that despite
unimaginable trauma,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.899
physical pain and mental illness,

00:04:38.923 --> 00:04:42.034
that everyone there thought
that things would get better.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.574
Most were convinced that, someday,
they'd stop using drugs altogether.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.946
That room was the forerunner
to North America's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.506
first government-sanctioned
supervised injection site, called INSITE.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.456
It opened in September of 2003
as a three-year research project.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.043
The conservative government was intent on
closing it down at the end of the study.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.426
After eight years,
the battle to close INSITE

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.946
went all the way up to
Canada's Supreme Court.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.746
It pitted the government of Canada

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.106
against two people with a
long history of drug use

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.593
who knew the benefits of INSITE firsthand:

00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:25.140
Dean Wilson and Shelley Tomic.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.506
The court ruled in favor
of keeping INSITE open by nine to zero.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.347
The justices were scathing in
their response to the government's case.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.005
And I quote:

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:42.664
"The effect of denying the services
of INSITE to the population that it serves

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.895
and the correlative increase in the risk
of death and disease

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.878
to injection drug users
is grossly disproportionate to any benefit

00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:53.004
that Canada might derive

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:57.497
from presenting a uniform stance
on the possession of narcotics."

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.913
This was a hopeful moment
for harm reduction.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.802
Yet, despite this strong message
from the Supreme Court,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.005
it was, until very recently,

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.209
impossible to open up
any new sites in Canada.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.855
There was one interesting thing
that happened in December of 2016,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.935
when due to the overdose crisis,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.213
the government of British Columbia allowed
the opening of overdose prevention sites.

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:30.506
Essentially ignoring the
federal approval process,

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.901
community groups opened up
about 22 of these de facto illegal

00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:37.694
supervised injection sites
across the province.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.989
Virtually overnight,

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:43.136
thousands of people could
use drugs under supervision.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.025
Hundreds of overdoses were reversed
by Naloxone, and nobody died.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.847
In fact, this is what's happened
at INSITE over the last 14 years:

00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:58.316
75,000 different individuals
have injected illegal drugs

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.556
more than three and a half million times,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.133
and not one person has died.

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:08.061
Nobody has ever died at INSITE.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.126
So there you have it.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.768
We have scientific evidence
and successes from needle exchanges

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:20.826
methadone and supervised injection sites.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.143
These are common-sense,
compassionate approaches to drug use

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.779
that improve health, bring connection

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:30.834
and greatly reduce suffering and death.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.606
So why haven't harm reduction
programs taken off?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.883
Why do we still think
that drug use is law enforcement issue?

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.362
Our disdain for drugs and
drug users goes very deep.

00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:49.786
We are bombarded with
images and media stories

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.254
about the horrible impacts of drugs.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.936
We have stigmatized entire communities.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.785
We applaud military-inspired operations
that bring down drug dealers.

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:05.146
And we appear unfazed
by building more jails

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.566
to incarcerate people whose
only crime is using drugs.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.881
Virtually millions of people are caught up

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:18.039
in a hopeless cycle
of incarceration, violence and poverty

00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:23.857
that has been created by our drug laws
and not the drugs themselves.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.027
How do I explain to people
that drug users deserve care and support

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.726
and the freedom to live their lives

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.289
when all we see are images of guns
and handcuffs and jail cells?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.101
Let's be clear:

00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:44.212
criminalization is just a way
to institutionalize stigma.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.420
Making drugs illegal does nothing
to stop people from using them.

00:08:53.888 --> 00:08:57.256
Our paralysis to see things differently

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.816
is also based on an entirely
false narrative about drug use.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.087
We have been led to believe
that drug users

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:07.889
are irresponsible people who just
want to get high,

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:10.428
and then through their
own personal failings

00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:14.116
spiral down into a life
of crime and poverty,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.076
losing their jobs, their families
and, ultimately, their lives.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.721
In reality, most drug users have a story,

00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:27.146
whether it's childhood trauma,
sexual abuse, mental illness

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.616
or a personal tragedy.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.455
The drugs are used to numb the pain.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:40.241
We must understand that
as we approach people with so much trauma.

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:46.186
At its core, our drug policies
are really a social justice issue.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:51.297
While the media may focus on overdose
deaths like Prince and Michael Jackson,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.399
the majority of the suffering

00:09:53.423 --> 00:09:56.971
happens to people who are
living on the margins,

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.121
the poor and the dispossessed.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.479
They don't vote; they are often alone.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.812
They are society's disposable people.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.946
Even within health care,
drug use is highly stigmatized.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.056
People using drugs avoid
the health care system.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.646
They know that once
engaged in clinical care

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.780
or admitted to hospital,
they will be treated poorly.

00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:24.327
And their supply line, be it heroin,
cocaine or crystal meth

00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:25.866
will be interrupted.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.136
On top of that, they will be asked
a barrage of questions

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.326
that only serve
to expose their losses and shame.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.733
"What drugs do you use?"

00:10:35.757 --> 00:10:37.924
"How long have you been
living on the street?"

00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:39.638
"Where are your children?"

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.066
"When were you last in jail?"

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.865
Essentially: "Why the hell
don't you stop using drugs?"

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:52.866
In fact, our entire medical
approach to drug use is upside down.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.041
For some reason,

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:59.318
we have decided that abstinence
is the best way to treat this.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.396
If you're lucky enough,
you may get into a detox program.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.486
If you live in a community
with Suboxone or methadone,

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.914
you may get on a substitution program.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.448
Hardly ever would we offer people
what they desperately need to survive:

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:16.892
a safe prescription for opioids.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.873
Starting with abstinence is
like asking a new diabetic to quit sugar

00:11:22.897 --> 00:11:26.128
or a severe asthmatic
to start running marathons

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.456
or a depressed person to just be happy.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.043
For any other medical condition,

00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:33.090
we would never start with
the most extreme option.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.686
What makes us think that strategy

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.257
would work for something
as complex as addiction?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.006
While unintentional overdoses are not new,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.126
the scale of the current
crisis is unprecedented.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.944
The Center for Disease Control estimated

00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:54.111
that 64,000 Americans died
of a drug overdose in 2016,

00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.817
far exceeding car crashes or homicides.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.771
Drug-related mortality is now
the leading cause of death

00:12:01.795 --> 00:12:06.310
among men and women between
20 and 50 years old in North America

00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:08.382
Think about that.

00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:13.617
How did we get to this point, and why now?

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.936
There is a kind of perfect
storm around opioids.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.716
Drugs like Oxycontin,
Percocet and Dilaudid

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.073
have been liberally distributed
for decades for all kinds of pain.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.763
It is estimated that two million
Americans are daily opioid users,

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:33.676
and over 60 million people

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.446
received at least one prescription
for opioids last year.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.727
This massive dump of
prescription drugs into communities

00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:46.314
has provided a steady source
for people wanting to self-medicate.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.092
In response to this prescription epidemic,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.982
people have been cut off, and this
has greatly reduced the street supply

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.502
The unintended but predictable consequence

00:12:58.526 --> 00:13:00.336
is an overdose epidemic.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.685
Many people who were reliant on
a steady supply of prescription drugs

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.161
turned to heroin.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.717
And now the illegal drug market
has tragically switched

00:13:09.741 --> 00:13:12.167
to synthetic drugs, mainly fentanyl.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.034
These new drugs are cheap,
potent and extremely hard to dose.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.172
People are literally being poisoned.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.676
Can you imagine if this was
any other kind of poisoning epidemic?

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.033
What if thousands of people started dying

00:13:30.057 --> 00:13:33.691
from poisoned meat
or baby formula or coffee?

00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.316
We would be treating
this as a true emergency.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.976
We would immediately be
supplying safer alternatives.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.996
There would be changes in legislation,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.266
and we would be supporting
the victims and their families.

00:13:46.356 --> 00:13:48.366
But for the drug overdose epidemic,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.742
we have done none of that.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:54.659
We continue to demonize the drugs
and the people who use them

00:13:54.683 --> 00:14:00.492
and blindly pour even more resources
into law enforcement.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.818
So where should we go from here?

00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:09.897
First, we should fully embrace,
fund and scale up

00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:12.466
harm reduction programs
across North America.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.386
I know that in places like Vancouver,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.942
harm reduction has been a
lifeline to care and treatment.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.796
I know that the number of overdose deaths

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.796
would be far higher
without harm reduction.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.013
And I personally know hundreds
of people who are alive today

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.656
because of harm reduction.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.726
But harm reduction is just the start.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.046
If we truly want to make
an impact on this drug crisis,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.916
we need to have a serious
conversation about prohibition

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.486
and criminal punishment.

00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:52.271
We need to recognize that drug use is
first and foremost a public health issue

00:14:53.358 --> 00:14:59.715
and turn to comprehensive social
and health solutions.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.051
We already have a model
for how this can work.

00:15:03.075 --> 00:15:06.366
In 2001, Portugal was
having its own drug crisis.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.576
Lots of people using
drugs, high crime rates

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.466
and an overdose epidemic.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.274
They defied global conventions
and decriminalized all drug possession.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.266
Money that was spent on drug enforcement

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.583
was redirected to health
and rehabilitation programs.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.369
The results are in.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.280
Overall drug use is down dramatically.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.812
Overdoses are uncommon.

00:15:31.836 --> 00:15:34.542
Many more people are in treatment.

00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:38.782
And people have been
given their lives back.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:47.131
We have come so far down the road
of prohibition, punishment and prejudice

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.744
that we have become
indifferent to the suffering

00:15:49.768 --> 00:15:53.926
that we have inflicted on the
most vulnerable people in our society.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.896
This year even more
people will get caught up

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.542
in the illegal drug trade.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.916
Thousands of children will learn
that their mother or father

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.318
has been sent to jail for using drugs.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.876
And far too many parents will be notified

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.542
that their son or daughter
has died of a drug overdose.

00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:20.550
It doesn't have to be this way.

00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:23.594
Thank you.

00:16:23.618 --> 00:16:28.912
(Applause)
