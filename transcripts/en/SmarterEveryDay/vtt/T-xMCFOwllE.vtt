00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Destin] Radius gauges.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.913
-[Darryl] Yes.

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:05.090
If anything's missing it's
because you probably--

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.830
- [Destin] What are you talking about?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.150
- You probably misplaced it.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.080
- Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.100
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.160
So this is my dad,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.200
and everybody's gonna talk about

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.770
in the comments how ugly we are.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.870
Let's just get that outta the way.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.810
- Chip off the old block.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.669
- We're ugly.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.502
- It ain't gonna get no better.

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:18.335
- We know it.

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:19.168
He knows how to measure things.

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:20.820
He's been a metrologist for years

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.920
and years and years, right?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.753
- Yes.

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:24.393
- Yeah, what things have you measured?

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.600
- All kinds of things.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.433
- Yeah?

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:28.266
- You name it,

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.640
just this week I measured
things that go into space

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.060
and things that go down deep in the ocean.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.893
- Just this week?

00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:35.726
- Just this week.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.007
- And that's a metrologist does, right?

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:39.111
It's the study of measuring things.

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:40.790
So, when I was growing up,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.880
this is the kind of
stuff I would play with

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.713
in the garage.

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:45.072
These are micrometers,

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:48.360
that's a really old lathe over there.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.401
These are things that kind
of shape the way I think,

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.830
and I read a lot of books back in the day,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.643
and I'm basically making this video

00:00:56.643 --> 00:00:57.980
because I want you to see it.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.720
It's the dawn of precision.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.224
You taught me all this stuff,

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:03.842
and there's a guy named Joseph Whitworth.

00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:06.430
- Mm-hmm, we're standing on
his shoulders right now, right?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.737
- Right, well I mean like,

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:10.010
you like surface plates don't you?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.843
- Oh yeah.

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:11.960
- Do you know who made surface plates?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.920
- Who made em?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.500
I guess Mr. Starrett did.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.620
- No, Joseph Whitworth.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.453
- Did he?

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:17.493
- Yeah.

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:18.326
- Did he really?

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.330
- Yeah, so today on Smarter Every Day,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.370
I would like to go on an adventure

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.530
to learn about this guy,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.460
Joseph Whitworth,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.140
and basically I think you
will enjoy this video.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.973
- Okay.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:28.420
- So our story starts here

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.320
at the Tennessee State Museum.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.060
There's a really cool thing here,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.000
something I've cared about my entire life.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.830
It's a special weapon that
was used in the Civil War

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.760
called a Whitworth rifle.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.950
Okay this is what we're here for,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260
this is a Whitworth.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.610
This represents the
proliferation of the idea

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.630
of modern manufacturing precision.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.970
This is a weapon that
was designed in England

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.210
by a guy named Joseph Whitworth.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.880
The scope is off to the side

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.530
so I don't really know
how they fire this thing.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.630
Look at the end of the barrel here.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.345
You can see that it's not a circle

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.430
like most rifles are at
the end of their barrel.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.610
This is a hexagonal bullet.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.070
Now the interesting thing about that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.080
is it's a hexagonal helical bullet.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.913
If you think about it,

00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:06.980
how do you make a hexagonal hole in metal,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.750
and then how do you twist
that at a certain rate?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.250
The answer is extreme
manufacturing precision.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.410
So there was a bullet at the museum,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.070
but the cool thing about the South

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.160
is you can pick up the
phone and call people

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.150
like Preston who owns nashvillerelics.com,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.980
and you have a Whitworth bullet?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.813
- [Preston] I do.

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:25.860
- [Destin] So your thing
is Civil War relics, right?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.820
Like you've got all the--
- Yes.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.490
- [Destin] You buy and
sell the stuff, right?

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.323
- Absolutely.

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:31.460
- [Destin] But, is your
Whitworth for sale?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.945
- Not yet.

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:33.778
(laughter)

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.118
- [Destin] Well what's the deal here?

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:36.289
You found this right?

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.476
- I found that one.

00:02:37.476 --> 00:02:38.740
- [Destin] Okay, so it has
sentimental value to you.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.573
- [Preston] It does.

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:41.980
I've never actually sold
anything that I found.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.813
- [Destin] Really?

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:44.100
So what's the story with this?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.030
This is what you'd call a drop?

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.410
- [Preston] This was a dropped bullet,

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.732
it was not fired.

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:51.354
It was found along the
second day's battle lines

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:53.260
at the Battle of Nashville.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.317
Basically it would've been
dropped on December 16, 1864.

00:02:57.317 --> 00:02:58.390
- [Destin] Really?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.885
You can peg it down to the day?

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:00.718
- You can peg it down to that day.

00:03:00.718 --> 00:03:02.760
- So what's so special
about the Whitworth bullet,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.005
the hexagon right?

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:04.838
- The hexagon,

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:06.360
a lot of the Whitworth's that came through

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.946
were the round conical type shells.

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:12.848
You didn't see a lot of
the hexagon type guns

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:13.925
come through,

00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:16.507
and it's quite rare to dig one

00:03:16.507 --> 00:03:19.801
and to find one in dropped great condition

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:21.790
is kinda neat to find.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.710
- [Destin] So why did the
sharp shooters of the day

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.900
prefer the Whitworth?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.030
- Very accurate.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.200
- [Destin] Really?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.020
Did you know they actually
made artillery pieces

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.090
that have the hex?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.140
- I did, I did.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.665
I'd seen some of those shells.

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:37.510
I've never seen the actual cannon,

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.090
but I'd seen some of the shells.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.230
- [Destin] I recently went
to a civil war cannon shoot,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.710
and while some people
were there on the field

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.548
trying to knock down
barrels with their cannons,

00:03:44.548 --> 00:03:46.528
there was this one guy that
was absolutely drilling

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:49.200
whatever he aimed at.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.810
How long did it take
you to make this Mike?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.329
- [Mike} It took me a couple years.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.926
The planning and arranging stage

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:59.110
took longer than the actual making of it.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.300
The making of it was about a year.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.942
- [Destin] So the whole purpose of this

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.510
is that you have an increased roll rate,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.810
so you have a more
stabilized projectile right?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.643
- Correct.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.070
- Wow, that's amazing.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.500
Okay let's get the camera set up.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.040
- [Man] That's perfect.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.218
- Is that it?

00:04:16.218 --> 00:04:17.924
Oh that's cool.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.270
That's really cool.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.110
That's gonna work.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.943
- [Mike] It looks good doesn't it?

00:04:21.943 --> 00:04:22.820
- [Destin] It really does.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.653
Okay here we go,

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:24.670
Whitworth 600 meters,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.757
yards, yards.

00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:26.590
600 yards.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.720
- [Mike] Whitworth three
powder ready to fire?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.553
Fire!

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:34.245
(cannon boom)

00:04:36.862 --> 00:04:39.195
(explosion)

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:51.078
(explosion flying through the air)

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:56.728
(explosion)

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:11.840
(explosion)

00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:37.030
- [Destin] Did you hit it?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.268
- Yeah looks like I skimmed the bullseye

00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:42.027
at about nine o'clock.

00:05:42.027 --> 00:05:42.927
- [Destin] Really?

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.053
Oh holy cow dude!

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.440
We're talkin' about 600 yards?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.273
- Yes.

00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:53.550
- That's insane.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.510
So here it is right here.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.370
- Aw man.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.520
- Oh my goodness.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.520
- Look at how aggressive that rotation is.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.370
- Whoa!
- Wow!

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.560
- [Destin] Each one of those lands

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.360
represents 60 degrees of rotation,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.250
so what we can do is we can go back

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.490
and we figure out where one
is in polar coordinates,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.570
and as it rotates we
can actually calculate

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.130
the roll rate and the distance.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.430
And we can calculate the distance

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.820
or the muzzle velocity,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.998
based on the length of the round itself.

00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:19.665
(cannon firing)

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:21.918
- Whitworth was an engineer.

00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:24.028
He developed a lot of machining,

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:29.028
unique machining abilities
to make flat planes,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.640
to measure to a millionth of an inch,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.550
those were all original things
that Whitworth engineered.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.170
- A millionth of an inch.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.310
To show how this might work,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.370
let's look at this.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.660
So let's say we have a lever here,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.290
and we have 10 inches here,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.340
and we have one inch here
to where we put a pencil

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.173
or something like that.

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:50.072
So if we move this thing 10 inches up top,

00:06:50.072 --> 00:06:52.486
we get one inch of movement down here.

00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:55.040
But what if we add another lever to this,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.120
exactly like that one.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.950
It's got a 10 inch fulcrum distance there,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.450
one inch of movement.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.570
Down here in the middle,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.791
that's a hundred thousandths
of an inch of movement.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.770
Down here at the bottom,

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.180
it's barely even moving.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.820
That's 10 thousandths of an inch.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.900
We have to zoom in so you can even see it.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.120
Okay it's one thing to
understand these principles,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.330
it's quite another to
actually incorporate them

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.626
into the machinery of the day.

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.190
That's the magic of what Whitworth did,

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.389
and to explain how he did it,

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.520
I'm gonna kick it over to
a buddy of mine named Will.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.486
He has a YouTube channel
called Machine Thinking.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.860
He actually went to the
U.K. and shows exactly

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.032
what Whitworth did to kick
precision manufacturing

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:31.683
into high gear.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.923
- [Will] Thanks Destin,

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:35.290
though it does seem incredible,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.300
Whitworth did make a
machine that could measure

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.950
down to a millionth of an inch.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.740
To make a machine this
accurate and precise

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.800
he did something amazing.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.230
His machine had a micrometer screw

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.340
with 20 threads per inch,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.790
which acted on the work piece

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.300
that had a worm wheel with 200 teeth

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.590
on the end of that shaft.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.618
In turn, the shaft had a
dial divided 250 times.

00:07:51.618 --> 00:07:55.360
So 20 times 200 times 250
gives you a resolution

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.710
of one millionth of an inch.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.700
Whitworth was able to show

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.860
even a momentary human
touch on the workpiece

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.440
was detectable by this machine.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.780
Now this was before the times of

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.280
environmentally controlled rooms,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.420
so I'm certain he was unable
to get those same measurements

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.253
day to day,

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.285
but it does show he was able to measure

00:08:09.285 --> 00:08:10.670
to accuracies far beyond
what anyone else was doing

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.231
at the time.

00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:14.370
In fact, Whitworth is credited
for introducing the thou,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.410
a one thousandths of
a inch of measurement,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.960
and he could easily and regularly work

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.660
to that kind of precision or beyond.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.460
But you can't make a
machine measuring close

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.240
to millionths of an
inch from just anywhere.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.160
There's a whole chain
of important precursors

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.530
to make something like that.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.760
Whitworth helped invent
or improve those as well,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.780
probably the most important
being the surface plate.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.760
The surface plate is
simply a piece of cast iron

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.170
or later granite,

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.400
which is incredibly flat
and serves as your reference

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.300
for all precision.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.000
Whitworth helped popularize the method

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.836
for making surface plates
by scraping and lapping

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:42.930
three pieces of cast iron together.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.420
The only plane that has come

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.870
in between three or more surfaces

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.310
has to be one that is
practically perfectly flat,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.910
and it's from those flat surface plates

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.560
that Whitworth could
transfer that precision

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.210
into other tools or machines

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.770
like his millionth of an inch machine

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.883
or cannons or rifles,

00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:57.300
and was able to help the world

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.100
make precision a commodity
like it is today.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.210
All the precision and
accuracy in the world

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.680
can be traced back to flat plates

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.910
like the one that Whitworth made.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.220
It's not initially intuitive,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.557
but even those precise hexagonal bores

00:09:06.557 --> 00:09:08.423
have their origins back in
Whitworth's machines and tools,

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.924
which got their precision and accuracy

00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:12.091
from his surface plates.

00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.140
The amazing accuracy of
his cannons and rifles

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.230
are just the end product of a
very long chain of precision.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.860
But Whitworth didn't
keep all this technology

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.693
to himself.

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:21.430
He eventually founded his own company,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.870
and he made precision machine tools

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.440
for the industries that
were starting to bloom

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.940
thanks to this new level of precision.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.860
Whenever you have new kinds

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.739
of precision and accuracy
available to manufacturers,

00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:30.672
it enables new kinds of things to be made

00:09:30.672 --> 00:09:32.670
and products start to get cheaper.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.160
If you're ever eating a fresh strawberry

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.194
in New York City in January,

00:09:35.194 --> 00:09:36.723
you have Whitworth
partly to thank for that.

00:09:36.723 --> 00:09:38.550
Whitworth's company made some of the

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.383
absolute finest machine
tools you could buy,

00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:42.010
including lathes, planners,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.990
drill presses, shapers,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.840
slotters and more,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.040
which gave precision
manufacturing a huge kick.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.490
Whitworth died a wealthy man,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.390
and for his enormous
accomplishments was given

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.500
a title by the crown,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.900
but perhaps his biggest legacy

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.360
was for another kind of machine he made,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.398
a screw cutting machine that
he sold all over Britain.

00:09:55.398 --> 00:09:56.590
What that machine did,

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.902
and the implications of it are amazing.

00:09:57.902 --> 00:10:00.740
- If you wanna learn more
about precision manufacturing,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.880
go check out Will's channel,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.750
Machine Thinking.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.420
Think about how important this stuff is.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.610
He's got some more videos coming about

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.720
Whitworth and precision manufacturing,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.853
but this is important.

00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:10.830
Like Whitworth was the first person

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.900
to standardize threaded fasteners,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.030
like threads per inch.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.863
He did that,

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.630
it's called the British
Standard Whitworth.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.850
Imagine going to a bolt bin here

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.220
and trying to get a bolt,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.510
but nothing is standardized.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.050
He fixed that back in the 1840's.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.150
So do me a favor and look around you

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.020
and see what's within arm's reach.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.760
If there's something made
by humans around you,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.790
chances are there's a
threaded fastener in it.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.529
So, leave a comment down in the video

00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:36.042
as to what that thing is,

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:38.760
chances are it's a small
fine thread machine screw,

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.870
if I had to guess.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.525
Leave a comment and bonus
points if you can name

00:10:41.525 --> 00:10:43.082
exactly what thread it is.

00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:44.855
Another thing you'll find in the basement,

00:10:44.855 --> 00:10:47.800
genealogy, things like
that from the family.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.002
But I'm gonna give you
the modern precise way.

00:10:51.002 --> 00:10:52.106
- What's that?

00:10:52.106 --> 00:10:53.045
Oh yeah.

00:10:53.045 --> 00:10:54.216
- [Destin] 23 and me.

00:10:54.216 --> 00:10:58.134
I would argue that there is
a new helix study going on

00:10:58.134 --> 00:10:59.550
that's trying to help the world,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.320
and that is DNA.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.038
DNA as you know is a double helix.

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:05.704
23 and me is the sponsor
for today's episode,

00:11:05.704 --> 00:11:07.440
and they have developed a kit

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.295
that you can get by going
to 23andme.com/smarter.

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:11.700
It comes to your house.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.760
There's a little vial in it.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.950
You spit in the vial,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.990
you package it back up.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.823
You register,

00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:16.656
you send it off.

00:11:16.656 --> 00:11:17.680
There's a video on Smarter Every Day

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.340
where I went to the lab
and see them using a chip

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.240
like this to do what's
called genotype testing.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.150
They don't sequence your DNA,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.590
they do genotype testing,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.840
which is a way to look at different SNPs,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.480
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.670
to understand more about
your genetic sequence.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.810
It's like a very small
fraction of your sequence.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.540
There's two ways you can use 23 and me.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.780
You can just do the ancestry part,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.840
which makes a great gift for
somebody that's interested

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.580
in genealogy and stuff like that.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.710
Or you can do health and ancestry,

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.670
which is what I choose to do

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.190
because I get all kinds of information

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.023
about my body.

00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:47.920
Just like back in the day,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.188
they were seeing the dawn
of precision manufacturing.

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:51.239
Right now, today,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:52.827
in our day and age,

00:11:52.827 --> 00:11:55.190
we are at the dawn of precision medicine,

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.452
which is going to affect our
children's lives forever,

00:11:57.452 --> 00:11:59.360
and it's gonna make the
world a better place.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.640
So I'm excited about this.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.980
If you want to get a kit
for you or someone you love,

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.328
go to 23andme.com/smarter.

00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:06.240
Get a kit,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.330
makes a really good gift,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.040
and learn more about your body.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.170
You went to Alabama right?

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.003
- Absolutely.

00:12:11.003 --> 00:12:11.836
- Roll Tide.

00:12:11.836 --> 00:12:12.940
- Roll tide.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.340
- [Destin] Dude, every time I see you,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.160
you're over here sticking
things in your barrel.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.630
What's up with that?

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.317
- Well, I have the luxury
of cleaning the bore

00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:22.672
to an immaculate state,

00:12:22.672 --> 00:12:27.672
which helps with accuracy
in an actual war situation.

00:12:27.912 --> 00:12:29.810
- Dude's proud of his gun,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:30.890
that's what this is.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.107
Proud of your gun,

00:12:32.107 --> 00:12:34.910
that's exactly what's going on.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.743
- That's right.

00:12:35.743 --> 00:12:36.890
- [Destin] This is your baby isn't it?

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.904
- It's like waxing my corvette.

00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:41.483
- [Destin] It's called the
Whitworth three plate method.

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:42.577
- I did not know that.

00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:44.080
I mean I knew the three plate method,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.040
but I didn't know Whitworth did it.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.020
- [Destin] So Whitworth is like your hero.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.353
- Yup.

00:12:49.353 --> 00:12:51.603
(laughter)
