00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.370
I basically do cluster has
an unfortunate single fail

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.272
point the NameNode.

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:05.994
The NameNode machine crashed or

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:09.190
became unreachable the metadata
about the blocks we lost.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.644
But if you have a standby NameNode that
a synchronize with the active NameNode

00:00:13.644 --> 00:00:15.230
the standby can take over.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.571
This is called High Availability mode
and bar provides a wizard to lead you

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.590
through enabling high availability,
all right.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.315
Now ,it is time to configure
high availability.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:30.836
Go to Services &gt; HDFS &gt; Summary.

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:36.530
Click on the Service Actions menu
then choose Enable NameNode HA.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360
Name is guy anything you want.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.200
Those are in my cluster.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.218
So here, you can choose which host you
want to be running, the JournalNode,

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:47.678
NameNode and whatnot.

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:49.521
I have this set up as a DataNode, and

00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.280
we've these guys are only running one
service each, so I put them here.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.760
So now we have three hosts not
remaster services that mean

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.425
those are the DataNodes.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.780
Now the wizard will lead
you through the process.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.660
It's pretty simple, but a few times,
it'll prompt you to log into

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.000
the NameNodes with their
internal host names.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.130
However, you'll need to
use the public host names,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.740
since you are in the network
with your EC2 instances.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.850
All right?

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.120
Now we see standby NameNode and
an active NameNode.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.690
This cluster is now running in
the high availability mode.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.970
If this NameNode dies,
this one can take over.
