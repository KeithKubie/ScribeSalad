00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.700
We have four quadrilaterals
drawn right over here.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.980
And what I want
us to think about

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.105
is looking at this green
quadrilateral here.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:10.730
I want you to pause
the video and think

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.030
about which of
these figures have

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.500
the same area as the
green quadrilateral?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.360
And so pause the video
now and think about that.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.040
So I'm assuming you
gave a shot at it.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.980
Now let's think about it.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.480
And the way I'm
going to think about

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.350
is to really rearrange parts
of this green quadrilateral

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.040
to make it look
more like maybe some

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.800
of these other quadrilaterals.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.040
So for example, if
we were to if we

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.860
were to put a little
dotted line right over here

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.170
and a dotted line
right over here,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.360
we see that our green
shape is actually made up,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.560
you could imagine it being made
up of, a triangle, and then

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.810
a rectangle, and then
another triangle.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.320
And what's interesting
about the two triangles

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.310
is that they represent
the exact same area.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.870
They essentially
both represent, they

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.080
each represent half of this
rectangle right over here.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.519
Let me do that in a color.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.130
They represent half
of this entire thing

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.150
if I were to color it all in.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.020
And if you have
trouble visualizing it,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.690
imagine taking this top
part right over here

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.600
and then flipping it over.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600
It would look like this.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.200
If you flip it over, this
line right over here,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.650
it would look
something like this.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.930
My best attempt to draw it.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.790
So take that top section, it
would look something like that.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.520
And then move it down right
over here to fit in here.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.680
And then this plus this will
fill in this entire region

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.950
right over here.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.190
So that original green trapezoid
that we were looking at,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.740
if you take that top
part out, it essentially

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.610
has the exact same area
as a rectangle that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.960
has a height of 4
and a length of 5.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.275
So this right over here
has the exact same area

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:07.550
as our trapezoid.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.449
And once again,
how did we do that?

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.180
Well, we just took
this top part,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.234
flipped it over, and
relocated it down here.

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:14.650
And we said hey,
we could actually

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.090
construct a rectangle that way.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.280
So essentially, and if
you want to know its area,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.460
we could either just
count the squares here.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.520
So we have, let me do
this in an easier to see.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.642
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:41.517
16, 17, 18, 19, 20 of these
unit squares right over here.

00:02:41.517 --> 00:02:43.600
And we know that there's
an easier way to do that.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600
We could have just multiplied
the height times the width.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.110
We could have just said,
look this thing is 1, 2, 3,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.440
4 high and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wide.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.710
So 4 times 5 is going to give
us 20 of these units squares.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.890
So that's the area in terms of
unit squares, or square units,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.560
of that original
green trapezoid.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.470
Now let's see which one
of these match that.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.350
So this pink one
right over here.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.720
If you don't even
count this bottom part,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.590
if you were to just separate
this top part right over here.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.730
This top part is
4 high by 5 wide.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.580
So just this top
part alone is 20.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.940
And then it has this
extra right over here.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.970
So the pink has a
larger area than

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.370
our original green trapezoid.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.370
The blue rectangle is 3 by 5.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.140
So it has an area
of 15 square units.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.660
Now the red one is interesting.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.230
It is 1, 2, 3, 4 high and 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 long or 5 wide.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.570
4 times 5 is 20 squares,
and you can validate that.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.930
And so the red rectangle
has the same area

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.770
as our original green trapezoid.
