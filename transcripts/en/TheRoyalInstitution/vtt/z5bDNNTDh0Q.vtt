00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.400
Hi.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.980
As you can see, I put up there
Science in the Media, Fitting

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.940
a Square Peg in a Round Hole.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.140
And as I talk, I hope it
will become obvious

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.590
why I'm saying that.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.660
So, the journey, where
are we going to go?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.650
We're going to look at who the
main players are when we talk

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.400
about science in the media.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.730
How does the media work?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.100
How does science work?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.250
A bit of a think about why we
need science coverage in the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.780
first place, criticisms of
science in the media,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.210
alternatives to where we are at
the moment, how things are

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.340
changing, and who controls
what science

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.770
appears in the media.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.460
And then: the future, how on
earth are we going to fund

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.800
continued science
in the media?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.940
So, the main players,
who have we got?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.070
We've got the scientists.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.450
They do the science that
the media report on.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.900
You've then got scientific
bodies, places like the Ri.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.120
You've got government.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.160
They might fund science, develop
science policy, put on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.300
events just like this
that then create

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.770
coverage in the media.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.140
You then have press offices.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.290
They sit between the science
and the journalists.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.720
They kind of interpret what the
scientists are doing and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
sell it to the media, and that's
a job that I've had.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810
That's been one of my main jobs,
is doing that job in the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.620
middle there.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.266
And at the end of the day, key
to the media, at the heart of

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.220
the media, are the journalists,
and they're the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.600
ones who actually do the job of
reporting on the science,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.060
interviewing the
scientists, and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.210
presenting it to the public.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.620
OK, so the media - what's
the media all about?

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.220
Short time scale, simple
messages, clear-cut yes or no

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.600
answers, focus on disagreement
and exceptions at its basis.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.400
Science: long time scale,
complicated messages, no hard

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.490
and fast answers, and it
works on consensus.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.370
So already you can see
it's quite different.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.380
What the media wants, it's
very different from how

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.520
science works.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.140
They're kind of at
opposite poles.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.900
So are they completely
incompatible?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.830
And Quentin Cooper, who presents
Material World on BBC

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.280
Radio 4, I just thought this
was a really nice quote.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.450
He was saying to me, science
values detail, precision, the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.100
impersonal, the technical, the
lasting, facts, numbers, and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.660
being right.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.900
Journalism values brevity,
approximation, the personal,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.110
the colloquial, the immediate,
stories, words,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.160
and being right now.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.090
And there are going
to be tensions.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.470
But can we overcome
these tensions?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.385
And you can see there's a
completely blank slide there,

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:30.430
because I was starting to think
about why do we need

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.940
science media coverage
in the first place?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.340
Why do we need science out
there on TV, in the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100
newspapers, on the internet?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.250
And I originally had put down
a number of points as to why

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.385
we might need it, but I suddenly
thought, actually

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.560
that's something that you should
be thinking about, is

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.760
what is the purpose of it?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.660
If it's so diametrically
opposed, why do we need it in

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.820
the first place?

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.450
And just listening to Hugh
was making me think.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.860
Already I can think of a
thousand reasons how we'd know

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.530
about all the stuff that Hugh
was talking about if it wasn't

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.905
for the media.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.225
But anyway, I left that one
blank rather than giving you

00:02:58.225 --> 00:03:00.890
all the answers, because I
thought that was my job.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.150
So, criticisms of science
coverage.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.700
And it does come under quite
a deal of criticism,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.240
particularly from scientists
themselves.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.250
They would say that the coverage
distorts the facts,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.230
is quite arbitrary.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.930
What ends up in the newspapers
isn't really representative of

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.260
what's going on out in
the world of science.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.740
Kill or cure sensationalism, and
we've all seen this kind

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.040
of thing where one day chocolate
is good for you, the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.890
next day it gives you cancer.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.640
You know, it's the same things
do one thing one day,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.140
something the other day.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.500
Dumbing down: the science is
made so simple as to actually

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.510
making it wrong.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.510
In the end it's just
completely wrong.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.390
And perpetuating the idea of
novelty and breakthrough.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.640
So the way it's reported is that
science just happens in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.990
these small bursts of we know
this, we know this, we now

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.010
know this, when in fact that
isn't how science works.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.590
It's a much more
gradual process

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.500
of coming to consensus.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.490
So, also criticism of science
journalists and what they do.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.300
There's big criticism about
false conflict, dressing it up

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.350
as balance.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.450
So if we take the example of
the environment, climate

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.140
change, you put two people up
against each other, somebody

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.180
who says yeah, climate change
is all down to humans, and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.260
then somebody who says actually
no, it was nothing to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.430
do with us.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.340
Vast consensus of opinion on one
side, tiny minority on the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.529
other, but put up against each
other as though they're yes or

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.690
no in the same way they might
do with politicians.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.700
That kind of model doesn't
really work for science.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.050
Pack journalism, where science
journalists all

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.070
cover the same story.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.090
If you look in the papers today,
if there's a science

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.090
story, it'll be in all the
papers, it'll be on the news.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.660
They're all covering
the same stuff.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.790
They're not digging up
their own stories.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.360
Which is where we come to
churnalism, which is a great

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.010
term for journalists just
churning out stories.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.180
They get the press release,
they just completely

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.320
regurgitate it.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.460
They don't even ring up to
get their own quotes.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.940
They don't even dig
a bit deeper.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.780
They don't see if there's
anybody who's saying, hang on

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.190
a minute, this isn't
quite right.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.220
They churn it out.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.740
And so at the end of the
day, people say science

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.490
journalists, they're no longer
being journalists.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.260
Now what does this all matter?

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.680
My son was quite concerned that
wouldn't be big enough.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.360
I think that's quite big.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.716
It's a cartoon from
the States, but I

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:04.640
just quite liked it.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.360
You start out with
these scientists.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.610
Here he is saying, oh, A is
correlated with B, given C,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.610
assuming D, under
E conditions.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.700
So there's a bit of a
relationship between A and B,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.490
but there's all these
little caveats.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.050
But then it goes to
the press office.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.110
They put out a press
release about it.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.070
They're quite good about it,
because they say they find a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.150
potential link in there under
certain conditions.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.220
By the time it gets into the
news, onto the internet, A

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.010
causes B, then A causes
B all the time.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.110
What will this mean for Obama?

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.980
Sorry, this is an
American slide.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.230
Then it gets onto
the local news.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.220
What you don't know about
A can kill you.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.880
A: the killer amongst us.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.766
At the end of the day, your
grandma comes back to you as a

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.540
scientist, saying, I'm wearing
this hat to ward off A. So you

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.770
can see how something that
starts out quite measured goes

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.520
through the cycle and comes out
black and white: A causes

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.160
B.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.090
So what?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.360
So what does this really matter
if it's not completely

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.840
accurate, if the media kind of
misinterpret it to fit into

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.470
their model?

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.930
Well at worst, you can have
serious consequences for

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.080
public health.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.820
The example of MMR where there
were a number of reports all

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.160
about the fact that the
MMR vaccination

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.650
would lead to autism.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.850
And there was in the end a big
drop in the number of children

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.410
having the vaccination, a rise
in the number of measles

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.110
cases, and it did have
an effect on health.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.190
So that is quite a
serious effect.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.630
But what about non-health
stories, stories about physics

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.230
or chemistry, for example?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.070
Does it really matter if the
public don't understand the

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.285
full nitty-gritty of scientific
research, and if

00:06:31.285 --> 00:06:32.650
it's all slightly wrong?

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.990
And is it the job of the media
to be educating the

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.260
public in any case?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.220
Is that really their role?

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.580
Now what's an alternative
scenario?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.150
And this is something that's
happening at the moment,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.920
scientists going out there,
talking direct to the public

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.390
via blogs, via podcasts - the
opportunities the internet has

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.260
given to us.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.970
And scientific bodies doing
exactly the same thing, they

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.980
create their own news, so they
produce their own news about

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.290
their own work.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.700
And this is already,
as I say, happening

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.310
here and in the States.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.500
But think about this.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.070
Isn't that just self-serving
publicity by organisations

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.970
with their own agenda to promote
what they're doing?

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.750
What best serves the
public interest?

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.360
Are we better served by
journalists doing the job of

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.380
journalism, investigating,
criticising, getting to the

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.800
truth, or by scientists and
scientific institutions

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.710
telling their own story?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.580
So hearing it from the
horse's mouth.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.770
Also another thing
to think about.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.450
Who controls what appears
in the media?

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.290
The stories that are out there
today, who is actually sort of

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.760
making sure some story's
there, and some aren't?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.120
Is it the media itself, or is it
the science establishment?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.190
And who serves the public
interest better - if the

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.000
scientists are in control or
if the media in control?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.920
Now there's been a bit of a
shift here over the years, and

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.490
it used to be very much the
media were the gatekeepers of

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.420
the science that ended
up out there.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.390
But now because - there's
a number of

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.080
issues I've put here.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.360
There's probably all
sorts of different

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.320
factors involved in this.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.530
Multi-platform coverage -
journalists used to just have

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.670
to write a story.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.570
They now write the story, they
have to blog on it, they have

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.990
to do a video, they have to sing
the theme tune, write the

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.750
theme tune.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.910
There's just so much more
for them to do.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.540
They don't have time to go out
there, find their own stories.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.850
So because of that, the
science PR people, the

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.320
scientists, the scientific
organisations, they hold much

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.220
more power.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.000
They put out the information
there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.950
The journalists as we said, they
just regurgitate it, that

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.250
churnalism effect.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.720
So the power more in the hands
of the science establishment -

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.500
good or bad?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.710
And at the end of the day, the
biggest challenge, it all

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.200
comes down to money, which
most of these things do.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.940
And one of the biggest
challenges facing the media is

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.289
how we're going to fund
journalism into the future

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.600
when everything is
readily available

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.310
for free on the internet.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.910
So how are we going
to fund it?

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.760
And the first to go when there
will be cutbacks are the

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.040
specialist journalists, the
specialists being the science

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.140
journalists.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.680
So at the end of the day, how
might we fund those science

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.470
journalists if in fact
you feel that we

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.430
still do need them?

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.430
Or is it better that we just
hear everything straight from

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.350
scientists?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.290
So we're getting something
to think about.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:08.160
Anyway, a bit of a whistle stop
tour, and more questions

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.630
than answers, but that's
what I was told to do.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.780
So I hope that's given you
some food for thought.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.220
Thank you.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:26.497
