&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.870
[ Applause ]

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.340
&gt;&gt; Susan K. Siegel: Good afternoon.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.810
I have the privilege of welcoming
to the stage our very special

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.940
and talented interviewer
for this program.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.210 position:56%
He's one of the nation's leading
philanthropists, a tireless advocate

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.900
of reading and literacy, a great
friend to the Library of Congress,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.780
and the individual most
responsible for ensuring

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.500
that there is a National Book
Festival, year after year.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.610
David Rubenstein.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:45.910
[ Applause ]

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.210
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.510
Thank you very much.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.810
We have a special treat.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.340
We have, I think, the
world's most famous journalist

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.910
as our special guest, and just for
those who might have been living

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.200
under a rock for the past
35 or 40 years, briefly,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.500
Bob Woodward is the reporter
who, with Carl Bernstein,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.230
broke the Watergate story.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.630
Ultimately, the Washington Post
won a Pulitzer Prize for it.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.750
Bob has gone on to become the
role model for journalists all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.510
over the world, but since he
did that at the Washington Post,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.430
and he's still an associate
of the Washington Post,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.290
he has written sixteen books,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.080
twelve of them New York Times
bestseller, number one bestsellers.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.300
The only person who's ever written
twelve New York Times number one

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.150 position:56%
bestsellers, total sixteen books,
all of them, of course, bestsellers.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.650
His most recent book is, "The
Last of the President's Men,"

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.240 position:56%
which is about, a very interesting
story about some person was involved

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.820
in Watergate, and approached
Bob not long ago,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.120
and Bob has written about it.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.820
We're going to talk about that
book, talk about Bob's view

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.230 position:56%
on the campaign, and also talk
about his other books in his career.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.920
So, without any further ado,
let me introduce Bob Woodward.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.720
Bob.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:09.940
[ Applause ]

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.260
So, thank you very much for coming.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.560
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Thank you.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.070
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So, most people would think

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.670
that Watergate was kind of over
in the 1970's, or so forth.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.170
President Nixon resigned, you wrote
some books, there was a movie,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.490
you were played by Robert Redford.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.680
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You have no idea
how many women I've disappointed.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.850
[ Laughter ]

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.540
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay, I'm
sure that's not true, but, so...

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.990
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I could
tell you it's true.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.640
During that period, I would make a
date with someone over the phone,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.130
and then go see them, and they'd
open the door and go, huh?

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.540
[ Laughter ]

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.840
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So...

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.140
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I
know disappointment,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.730
because I've seen it [laughter].

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, we're
going to talk a little bit later

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.690
about what happened in early,
in the days of Watergate,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.150 position:56%
but I'd like to start about your new
book, because most people, like me,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.640
would say, "Well, Watergate
was kind of over."

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.390 position:56%
Anybody still involved in Watergate,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.460
we didn't really think they had
any information left to talk about,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.890
but then you got some information

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.250
from a very famous person
involved in Watergate.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.810
Could you explain how
that came about?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.110
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.500
Alexander Butterfield,
who was the Nixon aide

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.350
who disclosed the secret taping
system, and I'd just met him,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.130
but I saw him at one of these
conferences and said, you know,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.100
let's get together, and so
we talked, and I visited him

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.270
at is home in La Jolla, California.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.440
Always go to someone's
home if you can.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Because?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.080
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: If, if I
was doing a book on you,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.930
I'd want to come to where you live.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.170
Because I went to his home, and I
said, "Do you have any documents?"

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.680
And he said, "Yeah, I have
a few," and I said, "Well,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.160
can you get them out for me?"

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.730 position:56%
And so we filled 20 boxes [laughter]
of documents that he had spirited

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.370 position:56%
out of the Nixon White House, and 73
new documents, top-secret documents,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.950
things that we hadn't seen, and
foremost was a top-secret memo

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.700
that Henry Kissinger, Nixon's
national security advisor,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.000
had sent him, update on
Vietnam, and then Nixon,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.250
in his own handwriting said,
"Well, the bombing in Vietnam

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.570
for 10 years has achieved zilch.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.680
Nothing. That it's a failure."

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.540
And this totally contradicted the
public position and showed a level

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.190
of deceit on the warfront
that was equivalent

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.360
to the deceit of Watergate itself.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.930
Alex Butterfield had
been a military officer,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.180
and when he left the military,
he reconnected with, I think,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.530
Bob Haldeman, who had he had known
in college, and his job was to work

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.120
as an assistant to Bob Haldeman,
but what was his main job

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.180
in the White House, other than
being an assistant to Haldeman?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.170
Was he supposed to trail
Nixon, or what did he do?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.410
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well, he
had the office adjacent

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:18.360 position:56%
to Nixon's Oval Office, and his job,
essentially, was anxiety alleviation

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.300
of the President, and of course,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.520
Nixon's anxieties could
never be fully alleviated.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.140
So it was 24/7, and what
Nixon did, he, you know,

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.020
if he had something he wanted
done, somebody screwed,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.750
somebody investigated, you
know, Nixon essentially,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.570
we know from the tapes, and
this book even in more detail,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.670
he used the Presidency as an
instrument of personal revenge.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
Alexander Butterfield was,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.620
had the office next
to the President, and,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.490
for those who may not remember, in
the most dramatic part, I think,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.220
of the Watergate hearings in the
Senate, Butterfield was called

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.360
to testify, and he
was asked a question

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.020
about whether there
were taping devices

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.760
in the Oval Office,
and what did he say?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well, he was going,
he wasn't sure they were going

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.180
to ask that, he thought
they wouldn't.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.490
He resolved that if they asked a
direct question, he couldn't lie,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.850
because even though
he was not under oath,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.330
it's technically a
violation to lie to the FBI.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.430
Of course, no one ever
lies to the FBI [laughter],

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:40.590
or says they can't remember, and,
and no one, and it's a violation

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.160
of law, technically, to not tell
a Senate committee the truth,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.620 position:56%
and so when he was asked about this,
but, he knew it might be coming,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.960
and he was faced, and this is
part of the drama of this story,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.900
which we haven't seen before, he
was faced with a moral choice.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.420
Because Nixon's policy was,
"Oh, the tapes are sacred.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.910
No one's going to know about them.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.900
No one's ever going to find
out about them," and it was,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.400
you know, conceal, don't reveal.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.470
And so, when Butterfield
was asked this, he said yes,

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.240 position:56%
there were listening devices, and of
course that provided the thousands

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.850
of hours of Nixon's tapes.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.620
It led to his downfall and
resignation and then there are more

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.290
and more that come out
essentially each season,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.770
and we peer into the life
and the soul of Nixon

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.830
in a way we'd never seen
in another President.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: When Alex
Butterfield was asked in the Senate,

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.060
do you know if there's
a taping device,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.970
did the Senate investigator
already know the answer to that,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.610
had he already told
them prior to that?

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.910
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.320 position:56%
He had, well he had in a closed,
closed-door hearing he had told them

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.130
on the Friday before, but
they called him on Monday.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.020
Now, somebody told me that weekend
that Butterfield had come in

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.580
and said there were these
secret taping systems.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.520
I thought, wow, that's,
that's one hell of a story,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.480
and I was unsure what to do.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.190
So I called Ben Bradley, the
Editor of the Post, and said,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.310
"There's a secret taping
system, and what do you think?"

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.490
And Ben said, "Oh, well I
wouldn't bust one on it,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.040
and I think it's kind of a B plus."

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.230
So I didn't do anything, and then
Butterfield testified on Monday,

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.920
and it was explosive, and Ben, to
his credit, came by and knocked

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.580
on my desk and said, "Okay, it's
more than a B plus" [laughter].

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.050
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
if there had been no tapes,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.640
do you think Nixon would
have had to resign?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.940
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.020
I think, I think that the,
what happened in the trajectory

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.220
of Watergate, there
were all the hearings,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.480
there were all the accusations,
there were some documents,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.980
but Nixon denied everything,
and when the investigators asked

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.890
for the tapes, they
had to go to court,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.950
and eventually the
Supreme Court said, 8 to 0,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.030
because one of the Justices
recused himself, said, "No,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.050
you have an obligation
to turn over your tapes,"

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.570
within two weeks, Nixon
had resigned.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
when Butterfield testified,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.300
was he working the
White House at the time?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.480
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No, he
was FAA Commissioner.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.030
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And was
his career essentially terminated

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.410
by the people who were
his supporters,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.570
because he had told this?

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.850
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes, I
mean, he paid a price.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.330
He went to California, here
he was kind of a Nixon guy,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.710
and he had broken omerta,
the oath of silence,

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:04.110
and it led to Nixon's downfall, and
so he, Butterfield, was ostracized,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.130
and that is part of the story
here of the penalty, you know,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.520
we think we have a
culture of truth-telling.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.250
Actually, we don't.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.990
When somebody tells the truth,
they, and it harms others,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.220
and it has political impact,

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.130
the truth-tellers pay,
and Butterfield did.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, he
gave you twenty boxes of documents,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.650
he didn't say, don't write about
this or that, he just said here,

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.440
do what you want with
them, more or less?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.860
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah, more or
less, and I put them in the book.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.300
There were about 70
pages of the documents,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:43.430
so you can see Nixon's handwriting
or, you know, what was going on,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:49.220
and it, it's, it is, to me,
I thought we knew everything

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:57.150
about Nixon, but this is a new
layer of the deceit and the anger,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.530
which it just does not subside.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now, in
your career, have you ever met,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.070
did you ever meet Richard Nixon?

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.370
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.310
I was not on his Christmas
card list.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.740
[ Laughter ]

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.980
I was on another list
though [laughter].

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And, and
did you ever try to get an interview

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.080
with him when he went
back to [inaudible]?

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.380
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes,
yes, Carl Bernstein

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.640
and I did many times,
and he declined.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.940
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.880
So let's go talk about the current
election campaign, if we could.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.710
You have, you're still
covering this campaign,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.550
and you've covered
many political kinds

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.720
of leadership, leaders
over the years.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.440
Right now, tell us your
view on Hillary Clinton,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.490
do you think that she and
Donald Trump, for example,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.500
both of them are older than most
people who are elected President

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.800
of the United States, generally.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.650
Do you think age is a
factor in this campaign?

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.520
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You know, well, I
don't know, but it's interesting.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.360
President Obama, who now will
leave the Presidency at age 55,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.740
has said privately that the Office

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:08.830
and being President has taken a
psychological and physical toll

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.740
on him that he did not
anticipate, and physically,

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.380
he was not getting enough
exercise, not walking enough,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.250
and so he had a new
treadmill installed

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.890
in the White House residence,
and each night he gets on it

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:27.890
for about an hour or hour
and a half, and the top aides

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.990
who send him written material,
memos, have to make sure it's

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:39.160 position:56%
in large type, so he can be on the
treadmill and read at the same time,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.790
and he has indicated to people

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.850
that because the Presidency
is different now

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:53.060
than it was during the Nixon era,
it's 24/7, everything comes at you.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.260
I, I think Presidents have
a concentration of power.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:06.700 position:56%
Now Obama does much more than Nixon
did, and if you were to say what is,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.870
this is the age of the
American Presidency.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.930
We in this country,
and in the world,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.780
get measured by how
the President does.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.260
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So this,
what you just said is private,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.120
so nobody should talk
about what you just said

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.390
about the President's
private habits.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.430
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes, right,
that's off the record.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Off the record.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.030
Okay [laughter].

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.330
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: And, and
you know what it means,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.440
off the record means you absolutely

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.450
and totally cannot use it unless
it's really good [laughter].

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, actually
for some people [inaudible].

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.780
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: And
that's not really, I mean,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.460
that's not surprising that, I mean,
you see Obama, you know, Obama,

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.240
you see him, has he aged?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.540
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.490
I'd say he has more gray
hair than he used to have.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.790
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well,
how about you?

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,
my hair is dark, I dye it gray.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.820
I want people to think
I'm more mature.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.160
That's the reason.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.460
But...

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.760
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Does it work?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.060
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Hasn't worked yet,

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.360
but hope is, hope springs eternal.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.010
So, let me ask you, you have
interviewed Donald Trump.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.310
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:12.910
Any impressions you
would like to convey?

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.600
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: This
was five months ago.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:21.240
Bob Costa, reporter at the Post,
and I interviewed him, and,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.630
first of all, he wanted to
kind of do this on the phone,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.280
and we said no, we
want do it in person.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.490
I've never really met anyone
who has the capacity to measure,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:40.470
in the moment, the reaction he's
generating among the people he's

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.770
talking to.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.810
Other words, the reaction
to himself.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:50.220
And so, he's, face-to-face, very
careful, not hostile, not angry.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:57.210
But in the text of the interview,
he said some things that, I mean,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.850
let me confess I thought
afterwards, you know,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:07.620
maybe that these things are
so raw that it will hurt him

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.070
or maybe finish him, because one,
one of the things he said was,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.300
"I bring out rage in people."

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.520
And he said that with pride.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.020
Now, I mean, you worked for
Jimmy Carter and, you know, you,

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.440
Presidents have to
bring people together.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.970
Camp David Accords was an example
of, you, you can't be President

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.180
and bring out rage in
people, but he does,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.960
and he thinks it's a good thing.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.900
We asked him about the economy, and
he said he thought we were going

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.960
to have an awful recession.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:56.090
Asked him about Lincoln and
Nixon, two Republicans, and why,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:01.130
we asked him, why did
Lincoln succeed as President?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.760
And he went, gave a long
rambling answer, and said, well,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:12.970
Lincoln succeeded because he did
things that needed to be done.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.600
Now, if you were in high school,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.640
and you wrote that on
an exam [laughter]...

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So...

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.750
[ Applause ]

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.050
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I mean, look.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:30.430
I mean, that's, he did things
that needed to be done.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.730
Like what?

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.380
I get, we didn't, we were I think
embarrassed to ask [laughter].

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.340
And so why did Nixon fail?

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.690
And he went on a little bit,
and he said, well, basically,

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.240
because of his personality
[laughter].

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.100
And we couldn't, I'm sorry, I
couldn't help but say but yeah,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.650
but he was a criminal [laughter].

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.850
And, and Trump said, "Oh,
that too" [laughter].

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.790
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, now,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.800
have you interviewed
Hillary Clinton lately?

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.100
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.790
She, I'm, on not the
Christmas card list.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.420
So she won't...but you've
interviewed her in previous times?

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.720
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And your impression?

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.520
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: And my
impression is, I interviewed her

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.690
when she was First Lady, and
she was so open and candid

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:22.630
in describing how her husband
decided to run for President.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.460
I asked how, and she
said, oh, I know.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.950
And explained how was her idea
that he run for President.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:38.090
And, I, I was astonished that she
would take the credit for this,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.220
but it, we checked, and it's true.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.830
She was the one who said,
in 1991, to him, "This,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.140 position:56%
if you run, this will be your time."

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.690
And he said, "Oh, no, it'll be
a dry run," and she said, "No,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.840
you will win, but you're,
it's going to be hard

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.430
because the Republicans are
going to come after you,"

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:05.570 position:56%
and there will be what she called a
"pain threshold" that we have to go,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.610
we're going to have to
go through, and over.

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:15.570
And, and I've seen her before,
and she is a different person.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.320
I mean, whether it's that, I mean,
you know, is she different in

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.070
and what we see on television,
from what you have seen?

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.490
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I'm
going to ask the questions,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.380
because people want to hear
your opinion [laughter].

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.920
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No, I asked that
question, and let it be noted

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.690
that you didn't answer [laughter].

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.040
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
I think people want

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.570
to hear your views
on things, not mine.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.040
But let me start back.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.400
You come from a family in the
Midwest, your father was a judge.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.580
Many people who are
judges would probably

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.910
like to have their children
be lawyers, too, maybe judges.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.210
You went to Yale.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.860
School that probably
produces more lawyers

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.900
and business people
than journalists.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.390
Did you know you wanted to be a
journalist when you went to Yale?

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.690
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.920 position:56%
And I served in the Navy five years
after college, and I was going to go

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.830
to law school, and I thought,
"Oh my God, I'll be, you know,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.630
30 years old when I
get out of law school.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.310
That's the end of life [laughter].

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.400
And so, I went into, to
journalism, and I told my father,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.090 position:56%
"I've got a job at this weekly paper
in Montgomery County, Maryland,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.850
that pays 115 dollars a
week, and I'm going to do

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.550
that instead of going
to law school."

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.090
My father, who was a
really open-minded person

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:41.720
who didn't make judgments,
said, "You're crazy."

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.600
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
you did that for a while,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.150
and then you got a little bit of
a tryout with the Washington Post.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.640
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Which I failed.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So you
had two weeks or something, or...

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah, two-week
tryout, and I wrote lots of stories,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.620
none of which they published,
and they said, you know, see,

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.820
you don't know how to
do this, which is true.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.240
And, and so I worked at the...

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.540
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.840
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Montgomery
[inaudible].

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
You worked in Montgomery,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.440
and eventually the Post
gave you another chance,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.290
and you went back, and
that was 1971, or 2.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.590
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes, yes.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: '71.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.190
So, when you get back
there, and you're assigned

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.490
to the metropolitan area?

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.180
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Right,
to the night police beat.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.610
So, which is not usually a
way to advance your career,

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.510
right, the night police beat?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.360
So, how did it actually happen
that you, as opposed to any

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.760 position:56%
of the other 500 reporters there,
were assigned to Watergate break-in?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.770
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I'd
been there nine months.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.700
I really loved it.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.970
I did the night police beat,
I would come in during the day

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:45.200
and do stories, do follow-up
stories, and you can't,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.600
I can't really capture for you
completely, being in the Navy

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.620
where it's controlled,
where you have no freedom.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.850
The Washington Post, at that
time, and I think now, you know,

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.950
it's a reporter's newspaper, and
if you can find out something

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.850
and do something, you, you're
supported by the editors.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:15.060 position:56%
And so, the morning of the Watergate
burglary was this Saturday morning,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.170
June 17, '72 was one of the
nicest days in Washington, by far,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.480
and the editors met,
they, this burglary was,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.680
looked like a police story, and
they said, who would be dumb enough

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.790
to come in and work this morning?

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.950
And immediately my name
came up [laughter].

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:35.260
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
They called you to come in?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.420
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah, and
they called me to come in,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.770
and I went to the arraignment,
and the judge,

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.020
and here are the five
burglars in business suits.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.900 position:56%
Now, I'd covered the police beat
for nine months, and I'd never heard

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.540
of a burglar with a business suit
[laughter], let alone five of them,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:22:00.540
and they stood there, and
the judge asked the head,

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.190
James McCord, where did you work?

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.200
And McCord went, [whispered] "CIA."

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.530
And the Judge said, "Speak up."

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.960 position:56%
And he said, [louder whisper] "CIA."

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.410
And the Judge said, "Speak up."

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.900
And he said, "CIA," and I
was sitting in the front row

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.610
and I think I said
out loud, "Holy shit!"

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.130
[ Laughter ]

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.940
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Did
the judge hear you say that?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.610
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No, I don't think
he did but, and, and, you know,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.600
this, and it turned out this guy
was Head of Security at the CIA,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.530
the Head of Security of the
Nixon Reelection Committee.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.830
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But at that point,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.130
you didn't think this was a story

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.580
that would really touch
Nixon, I assume.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.590
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah,
you just, you never knew.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.560
Bernstein knew.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.000
He had a nose for it, that
quite frankly, I didn't.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
you began to develop the story,

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.520
but for many months, people were
skeptical this was anything more

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.670
than a break-in by some,
you know, rogues, let's say,

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.090
and nobody thought, really,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.040
that it was Nixon behind
it, is that correct?

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.360
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Other than Carl.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:11.060 position:56%
So, but, you began to go do a lot of
research, and you published stories,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.250
many of them were used stories
that were, there were cited sources

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.700
that wouldn't, you
couldn't disclose.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.670
Was that a novel thing at
the time, the, to not be able

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.710
to disclose those sources?

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.960
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: It
happened a lot in diplomatic

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:30.700
and political reporting, but we
instituted a two-source rule, and,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:38.290
but at the same time, as you look
back on this, it was very risky,

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.650
not for Carl and myself,
we were young.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.440
I could have maybe
still gone to law school

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.910
if it'd turned out not to be true.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.950
And, but the risk was
borne by the editors,

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.210
and particularly Ben Bradley,
and the owner, Catherine Graham.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, when
you began to write some stories

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.870
that turned out not to be accurate,

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.960
and was proven they weren't
accurate, did you get in trouble?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.420
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah, well
we got, we made some mistakes,

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.020
but they were mistakes in form.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.110 position:56%
Actually, the, if you looked at the
coverage, the stories as people had,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.980
they were very conservative,
and careful,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.340
and unintentionally understated.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, where
were the other major newspapers?

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.740 position:56%
I mean, you and Carl Bernstein get a
lot of credit, maybe all the credit,

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.580 position:56%
for breaking this story, but where
were all the other major newspapers,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.880
what were they doing?

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.510
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well,
it was a police story.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:36.340
You had to go, and, and, quite
frankly, it was Carl Bernstein

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.450
who had the, "Well,
these people won't talk,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.770
so we have to go see them at
home, and knock on their doors,

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.180
and that's what, what we did, and
we got clues, and we had Mark Felt,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.450
who was Deep Throat, the
number two in the FBI,

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:57.220 position:56%
guiding us in a very secret way, and
we kept finding pieces of the puzzle

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.520
that said, "No, wait a minute.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.860
Watergate isn't just one thing.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.800
It's a series of sabotage

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.430
and espionage operations
launched by Nixon."

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now, in the movie,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.800
there's a famous thing
about Deep Throat.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.780
And where that name
come from, by the way?

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.370
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: The Managing
Editor of the Post, Howard Simons,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.980
if it was on deep background,
and so, Howard says, "Oh yeah,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.390
your guy 'Deep Throat, '" and
so the name stayed around.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.940
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So, did you actually go

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.700
into the garage and all that?

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.000
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.300
Exactly as...

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.600
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And he was not worried

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.190
that you would disclose his name?

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:35.680
Obviously not, I guess, but...

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I think he probably
was worried but I, you know,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.100
we'd made an agreement, you
know, you make those agreements

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.390
with somebody and try
to stick to them.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, Mark
Felt, who was the Deputy Head

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.510
of the FBI, but wanted to be
the head of the FBI, presumed,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.040
what was his reason
for talking to you?

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.200
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Complicated,
like all human motivation.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.840
Some high road, some high
purpose, that this was too corrupt,

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.230
and at the same time,
he was very upset

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.000
that he did not get
selected to be FBI Director.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So, most people, let's say,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.070
were playing the parlor game for
20 or 30 years, Who is Deep Throat?

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.150
So, when people would come
up to you and say well,

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.060
can you just tell me
privately who it is,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.360
I'll just, I won't tell anybody?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.380
Did that happen a lot, and
did people get accused of it,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.000
and they were being accused of
it, and you knew they weren't it,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.570
but how did you handle all that?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.690
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Sometimes, couple
of people were accused and said,

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.730
you know, I can't get a
job unless you call the guy

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.900
and say it wasn't me.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:46.330
And but, you know, it was, I mean,
we agreed, and I told my wife,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:54.010
and Bradley knew, and it, I mean, I
hate to be so practical about this,

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.710
but when there was this parlor
game, and I'd go interview people,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.880
and I remember going to see a
Senator about a sensitive subject,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.500
and he said, "Oh, my wife said
to me," you know, "He never told

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.140
who Deep Throat was, so he's not
going to tell who you are," and so,

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.130
it, it helped in the
work, that people knew.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.360
what is the journalists'
convention on this?

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.420
Let's suppose Mark Felt had
died, and once he's deceased,

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:29.500 position:56%
do you feel an obligation to protect
his identity is no longer around?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.750
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I think
once somebody is deceased,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.500
they're not going to
object [laughter].

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.780
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Right [laughter].

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.140
So, how did, you know, the
previous book you wrote talked

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.440
about Mark Felt.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.080
You identified him, and
how did that come about?

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.010
At what age did he actually say,
"Okay, you can use my name now?"

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.390
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: He didn't.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:52.770
What happened, he, he
unmasked himself in 2005 and,

00:27:52.770 --> 00:28:01.180
to Vanity Fair magazine, and so
we had make sure that he was,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:08.470 position:56%
because he was old and frail, and I
wrote what had happened in book form

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:13.510
to be published after he
died, but it actually turned

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.190
out to be a good thing,
because it was a mystery,

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.650
and people were confused by it.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:23.350
There was some doubt, and to
remove that doubt, I thought,

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:28.100
was important to the story,
and to the history of this.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
you wrote a book called,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.440
"All the President's Men," and
that was made into a movie,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.050
and we mentioned Bob Woodward
played you, and so forth.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.590
But then you wrote another
book about that period of time,

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.700
which was, "The Last,"
"The Final Days," I guess.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.110
Now, can you describe what
were the most surprising things

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.720
that you learned about in the final
days of Nixon's White House time?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.110
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: This
was about his last year,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:57.270
while he was under investigation,
and leading to the resignation.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:01.910
It, it showed how much it
was a lawyering operation.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.730
It showed how emotional it was.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:09.590
The night before Nixon resigned, he
had a meeting with Henry Kissinger

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.280
when they got down on the floor
and prayed, and you could see that,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.360
we published this in the book, and
I remember Kissinger denied it,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.690
and then, and said oh, you know,
there was this unfeeling account

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:32.470
of that evening together with
Nixon, which has showed Nixon

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.220
out of control, and then Kissinger
wrote his own version of that

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.200
in his memoirs, and it's
actually more searing.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.500
He said Nixon wasn't out of
control, just he was shattered,

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:53.340
and it was very sad and, you
know, what we often forget

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:59.140
in reporting is the emotional
impact of these political events,

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.240
and that was kind of
the culmination.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
how often does it happen

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.780
that somebody calls you up when
you're a reporter, and says,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.950
"I have a great scoop for you,"
and it turns out not to be much,

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.250
or it turns out to be great.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.550
I mean, did somebody...?

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.850
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Never enough.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.150
David M. Rubenstein: Never enough?

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.450
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Right.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But, do you ever get...?

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.050
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Somebody
called me from the White House

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.350
when you worked there,
do you remember this?

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
I do remember that.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.950
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Do you
want me to bring it up?

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I do
remember, and it was painful, but...

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.550
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Okay, about a
memo that David wrote to Carter

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:35.250
about OPEC, the oil monopoly, and
you suggested that the strategy

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.870
for dealing with OPEC was what?

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.170
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: To
blame it on Bob Woodward?

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.470
I don't remember, but...

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.770
[laughter].

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.070
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No, no [laughter].

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: No, what,
actually what it was, was...

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.390
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Was to declare
war on them, essentially, yes.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: At the time,
he was stopping back from a trip

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.200
to Japan, he was in
Hawaii, and they were going

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.350
to spend a couple days there,
and I think that sense was

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.200
that he should come back and
deal with the energy problem,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.500
and deal with it directly.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.800
That, I think that was
the essence of the memo,

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.620
but I'm not sure the reporter got
it right, but anyway [laughter].

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.600
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes, I'm sure,
and it was the language of,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.740
"Let's declare war on it, on OPEC."

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:14.580
Which, you know, I mean we
did a big banner story on it,

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.450
and that made you famous.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.290
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I don't
know about that [laughter].

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.320
So, let me ask you about
another related subject.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.270
After you did those two
books, you were given access

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.040
to a famous person,
and you came out of it,

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.610
it wasn't in the political
world, it was John Belushi,

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.780
and you wrote a book
about John Belushi,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.970
and it seemed like it was a painful
experience, because everybody

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.200
who kind of knew him then said
your book was not accurate.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.720
And, can you describe
what that was about?

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.850
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Actually they
never said it was not accurate.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:51.290
They said it didn't show the good
side of him, the joyful side.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.670
You know, look.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:59.400
It, it was a drug overdose death.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.560
He was a drug addict.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.500
These people who were close to
him knew he was a drug addict.

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.430
They gave him money to buy drugs.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:14.090
They fed it, because that was part
of the Belushi show, and they were,

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:18.860
I don't think the term was used
in the 80's, drug enablers,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:25.640
and they felt guilty about it, and
what I did it all on the record.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:31.180
They were all confessional
about, you know, what they did,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:37.280
and the end result was tragic
and sad, and they didn't like it,

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.470
and they, I think some

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.010
of them thought they should
blame me, the messenger.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.280
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Your next
book was about the Supreme Court,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.540
and that's a place
that very few people,

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.440
maybe nobody ever really
got access to the Justices.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.050
How did you get access to the
Justices, or their Clerks, and,

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.470
and how did that come about, and
what did you learn in that book

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.900
that was really most interesting?

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.210
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: It was sitting
there, the, you know, the Court,

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:09.080 position:56%
how does it really function, and one
of the Justices, Justice Stewart,

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.040
kept wanting, I wanted to talk to
him, I finally came to his house,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.010
and he outlined the brethren,
and he was quite angry

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.710 position:56%
at Chief Justice Burger, and we
realized this is an important story.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:28.560
We got five of the Justices
to cooperate, 1 40 law clerks,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.620
boxes of documents, of
drafts and memos, and it,

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:39.410
it was kind of a shock to the
legal community when it came out,

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.770
and it was denounced, and
now people acknowledge

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:48.150
that it's the most severe
critics say it was accurate.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:54.870
And, you know, it, it's,
it's not a pretty story

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.230
when you say the Supreme Court,
that decides what the law is,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:05.060 position:56%
or interprets the law, that personal
animus and some of the things

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.540
that drive most human
beings one way or another,

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.490
plays a role, and it does.

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.170
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
another book you wrote dealt

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:17.390
with the Iran Contra situation,
and your, and Bill Casey,

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.870
and do you think President
Reagan knew about Iran Contra?

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.240
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: There is no
evidence, and I did a later book

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:28.380
on that, and dealt with the
lawyers who investigated Reagan,

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:34.310 position:56%
White House lawyers, and, and they
concluded, and I think that's right,

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:40.520
there was no evidence that he knew
about illegal diversion of profits

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.460
from the Iran arms sales
to the Nicaraguan...

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now, in
that book you were criticized

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.020 position:56%
by some people for saying you had a
lot of conversation with Bill Casey,

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.310
and people said Casey
couldn't really talk that much,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.480 position:56%
and you visited him in the hospital.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.280
How did you respond
to those critics?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.420
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well, there's
a CIA Inspector General's report

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.830
that they documented, that
I talked to Casey in person

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.000
or on the phone 48 times.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.600 position:56%
And I wrote about seeing Casey in
the hospital, and he spoke, I think,

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.750
19 words to me in four or five
minutes, and then Bob Gates,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:28.600
who was his deputy who became the
CIA director after Casey resigned,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.280
wrote in his own memoir that he
talked to Casey at the same time,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.050 position:56%
and that you could understand Casey.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.350
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Let's
talk about President Bush.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.890
You wrote a book about the
war that we did in Kuwait,

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.870
and that was "The Commanders."

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.640
And in that war, what, who do you
think the hero was that really came

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.950
up with the strategy that
won that war in Kuwait?

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.460
Was it Colin Powell, was it
Schwarzkopf, was it President Bush?

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.740
And what went so well
in that particular war?

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.670
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well, when we look
back, I was somewhat of a critic

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.150
of the war and whether it
was necessary at the time,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:11.260
but the genius of the war was, it
was quick, lasted about 40 days,

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.260
minimal US casualties, and
it accomplished the mission

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:23.900 position:56%
of getting Saddam's Iraqi Republican
Guard and forces out of Kuwait,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.880
and sending them, and
they went back to a Iraq.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:35.960 position:56%
So, the genius of it, or who's the
hero in the end, was President Bush,

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.300
who put it all together, used
diplomacy, went to Congress

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.690
to get authority, but also listened
to Colin Powell, who was chairman

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:50.590
of the Joint Chief, saying, we
need 500,000 troops to do this.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So, when you write books

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.000
like the ones we just talked
about, how long does it take you

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.850
to do the research, and how long
does it take you to do the writing,

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.840
and do you do all the
research and then write,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.130
or do you research,
write, research, write?

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.660
What's your style?

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.560
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You want
to do a lot of research,

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.450
and then start writing early.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:12.040
Sometimes I call it a premature
draft, so you see what's missing,

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.950
and then you go back and
do more interviewing.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.250
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Do you write it

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.670 position:56%
out longhand, do you use a computer?

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.250
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I use a computer.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And when
you use a computer, do you show it

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.270
to an editor early on, or do
you just keep it for a while

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.570
until you're ready to show it?

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:30.160
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I show it to,
my, I have an assistant or two,

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:36.740 position:56%
and to my wife, Elsa, who's the
best editor around, and I, you know,

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.290
it's a process of, you, you
add to it and then I show it.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:45.620
Alice Mayhew at Simon &amp; Schuster
has been my editor on all 18 books.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.700
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
some people have a theory,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.120 position:56%
it's maybe my theory, that if you're
a journalist and you're writing

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.870
for a daily publication,
let's say the Washington Post,

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.360
somebody might be less
inclined to talk to you,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.410
because whatever they say might
be in the newspapers the next day,

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.650
but if you're talking to a
book author, you figure, well,

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.240
this will be coming out in a year
or two, and I won't care about it.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.660
Do you think that's true or not?

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.660
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I think
no, it's somewhat true,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.220
and they realize you're talking

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.050
to other people, and
it, it gets around.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:19.150
I mean, even the Obama White House,
I've done two books on Obama,

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.990
and people would say,
okay, he's working on this,

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.840
he's got these memos or
documents, or the accounts

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.790
of what happened at meetings.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But
the, do you ever say to people,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.170
"I'm talking to X, they've
authorized me to say

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.470
that they're talking to me,"

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.770
or do you never tell
anybody who you've talked to?

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.020
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: It depends,
some people are willing to talk

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.060
on the record, most just on
background, except Presidents.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.690
When you interview a President,
I don't think you can talk

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.850
to a President on background.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:53.420
So when I've interviewed Bush or
Obama it's always on the record.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.710
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, for
people who may not be familiar

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.140
with the journalist terms, "Off
the record" means, again...

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.490
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You can't use it.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:01.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
You can't use it any time.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:05.330
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well, except it
doesn't mean you can't find it

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.430
out elsewhere, and because
you can't, you know,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.580
flush it out of your
mind, and so sometimes,

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.620
people think off the record means
it's, I'm never going to see this

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.630
in print, and they're shocked when
they do, and you have to explain,

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:23.450
yeah, you told me about this, but
I found out from somebody else,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.410
and then you want to find out more.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.310
So they know, okay, you got it...

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
And that's off the record.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.270
What is background?

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:34.390
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Background
means that you're going to use it

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.590
and not say where it came from.

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
What's deep background?

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.540
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Means you're
really going to just kind of say it

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.360
like it came out of the air.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay, and on
the record means that they can clean

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:48.990
up the quotes, or they
get to approve the quotes?

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.290
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No, it means,

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.150
it's on the record,
you're going to use it.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.990
Sometimes people want to
go, want you to come back.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:59.520
I'm not really in love
with that process,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.630
because you then get people
wandering and cleaning up,

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.360
and you want what they
really said and meant.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So
when you interview somebody,

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.360
do you write notes, or do you tape?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.530
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I tape as much as
I can with the person's knowledge,

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.460
and it's amazing how
all of a sudden,

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.090
that tape recorder goes away, you
would think it would cause people

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:27.430
to freeze up, but it doesn't,
because they know, okay,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.550
I'm not going to give that, I mean,
I've got transcripts of interviews

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:39.740
from people over decades that I've
used in books, and if you look

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.300
at these or listened, you
might really be surprised

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.500
at the clarity and
the, forthrightness.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.800
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
When you're taping somebody,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.810
do you ever make the mistake I
do, you push the wrong button

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.760
and it doesn't, the tape doesn't
work, or does it always work?

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.650
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yeah,
it's happened once.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.250
The tape ran, the battery ran out.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now, you've interviewed,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.480
you never interviewed Nixon.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.780
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.080
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But you
did interview President Ford?

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.380
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: What was
your impression of President Ford?

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.980
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You know,
Gerald Ford turned out,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:16.910
I thought when he went, September
1974, he'd been President

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:21.560 position:56%
for one month, went on TV
announcing, he, on a Sunday morning,

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.320
giving Nixon a full pardon for
Watergate, I didn't see that.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.430
I was asleep that morning, and
Carl Bernstein called me up,

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:33.150
and said, "Have you heard?"

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.320
And I said, "I haven't heard
anything, I was asleep," and Carl,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:42.890 position:56%
truly the ability to say things with
the fewest words and the most drama,

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:47.310
said, "The son of a bitch
pardoned the son of a bitch."

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
[laughter] Okay.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.860
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: And
even I was able to figure

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.370
out what had happened [laughter].

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:58.420
And I thought, ah, it's the
perfect corruption, of, you know,

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.890
Nixon's the one behind all
this, he gets a pardon.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.460
There was an aroma of a deal,
I later for the book "Shadow,"

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.960
25 years later, met Ford and
interviewed him for the first time.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:19.320
Kept going back to him, and
he really explained what,

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.370
what happened, and
what is important is I,

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:28.990
I think what Ford did was really
courageous rather than corrupt.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.220
He had to move on beyond Watergate.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.130
The only way to do it was pardon
Nixon, because Nixon was going

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:40.240
to be investigated, certainly
charged, might go to trial,

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.230
might go to jail, and as
Ford said, we'd have two

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.660
or three more years of Watergate.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.350
The country couldn't stand it.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: You
think had he not pardoned Nixon,

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.860
he would've been reelected?

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.540
Or elected?

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.040
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Ford?

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.600 position:56%
You know, I don't, I mean, obviously
that's, if history, you don't know

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.520
but Ford, in having the luxury
of time, I could go visit him

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.090
at his home in Colorado,
or in California,

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:13.420
and I think we peeled the onion
on that pretty completely,

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:19.090
and what was a shock to
me was how wrong I had it.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.770
I thought it was the
absolute corruption,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:27.930
and the Kennedy library gave him
the profiles in courage award

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:33.870
for pardoning Nixon,
and I watch that and I,

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.050
it's true, it was a cold shower.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:42.680
And then I realized, you know,
how humbling, how, to be honest,

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.850
humiliating it was, because
I was sure it was corrupt,

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.460
and then you examine
it 25 years later,

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.390
and it's the precise opposite.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:44:01.350
It's courage, and so that puts
a, puts you, your judgmental,

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.280
the part of your head,
in slow motion.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.430
Don't rush to judgments.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.080
You may have it absolutely wrong.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.180
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Did you
ever interview President Carter?

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.480
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And what was
your impression of President Carter?

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.300
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Well,
the first interview

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.860
with him was his first
month in office,

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.030
when I found out that King Hussein

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.560
of Jordan had been
on the CIA payroll.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.210
And we called the White House,

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.940
and I remember Jody Powell
was the Press Secretary.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.610
I hadn't covered the
campaign, and I said,

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:41.220
there's a secret operation
of paying King Hussein.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.600
The CIA does it, and the
operation is called "No Beef."

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:53.070
And I remember Jody
Powell going, "No shit!"

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:57.020
We didn't deal with stuff like
that in Georgia, and then he said,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.510
"You and Bradley come see Carter
tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock,"

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:05.600
and Carter, off the
record, confirmed it, and,

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.330
but Ben asked him, will
it harm national security

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:11.630
if we publish this?

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.200
And Carter said no.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.560
And of course Brzezinski, who
wasn't invited to the meeting,

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:25.510
went nuts afterwards, and, and
we published it, and Carter went

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.490
up to the hill and and said some
things that were not factual,

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:37.720
and I was distressed that again,
after all of Nixon's saying things

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.940
that were not true, I was
distressed that Carter kind

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.160
of couldn't face up
to what happened.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.050
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Did
you ever interview Reagan?

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.350
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: No.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.690
No. He would never do an interview.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.350
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And did
you interview George Herbert

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.650
Walker Bush?

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:55.000
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: He would
never do an interview.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.090 position:56%
He had been Republican National
Committee Chairman during Watergate,

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:05.160
and I wasn't on his Christmas
card list either [laughter].

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Did you
ever interview Bill Clinton?

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:08.910
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Oh yes.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.440
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
your impression of Bill Clinton?

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:16.350
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Oh, Clinton,
what an interesting interview.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:21.120
It was, I think he'd been, it
was '94, I was doing the book,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.330
"The Agenda," on his
economic policy.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:29.570
It was a background interview,
but he's talked about it, and,

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:33.590
and what you go into the Oval
Office, and he drills you

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:39.150
with this eye contact that is
almost a gravitational force.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.360
I've never known it, I
mean, he doesn't blink.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:48.190
Now, you blink all the time.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.880
I blink all the time.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.380
Well, I think, ever since he
was five, he decided he wanted

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.960
to be President, and realized,
contribute every organ in the body

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.040
to the task [laughter]
including your eyes.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Alright.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.800
Bob Woodward: And so, it
creates that sense of intimacy,

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.810
slows time down just a little
bit, and did this interview,

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:17.870
and I thought oh, because it's,
you are the only person who exists,

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:23.960
and it, no blink, focus,
gives paragraph answers,

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.440
and I was thinking, oh, he
realizes how brilliant my questions

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.630
are [laughter].

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.800
And I left the interview
thinking, this, you know,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.420
what a great interview, such
insight, I can use all this,

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:43.840
and then I read, had a transcript
made, and read the transcript

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.030
without the eye contact,
and it was mush [laughter].

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.240
But, but it sure felt
good [laughter].

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:58.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So did
you ever interview George W. Bush?

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Oh yes, many times.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.920
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Your impression of him?

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.220
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Four books.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:10.250
Bush was, he agreed to be
interviewed extensively for hours,

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:17.370 position:56%
two, three hours, four hours, three
of the four books I did on his wars,

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:22.350
and there was always little
pushback, but I have 300 pages

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:27.070 position:56%
of transcript of those interviews,
which were almost all on the record,

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:31.750
and I'm going to publish them
someday, because you see, there,

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:39.000
in his odd way, there's a lot of
candor, there's some defensiveness,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.800
particularly about the Iraq
war, but I think when people say

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:54.210
that on the Iraq war that he lied,
I spent a year and a half on this,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:57.630
and talked to everyone, and
got notes and documents.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:03.070
I think he made a tragic mistake,
I think the CIA, George Tenet,

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.600
telling Bush it was a slam
dunk that there were weapons

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:13.280
of mass destruction in Iraq,
the CIA made a terrible mistake,

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.340
but I don't think it was a lie.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:20.600
I think it was a tragedy, and
if you go through all the steps,

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.140
you kind of come up, gee, you know,

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.960
he should've realized it was
not necessary to go to war,

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.290 position:56%
but there was a momentum and he, you
know, he had the support of people

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:36.100 position:56%
like Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton,

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.940
who voted to give them the
authority to go to war.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, have
you interviewed President Obama?

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.040
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Yes.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.200
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And what is
your impression of President Obama?

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.100
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Very smart.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:52.960
Likes, you know, he, look at the
world, media world, he lives in,

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:58.030
the few questions and, and so
forth a lot of softball interviews.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:03.120
I sent him a, I think,
12-page single-spaced memo of,

00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.120 position:56%
I understand this is what happened,
these were the meetings, the issues,

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:13.140
the discussions, and I want to
interview you, and he, he agreed,

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.670
and I think he agreed because he
knew he was going to get his say.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.990 position:56%
And he gets his say, it doesn't mean
that there isn't criticism of some

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:28.090
of these things, he's very much
on top of the job, I mean, I just,

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:32.930
I have a little technique when
I'm interviewing somebody.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:39.260 position:56%
I take this finger and put it over
this finger and dig it into the nail

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:47.230
so it hurts, and it tells me to
shut up when I'm asking questions.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:53.630
And just as the CIA, they say, "Let
the silence suck out the truth,"

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:57.930
sometimes you just have to
shut up, and so, with Obama,

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:03.420
he likes to talk, and so I do
this and shut up, and he will,

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.390
would say things, like, just
out of the blue he said, "Oh,

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.960
what do you think I
worry about the most?"

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:14.210
Now what do you think Obama
worries about the most?

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.960
What's the big worry?

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.260
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Well,

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.010 position:56%
I think his biggest worry'd probably
be seen as being, doing a good job

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.450
as President of the United
States, and bringing,

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:25.750
making sure there's no...

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.610
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: I mean, the one,
kind of, thing that, you know,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.780
what he said, he said,
"The thing I worry

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:35.800
about is a nuclear weapon
going off in an American city."

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:42.450 position:56%
He said that would be a game
changer, and, and, and then he said,

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:46.750
"Many of our intelligence programs
are designed to prevent that,"

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:51.420
and I think that's true,
I think, you know about,

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.590
if you know about some of
those intelligence programs,

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.500
which over the years I've learned
about, you don't write about them,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:03.160
because they buy a degree of
security, and so that was kind of,

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.350
okay, you know, he's
worried about the thing

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:09.610
that could devastate this country.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:13.360
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, you've
written, as I said, sixteen books.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.660
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Eighteen.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I'm
sorry, eighteen books [laughter].

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.320
Eighteen books.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.250
Twelve of them New York
Times Bestseller number ones,

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.190
and they all were bestsellers.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.740
What's your nineteenth
book going to be?

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.860
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: The
Rubinstein Empire [laughter].

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.730
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: That's
going to be a very small block.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.030
So, as you look...

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.410
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: And, no,
the title's going to be,

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:42.400
"Why does he really give
away all this money?"

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.670
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So,
let me wrap up [laughter].

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:50.830
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You know the
Citizen Kane movie, Rosebud?

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Yes.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.580
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: What's rosebud?

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: I just
want to do a good interview of you,

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.020
and have people buy
your book and read it.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:03.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Anyone who believes
that, raise your hand [laughter].

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:06.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
So, your legacy.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:09.250
Obviously, as I said at the
beginning, you're regarded as one

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.320
of the greatest, maybe the
best-known, and best journalist

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.810
of the 20th Century, 21st Century.

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:17.510
What would you like
people to know about you?

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:22.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: You know, I think
that's, it's, the work is out there,

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.770
and that speaks for
itself, and the mistakes,

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:31.920
I think the interesting legacy
question is for journalism now.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:39.820
Yesterday I was talking down
at the Museum to 250 people,

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.170
and I asked the question, I said,

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:50.640
how many of you think the media
is doing a good to passable job

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.220
of covering the Presidential
campaign?

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.820
Not a single hand went
up, and, you know,

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.800
you and I don't think we'd take
a poll here, maybe we could.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.630
How many people, can I take a poll?

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:05.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Sure.

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:09.760
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: How many people
think the news media is doing a

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.050
passable to good job of covering
the Presidential campaign,

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.470
raise your hands?

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:24.790
Yeah, there're six people,
out of, now, that's sincere.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.300
They're not making that up.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.440
Part of it is, it's kind of,
it's fun to dump on the media,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:38.390
but we need to face the fact that
we've lost the trust and confidence

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:44.030
of a large majority, a vast
majority of the public.

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:48.450 position:56%
It'd be like if you, if the
Carlisle group, you know, was going,

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:51.850
and you kept losing money,
losing money, losing money,

00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:54.520
there comes a point where
you have to say, hey,

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.110
we're going to have
to deal with this.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:54:59.820
We are going to have to deal
with it in the news media.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:05.330
I do not have the answer
to how we do that.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:09.080
The new owner of the Washington
Post, Jeff Bezos has said,

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:15.300
he said to me a year ago, said,
make sure we, because he asked me.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.610
He said, could we have
known about Nixon earlier?

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:22.390
And I said I don't think so, but
we could've done a better job,

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:26.880
and he said, to his credit, he
said, okay, we need to make sure

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.190
that we provide in the
Washington Post as much background

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:38.700
on who these people really are,
and then he said the goal is

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.760
that no one can go to the polls in
November and say, I couldn't find

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.250
out who the final candidates were.

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:51.030
And that's exactly the right goal,
and he said to me, you tell Marty,

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:56.270 position:56%
Marty Baron, the Editor of the Post,
this was Bezos, like a good CEO,

00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:00.340
was totally breaking the chain of
command, and said pass on to Marty,

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.320
he will have the resources
to do this.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.300
And if you talk to Marty Baron,
he'd say Bezos has delivered.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.410
We have many people, we have
40 people covering the national

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:16.430
campaign one way or another, it's
more than the New York Times,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:20.130
and we have had some
fabulous stories.

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.960
We've done a book on Trump.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.440
Now, are people going
to get up and applaud?

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.930 position:56%
No. I mean, we still are distrusted.

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:34.250
We're still on probation, and
we need to figure out how to get

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:38.760
out of probation, that is the
monstrous problem we've got

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.060
to confront.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, as a
journalist, you have quite a legacy.

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:42.810
You have two daughters.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:44.120
Do they want to be journalists?

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.330
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: One, Tally, is,

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.390
works at the Columbia
Journalism School,

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.910
administers the Masters
program there.

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:57.260 position:56%
The other is a sophomore in college,
and she couldn't run further

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.470
from journalism [laughter].

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Bob, I want to thank you

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:02.410
for all the great books you've
given everybody [applause].

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:05.090
And thank you for a great job.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.710
&gt;&gt; Bob Woodward: Thank you.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:13.410
[ Applause ]

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:17.070
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
