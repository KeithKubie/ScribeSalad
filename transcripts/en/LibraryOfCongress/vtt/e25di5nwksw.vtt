00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.030
&gt;&gt; Who here is from the
Moten Elementary School.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.330
All of you.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.130
Terrific. Well, thanks for coming
to the Young Readers Center.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.840
[Inaudible] part of the
Library of Congress.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.760 position:56%
Has any one of you been here before?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.060
&gt;&gt; Oh boy.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.980
&gt;&gt; Great. The Young Readers Center
is a special place because it's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.630 position:56%
for children up to age 16 years old.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.140
When you're 16, you can
get a reader's card,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:10.590
and that means you can go
to different reading rooms

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.210
in the library and read
books that the library has.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.710
The Library of Congress
is the biggest library

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.420
in the world, but we are not.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.580
We are the Young Readers Center,
and we're part of the library,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.940
but we're much smaller

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:51.220
and the difference is you
don't need a reader's card.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:03.190
So if you come back to visit
us, we have lots of books.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.200
We have three rooms.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:17.300
And we have books in
every room for all ages.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:27.450
And if you come back and you
find a book you want to read

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:44.750
or have somebody read it to you,
you can just take it off the shelf

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.400
and sit in a [inaudible]
place and read.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.920
That's why we're special.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.500
And the other reason is that we
have programs for children like you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.360
in which we invite special guests.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.390
And today we're really lucky.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:23.870 position:56%
This is a program of an organization
called Everybody Wins D.C..

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.900
They're our partner,
and they have suggested

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.780
that your school be included, and
we are introducing to you an author

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.910
of a book called Dozer's
Run, A Dog's Story of --

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.510
I'm getting this wrong --
A Dog's Story of His Race.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.510
Debra will correct me
with the right title.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.320
So this is Debra Levy.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.160 position:56%
She's the author, and Rosanna
[inaudible] is the owner and trainer

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.800
of Dozer, and that's
who the story is about.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.250
[Inaudible] at the end of
the program, you'll be able

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.210
to very carefully pet Dozer, and
we'll take a group photo with him,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.670
but between now and
the end of the program

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550
if you don't mind, [inaudible].

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.140
So now I'm going to
introduce Debra [inaudible].

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.440
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: I'm Debby Levy,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.780
but you knew that because
I was just introduced.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.080
Rosanna.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.380
&gt;&gt; Hi, guys.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.680
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Dozer.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.980
Are you all in second grade?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.580
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Yes?

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.880
Are there any first graders here?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.180
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.480
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Okay.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.780
Well, we're a very intimate group.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.080
I just might sit down so
I'm not looking down on you.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.380
I'm very happy to be here,
very happy to meet people

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.680
from Moten Elementary School,
andI'm going to be talking about --

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.980
let me do a click here -- I'm
going to be talking about Dozer

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.280
and the book, which
is called Dozer's Run,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.580
A True Story of A Dog and His Race.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.880
I'm going to be talking a
little bit about writing books.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.180
I'm going to be talking
about -- let's see --

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.480
cats and crickets and
rabbits, and you will see.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.780
Now, Dozer is a very special dog.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.080 position:56%
And although he is right here today,
I do love looking at him up on

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.380
that screen because he's such a
good looking guy, don't you think?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.680
Does anybody here like dogs?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.980
Oh, okay. Wait a minute.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.280
Me, too. Does anybody have a dog?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.580
Really? Well, since
we're such a small group,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.880
give me your dog's
name if you would, yes.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.180
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.480
Yoey? What's your dog's name?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.780
&gt;&gt; Rocky.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.080
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Rocky.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.380
What's your dog's name?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.680
[ Inaudible ]

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.980
You'll get it.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.280
It'll come to you.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.580
What's your dog's name?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.880

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.480
Zeuss? I love it.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.580
Yeah. Beautiful coat of black?

and -- okay, you remembered.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.380
Ang? Okay.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.680
Okay. Well, I'm glad
you told me your names.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.980
Sometimes I collect names because
then you never know in a book

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.870
that I write in the future, and
I've written a lot of books,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.860
I might remember one of these
names and use them in a book.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.590
So stay tuned.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.390
So back to Dozer.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.610 position:56%
There's the book I wrote about him,
and I'll be talking more about them.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.040
And Dozer is famous.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.730
He's famous.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.090
He's very special.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.390
Yeah, he's famous.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.690
I'm going to tell you about that.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.140
He's also special because --

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.970
do you think any old dog can go
into the Library of Congress?

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.440
No. Do you think dogs can
normally go to hospitals?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.740
Dozer can.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.940
Do you think dogs can
normally go to schools?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.240
Dozer can.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.390
He's on his way some place
right there in that picture.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.790
Here he is on television.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.040
He's been on television across the
land, across the United States.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.240
He has so many friends and fans.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.380
Dozer has seven -- more than
17,000 friends on Facebook.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.560
But don't -- that's his
Facebook page right there.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.310
I thought if I told you he
had more than 17,000 fans

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.240
and friends you wouldn't believe
me so I included the number that's

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.840
on the internet right there.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.110
&gt;&gt; And I'm also one of his friends.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.750
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: You're
one of his friends.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.660
Thank you very much.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.840
He also has friends and real
people like these people who got

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.350
to meet him and many, many more.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.310
So we've established that we
all like dogs or most of us,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.430
but let us not neglect
other animals.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.400
Does anybody here like cats?

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.950
I like cats.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.900
I have a cat.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.200
That's my cat.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.280
I wrote a poem about a cat.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.760
We're going to -- I'm going to
give you time to ask questions

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.370
after I've blabbed
a little bit, okay?

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.830
But there will be time
for questions.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.940
So I wrote a poem about
a cat, not this cat.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.370
But that cat in that book, which
I also wrote which is right here.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.750
Maybe I'll Sleep in the Bathtub
Tonight, and I'm going to start --

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.650 position:56%
we're going to start with me reading
this poem because there's a role

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.650
for you all in this poem, too.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.150
The poem is about a cat, yes.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.850
But it's also about a cricket.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.210
And a cricket makes
what kind of sound?

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.230
Chirp, chirp, chirp,
chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.530
Am I right?

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.830
All right.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.130
Can you chirp?

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.210
When I go like this on the
poem, when I raise my hand,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.950
that's your time to say the line
in the poem, which is chirping.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.450
So you're going to chirp.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:55.550
Let's practice.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.930
Okay? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp,
chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.260
What? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.560
One more practice.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.860
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.580
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.290
Here we go.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.540
The poem is called The Cricket.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.840
The Cricket.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.170
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.180
The cricket chirped.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.990
I thought it sounded cute.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.300
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.670
Okay. Enough, now scoot.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.970
It didn't scoot.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.450
I couldn't sleep neither
could Chester, my cat.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:36.650
I nudged Chester off the bed and
said, "Go, put an end to that."

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.250
Chester pounced, and I called
out, "Swat it, Chester.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.190
Swat it!" I cheered my cat
[inaudible] the dark I thought

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.190
that he had got it.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.270
Chester got the cricket, yes.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.430
It jumped into his mouth.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.000
But didn't stop and hopped
inside of Chester heading south.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.890
Once the cricket reached his
belly, Chester gave a burp and ever

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.090
since when Chester purs, he goes
chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.910
Now, I love poems that rhyme,
and that poem in that last verse,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.210
what word rhymed with chirp?

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.510
Burp. Burp.

Once the cricket reached his
belly, Chester gave a burp and ever

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.110
since when Chester purs, he goes
chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.410
Can you think of any other
words that rhyme with chirp?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.710

rhymes with chirp?

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.610
Is that a word?

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.910
No. Slurp.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.640
Good one because I was about to
say I can't think of a single word

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.920

You did. Well done.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.300
And you know what?

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.470
We're all natural poets in a way.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.430 position:56%
So if I were to make up a poem about
an apple and I say an apple is red

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:44.010
and round, you plant
its seed in the --

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.310
&gt;&gt; Ground.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.610
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Ground.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.390
The seed grows into a tree.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.820
New apples for you and me.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.520
We're all natural poets.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.820
It's amazing.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.540
Okay. Enough about
cats and crickets.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.700
Rabbits. Any of you have rabbits?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.750 position:56%
Yeah? Do you have a rabbit as a pet?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.050
Well, I don't.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.090
But I wrote a book about a rabbit.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.520
Oh, do you think this book
that I wrote about a rabbit

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.610
that I called Tab for some reason
is on the library shelf here

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.200
at the Library of Congress?

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.500
It's not.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.730
You think it's on anybody's
shelf at all?

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.970
No. I wrote it when
I was little, though,

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.830
because even when I was
little, that's me being little.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.720
I was interested in writing books.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.800
And so I started writing books.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.330
Here's one that I wrote
when I was 7 years old.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.780
Something Happens to Tuggy.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.980
That's not Tuggy on the cover.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.330
That's Tuggy, Tuggy the tugboat.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.630
And let's see.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.930
Here's another, The Captured Boys.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.610
I know what you're thinking.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.850
You just -- I already know
that what you're thinking is

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.130
that this woman cannot
draw or color.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.430
And it is true.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.730
I'm not an artist.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.050
So get that out of the way.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.690
You don't have to feel sorry for me
because I know that it's the case.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:01.250
So this is my first book that's
a nonfiction book called Fish.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.620
Who here can tell me
what nonfiction is?

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.010
What's nonfiction?

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.710
[ Inaudible ]

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.820
Something that's --
something that's real, yes.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.420
A nonfiction book is a book that's
an information book, that's true.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.890
It tells a true story.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.120
My Dozer book tells a true story.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.000
What's the opposite
of a nonfiction book?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.460
Yes. A fairtale is not a -- is
a -- the opposite of nonfiction.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.760
What else?

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.970
Fiction is also the
more general term.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.130
So fish is supposed to be my
first effort at nonfiction and so

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.660
for there are many kinds of fish,
there are much more than listed.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.920
So far so good.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.020
Yeah. Nice drawings, huh?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.180
You know when they're dead because
he lies on its sides on the bottom.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.480
Well now. You could spend an
entire week in school learning

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.300
about all the mistakes in
the sentence that I wrote.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.950
Who here can tell me
something wrong,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.270
some of my mistakes in my sentence?

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:07.410
You know when they're dead because
he lies on its sides on the bottom.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.130
Anybody? Yes.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.510
&gt;&gt; Sides.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: He lies on its sides.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.770
Can you lie on both your
sides at the same time?

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.000
Kind of a problem.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.340
What else?

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.370
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.750
You can lie on one side at a time.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.050
An here's another thing.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.920
You know when they're
dead -- I say -- yes.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.220
&gt;&gt; Its.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.460
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: So I say he lies
on its sides on the bottom.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.130
So here I'm talking about fish,
and I'm talking about they

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.430
as if there's lots of them.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.020
I'm talking about he,
and I'm talking about it.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.010
I should have chosen just
one way to talk, shouldn't I?

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.150
If it's a he, then he lies
on his side on the bottom.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.450
But you know what?

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.110
This leads me to one of
the most important things

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.170
that I've learned in writing books.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.100
And that is the importance
of making mistakes.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.010
Do you ever make mistakes?

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.430
Yeah. Yeah, we all make mistakes.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.190 position:56%
And when you make mistakes, you know

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.420
that you're doing something
new usually.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.720
You're trying something new.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.250
That's a good thing.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.550
You make mistakes.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.070
You learn from your mistakes.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:19.310
So I encourage you all not to
be afraid to make mistakes.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.370
It's usually because you're trying
something new and you're going

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.600
to learn and very often you
can also correct your mistakes

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.900
and make them good.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.200
So one more page.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.830
Fish tanks should not be carried.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.560
A lot of the fish get dizzy.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.120
Okay, this is a nonfiction book.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.420
True or false.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.780
Fish tanks should not be
carried a lot if fish get dizzy.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.080
What do you think?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.380
True? False?

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.680
What do you think?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.270
True. What does anybody else think?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.570
What do you think?

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.420
False. I have no idea.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.410
I made it up, which
you're not supposed to do

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.230
when you write nonfiction,
but I have learned

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.050 position:56%
and I do try not to do that anymore.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:03.270
Okay. So Dozer's saying,
"Are you kidding me, already?

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.660
Enough with the crickets
and the fish and the cat.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.600
Let's talk about me."

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.670
So rather then just talk about
him, I'm going to read you part

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.610 position:56%
of this book, Dozer's Run, which I
wrote about him with Rosanna's help,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.850
and this is a book you're going
to take with you, your own copies,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.340
when you leave here today.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.640
So are we ready?

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.990
I'm ready.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.570
Dozer's Run, A True Story.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.130
And I'm going to show the pages
up here, then I'll read it here.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.300
It was a dark -- it was a damp and
drizzly Sunday morning in Dozer

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.840
and Chica's neighborhood.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.880
Who knew what delicious smells
last night's rain washed in?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.130
Who knew what treasures the
storm blew into the yard?

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.830
So the two best friends stretched
out after a good night's sleep

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.940
in the barn, shook themselves
off and began to investigate.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.660
Out in the street a runner ran by.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.500 position:56%
Then, another runner and another
and another and another and another.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.590
Where were those runners running?

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.990
Dozer and Chica looked
at each other.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.270
Then they got back
to their exploring.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.200
Was this big branch here yesterday?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.490
A raccoon was there.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.620
Wow, the whiff of wet wood,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:25.630
frog here in this hollow,
more runners ran by.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.260
Where are all those
runners running ?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.600
"We stay in the yard,"
Chica said with her eyes.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.000
Dozer's eyes were on the runners.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.360
"We belong in the yard,"
Chica's eyes said.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.580
Plus, we haven't had breakfast yet.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.870
Later. We'll walk with our people.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.950
"But the runners are running
now, Chica," Dozer said

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.940
with his big swishy tail.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.590
They must be chasing
something wonderful."

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:57.520
"More wonderful than the flavor
of frog and the wreak of raccoon?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.520
More wonderful than
breakfast, Dozer?

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.380
Dozer did love his breakfast.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.420
But he had to find out what
the runners were chasing.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.270
He dashed out of the yard.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.650
"I'll be back, Chica!"

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.720
Follow the leader.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.640
But who was the leader?

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.530
Dozer followed his nose and
smelled a pocket full of gummies,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:28.080
shorts with a scent of strange
dog, stinky socks, tangy trailmix,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.840
sneakers that once
stepped in never mind.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.450
Dozer followed his ears.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.730
He heard laughter,
whistles, wonderfulness.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.640
And lots of leaders.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.400
Dozer could be a leader, too.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.460
Dozer kept his head
high and his tail proud.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.950
Around him, people were drooping.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.250
Some were slowing down.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.400
These runners needed him.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.370
Come on, one foot after another.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.190
You can do it.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.990
We'll be some place wonderful soon.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.660
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.580
Suddenly, Dozer heard
clapping and cheering.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.740
He slowed down to investigate.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.130
He looked right.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.010
He looked left.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:18.070
He looked straight ahead
and oh, Dozer sped up

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.550
and scampered across
the finish line.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.300
"See? I knew we could do it.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.600
I knew we were running
some place wonderful."

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.310
The other runners smiled
and chatted and high fived.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.100
They all got big shiny
metals hung on broad ribbons.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.860
Friends and families greeted them.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.620
Everyone was happy and crowd.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.690
But no one greeted Dozer.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.750
No one smiled and chatted
and high fived with Dozer.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.990
No one gave him a big shiny metal.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.360
No one even gave him a
teeny tiny dog treat.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.730
Oh, suddenly, this
wasn't so wonderful.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.080
It wasn't wonderful at all.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.130
So Dozer ran on.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.820
Morning turned into
afternoon turned into evening.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.590
There was no leader
for Dozer to follow.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.130
There were no followers
for Dozer to lead.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.300
Dozer was alone.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.780
He was alone all night long.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.480
That's as much as I'm
going to read right now.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.600
You can find out exactly what
happens when you read the book.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.810 position:56%
I'll talk a little bit about what
did happen in a minute, but tell me.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.440
What do you think Dozer
might have done all night?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.740
Keep in mind these things.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.690
He's far from home because
he's been running a long time,

He's lost.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.470
Any ideas about what
maybe Dozer did?

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.450
I'd like to hear them?

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.030
What do you think Dozer
might have done?

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.110
He might have been running
and looking for the runners.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:59.410
Because he didn't know.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.830
Maybe the runners are
running at night.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.040
What was your idea?

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.620
He was looking for a
home, another good idea.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.510
What might he have done?

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.850
[ Inaudible ]

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.180
He wanted to know where
they were going

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.960
so maybe all night he kept
looking and running, right?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.300
Anybody else's idea?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.310
Anybody have any crazy
and wild ideas

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.010
for something he might have done?

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.340
No? Maybe he knocked on somebody's
door and they let him in?

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.990
No. Maybe he -- I don't know --

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.250
went to McDonald's and
had some chicken tenders?

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.780
No, no. Well, any of
those wild ideas or any

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.940
of your ideas are good ideas but
they couldn't have gone in my book

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.390
because my book is
nonfiction, meaning it's true,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.490
and we don't know what Dozer did.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.580
We don't know.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.960
And we're not going to know
until he learns how to talk.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.280
So Rosanna, please teach him.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.190
Now, Dozer, if you had been
in Dozer's shoes that day,

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.240
and you had seen these runners
running past his front yard,

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.910
you would have seen clues that
would have given you an idea

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.080
of what was going on.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.080
Can you tell me what clues
you might see in the picture

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.390
that would clue you
into what was happening?

running in an organized race

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.130 position:56%
and if they finish will get a medal.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.440
You also have an idea?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.240
Yeah.

[ Inaudible ]

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.990

he didn't get a medal also.

What do you have?

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:11.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.930
Dozer probably was doing --

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.200
following because he smelled
good things, and in fact,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.500
people that run races and what I
learned, what Dozer didn't know is

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.080
that this was an organized race
called the Maryland Half Marathon.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.560
You know how long a
half marathon is?

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.470
13 miles. Have you ever
run 13 miles at one time?

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:37.340
I don't think so unless
you've run a half marathon.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.980
And a lot of people
-- you were talking

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.450
about Dozer following
his nose and smells.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.510
A lot of people when
they're running that far,

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.090
they'll carry in their arm bands
or in a little pouch little snacks

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.420
like jellybeans or trailmix
or things like that.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.080
Now, 2000 people ran
the race that day.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.840
So can you blame Dozer for
wanting to leave his yard

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.440
when he saw 2000 people
running by one after another?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.930
And a lot of people
saw Dozer running.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.340
Some of the runners did, of course,
but so did people along the race.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.950
And they took pictures
of him running.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.750
Those are some of the
photos from Dozer running.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.210
And more. Here's Dozer running.

cross the finish line.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.830

life photo of the finish line

Very cool.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.220
Well, a lot of time these races
like the Maryland half marathon,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.220
they are run for the fun of
running, for the exercise

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.670
of running, but also to do good.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.060
So they raise money
often for a good cause.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.770
The Maryland half marathon
raised money to fight cancer.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.370
Just by your hands, do
you know what cancer is?

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.670
It's a disease.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.420
It effects a lot of people.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.980 position:56%
And so research needs to be done,
and people need to be taken care of.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.500
So the runners, they get sponsors.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.370
They get sponsors to
pay, give money to --

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.290
in this case, a cancer center in
Baltimore in honor of their run

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.710
and that's how lots of money
is raised to fight cancer

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.250
and people also get to go
out and have a good time.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.660
Now, so these runners, all of
them were also philanthropists.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.050
It's a hard word to say, but
it's easy for you to understand.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:08.830
First, let's see if you can say it.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.130
Philanthropists.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.430

And all that is is
somebody who does --

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.560
who does for others,
who gives for others.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.710
And it doesn't have
to be piles of money.

So for example, it can be doing
something good in your neighborhood.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.190
Now, do you think a dog --

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.010
do you think Dozer could
be a philanthropist?

[ Inaudible ]

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.290
I mean, he didn't go
out and get sponsors.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:40.120
He didn't go out and raise money,
but all during the race, he helped.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.150
His cheerfulness helped
people keep going

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.000
because it's hard to run 13 miles.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.670
His funniness -- he
made people laugh

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.920
because he can be a
little bit goofy.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:25:00.160
So he made people laugh, and
they wanted to finish the race.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.190
So what happened after the race
was over and Dozer was missing

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.570
for 24 hours -- you
know how long that is?

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:10.260
A full day from Sunday
morning to Monday morning.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.640
Of course, Rosanna was
worried to death about her.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.480
But all the people who had seen
Dozer, they were talking about him.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.140
So they're talking
about their neighbors.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.020
Rosanna's calling people.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.880
The race organizers are
talking about this dog.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.170
Finally, Rosanna and the
race organizers realized

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.660
that Dozer was the dog that
everybody was talking about.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:39.480
So the organizers decided that
Dozer who finished the race,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:46.030
he started at mile five and ended
at 13 so how many miles did he run?

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.030
Hard for me, too.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.330
Eight miles.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.630
He ran eight miles.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.930
That's a long way.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.340
So they decided he
should get a medal.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.900
Here he is, the medal is being
put on him and he's thinking,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.740
do I really want this on my neck?

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.040
I don't know.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.520
And there he is telling his Mom,
yeah actually I look pretty good.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.790
So then word really started
to spread about Dozer,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:14.280
not only among the runners but
throughout the state of Maryland,

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.860
throughout the whole country.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.120 position:56%
And people started making donations
to fight cancer in honor of his run.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.200 position:56%
And what happened was 700 people
from 43 states including Washington,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.490
D.C. and three countries made
donations totalling $25,000

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.790
to fight cancer.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.300 position:56%
So Dozer raised two times as much as
any of the human runners in the race

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.770
that day because nobody raised
nearly as much money as Dozer.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.820
And that is what made him
famous, and that is why he's

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.530
on television, why
he has so many fans.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:53.280
He's a good boy, and now I'm
going to get back to a mistake.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.740
It was a mistake for him
to leave his yard that day.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.040
It was a mistake.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.340
He shouldn't do it again.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.760
Dozer, don't do it again.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.980
But he and his Mom and everybody
who knew him, they turned it

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.330
into something really, really good.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:14.310 position:56%
I'm going to tell you a tiny bit
about how I came to write this book.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.810
Somebody told me about what
happened, just the vaguest details.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.990

Maybe you want to write
a book about it.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.130
So I did some research.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.790
How do you think I
started my research?

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.130
How do you think?

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.160
[ Inaudible ]

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.460
I looked it up on the computer.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.760
That's exactly right.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.710
I learned that Dozer was in
Maryland and I'm from Maryland.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.700
I learned a little
bit, but then I need

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.040
to go meet Rosanna, and
I talked to Rosanna.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.830
I talked to others too about
what happened that day,

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.760
but I knew I wanted to write a
book from the dog's point of view.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.630
So remember when I wrote --
when I read from the book?

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.220
You've got Dozer's point of
view and what he's seeing

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.010
but mostly what he's smelling.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.350
I really wanted to get in
Dozer's head and to do that,

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.100
I needed to interview Rosanna.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:09.220
So you all, think about if you're
the writer and you have this idea

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.350
to write a book about
a dog about Dozer.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:18.120 position:56%
Let's you interview Rosanna like I
did and ask her questions that you'd

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.450
like to know or that you'd want to
know to write a book about Dozer.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.400

questions about Dozer?

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.680
Well, I can start.

is he called Dozer?

&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.670
He's called Dozer because when he
was a little puppy he had bigger

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.360
paws than his body, and
when he used to run,

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.960
he used to dozer down the hill.

He's a people lover so I think when
he saw so many people running by,

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.480
he wanted to join the momentum.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.100

a forward motion.

So when you feel it's
an energy of momentum.

and wanted to go, go for it.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.190
So we've got our award
winning Dozer.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.300
Now, do you think the Library
of Congress lets any old dog

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.970
into the Library of Congress?

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.380
No. They don't.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.280
And remember I told you, do
you think any old dog can sit

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.740
through a presentation like he has?

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.100
He might be saying, "Oh,
I got to get out of here.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.400
I got to move.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.700
Let's go. Let's go.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.000
Where's my [inaudible]?"

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.300
Can I say that word?

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he's --

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:52.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: So Dozer is a special
dog also because he has a job.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.720
Dozer's a therapy dog.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.450
And I'm going to be asking,
interviewing now Rosanna

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.760 position:56%
about Dozer's life as a therapy dog.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.990
And this isn't the book
because when Dozer ran away

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.480
and did his run, he
wasn't a therapy dog.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.110
Only afterwards did Rosanna
decide to get him certified

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.990
to get him recognized as a therapy
dog so that he could come to places

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.970
like this and so they could do --

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.920
continue to do good
things for other people.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:27.880
So now there are philanthropists,
philanthropists, philanthropists

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.560
in a new way by going
and helping people

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.280
because Dozer's a therapy dog.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.930
And a therapy dog -- does anybody
know what a therapy dog is?

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.870
Is one that's trained specially to
work with people and be with people

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:48.700
who are maybe sick or very old and
frail or people who have problems,

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:53.710
whether they have drug
problems or alcohol problems

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:56.340
or maybe they've been
through a terrible experience,

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.310
a disaster like a flood or
a hurricane and therapy dogs

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:06.050 position:56%
with their humans, they go and visit
these people and work with them,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.800
and they do a lot of good.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:14.590
And therapy dogs are always
very gentle and kind and smart.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:19.930
And let's learn more about Dozer
the therapy dog from Rosanna.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.330
So Rosanna, what would you say
is the most important quality

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:28.160
that a dog has to have in order to
get the job of being a therapy dog?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.430
&gt;&gt; I would say he has to
be able to be patient.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:35.610
It's very important
like he is today.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.420
And mostly calm.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.160
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Do therapy dogs
have to be a particular size?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.730
Do you have to be a
nice big dog like Dozer?

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.030
&gt;&gt; You can be any size.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.460
Therapy dogs come from little --

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.400
tiny little pups to
really big, big ones.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.620
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: And what does
a therapy dog do in its job?

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:59.040
&gt;&gt; A therapy dog helps
people in different ways.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.540
That's why their title is therapy.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.570
It gives each person depending
on what their needs are.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.720
It's therapeutic.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:12.430 position:56%
So some people are nervous people
or anxious, and I'll bring Dozer in,

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.400
and it kind of calms them down.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.300
Some kids are in the hospital.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.260
They've been in there for a
long time and they get depressed

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.380
and upset because they
haven't been outside a lot.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.330
So they get really happy
when they see Dozer,

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.030
and Dozer brings them
a lot of happiness.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:35.770
Sometimes we go into nursing
homes where the patient had

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:41.160
to leave their dog at home or their
animal at home and hasn't seem them

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.400
for a very long time because
they've been too sick to go home

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.390
or they're probably not
going to be able to go back.

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:50.950
So when Dozer comes in, it
makes them really happy.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.200
They remember their pet.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.230
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Does a
therapy dog work by himself?

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.970
Do you take him in and then
send him into the room?

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:02.700
&gt;&gt; No. A therapy dog has
to have a person with them,

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.370
and the person trains them to do
basically just to be good to others

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:14.160
and therapeutic, to give
others what they need.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.540
Lots of love, loves of attention.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.500
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: What do you like
most about doing the therapy work

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.380
about being Dozer the
therapy dog's Mom?

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.270
What do you like most about
the work of a therapy dog?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.480
&gt;&gt; I like mostly that we're
helping people, that we make --

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.300
we always leave there
with people smiling.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.540
Everybody's happy when
Dozer comes in.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.520
Everybody always wants
to see us come back.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.460
So it's a great feeling
to help others.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.890
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Does
anybody have questions

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.240
about the therapy dog
part of Dozer's work?

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.800
And we'll get to all your questions
if you have any in a minute,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.710
but anything about him
being a therapy dog?

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.010
Yeah.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.950
What does he do when he actually
goes into to do his therapy?

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.630
So I guess what does he do when
he's with an older sick person?

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.330
What does he do with
the younger person?

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.180
&gt;&gt; Dozer just goes with the flow.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.480
So it depends.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.780
For example, if we
came to your house,

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.360
what would you want
to do with Dozer?

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.980

he would do that with you.

He'll throw things.

bring it back to you.

&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Does
Dozer do any tricks?

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.450
&gt;&gt; He does a couple tricks.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.820
He -- Dozer, come up.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.730
Up. So Dozer will sit.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:55.790
Sit. He gives paw.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.510
Give me your paw.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.910
Good boy. Lay down.

Lay. Dozer, lay.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:01.510
Lay. Good boy.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:06.960
That's pretty much what
he does for right now.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.860
I don't know if he'll do the other
ones because -- and he listens.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.160
He listens real well.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.130 position:56%
But Dozer will do pretty much
anything depending on where we're at

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.330
and what the situation is
and what your needs are.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.320
You like to throw the ball.

you -- play with him.

She wants to eat --
feed him and walk him.

So he pretty much just
wants to make people happy.

That's why he's a great therapy
dog because he's a people pleaser.

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.810
&gt;&gt; His dog Mom.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:17.310
We got him from a breeder
in Pennsylvania.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.610
So they have her.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:20.490
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: So Dozer's
Mom is in Pennsylvania.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question for them.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.610
I'm wondering what their favorite
thing about Dozer's story is?

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:33.440
What do you like most
about the whole story?

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.740
&gt;&gt; Debby Levy: Yes.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.880
That he runs with people.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.680
Yes.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:46.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.570
He likes people walking him.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.010
You liked that about him.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.570
You like that he likes
helping people.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.310
That's a big one.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.090
Yes.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.160
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.780
Why else is he a special dog?

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.580
Let's hear it.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.480
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.780
Because he's a therapy dog.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.790
That does make him very special.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.650

of the Library of Congress.
