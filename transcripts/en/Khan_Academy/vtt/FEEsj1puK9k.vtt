00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.720
One problem left, problem
number 20.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
There are 75 more
women than men

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.710
enrolled in Linden College.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.260
If n men enrolled, then in terms
of n, what percentage of

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.866
those enrolled are men?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:27.870
Well, they're saying that n is
men, so n is equal to number

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.610
of men, right?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.480
They tell us that.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.310
And there are 75 more women
than men, right?

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.140
So what is equal to the
number of women?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.680
We know that there are 75 more
women than men, so it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.220
must be n plus 75.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.920
I think I'm coming down
with something.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.320
And then they say well, in terms
of n, what percentage of

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.630
those enrolled are men?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.320
So if we want to know the
fraction that are men, it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.690
the number of men over the
total number of students.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.080
So the total number of students
is going to be the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.840
men plus the women.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.810
So the men is n plus the women
is n plus 75, right?

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.730
So this tells us the fraction
that are men.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.360
So this is n over 2n plus 75.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.000
This would be some decimal
number, and if I want to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.040
convert this to a percentage,
I'd multiply it times 100 and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.415
add a percent sign right here.

00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:47.260
And if I wanted to rewrite that,
it would be 100n over 2n

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.780
plus 75 percent.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.521
And that is choice e.

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:57.800
I have all this extra time I
don't know what to do with.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.540
I guess I will let you use
it more productively then

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.080
watching me do nothing
on a video.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.800
I'll see you in the
next SAT Section.
