00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, in the next class, I'm going to teach you our final state estimation algorithm.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's called Particle Filters. And there's the two first methods we learned.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The histogram method and now the Kalman method are really complex and involved.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This one is really simple and easy to implement and really powerful.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We are using it in various places in the Google self-driving car.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And it's possibly the most popular method to-date in recent times.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it really overcomes some basic barriers in both of the two previous methods.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's also really fun to implement because you can implement it in about five lines of code,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is quite amazing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.320
So, please come back when the next class comes and learn how to program a particle filter.
