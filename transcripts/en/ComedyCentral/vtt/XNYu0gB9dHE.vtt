This is for cars?

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:10.343 align:start size:75% position:25%
Ugh.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.345
He took the consultant's fees
and ran.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.480 align:end position:100%
You know, I'm sure consultants
can get away with that.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.183 align:end position:100%
I mean, it seems like a pretty
shady job to begin with.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.018 align:start size:84% position:16% line:92%
Consulting?

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.018 align:start size:28% position:72%
Yeah.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.553 size:88% position:44%
I mean,
that's basically what I'm --

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.288
That's all I'm doing right now.
I'm a consultant.

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.457 align:end position:100%
I just take my friend Tall John
when I go get a car.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.825 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah.

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.360 size:66% position:67%
He acts
kind of intimidating.

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.895
[ Laughing ]
You think that's your negoti--

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.964 size:66% position:33%
"How about we go
$300 off the price,

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.699 size:66% position:33%
or my friend's
gonna beat you up?"

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.635
[ Both laugh ]

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.070 align:start size:91% position:9%
I would love it
if that worked.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.571 size:84% position:42%
It'd be like,
"Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Benson."

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.006 align:start size:78% position:22%
No, just some of those --

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.474 size:72% position:36%
"I'll change
some of these numbers."

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.677 align:end position:100%
The guy I bought a car from wore
a cowboy hat and wore boots.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.179 size:88% position:44%
Why would you ever buy a car

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.648 size:84% position:42%
from someone in cowboy hats
and a boot?

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.349 align:end position:100%
Why are you putting all
this shit out on the table?

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.318 align:start position:0%
I got to see it all.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.686 size:78% position:39%
I got to see what
we're talking about here.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.254 align:start size:53% position:47%
Take it all in.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.923
I think every one
of these things is confusing.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.057 size:75% position:38%
Anything that's stapled,
that's out.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.093 size:78% position:39%
I'm not dealing
with two pieces of paper.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.829 align:end position:100%
Here's the two checks, so it's
proof she paid him twice.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start position:0% line:85%
They want $1,400 back.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start size:34% position:66%
$1,410.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.501 align:start size:78% position:22%
Should I give it to them?

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start position:0%
He was so convincing.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.372
Everything he said, I was like,
"Ah, he's right."

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:14.941
[ Water bubbling ]

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:19.145 align:start position:0%
That guy, he showed up
with a goddamn manilla folder.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.147 size:66% position:33%
You can't buy
one of these, Doug.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.349 size:66% position:33%
You're buying
a 50-pack of these.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
And you're not buying
a 50-pack of manilla folders

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:28.654 size:69% position:34%
unless you're somebody
who does business.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:29.820 align:start size:94% position:6%
God, it was good.
