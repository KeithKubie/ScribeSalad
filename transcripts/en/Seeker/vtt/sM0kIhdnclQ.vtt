00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.459
People say when you're pregnant you're eating
for two, but according to the math you're

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:14.020
really only eating for one point one five.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.400
Half of Earth's population takes nutrients
from food and uses them to build a human inside

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.029
of their body, but what's the construction
cost?

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.390
How many calories does it cost to make a little
bundle of joy?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.410
How many calories it takes for a pregnant
woman to healthily make a baby day-to-day,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.460
is a little nebulous.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.970
It's not just food intake, because existing
muscle, bone and fat tissues will be broken

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.430
down for fetal needs too.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.600
But, according to the Journal of Tropical
Pediatrics and the American Pregnancy Association,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.809
the average cost over the entire pregnancy
seems to be about 300 extra kcal, a day -- or

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.820
about three tablespoons of peanut butter or
a couple hamburger buns.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.570
If you multiply that out: human gestation
averaging 280 days, 40 weeks, or close to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.510
10 months at 300 calories a day means a pregnant
woman will eat 75,000 calories to CREATE A

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.510
HUMAN.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.559
But to put 75,000 calories in perspective
-- it's only a snack or two per day.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.500
U.K. Dietitian Sasha Watkins describes 200
calories as "A small, toasted pita, filled

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.750
with a tablespoon of reduced-fat hummus and
grated carrot, followed by three dried apricots…

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
or a low-fat yogurt with six almonds."

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.009
So overall, eating for two, while technically
accurate, doesn't mean doubling food intake,

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.710
and instead could mean eating as little as
[[weirded out]] two slices of wholegrain bread

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.630
with a tablespoon of cottage cheese??

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.630
Brits are weird.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.210
What the body DOES with those calories is
even more weird though.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
Caloric increases aren't spread evenly across
the whole pregnancy and do not directly correlate

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.870
with actual fetal growth.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.600
They could be used for anything!

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.960
Pregnant women will grow 50 percent more blood.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.640
Also, the 75,000 is the TOTAL.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.310
It's not 300 calories from day 1 to day 280…
it ramps up.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.719
At the end of the first trimester the fetus
is only 28 grams, and doesn't require additional

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.890
nutrition, but let's run the numbers.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.110
The Journal of Tropical Pediatrics reports
the mean increases for the women they studied

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.490
were: 9 calories per day for the first trimester,
8 for the second, with a sharp increase to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.140
216 for the third.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.480
While the American Pregnancy Association says:
women should eat normally in the first trimester,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.550
increase by 340 calories in the second, and
450 in the third.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.750
Then researchers in the UK say normal in the
first, increase by 200 in the second and 300

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.800
in the third.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.940
These numbers will change based on BMI, activity
level, metabolism and height!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.070
But honestly, all this variation shows we
still have a lot to learn about pregnancy.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.230
It's not like we can slap a meter on a fetus
and see what they need!

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.500
Scientists aren't entirely sure how the body
decides which nutrients go to the fetus and

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.990
which go to the mother, but one thing was
clear across all the research I found.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.390
Since growing tissues takes food energy, and
we are what we eat -- it was heavily emphasized

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.120
that the diet of a pregnant woman should be
a healthy one.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.280
Craving fatty or "unhealthy" foods is normal,
and shouldn't be ignored or derided!

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.230
But, we could all use a reminder to eat healthily.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.170
So, eat those extra 75,000 calories, ladyfriends,
and enjoy building your own human!

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.830
Half of those baby humans will eventually
grow up and need to shave one of these lovely

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.830
beards.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.370
So we'd like to Thank Harry's for sponsoring
