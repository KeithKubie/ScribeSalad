00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.340
So your body is made up of trillions of cells,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.180
and each cell has its own copy of the human genome.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.970
&gt;&gt; So wait, you're saying that my body

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.020
has trillions of my genome, not just one?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.580
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Your body is made up of trillions of cells, and because

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.520
each one has its own copy, you've got trillions of copies. It's what

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300
makes cells different. They each read a slightly different A portion of the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.060
instructions. For example a skin cell is a skin cell, and not a stomach

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.780
cell, because it's reading the skin chapter parts. And the stomach

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.450
cell is a stomach cell, not a blood cell, because it's reading

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.730
the stomach cell parts. And the blood cell is a blood

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.380
cell because it reads the blood cell parts. You get the idea.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.870
&gt;&gt; So all my different traits, that make me me, you're saying it's

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.450
because my cells are reading different parts of this to make Me, me?

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.190
&gt;&gt; Exactly. These traits at an organismal level, at a

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.440
whole body level, are because different cells make up tissues,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.520
the tissues are organized into organs, organs are organized into

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400
your whole body. And then, we see a myriad of traits.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.490
&gt;&gt; It's crazy how the body works.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.080
&gt;&gt; It is pretty amazing. So think it's about time we wrapped up this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.030
lesson pretty soon? So I want you to try answering one really tough question. I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.760
want you to tell me in your own words, what is the human genome?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030
I want you to be clear, succinct,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.490
but comprehensive, pulling on the information you've seen

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.370
so far in the exercises in these lessons. Use words

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.760
like chromosome, base pair, mitochondria, anything that you think you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.850
need to answer that question. And save your answer because

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.600
we're going to come back to it in a future video.
