00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.369
Let's look at some of
the things in the back.

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:03.403
MIKE: OK.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:04.170
Just straight back here, Mike.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.205
MIKE: Oh, wow.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.072
Man, look at all these records.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:06.973
Lots of records.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:07.674
MIKE: This is it.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.842
Yeah, handpicked.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.310
I mean, this is
like serious stuff.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.711
MIKE: OK.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.946
So this is all like-- this
is a curated collection?

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:13.980
Yes.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.049
The items I'm drawn
to happen to have

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.885
a good connection
with rock and roll,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.455
from posters to
the clothes I wear.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.757
It makes me feel great.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.891
That jukebox work?

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.059
Have you had it working ever?

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:26.993
Yeah.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.328
You know, the tone
arm is broken.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.396
MIKE: It's a beautiful piece.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.865
[rock music]

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:34.567
It's a Rock-Ola
jukebox, a piece of art.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.736
It's a classic period, 1948.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.204
This is obviously
an iconic model.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.406
Yeah.

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:40.874
MIKE: All the soldiers
that came home

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.308
from the war, that were
celebrating with their ladies

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.743
and everything--

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.378
I mean, this was what would
have been in the tavern.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.446
And they were lighting it up.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.781
And it lights up.
So it's--

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.249
MIKE: It is beautiful.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.650
I mean, do you have to
actually open the door to put

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.820
the record on and help it?
- Yeah.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.157
You put it on, and the
disk spins, and that's it.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:58.291
MIKE: Yeah.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.726
I mean, with that
said, I love it.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:00.994
I don't know if you're going
to do anything with it.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:05.432
But I'd be a player
at like 1,100 bucks.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.433
Can you do 15?

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.540
Having a store in Nashville
has made me change gears

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.674
on the way I look at things.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:16.342
I'm going to do 1,500.

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.510
And the reason I'm
going to do that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.512
is because we can rent this.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.080
We're in the antique business.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.651
But we're also finding ourselves
in the prop rental business.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.552
It's old microphones.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:26.352
It's old guitars.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.287
It's old banjos.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.621
It's old jukeboxes.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.023
Because we have a lot
of musicians down there

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:32.192
that even want to
use them for a video.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.594
Or they want to use them
just for still photography.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.762
It's the gift that
keeps on giving.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.096
- Let's do it.
- All right.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.364
It was a beautiful piece.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.367
But my association
with it is finished.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.635
I like this piece right here--

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.004
United States Air
Force, 8th Engineering.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.940
You know, it's got
the bomber pin on it.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.710
This was a piece that someone
put together as a memento

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.945
for their years in the service.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.513
Do you remember
where you found this?

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:54.948
Yeah, a flea market.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.782
That's cool.

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.217
This is a very personal piece--

00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:00.520
United States Air Force,
8th Engineering Division.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.821
It's got his wings on there.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.356
Some of it's hand carved.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.091
It says victory on the bottom.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.926
I like how they
incorporated in the plane.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.329
See how they've incorporated
that pin right there?

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.531
Yeah.
MIKE: And this one here.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.199
Here's a plane
getting shot down.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.534
I mean, it's patriotic.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.602
It's folk art.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.903
It's militaria.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.638
There's so much going on here.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.973
It's very cool.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.175
Can I make you an offer on this?
- Yeah, maybe.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:26.779
Like 125?

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.851
You know, that's a
pretty special piece,

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.320
the outsider artist part of it.
- Yeah, I know.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.388
That's what I love about it too.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.056
I don't know, maybe 150.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.258
- How about 140?
- OK.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.026
- All right.
- We'll do it.

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:40.860
Thanks man.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.462
- And a haircut.
- All right.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.730
[laughter]

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.566
Hey, Mike, I want to
show you this bike

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.668
I've had for many years.
- Oh yeah.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.670
That's a Schwinn Phantom, man.
- Yeah.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.238
I bought it from a
friend at a yard sale

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.706
that I went to high school with.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.544
This was Schwinn's deluxe
bike from 1949 to 1959.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.112
They made it in black.
They made it in red.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.246
They made it in green.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.815
This is the black Phantom.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:07.053
Just the name alone, the
mystique, the allure,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.454
the cool factor--

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.323
back then and now--

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.591
is the same.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.361
I'd do 750 bucks on it.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.430
If the chain guard
was on it, and it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.199
was in a little better shape,
it would bring that number up.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.607
How about 850?

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.909
Why don't we just
do an even eight?

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.210
All right, Mike, you got it.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.078
All right, man.

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.112
I appreciate it.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.414
Just for the hell of
it, I got to know,

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.882
how much was it
at the yard sale?

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.883
50 bucks.
