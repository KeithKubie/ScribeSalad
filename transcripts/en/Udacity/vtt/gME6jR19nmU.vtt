00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.830
One of the problems that Bit Torrent needs

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.710
to solve is ensuring that each client gets chunks

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.260
to swap with other clients. If all the

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.100
clients received the same chunks, then no-one would want

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.160
to trade with one another and everyone would

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.120
have an incomplete copy of the file. To solve

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.240
this problem, Bit Torrent clients use a policy

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.180
called rarest piece first. Rarest piece first allows a

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.470
client to determine which pieces are the most

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.500
rare among clients, and download the rarest pieces

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.050
of the file first. This ensures that the

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.680
most common pieces are left til the end to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
download, and that a large variety of pieces

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
are downloaded from the seeder. Additionally, a client has

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.560
nothing to trade and it's important to get

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.350
a complete piece as soon as possible. Rare pieces

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.850
are typically available at fewer peers initially. Downloading a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.780
rare piece is initially maybe not a good idea.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.510
So one policy that clients use is to select

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.810
a random piece of the file and download it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.470
from a seeder. In the end game the client

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
actively requests any missing pieces from all peers, and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.910
redundant requests are cancelled when the missing piece arrives.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.760
This ensures that a single peer with the slow transfer

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.180
rate doesn't prevent the download from completing.
