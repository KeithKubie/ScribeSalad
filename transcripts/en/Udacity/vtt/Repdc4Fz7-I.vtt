00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.770
Okay, so for our value proposition,

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.870
we're simply going to
fill in Moore's Template.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.850
Our first line is For.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.520
We're thinking about our
target customers here.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.790
So who is your market segment or
persona?

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.420
Then we have Who.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.210
So our target customer is blank.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.080
Now what is their main problem
that our company is solving for?

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.490
So this is where you write in
their problem or their need.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.610
Our product or service is, blank.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.660
Now this is where you describe
the product or the solution.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630
You want to categorize this generally.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.880
Remember, this is not
the differentiation line.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.420
Then we have that provides.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.380
What is your primary
benefit to your customer?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.530
What is your solution to their problem?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.170
Cite your breakthrough capability here.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.240
And the main benefit that
the customer receives.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.510
Next we have unlike.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.900
This is where you want to
reference your competition.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.320
Now you're not trying to compare
a Michelin star restaurant to

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.420
a Subway here.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.750
This is a real alternative
to your business.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.050
And finally, our product or
solution, blank.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.550
This is where you state your primary
differentiation with your competitor.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.519
This is your key point of
competitive differentiation.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.100
Not every way that you're different, and
some consider this last line optional.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.720
So taken together, the template is for
your target customers, who,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.800
what is their main problem, and
you state your product or services,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.260
describe the solution or your product,
but don't differentiate.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.030
And what is it that you provide for
your customer?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.490
Unlike, who's your main competition?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.950
And what is it that differentiates
you from that competition.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.240
This is simple framework, but really
helps you clearly define your product

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.050
and where you fit
against the competitor.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.770
Now, I want you to take the time
to fill this out yourself.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.870
I want you to fill in the blanks to
complete your value proposition.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.000
You can use your own app idea, or

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400
you can try to fill it in
using the aBarkment idea.
