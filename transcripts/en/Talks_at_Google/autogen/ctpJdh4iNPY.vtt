DORINA ARELLANO:
That was so cool.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.537
TINA GUO: Thank you, Dorina.

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:54.620
Thanks for having me here.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.520
DORINA ARELLANO: So awesome.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.353
TINA GUO: Thank you.

00:02:56.353 --> 00:02:59.260
DORINA ARELLANO: I just
totally nerded out, so anyway.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.040
So welcome.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.077
Thank you for coming.

00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:01.910
TINA GUO: Thank you.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.370
It's lovely to be here.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.030
DORINA ARELLANO:
Do you want to talk

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.440
about what you just played?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.970
TINA GUO: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.400
So the first piece I
played was very old.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.920
It was by a German
composer named Bach.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.550
He had many, many children.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.860
So he was very prolific in
child making and music writing.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.287
So that was probably one of his
most well-known cello pieces.

00:03:21.287 --> 00:03:23.620
You guys probably have heard
it somewhere before, right?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.930
Like Nike commercials
and basically anything

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.760
with a cello, it's,
like, synonymous, oh,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.560
that's the cello piece.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.240
And then after that,
it was actually

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.380
the main theme from the
new "Wonder Woman" series.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.430
And I did do the original
with Hans Zimmer so.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.990
Thank you.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.300
And it's very exciting
that very soon we're

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.970
going to start working
on "Wonder Woman

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.940
2," some music for that.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.500
So I'm very excited
about that yes.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.900
DORINA ARELLANO: Awesome.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.480
TINA GUO: And that was it.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.410
Now, I'm sitting here.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.050
DORINA ARELLANO: Cool.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.720
Well, thank you.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.020
Well, I am a huge fan of Tina.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.337
I actually met her a
couple of years ago.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:03:59.920
I gave her my business
card, because I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.210
was, like, I need to meet you.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.751
It was really creepy in,
like, a stalkerish way.

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:05.250
So I was, hey, let
me interview you.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.340
TINA GUO: I like stalkers.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.270
DORINA ARELLANO: So
thank you for coming.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.620
I've actually seen
her twice in concert.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.530
She's amazing.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.160
So I wanted to start with
really background questions

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.200
like when did you start
playing the cello?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.450
What made you choose that
particular instrument?

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.810
Was it kind of like your choice?

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.980
Was it forced upon
you by your parents?

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.937
What was that?

00:04:23.937 --> 00:04:24.520
TINA GUO: Yes.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.460
So I was born in
Shanghai, China.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.260
So I was made in China.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.280
And my first instrument like
many, many Chinese children

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.660
was piano.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.370
So I started when I
was three years old.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.960
And then later I
moved to the US.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.100
My parents are actually
both classical musicians.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.310
So they're classical music
teachers who live in San Diego.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.162
And so they popped me out.

00:04:45.162 --> 00:04:46.870
And then they came to
the US because they

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.930
were able to have an opportunity
to go to school in the US

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.380
for music, get a scholarship.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.380
And that was very, very rare
in like post communist China,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.110
like right after.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.630
So they took the opportunity.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.240
And my grandparents,
my mom's parents,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.201
actually raised
me for a few years

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:01.450
while they were here studying.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.000
I got really, really large.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.105
When I came to America--

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:05.980
I'm not kidding you--

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.650
I was like 82 pounds
at five years old.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.500
That is not normal.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.090
Right?

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.750
So I was a little round
ball, oh, I play the piano.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.190
And then I moved here.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.870
And my parents
thought that I should

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.070
play one of the
instruments that they

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.028
knew how to play because,
obviously, that would

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.220
save money on music lessons.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.510
So I started on the violin.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.570
I was really bad.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.840
I played "Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star" for--

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.564
again, I'm not exaggerating--
like six months.

00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:30.730
I could not get past "Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star."

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.271
Like, wow, she's
not talented, right?

00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:34.242
So then I switched to the cello.

00:05:34.242 --> 00:05:36.700
And for some reason, even though
it's like kind of similar,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.950
it just came a lot
more naturally.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.180
And I seemed to
progress pretty quickly.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.560
So my dad decided, OK, this
is what she's going to play.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.534
And from there on out I was--

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:47.950
I had to say forced
to be honest--

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.880
I was forced to practice
eight hours a day, every day--

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.650
which I'm grateful for now.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.010
I didn't have much of a
childhood I have to admit.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.760
And I was very angsty.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.700
Hence, probably my
love for metal now.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.580
It was very like,
ah, I hate my life.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.900
I mean it was really extreme.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.066
And I've talked about it
before so hopefully they'll

00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:09.730
forgive me for spilling
the family secrets.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.309
But they would lock me in my
room sometimes to practice.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:14.100
And they'll like let
me out once in a while

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.310
to go to the bathroom, maybe
eat something if I was lucky.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.800
But I have to say
that type of like very

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.900
regimented, strict training--

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.150
really, I have to say it
did pay off in the end,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.510
because if you don't practice
for that many hours every day,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.940
you know, whether it's cello
or swimming or basketball,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.110
you don't build that
type of muscle memory.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.250
So I was more comfortable
playing the cello than really

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.960
doing anything else.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.430
So, yeah, to answer
your question,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.770
I was forced into
the family trade,

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.314
but I'm happy to be here now.

00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:44.730
DORINA ARELLANO:
Yeah, that sounds

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.540
like-- your parents
sound both terrifying,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.190
but also thank you
to your parents.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.790
TINA GUO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.290
No.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.650
They're definitely terrifying.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.960
But also at the same
time, I think it actually

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.720
takes a lot of courage and a lot
of determination and sacrifice

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720
on their part, you know?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.082
Because when I have babies--

00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:01.540
I don't have kids
yet-- but I don't

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.510
know if I can spend
that many hours yelling

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.540
at my kids, practice.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.620
DORINA ARELLANO: That's
some dedication for sure.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.620
TINA GUO: Yeah, it's dedication.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.536
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:09.310
Cool.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.530
So whether it was growing up or
now, what do you think were--

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.240
other than your parents--

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.360
music influences
that affected you

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.344
or that inspired
you to keep playing,

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.510
whether it's this instrument
or other type of music,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.950
because you mentioned
metal as well?

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.074
TINA GUO: Yeah, definitely.

00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:31.600
So again, growing up because, my
parents are ultra conservative

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.464
and just very, very
classical music is good,

00:07:34.464 --> 00:07:36.130
anything else is the
music of the devil.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.070
You can't listen to it.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.820
And of course, what
happens when you don't

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.800
allow people to do something?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.770
They get very curious.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.144
Especially me,
because I'm really

00:07:44.144 --> 00:07:45.420
a contrarian in many ways.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.360
I'm like, oh, yeah?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.460
I'm going to--

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.390
DORINA ARELLANO: Same.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.550
TINA GUO: So the very first
exposure that I had to,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.400
I guess, heavier music or
the underground alternative

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.200
was a Marilyn Manson.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.430
And how did this come about?

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.020
So I was in seventh grade.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.520
This was a little
bit later in life.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.310
I mean that's not that late
in life, but seventh grade.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.200
And I remember I had this
crush on a kid named Luke.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.380
He was like a combination
of a Goth and a nerd.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.560
He was like a nerdy goth?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.060
Right?

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.920
He had these really
thick Coke bottle

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.870
glasses with thick black rims.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.750
But he also had long hair
down on the shoulders

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.620
and black lipstick.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.160
And I'm oh, my god,
who is this kid?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.510
He's so weird.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.260
I love it.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.720
And the neighborhood
we grew up in

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.110
was not very
alternative so everybody

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.940
was pretty much the
same, very preppy.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.620
DORINA ARELLANO: You're
like the weird one, you.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.980
TINA GUO: Yes, I'm
like he's weird.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.521
I'm going to follow him around
at lunch, like a little loser,

00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:38.320
like a stalker, right?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.404
And then so one day, he's
like, hey, Tina, have

00:08:40.404 --> 00:08:41.570
you heard of Marilyn Manson?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.440
I'm like who's she?

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.590
No, I don't know who that is.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.260
So he let me borrow his
"Antichrist Superstar" CD,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.290
because back in those
days we listened to CDs.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.610
DORINA ARELLANO: Good CD.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.350
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.770
And I had a boombox in my room
that we got at a garage sale

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.980
from the next door neighbor,
so nearby garage sale.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.480
And there's a CD
player at the top.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.771
And I remember I would turn
the volume all the way down

00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:04.630
to a little bit below
one, so like 0.9 volume

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.746
and put my ear up
against the boombox.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.120
I mean, I wouldn't
be here today,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.100
I'd be dead if they heard that.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:15.040
And I'd be, like,
yeah, I am so cool.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.880
So that actually had
a huge impact on me.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.710
Imagine coming from
classical music to--

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.170
I guess that's like industrial--
it's not really metal,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.034
but like heavy
industrial, dark music.

00:09:26.034 --> 00:09:26.825
And I was just so--

00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:27.090
DORINA ARELLANO: Goth music.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:27.670
TINA GUO: Goth music.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.290
And I was very fascinated by it.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.529
I started trying to like--

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.320
oh, I found a clip.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.510
Sorry.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.880
I'm going to go way
off tangent right now.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.380
Stop me.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:34.930
OK.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.555
So all these memories
are pouring back.

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.754
So I found this clip-on
earring, like just

00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:39.670
like the clip on part.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.650
There was no actual earring.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.210
You know the plastic
part, that kind of--

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.376
the metal plastic-- you
know what I'm talking about?

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.131
Yeah?

00:09:45.131 --> 00:09:47.380
I'm like, ah, that would
make a really cool nose ring.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.260
Because I wanted to be cool,
but I didn't have any piercings.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.617
So I would go to school.

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:53.200
I would run into the
bathroom and clip

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.397
this plastic clip on earring
thing like a bull, on my nose.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.770
I'm so cool.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.180
So anyway.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.240
So Marilyn Manson.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.630
And then a few years later in
high school, my best friend--

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.810
her name is also Tina--

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.990
and she had a Guns
and Roses tape.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.490
Oh, my gosh, a cassette tape.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.630
"Appetite for Destruction."

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.410
So I heard that.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.424
And then the third musical
influence that I heard,

00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:20.590
but I only heard the first
two tracks of their album

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.600
was a Daft Punk CD that I got
at yet another garage sale.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
But it was scratched up.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.766
So only the first-- it
wasn't even first two tracks.

00:10:26.766 --> 00:10:28.460
The first track
and a half worked.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.190
And so I would like listen
to it for a track and a half.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.064
And then it would skip
and then stop working.

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.000
I'd rewind it and just
keep listening to it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.680
And that was my
musical influence, that

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.090
and classical music.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.570
DORINA ARELLANO: That's so good.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.820
And that actually makes sense.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.690
If you follow Tina's
career, it makes sense,

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.320
because she's really all
over the place in a good way.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.660
You know, she's not
the typical cellist

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.590
that you would go see at
the Disney Concert Hall.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.020
She does all of this cool stuff.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.570
One of the concerts
that I saw her at she

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.560
ended up playing "Super
Mario Bros," the theme.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.500
And then all of a sudden
went into a heavy metal

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.580
version of it.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.980
And I freaked out, because
I was like it's like she's

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.330
dedicating this to me.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.050
It was so cool.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.100
TINA GUO: It was for
you, just for you.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.370
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:09.870
Thank you.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.960
That's right.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.560
And it was really cool.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.420
So she has albums out, right?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.480
There's this one
called "Game On"

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.040
where you play video game music.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.430
So how did that come about?

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.480
And how do you, as a musician--

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.530
because do you do your own
compositions and arrangements

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.027
for when you're doing
a cover and putting

00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:32.860
your own spin on it?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.192
Like how does that blend of
metal and classical come about?

00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:37.150
TINA GUO: Right, right.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.099
So this album that
she's talking about,

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:40.390
it was actually my first album.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.330
I finally got signed
to a major label,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.820
to Sony, almost two years ago.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.516
So "Game On" was the first
label released album that I did.

00:11:49.516 --> 00:11:50.890
But actually,
previous to that, I

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.080
self-released nine
albums by myself.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.936
So I self-funded it.

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:56.060
I recorded it myself, didn't
know what I was doing,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.610
but I figured it
out along the way.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.500
If you listened to
my oldest albums,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.030
it's like, whoa,
that's really bad.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.738
And it hopefully gets
a little bit better

00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:04.310
as I'm figuring out what to do.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.490
But I released albums
that were fully classical.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.170
And my parents were
happy about that.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.810
And then I did some
super metal ones.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.340
There is one called
"Cello Metal,"

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.610
because that's how creative
I am-- cello, metal.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.790
And then so when I
got signed to Sony,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.920
it was weird timing
because I had planned

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.810
on doing a music video--

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.335
music video, sorry--
a game music album.

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:28.570
And since I moved to LA,
I feel like everyone's

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.370
in the entertainment industry
in some way or another.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.734
So I started doing-- when I
came to college, as a side

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:36.400
gig to make money,
amongst other things,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.733
I tried to sell Avon, et cetera.

00:12:37.733 --> 00:12:39.410
I wasn't very good at that.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.840
But I started
doing session work.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.070
And slowly I built that up.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.859
And I ended up playing
on a lot of video game,

00:12:44.859 --> 00:12:46.150
like in the actual soundtracks.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.830
So I had thought,
oh, maybe I should

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.020
do some versions of
my own of the stuff

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.506
that I've played on or some
of my favorite game music.

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:54.380
And so when Sony signed
me, they said, oh, we

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.881
were thinking that maybe you
could do a video game music

00:12:56.881 --> 00:12:57.380
album.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.179
Like no way, check
out my spreadsheet--

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.220
because I love Google
Spreadsheets-- so I already

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.303
had a spreadsheet of all
the music I wanted to do,

00:13:03.303 --> 00:13:04.490
the tracks.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.620
And so it was really
one of those situations

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.711
where it was perfect,
perfect timing.

00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.210
And so I just kind of picked
some of my favorite music, some

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.310
of the games that I
did play a little bit

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.530
and then some just
epic music that I

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.970
love like "Final Fantasy 7."

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.201
I mean it's just
like opulent music.

00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:20.700
So that's how it
kind of came about.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.741
DORINA ARELLANO: So cool.

00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:23.664
Do you have a
favorite video game?

00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:24.830
TINA GUO: It doesn't count--

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.579
I don't know if it
counts as a video game.

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:28.980
But what I'm playing right
now-- which is really bad.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.010
I don't know if you guys play
"Homescapes" or "Gardenscapes?"

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.510
No.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.160
It's like what's that?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.090
My mom plays it, too.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.150
That's when you know it's bad.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.940
I was telling my mom, oh,
I have found this thing,

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.801
like "Gardenscapes."

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:39.300
What?

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.990
Me, too.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.906
I play "Gardenscapes."

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:43.714
I'm oh, no, I'm like playing
the same games as my mom.

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:45.380
It's kind of like
little matching games.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.080
And then you can win points
and upgrade your garden.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.831
I know.

00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:50.330
Not metal.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.440
DORINA ARELLANO:
I would play it.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.180
I mean, probably.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.270
TINA GUO: It's on iPad
and your iPhone and stuff.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.520
DORINA ARELLANO: There you go.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.728
Now, we have to check it out.

00:13:56.728 --> 00:13:57.870
TINA GUO: OK.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.987
Promoting "Gardenscapes."

00:13:59.987 --> 00:14:01.070
DORINA ARELLANO: So, yeah.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.920
You mentioned your
album "Cello Metal."

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.530
And I mean you have the songs
by Black Sabbath and Metallica,

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.450
Slayer, it's so good.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.550
These are not just
covers, right?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.400
Like there's arrangements
that go into this.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.220
Did you end up really
getting into metal?

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.662
And then it seems like
sometimes-- correct me

00:14:21.662 --> 00:14:23.120
if I'm wrong-- but
like when you're

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.600
playing the metal
versions of songs,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.426
you kind of treat the
cello like a guitar.

00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:30.800
TINA GUO: Yeah,
exactly, exactly.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.630
So when I was listening
to that Guns N' Roses

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.130
"Appetite for Destruction,"
you know, Slash.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.490
I was, like, oh, my
god, I want to be Slash.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.710
How do I become Slash?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.100
So I think, basically, what I
did with the electric cello is

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.420
just try to experiment with it.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.050
I use guitar effects.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.724
This is a pedal born
meant for a guitar player.

00:14:45.724 --> 00:14:48.390
But I thought it's close enough,
it's kind of in the same range.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.107
And so, yeah, that's
exactly what I try to do.

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:52.940
And even with the "Wonder
Woman" main theme,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.280
I sometimes I
would go on YouTube

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.239
and look at-- the people
just upload the track.

00:14:57.239 --> 00:14:59.529
And there's some comments
like, oh, the guitar is cool.

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:01.550
I'm like, it's not a
guitar, it's cello.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.671
But at the same time, it's
good, because I want it

00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:04.920
to sound like a guitar player.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.090
So the fact that it's
a little bit confusing

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.170
is like both a good and
a bad thing, you know?

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.470
DORINA ARELLANO: No.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.136
And that's true.

00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:12.940
That's actually--
because I'm a nerd--

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.200
I've also corrected people,
because they'll be like,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.658
oh, yeah, I love that little
guitar solo in "Wonder Woman."

00:15:17.658 --> 00:15:19.515
And I'm, like, that is a cello.

00:15:19.515 --> 00:15:21.650
What are you talking about?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.630
So speaking of
"Wonder Woman," that

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.880
must be such a cool experience.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.870
Tell us about that.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.180
What was it like to
get involved-- first

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.090
of all with one of my favorite
composers of all time, which

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.090
is Hans Zimmer and
then Junkie XL,

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.690
that they made this
really cool iconic theme?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.530
What was it like?

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.750
And how did that
process come about

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.824
to be involved in
such an iconic movie?

00:15:46.824 --> 00:15:47.490
TINA GUO: Right.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.770
So I think to backtrack, the
way that I met Hans was actually

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.500
through YouTube.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.960
So my very, very first
music video, I released it--

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.090
my gosh-- like 10
years ago, I think.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.140
Yeah.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.815
I'm old.

00:16:00.815 --> 00:16:01.690
No, I'm not that old.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.070
But 10 years ago, it's
called "Queen Bee"

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.500
and it was my metal version
of "Flight of the Bumblebee."

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.780
I know it's been done before.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.780
But I was just starting,
I wasn't very original.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.020
But anyway, so I
did a metal cover.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.535
And he actually saw
the music video,

00:16:13.535 --> 00:16:16.160
because he spends a lot of time
watching YouTube videos looking

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.480
at musicians.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.800
And his office
actually contacted me.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.270
And at the time, I was trying
to become a metal cellist.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.250
My life goal was to
play with Rammstein.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.080
And that's what--
and I thought, oh,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.239
if I release this
music video, maybe

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.530
metal bands will see the video.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.230
And they'll be like, oh, she
should like come play with us.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.190
So that was my entire purpose.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.860
But instead, that somehow
accidentally segued me

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.290
into a career in
soundtrack work.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.690
So now the majority
of my work here in LA,

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.080
I work on movie scores, TV
scores, video game stuff.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.540
And so he saw the
video, called me.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.580
The first movie that
we worked on together

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.249
was "Sherlock Holmes."

00:16:51.249 --> 00:16:52.040
The very first one.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.970
I remember I walked in--

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.490
so bad.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.614
If he watches this, please
don't get offended Hans.

00:16:56.614 --> 00:16:58.666
Sorry-- I actually
don't know who he was.

00:16:58.666 --> 00:17:00.290
So when his assistant
called, like, I'm

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.290
calling from Hans Zimmer's
office, I'm like who?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.350
What?

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.779
So I went in.

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:06.445
I still didn't know
what I was expecting

00:17:06.445 --> 00:17:08.068
to his office in Santa Monica.

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:09.859
And they're, like, oh,
Hans is having lunch

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.880
in the next building, because
there's all these buildings.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.950
So I went up there.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.480
And I did recognize Guy Ritchie.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.160
They were having lunch.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:16.980
And so I sat down.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.521
And there's like
all these, you know,

00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.480
cool celebrity people
and then, like, me.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.190
I'm like, oh, wow, OK.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.640
I guess I'm in a good situation.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.724
And so that's how we
started working together.

00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:27.140
And then we worked
on a bunch of--

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.650
"Inception" and a lot
of movies after that.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.400
And so this one, I
think they had actually

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.191
been experimenting.

00:17:32.191 --> 00:17:34.520
Originally, they were
thinking it would be a vocal,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.420
like a female vocal.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.301
And for some reason--

00:17:36.301 --> 00:17:37.550
they tried different singers--

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.100
like it just wasn't
quite fitting.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.910
And the Hans said, oh, we
should have Tina come in

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.035
with her electric cello
and do some weird shrieking

00:17:43.035 --> 00:17:45.570
sound, like a screaming Amazon.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.580
And so I went in.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.850
And it's a pretty-- it's a
simple melody that repeats over

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.650
and over and over.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.870
I literally played
it at least 1,000

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.160
times over and over and over.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.410
But we finally figured it out.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.510
And the theme is
actually layered.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.060
It's not just one
electric cello,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.912
but it's like 30 layers
of electric cello

00:18:03.912 --> 00:18:05.120
to get that really fat sound.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.520
DORINA ARELLANO:
And that's all you.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.645
TINA GUO: Yes, it's all me.

00:18:07.645 --> 00:18:09.140
So, yeah, lots of
multi tracking.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.610
And actually Junkie, I've
never even met him in person.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.651
He wasn't actually there.

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:15.970
So it's just myself and Hans
and then all of Hans' peoples,

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.290
entourage--

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:17.999
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:20.373
DORINA ARELLANO: But they both
composed the theme, right?

00:18:20.373 --> 00:18:21.830
TINA GUO: I believe so, yeah.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.600
A lot of times,
there's so many people

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.190
working on different
components of it.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.170
But, yeah, definitely.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.503
DORINA ARELLANO: That's so cool.

00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:30.950
I mean, I remember the first
time I heard that theme was--

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.930
I think it was "Batman
v. Superman the Movie."

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.110
TINA GUO: Yes.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.640
DORINA ARELLANO: And
there's that scene where--

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.320
spoilers-- Wonder
Woman basically

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.035
saves Batman, because
she actually has powers.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:40.910
No offense to Batman.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.350
I love Batman, too.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.160
But she basically does this
and the music comes on.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.390
And I hear the cello.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.560
And I'm like, oh, my god,
like this is like my jam.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.560
I was so happy about it.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.710
That's so cool.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.040
TINA GUO: Yea.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.042
DORINA ARELLANO: And
speaking of Hans, that's

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.000
actually one of the best
concerts I've been to.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.580
And I go to like
30 concerts a year.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.840
It's bad.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.720
And Tina was there along with
all these other great studio

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.760
musicians that Hans brought.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.010
And they basically
just play his scores.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.410
And that was such
a cool concert.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.830
I mean they played
everything from "Inception"

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.890
to "Sherlock Holmes."

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.390
Obviously, you
played "Wonder Woman"

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.681
and "Pirates of the Caribbean."

00:19:18.681 --> 00:19:19.480
What was that like?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.480
And was that kind of
like a dream of you

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.710
to be on stage with the
best musicians in the world?

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.790
And what's that
compared to what you

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.760
want to do in the future
or dreams of yours?

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.220
TINA GUO: Right, right.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.100
So of course, it was.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.683
I don't know if you
guys have seen it.

00:19:35.683 --> 00:19:38.109
It's on Netflix like
the "Live in Prague,"

00:19:38.109 --> 00:19:39.400
our show that we did in Prague.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.650
This was two tours
ago, two years ago.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.180
But when Hans first
said, oh, we're

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.770
thinking of maybe
taking this on the road

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.811
instead of being locked
up in a dark room all day

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:47.660
writing music.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.260
And I thought, great, because
for me, I love studio music.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.290
But while I'm still young enough
to prance around on stage,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.740
I want to take the opportunity
to travel, to perform live.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.450
And so it was really,
really amazing.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.490
And we played mostly
arenas, which is crazy.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.750
Because we all thought
is anyone going to come?

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.000
Is it going to be five people?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.320
But it was amazing, because,
I mean, Hans is huge.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.570
So all over the world
the arenas were full.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.600
So it was an amazing experience.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.790
And prior to that, I
actually, in a past life,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.470
I was in the Cirque du Soleil.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.170
And so it was weird to kind
of revisit the same arenas

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.370
that we played, but
with Hans this time.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.430
And it was just, yeah,
I mean what can I say?

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.100
It's really, really,
really awesome.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.360
And there was good food.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.026
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh,
that's always good.

00:20:27.026 --> 00:20:28.880
TINA GUO: I like free catering.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.110
DORINA ARELLANO: Wait.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.443
So you were in Cirque du Soleil?

00:20:30.443 --> 00:20:31.350
What did you do?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.720
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.410
Well, I play the cello.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.720
I was kind of like
this weird cello--

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.385
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh, I thought
you were like an acrobat,

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:35.460
and I was, like, ooh.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.900
TINA GUO: I'm not that flexible.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.720
No.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.250
I was like a weird cello alien.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.510
And I was wearing this outfit.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.380
I was skinnier then.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.960
I mean I know I'm not large
now, but they put me on a diet.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.740
They're like no.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.180
I was the largest person
in the entire show.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.720
Like all these like acrobat
girls with eight packs.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.730
I'm like Jesus Christ.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.050
So I would actually paint on
fake abs to try to blend in.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.080
And I remember one
time, someone I

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.564
think waiting for us
outside of the stage door.

00:20:58.564 --> 00:20:59.230
And they saw me.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.600
He's, like, oh, you're that
cellist, man, you are cut.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.340
I'm like, it's makeup.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.832
Because from far away, if you
have really bad makeup on,

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:07.540
it actually looks like
you're super buff.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.410
And I have a one
pack of nothing.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:09.982
You know?

00:21:09.982 --> 00:21:11.440
And the acrobats
are looking at me,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.814
they're like
working out all day.

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.330
And I'm just eating in catering.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.899
And I paint on my abs.

00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:17.440
But, yeah, I was
wearing this outfit.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.000
It was all Swarovski crystal.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.025
And it was the "Michael
Jackson, the Immortal Tour

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:22.900
by Cirque Du Soleil."

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.190
So it was actually half
owned by the Jackson estate.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.622
So this was after
Michael passed.

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:29.080
Obviously, he
couldn't do the tour.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.480
So we had his vocals.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.130
And then it was combined
with a Cirque du Soleil

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.330
to add in other elements.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.574
And now they have the Michael
Jackson show in Las Vegas.

00:21:38.574 --> 00:21:40.240
That's kind of like
the smaller version.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.240
But the original one that
opened was also an arena tour.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.060
So, yeah, I did
that for two years.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.644
I was a gypsy.

00:21:45.644 --> 00:21:46.893
DORINA ARELLANO: That's crazy.

00:21:46.893 --> 00:21:48.010
You've done everything.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.968
And you're so young and
you've done everything.

00:21:49.968 --> 00:21:51.110
Good for you.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.617
So you have a new album
coming out this year,

00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:56.200
or you're working
on this year, right?

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.755
TINA GUO: Hopefully, it
will come out this year.

00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:00.130
We're working on
song number two.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.690
So we'll see how it progresses.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.530
DORINA ARELLANO:
Can you tell us--

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.660
can you give us a little
bit of a preview for it

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:05.080
or what you're working on?

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:05.814
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:22:05.814 --> 00:22:07.480
Like I was telling
you, Dorina, earlier,

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.980
the idea for this
album has already

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.080
changed like five times.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.950
But that's part of
the creative process.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.174
You think you have a great
idea, then you do it.

00:22:14.174 --> 00:22:16.090
And you're like, wow,
this is really horrible.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.280
And then you erase it
and you start again.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.500
So I think we have the
general theme down.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.190
It's not really-- I mean, it's
kind of a cover, but not really

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.440
a cover, because I wanted
to do original material.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.320
But being that I don't sing
and it's instrumental music,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.720
it is difficult to have
something to grasp.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.640
It's not radio friendly.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.820
So we thought, what if we took
some classical pieces, but not

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.220
an entire cover, where you
just take a short segment.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.830
Like rappers, they sample
stuff that's recognizable,

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.590
and then kind of expand that,
and explode that into something

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.267
original and different.

00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:47.600
So that's what we're working on.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.474
So I guess you would
call it like classically

00:22:49.474 --> 00:22:51.236
based, cinematic medley.

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.110
Of course, there will
be some metal elements.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.030
DORINA ARELLANO: Yea.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.910
TINA GUO: Yea.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.824
Just for you.

00:22:56.824 --> 00:22:58.490
And, yeah, that's
what we're working on.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.940
I'm hoping it will come out
around the same time as "Wonder

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.440
Woman 2."

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.804
That's our whole
goal for the timing.

00:23:03.804 --> 00:23:04.720
DORINA ARELLANO: Cool.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.000
Can you tell us anything about
the "Wonder Woman" music or no?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.570
No, spoilers.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.230
TINA GUO: No, sorry.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:09.130
DORINA ARELLANO:
Contracts, I know.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.680
I got it.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.520
I got it.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.020
OK.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.480
So I wanted to ask about
since you perform with Hans,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.310
are there collaborators
that you work

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.680
with that it was a very
meaningful thing to you

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.572
or is there somebody
that you dream

00:23:22.572 --> 00:23:24.530
of working with in the
future that you're like,

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.970
oh, I would die if I
worked with that person?

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:26.553
TINA GUO: Yes.

00:23:26.553 --> 00:23:28.510
So remember how I said
that that first music

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.030
video that I made and I
spent every penny that I

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.880
had on at the time and I was
broke after, this metal music

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.380
video?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.088
I was hoping that
Rammstein would see it.

00:23:37.088 --> 00:23:39.542
I still really would
love to work with them.

00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:40.750
My thing is I don't want to--

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.170
I never reach out to
people and say, hey,

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.170
I want to work with you, because
I try to wait and manifest it.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.660
And hopefully, eventually,
somehow it'll just come

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.360
or we'll have mutual friends
or something weird will happen.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.890
So my dream is
that one day, I'll

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.320
be able to play with Rammstein.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.554
Hello, Rammstein.

00:23:56.554 --> 00:23:58.470
DORINA ARELLANO: Well,
we'll send this to him.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.540
TINA GUO: OK.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.180
DORINA ARELLANO: And then, you
were just at Noam recently.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.764
TINA GUO: Yes.

00:24:03.764 --> 00:24:05.305
DORINA ARELLANO:
And for those of you

00:24:05.305 --> 00:24:07.560
that don't know, if you
could explain what that is.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.734
But Tina actually has
an instrument line,

00:24:11.734 --> 00:24:12.900
because she does everything.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.185
So can you talk a little
bit about that as well?

00:24:15.185 --> 00:24:15.935
TINA GUO: Oh, yes.

00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:17.850
So in addition to
music, I'm actually

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.650
very passionate about
entrepreneurship and investing.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.340
But that's a whole other thing
that we won't go into today.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.980
But one of my, I
guess, side businesses

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.430
is a line of instruments,
bows, and pickups

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.110
for acoustic string instruments.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.160
So I have a couple of different
cello models, classical cello

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.180
models.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.770
We offer bows in both wood and
carbon fiber in custom colors.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.414
You can even get
like the hair here.

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:43.580
This is actually horse hair.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.110
But don't worry, no horses
were harmed in the making

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.220
of any of these bows.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.890
And we dye them all kind
of different colors.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.620
And so that's just something
that I also do on the side.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.320
DORINA ARELLANO: What's the
difference between horse hair

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.037
and other types of hair
that are used for bows?

00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:01.620
TINA GUO: So on the bows that I
play with the electric cello--

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.370
I actually tried not
to go too crazy today

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.077
because it's noon, Monday--

00:25:05.077 --> 00:25:06.410
so I don't want to be too extra.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.270
But if I play really, really
hard and I use a normal bow,

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.560
I'll literally destroy like one
bow every 15 minutes, maybe.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.060
Because if you hit it really
hard, all the hairs will break.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.760
And so for actually that
cello when I play it,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.670
I usually use fishing wire,
because it's like plastic.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.140
So it doesn't sound as good,
but it lasts a lot longer.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.996
Again, since it costs about $80,
usually about $80 per rehair.

00:25:27.996 --> 00:25:29.370
But for the
classical cello, I do

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.220
use the traditional
horsehair on the bows.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.890
DORINA ARELLANO: And I want
to talk about the difference

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.300
between when--

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.440
because, I actually grew up
playing the cello, this one.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.720
How did you transition
to doing electric?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.990
And what are the challenges
or what are the differences

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.542
or what's better or worse
between both instruments?

00:25:48.542 --> 00:25:49.500
TINA GUO: Right, right.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.350
I always tell people
if you compare it

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.715
to a classical guitar
and an electric guitar,

00:25:55.715 --> 00:25:56.880
it's exactly the same.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.550
So, yeah, I mean the frets
are in the same place.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.461
But as far as, obviously, when
I play this cello, I'm sitting.

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:03.960
And when I play
that, it's standing.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.990
And it's actually more difficult
to play the electric cello

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.190
in tune, because your whole
body-- as you can see,

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.380
it's just one end pin.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.030
So it's kind of like
a tripod situation

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.750
where my legs are
like this, right?

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.110
And you're kind of
trying to move with it

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.400
so it doesn't fall over.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.080
Because when I started,
it took me about two years

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.570
to figure out how to play it
without looking super awkward.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.820
I'm sure I still look awkward.

00:26:25.259 --> 00:26:27.300
There's a lot of people
who play electric violin.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.133
There's some people who
play electric cello.

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:32.670
But it's still not a super
popular thing, I guess.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.054
So I was really trying to
figure out how to do it

00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:37.470
and to be able to
stand so you can

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.150
be a little bit more mobile
instead of just sitting

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.910
all the time.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.860
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah,
because if you're

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.915
trying to hit the right
notes and you're playing

00:26:42.915 --> 00:26:45.290
and you're moving around, how
do you hit the right notes?

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.360
TINA GUO: Right, right, right.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.280
And there's no frets.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.310
It's muscle memory.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.430
So genuinely, it took
me like two years

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.360
of non-stop practice on that
one just to not sound horrible.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.860
Yeah.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.620
DORINA ARELLANO:
That's so awesome.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.620
And so I mentioned, I
grew up playing the cello.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.000
I haven't played in years.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.160
So for somebody like me--

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.590
TINA GUO: Do you want to play?

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.060
DORINA ARELLANO: No.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.610
TINA GUO: OK.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.050
DORINA ARELLANO: Definitely not.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.470
Especially after she played.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.410
So for somebody
like me or somebody

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.140
that's a beginner
that's hoping to play--

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.840
like for me it seems very
daunting to get back into this.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.390
Just because as you mentioned
earlier, it takes discipline.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:21.750
What advice would
you give people

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.760
like me and beginner musicians?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.350
Or what tips or what do you do
to not get uninspired and keep

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.860
playing?

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.526
TINA GUO: Right.

00:27:29.526 --> 00:27:31.560
I think everything's
just about consistency.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.474
And I'm not going to
lie and say, you know,

00:27:33.474 --> 00:27:35.140
you're always going
to want to practice.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.806
I don't even want to
practice sometimes.

00:27:36.806 --> 00:27:39.690
But I have the internal
Asian tiger parent already

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:40.870
in my brain.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.620
So even if I don't want
to, I'm like I have to.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.670
I have to.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.814
So if you just force
yourself to be consistent.

00:27:47.814 --> 00:27:50.480
And I'm not saying eight hours a
day, because we all have lives.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.510
And I don't do eight
hours a day anymore.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.140
But even if it's a good 30
minutes, like a really focused

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.780
30 minutes every day or
an hour, whether you're

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.810
learning cello or anything else,
it does come pretty quickly.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.160
But it's mostly
about consistency.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.830
Yeah.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:04.663
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:28:04.663 --> 00:28:05.290
We'll see.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.150
But thank you.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.691
TINA GUO: OK.

00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:07.800
Sure.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.200
DORINA ARELLANO:
So we actually only

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.210
have time for one more
question, unfortunately.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.530
And then Tina is going
to perform one more song.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.860
And then think of
some good questions,

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.620
because we'll open up the
floor to audience questions.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.730
So I wanted to also
ask about you've

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.370
had a lot of
partnerships with brands.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.585
And that's interesting
for a musician.

00:28:28.585 --> 00:28:29.710
Can you tell us about that?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.470
I think you worked
with Bentley last year.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.880
You're working
with Ritz-Carlton.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.610
What's that like?

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.070
And how do those things happen?

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.696
That's so cool.

00:28:35.696 --> 00:28:36.361
TINA GUO: Right.

00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:37.020
Thank you.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.920
Definitely very
grateful for that.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.790
And again, I don't reach
out usually-- not usually,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:43.290
I never--

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.090
I don't reach out to brands.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.910
I don't have someone
pursuing it for me.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.410
So these happened
organically, which

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.880
I think is the best way
for things to happen.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.170
And so the Bentley partnership,
actually the Marketing Director

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.700
Mike Sayer of Bentley in the
UK, he came to one of my shows.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.825
And then for some reason,
he Instagram messaged me.

00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:02.949
But you know on Instagram
if you don't follow them,

00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:04.410
it goes to your
archive messages.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.260
So I didn't see his
messages for months.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.789
Right?

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.330
And I think finally
he'll emailed me.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.860
And he's like, oh, I
tried to message you,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.760
but you ignored me.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.385
I'm messaging--

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:13.301
DORINA ARELLANO: He
stalked you the wrong way.

00:29:13.301 --> 00:29:15.470
He should have given you a
business card like I did.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.170
TINA GUO: Exactly.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.440
No, he came to the show, but
then he didn't come in person,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.940
you know.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.570
He didn't leave a
card like she did.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.000
So anyway, we connected.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.436
And then last year, I did
four performances for Bentley.

00:29:26.436 --> 00:29:27.560
I actually wrote the music.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.360
I scored a commercial for them
for the new Bentayga Hybrid,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.050
which is their SUV,
hybrid SUV, which

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.500
works with the idea of
taking something old--

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.340
Bentley is turning 100
years old this year,

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.590
so it's a very old company--

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.870
so taking something that's
old like this cello,

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:46.640
made in 1880 in Paris, France,
and transforming it and making

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.330
it something modern,
electric, with a hybrid SUV.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.080
So we did that.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.913
And that was a great
partnership for a year.

00:29:52.913 --> 00:29:57.584
And then this year I am a brand
partner with the Ritz-Carlton.

00:29:57.584 --> 00:29:59.750
So I'll be visiting some
of their different resorts.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.480
I know, awful job
visiting the resorts

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.660
and getting inspired by the
locations, the experiences,

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.390
the food that we'll have
there and taking that

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.510
and composing a kind of a
soundtrack, a theme song,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.730
for each location.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.940
And then playing a little bit,
playing like a very short show

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.080
at each one.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.100
So I don't know.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.510
I'm super excited about it.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.180
We have a meeting
on Wednesday to plan

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.680
the schedule for this year.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.805
DORINA ARELLANO: Cool, man.

00:30:25.805 --> 00:30:27.590
That sounds like a
nice part of the job.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:28.160
TINA GUO: Yeah,
yeah, definitely.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.940
I love to travel.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.670
I love to eat.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.150
I love to play music.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.080
Oh, and my fiance Rambo
gets to come, too.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.510
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.930
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:34.190
Yea.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.660
Hopefully he doesn't get
in trouble at work, though.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.450
He's supposed to be
at work right now.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.260
OK.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:39.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.649
TINA GUO: Hi.

00:30:40.649 --> 00:30:42.690
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
thanks for coming out.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.570
And thanks for having us.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.040
TINA GUO: Oh, of
course, thank you.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.565
AUDIENCE: That was wonderful.

00:30:46.565 --> 00:30:47.795
TINA GUO: Thank you.

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:49.910
AUDIENCE: I saw you're
playing not just the cello,

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.290
but also the erhu?

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.210
TINA GUO: Yes.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:53.000
AUDIENCE: And I
was just wondering

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.916
if you had some thoughts
like how they compare

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:56.804
and contrast, the spirit
of the instrument.

00:30:56.804 --> 00:30:57.470
TINA GUO: Right.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:02.120
So the erhu was that the
tall, thin Chinese thing.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.550
And it's made out of
rosewood and snakeskin.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.060
And I don't really know--

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.067
there's a fingerboard, so it's
kind of similar to a cello.

00:31:12.067 --> 00:31:14.150
But the strings are actually
suspended in the air.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.800
I wish I brought one
to show you guys.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.210
So you're not actually
pressing against anything,

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.760
so it's just a string.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.234
And it's-- I don't know.

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.900
I don't even know if
I play it properly.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.890
I'm self-taught.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.790
So I bought one.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.680
Actually-- wait.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.510
Do we have time if I tell a
really quick story about how

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.710
I learned to play the erhu?

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.150
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.680
TINA GUO: I was doing this
concert with the Golden State

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.990
Pops Orchestra and they were
doing a video game music

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.080
concert.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.390
And I was already playing--

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:40.840
I don't know if you
guys play "Journey."

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.360
No?

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:41.860
Yeah.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.130
So, yeah, Austin Wintory.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.510
So I did the original--

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.285
I play the cello
solos for that game.

00:31:46.285 --> 00:31:47.660
And so we were
playing "Journey."

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.850
It's, like, oh, Tina, since
you're playing in the concert,

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.840
you're going to be there
already, and you're Chinese,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.210
do you play the Chinese erhu?

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:56.140
You know, because all
Chinese people play the erhu.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.710
But I thought, oh,
like what is it?

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:58.190
They're, like, yeah.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.050
We have this game and
it features the erhu.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.120
And I thought, wow,
another opportunity

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.470
to be featured on stage?

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:04.699
Yeah, I want to do that.

00:32:04.699 --> 00:32:05.990
I could wear something Chinese.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.906
It will be really fun.

00:32:06.906 --> 00:32:08.780
But I had never played
the erhu before.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.620
So I lied.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.417
I said, yeah, I
could play the erhu.

00:32:12.417 --> 00:32:14.750
Just if you could just send
me the music ahead of time--

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.166
and there was still
like two weeks

00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:19.220
till the concert, which
is not that much time.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.070
And so I got off the
phone, got on Craigslist.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.930
I was searching erhu, erhu.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.280
There was no erhus for sale.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.820
So I finally found
a store in Texas,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.000
in Austin, Texas, that had
erhus with overnight shipping.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.760
So I paid like $100
extra for shipping.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.330
It arrived.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.450
I practiced every night.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.080
I didn't sleep.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.996
I was trying to learn.

00:32:37.996 --> 00:32:41.060
I was watching YouTube videos
like how to play the erhu.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.770
And I think I kind of did OK.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.860
We used a lot of
reverb in the concert.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.160
And it was pretty simple.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.090
It wasn't a super
complicated part, thankfully.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.440
So that's how I play the erhu.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.856
So when you ask
me about the erhu,

00:32:52.856 --> 00:32:54.680
I really am not
educated on actually

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.380
what it's supposed
to sound like.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.060
It sounds very ethnic, I
guess, because the tonality

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.352
is different.

00:33:00.352 --> 00:33:02.060
AUDIENCE: But it's
still continuous pitch

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.510
and everything.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.051
So I guess you had
faith in yourself,

00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:05.780
because you knew the principles.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.620
TINA GUO: Yes, the principles.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.790
And you just kind
of slide around.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.664
If you miss it, it's
like I meant to do that.

00:33:09.664 --> 00:33:11.580
It's part of the
Chineseness of it.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.080
You know?

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.790
It's like
[SLIDING NOTES],, right?

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.940
And it is very
forgiving in that way.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.440
Yeah.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.829
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks a lot.

00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:20.120
DORINA ARELLANO: Next question?

00:33:22.052 --> 00:33:23.510
AUDIENCE: Do you
have anything else

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.360
you can say about working
on "Journey" with Austin?

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.230
Like what you think about
having such evocative

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.564
visuals to go with your music
and those kinds of things.

00:33:32.564 --> 00:33:33.188
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:33:33.188 --> 00:33:34.880
So when we started
working on "Journey,"

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.180
I mean it was many years ago.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.890
I met Austin through
USC at school.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.260
And we had no idea it
was going to turn out

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.220
to be such a success.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.800
It was the first video
game ever nominated

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.080
for Best Soundtrack
for a Grammy.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.840
But when we did it, he was
still in his old studio, which

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.430
literally was just like a room.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.847
And we were both
just slumming it,

00:33:53.847 --> 00:33:55.388
like trying to figure
out what to do.

00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:57.500
And we both had no idea
that it would turn out

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.790
to be such a big,
successful game.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.760
And, yeah, I remember I just
went to a studio a few times.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.000
We would try out different
Ideas, again, lots of reverb.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.500
And I saw some of
the early visuals,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.630
but it was much later
that it was actually

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.949
placed into the game.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.089
So, yeah, it was fun.

00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:14.630
It was great.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.500
And I still work with
Austin, so it's good.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.000
Yeah.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.040
He just wrote to me
Instagram messaged me right

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.287
before I got up here.

00:34:21.287 --> 00:34:23.370
AUDIENCE: You don't have
him blocked, fortunately.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.810
TINA GUO: I don't what?

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.960
AUDIENCE: You don't
have him blocked.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.929
TINA GUO: I don't
have him blocked?

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:26.730
No.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.730
No.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:28.896
DORINA ARELLANO: Who's next.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.780
Over here?

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.439
The effects of the "Wonder
Woman" soundtrack--

00:34:38.439 --> 00:34:39.480
I mean I love that song--

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.010
TINA GUO: Oh, thank you.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.593
AUDIENCE: --made me
think a little bit

00:34:42.593 --> 00:34:44.730
of Les Claypool or Tom Reelo.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.909
I'm curious what
it's like to learn

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.530
the classical style
versus kind of try

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:54.239
to push the envelope of what
an instrument is capable of.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.250
Is there any overlap with
some of those artists

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.345
or are you just out
there on your own?

00:34:58.345 --> 00:34:59.470
TINA GUO: Yeah, definitely.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.060
I mean when I started, again,
YouTube was my teacher.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.160
So when I first got
my electric cello,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.360
I think it was about 11 years
ago when I was in college.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.810
I bought an electric cello
with a credit card from Yamaha.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.130
And then I was, like, OK,
what do I do with this?

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.210
So I would just go on YouTube
and watch guitar tutorials

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.250
and try to like-- because
the tonality again

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.585
is very, very different
from a classical instrument.

00:35:22.585 --> 00:35:24.960
And then also being able to
improvise, because most of us

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.560
classical musicians are
not taught to improvise.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.310
You play exactly what
you're told to play.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.268
And you play it the same
way every time, right?

00:35:31.268 --> 00:35:34.950
So it was more of a mental thing
even rather than a physical.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.570
Because once you
wrap your head around

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.270
you can do whatever
you want, you

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.895
can express yourself
through the music,

00:35:39.895 --> 00:35:42.450
and then just learning some
different scalar patterns

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:45.902
and passages that you can
use in your solos or whatnot.

00:35:45.902 --> 00:35:47.610
And then just playing
around with pedals.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.230
I actually went full
digital very, very recently.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.600
This is from Line 6.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.840
But I was like a big
collector of pedals,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.659
so like analog pedals.

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:56.700
And I used to love those.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.740
But after a while there's
some feedback issues

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.810
you know and now
with new technology.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.230
This unit right here,
it's both an amp modeler.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.440
So instead of having a giant
amplifier being carried

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.750
in here, everything
is processed through

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.080
this little pedal board.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.089
So all the effects, all this amp
sounds, everything is in there.

00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:15.505
So it's really,
really convenient.

00:36:17.862 --> 00:36:19.320
DORINA ARELLANO:
Going off of that,

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.237
is that basically your
like piece of equipment

00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:22.195
you can't live without?

00:36:22.195 --> 00:36:24.550
Or do you have something
that you really, really love

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.049
that you take
everywhere with you?

00:36:26.049 --> 00:36:27.090
TINA GUO: This is it now.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.680
Before when I did
shows, oh, my gosh,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.349
I had to hire a company because
these amps are so heavy.

00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:33.390
And of course, I like to
be melodramatic and have

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.570
lots of different amps.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.945
So they come in like with a
big truck, unload everything,

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:38.653
and then all my pedals
and this and that.

00:36:38.653 --> 00:36:40.410
And now this little
thing on the floor,

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.835
you just put it in a backpack.

00:36:41.835 --> 00:36:43.710
I don't carry it, my
fiance Rambo carries it,

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.770
but still, it's easier.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.120
It's easier-- it's
easier for him.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.300
And he likes it, too, right?

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:49.800
RAMBO: Yes.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.240
TINA GUO: OK.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.120
DORINA ARELLANO: Good answer.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.879
Next question?

00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:54.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.620
Thanks very much for coming.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.786
Your music is amazing.

00:36:56.786 --> 00:36:58.050
TINA GUO: Thank you.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.310
AUDIENCE: What you're
talking about with what

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.440
you've been doing with
the electric cello reminds

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.000
me a lot of--

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.160
have you ever heard
of Ronald Jenkees?

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.960
He's a keyboardist.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.750
I've seen some of his
videos on YouTube.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.230
But he has this one song
that's called "Guitar Sounds"

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.706
that he's using a keyboard.

00:37:14.706 --> 00:37:16.080
I actually thought
the first time

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.960
I heard it that it was just
entirely electric guitar.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.600
And I was so surprised when I
learned that it was actually

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.170
a keyboard.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.090
So it might be something
interesting for you

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.340
to look into because
he's doing something

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.620
similar except with
a keyboard that you

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.406
do with the electric cello.

00:37:30.406 --> 00:37:31.530
TINA GUO: Yeah, definitely.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's really cool.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.922
Ronald Jenkees.

00:37:32.922 --> 00:37:33.630
TINA GUO: Got it.

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.980
Thank you.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.820
DORINA ARELLANO: Maybe
you can play with him

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.670
and Rammstein one day.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.016
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:37.016 --> 00:37:37.710
That would be really cool.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.210
Concerts.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.540
TINA GUO: No.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.248
Rammstein's mine.

00:37:39.248 --> 00:37:40.026
I'm not sharing.

00:37:40.026 --> 00:37:42.151
AUDIENCE: That'd be an
amazing concert opportunity.

00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:44.410
But you don't reach out to him.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.059
So he would have to find you.

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:48.600
TINA GUO: No.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.100
I check other artists
out and stuff.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.990
But it's usually for
people that, you know--

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.950
I don't know what it is, I
just feel like energetically--

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:56.580
is that wrong?

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.330
Should I be--

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.163
I just don't want to
be one of those people,

00:37:59.163 --> 00:38:01.205
oh, work with me please,
I'll play cello for you.

00:38:01.205 --> 00:38:02.662
DORINA ARELLANO:
There's a balance.

00:38:02.662 --> 00:38:03.830
TINA GUO: There's a balance.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.340
It's more of
dangling the carrot.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.240
DORINA ARELLANO: I think
you could reach out

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.685
to Rammstein is all I'm saying.

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:08.310
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.160
But I'd be so embarrassed
and heartbroken if they said,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.640
no, thank you.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.140
Nein.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.370
DORINA ARELLANO: But
then, they're not cool.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:14.911
TINA GUO: OK.

00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:16.710
DORINA ARELLANO: So it's fine.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.049
TINA GUO: I'll give it
five more years and then--

00:38:19.049 --> 00:38:20.340
DORINA ARELLANO: Next question?

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.010
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of metal, what

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.452
are you listening to recently?

00:38:25.452 --> 00:38:27.910
TINA GUO: Not a lot of metal
recently, I have to be honest.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:31.870
So recently, I've been obsessed
with financial YouTube videos.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.540
I have them on a playlist and
I listen to them every morning

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.790
if I'm putting on makeup.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.740
But as far as like metal,
obviously Rammstein

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.020
is my big obsession obsession.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.540
And I'm into-- like when
you mentioned earlier about

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:47.290
my "Cello Metal" album-- more of
the classic, old school metal.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:51.820
Like now, honestly, I haven't
heard a lot of new, new bands

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.170
that I'm really, really into.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.137
Huh?

00:38:54.137 --> 00:38:55.665
AUDIENCE: Whitechapel.

00:38:55.665 --> 00:38:56.290
TINA GUO: Yeah.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.498
Whitechapel's cool, you know.

00:38:57.498 --> 00:38:59.800
But old school
stuff, Black Sabbath,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.580
Metallica, and whatnot, but
more industrial metal for sure.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.150
Yeah.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.358
DORINA ARELLANO: It'd be so
cool if you played with--

00:39:06.358 --> 00:39:07.480
there's these newer bands.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.396
I don't know if you were
thinking about these,

00:39:09.396 --> 00:39:11.380
but like Behemoth and Sleep.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.364
Like there's just more newer
bands that I think would love--

00:39:14.364 --> 00:39:16.030
I'm going to hook you
guys up with them.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.230
TINA GUO: OK.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.396
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:19.754
It's going to happen.

00:39:19.754 --> 00:39:20.254
Next?

00:39:23.188 --> 00:39:23.994
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:24.660
TINA GUO: Hello.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.750
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
pianist and a huge gamer.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.150
And I remember reading
on the bio intro

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.160
that you also worked
with "League of Legends."

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.720
I'm kind of curious
how that went.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.170
TINA GUO: Oh, yeah.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.295
So I play-- oh, my gosh,
I forgot what year it was.

00:39:35.295 --> 00:39:37.580
I think it was three
championships ago when it was

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.840
in LA at the Staples Center.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.343
TINA GUO: Do you remember?

00:39:40.343 --> 00:39:41.730
I think it was a few years ago.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.760
They just reached out
and said would you want

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.920
to play for the championship?

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.000
So we opened it.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.970
It was myself, Wes
Borland from Limp Bizkit,

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.970
and then the drummer
from Combichrist

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:57.080
who just left the band,
and then Crystal Method,

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.019
and an orchestra.

00:39:58.019 --> 00:39:59.060
So it was like this big--

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:03.890
like, not a mess-- so it was an
organized mess of just stuff.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.004
And, yeah, it was a lot of fun.

00:40:06.004 --> 00:40:07.920
And my brother was
really-- my little brother.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.294
He's a huge "League of Legends"
player, him and his wife.

00:40:10.294 --> 00:40:12.140
So they were
totally geeking out.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.190
And I remember they
gave us a gift bag.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.190
And there was this stuffed
animal thing from--

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.690
and then they're like,
oh, my god, can I have it?

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.100
I'm like sure you can have it.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.640
So they were happy about it.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.955
I think they were more excited
than I was to be honest.

00:40:22.955 --> 00:40:24.830
DORINA ARELLANO: You
also have a "God of War"

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.170
music video coming out, right?

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.211
TINA GUO: Actually, yeah.

00:40:27.211 --> 00:40:29.460
It came out, I
believe, last month.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.441
So, yeah, I did a
cover of "God of War."

00:40:31.441 --> 00:40:33.440
I try to play the game,
I'm not very good at it.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.310
DORINA ARELLANO: It's hard.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.970
It's good, but it's hard.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:35.630
TINA GUO: It's really hard.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:36.470
Oh, my goodness.

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.234
But yes, the video is
out on YouTube now.

00:40:38.234 --> 00:40:39.650
DORINA ARELLANO:
It's really cool.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.750
You guys check it out.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.950
TINA GUO: Thank you.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.170
DORINA ARELLANO: Time
for one more question?

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.830
TINA GUO: It smells
good in here.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:47.040
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.623
Is that curry?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.000
Is that it?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.910
Are we good?

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:52.410
OK.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:52.830
TINA GUO: Thank you, guys.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.496
DORINA ARELLANO: Well,
you guys, can you

00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:57.570
tell people where they can
find you on the Internets?

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.440
TINA GUO: Yeah, so

Instagram, Twitter, YouTube.

00:41:07.535 --> 00:41:09.410
I don't need to tell
you guys, you guys know.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:12.317
If you just Google it,
you can write to me.

00:41:12.317 --> 00:41:13.650
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh, Google her.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.317

DORINA ARELLANO: But thank
you so much for coming.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.260
That was so awesome.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.760
Thank you.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.090
