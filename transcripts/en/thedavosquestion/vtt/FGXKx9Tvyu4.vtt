00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.229
&gt;&gt; I'm Jim Wallis.
And here at Davos, many people are understanding

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.050
underneath the
economic crisis is a values crisis.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.790
We won't get to an economic recovery without
a moral recovery shaping

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.790
that, a moral compass for the new economy.
So we've been having sessions here.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.271
And in previous years, if you wanted to talk
about social conscience,

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.980
social values at Davos, you had to get up
at 7:00 a.m. and go to the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.250
fourth floor and you'd hear people like me
and Mohammed Yunus talk

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.640
about this.
But on the first day of Davos, Mohammed and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.800
I were on the main floor
taking about the need for social business

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.920
or social conscience for
purposeful economies and for a moral economy.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.410
And many people are very receptive to that
here.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.829
We've been overtaken by these new maxims,
greed is good, it's all about

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.550
me, and I want it now.
We have to replace those with some older virtues

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
like enough is enough,
we're in this together, and I love the indigenous

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
people's ethic, who
evaluate decisions today by their impact on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.390
the 7th generation out.
So we talked about the bad morality play of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.890
banks and bailouts and
bonuses.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.310
And how the massive bank bonuses in the face
of massive economic

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.760
suffering is, in my language, a sin of biblical
proportions.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.610
And how people are moving their money from
the big banks to local

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.070
banks.
And we say that if banks are too big to fail,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.659
we say make them smaller.
So people are talking about citizens' movements

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.909
now to bring values
back in this conversation.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.220
I've just written a book called, "Rediscovering
Values on Wall Street,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.299
Main Street, and Your Street."
And we had a launch to the book last night.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.680
And I've been pleased by the conversation
between business leaders,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.570
labor leaders, community organizers, religious
leaders, and lots of

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.100
lots of young people.
So it's a new conversation now.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.280
We had the discussion on Jon Stewart last
Wednesday night.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.599
I think that we're ready now for a new conversation
about values.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.840
If we don't have that, all the suffering and
pain of this recession

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.190
will have been in vain.
But we have a values conversation maybe the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.689
great recession could be
redemptive after all.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.659
I hope so.
