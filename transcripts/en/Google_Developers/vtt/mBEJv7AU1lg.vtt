00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.930
In this segment, we'll be
walking through the steps it

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.080
takes to set up Eclipse
to run the YouTube

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.300
API samples for Java.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.360
For this example, I'll be using
Eclipse 4.3, also known

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.610
as Eclipse Kepler.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.410
You'll need to already have
downloaded the YouTube API

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.290
samples from the Project page
and have unzipped the files,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.960
as well as have registered
an API key.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.790
If you're unsure about how
to do these steps, please

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.040
reference our other videos.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.460
Versions of Eclipse greater
than Eclipse 4.2, Eclipse

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.900
Juno, should have Maven
integration out of the box.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.160
If you're using an older version
of Eclipse, you'll

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.130
want to install the m2eclipse
plug-in via Eclipse's Help--

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.510
Install New Software
Mechanism.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.470
We won't be going through the
installation process for older

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.980
versions of Eclipse in this
video, but there are many

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.240
resources online that will
teach you how to do this.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.840
The way we import the samples
is through File, Import.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330
We'll want to search
for the word Maven.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.390
If we're running a version
of Eclipse that correctly

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.260
integrates to Maven, we should
see Existing Maven Projects.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.510
Click Next.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.470
If you don't see this,
either upgrade your

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.690
ID or install m2eclipse.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.935
Let's click Next.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.685
The way we import the samples
is we go to Browse.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.580
Now let's browse to the
directory of a sample.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.620
Click into it, and click Open.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.860
Eclipse will now analyze the
palm.xml file to find all

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.110
relevant name projects.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.670
When this is done, you'll see
the project appear in a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.949
projects list.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.460
You should see the name of the
project you've imported right

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.710
after palm.xml.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.420
Let's click Finish.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.100
Eclipse will go ahead and now
download the dependencies in

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.860
the background.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.600
You'd expand the progress
tab to see the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.630
libraries being download.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.280
What Maven is doing is
connected to remote

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.060
repositories, and downloading
the dependencies that are

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.800
required to run the
sample code.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
When this process is completed,
you should see all

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.020
the libraries for the sample
code under Maven Dependencies.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.760
We should now be able
to run the project.
