Thank you.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.610
Does anybody know
what bachata is?

00:04:10.893 --> 00:04:11.657
Uh huh.

00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:13.240
AUDIENCE: Oh, you
want me to tell you?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.520
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah why not.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.740
What's bachata?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.190
AUDIENCE: It's like a
Latin type of a dance.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.027
It's not salsa, but
more of a sensual dance.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:21.860
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.150
Bachata-- he said bachata
is like a Latin dance.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.965
What did you say,
is more sensual?

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.464
AUDIENCE: I think
it's more sensual.

00:04:26.464 --> 00:04:27.330
XENIA RUBINOS: OK.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.150
It could be.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.490
It's a dance style.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.560
It's from the
Dominican Republic.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.079
But it's also music.

XENIA RUBINOS: Thank you.

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:44.260
VIVIEN LEWIT: So I had--

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.792
I had this very distinct
way, I was going to order--

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:48.250
I was going to ask
you a questions,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.801
but I have to start with
something different.

00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:51.550
XENIA RUBINOS: OK.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.216
VIVIEN LEWIT: Because
you said something

00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:56.470
while you were up here, and I
think it was really profound.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.540
And I don't know that
every performer when

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.602
they get on stage gets that
overtaken by their music.

00:13:02.602 --> 00:13:04.060
And I wanted to
ask you about that,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.082
because you sing that second--

00:13:07.082 --> 00:13:08.290
XENIA RUBINOS: "Laugh Clown"?

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.456
VIVIEN LEWIT: "Laugh Clown."

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:12.400
And you said, I lose myself in
that sometimes, or something

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.070
to that effect.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.050
So when you are up on stage
like this and you're performing,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.460
and that feeling overtakes you,
what's going through your mind?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.910
How do you feel about your
music in those moments?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.430
XENIA RUBINOS: I'm not
really thinking on a--

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.000
kind of like a rational
level, and that's

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.410
really the problem mostly.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.280
VIVIEN LEWIT: Problem
or not a problem.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.100
XENIA RUBINOS: It
can be a problem.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:45.460
Yeah, I'm in like a dream state,
when I'm at my best I think,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.110
to be connected to performance.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.250
And I'm really grateful anytime
that I get to share my music

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.790
and perform it, and
for that experience of,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.330
you know, receiving energy from
people that I'm performing for

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.360
and also giving that energy out.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.340
So when I'm in that
cycle, that circle,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.990
I spin out sometimes when
I'm kind of in a dream state.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.310
Which can be a problem if
like I let my emotions kind of

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:22.220
take over, if I let my
adrenaline take over.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.740
I can do things that--

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.490
I could hurt myself or I
could like jump on people,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.490
or do all kinds of things
that I'm known to do,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.440
but then I don't remember after.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.195
You know, I'm not like present
in that rational sense,

00:14:36.195 --> 00:14:38.320
in that moment, and then
sometimes I'll see a video

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.070
and I'll be like, I
was dancing like that?

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.090
Oh my gosh.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.830
I didn't even know
I could do that.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.240
I'll be like, why
do my knees hurt.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.770
I'll look at the
video, and I'll see

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.312
that I was doing like these dead
drops-- like doing like pow!

00:14:47.312 --> 00:14:48.728
Like doing all
these crazy things.

00:14:48.728 --> 00:14:50.950
And I'm like, I don't
even remember doing that.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.620
Good thing I didn't
split my pants.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.090
But it happens.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.340
VIVIEN LEWIT: And you usually
play with a band, right?

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.131
XENIA RUBINOS: Yes.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.880
Currently, my setup
is a four piece band.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:09.490
So I am free to sing mostly,
and I play a little organs

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.320
in this current setup.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.850
But it's myself, my drummer
Marco Buccelli, and then a bass

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.524
player and guitar or keyboard.

00:15:17.524 --> 00:15:19.690
VIVIEN LEWIT: So if things
get really out of control

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.727
they can--

00:15:20.727 --> 00:15:22.310
XENIA RUBINOS: They
usually are just--

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.900
VIVIEN LEWIT: They
probably let you go.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.940
XENIA RUBINOS: They're
on the back line.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.300
They're holding it down.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.472
Yeah, they're usually just
like, what is she doing today.

00:15:28.472 --> 00:15:29.680
VIVIEN LEWIT: That's amazing.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.845
Yeah, I think we all need
to see you with the band.

00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:33.720
You know, when you're
performing in the area.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.300
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, come out.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.200
Yeah.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.140
VIVIEN LEWIT: Great.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.240
So this is a really
exciting time for you.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.600
You're on your second album.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.050
XENIA RUBINOS: Mhm.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.883
VIVIEN LEWIT: Your first
record was released

00:15:42.883 --> 00:15:44.440
in 2013, "Magic Tricks," yeah?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.350
XENIA RUBINOS: Yes.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.350
VIVIEN LEWIT: And then
this album, which I think

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.720
is so beautiful-- they're
both so beautiful,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.020
and they're sonically
so different.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.540
What is your process
when you write music?

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.680
What's your inspiration?

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.450
XENIA RUBINOS: Thank you.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.010
Well, I usually
start by improvising.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.710
So I usually start
a writing session,

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.260
first with something
that I know,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.629
whether it's a song that
I like or a song of mine,

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:12.670
or something that I know
to kind of just warm up.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.350
And then I usually
start improvising either

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.350
with just my voice,
or on an instrument--

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.494
a instrument like a
keyboard or on the bass.

00:16:24.494 --> 00:16:26.160
In this case, I wrote
a lot of the album

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.810
on bass, which I don't
know how to play.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.730
Really, I just I bought--

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.686
I went and I bought a bass,
because I was demoing the song,

00:16:33.686 --> 00:16:35.560
and I needed a bass
player to play the lines.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.300
And nobody would show up
that day, so I was like,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.924
well I guess I'm just
going to buy one.

00:16:38.924 --> 00:16:40.420
I'll return it--

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.670
I guess I shouldn't say that,
but I'll return it later

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.760
when I'm done.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.070
But I was having so much fun,
I decided to keep the bass.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.160
And so I ended up writing a
lot of this record on that,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.550
but usually it's
just improvising.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:58.360
And I try to just let
myself go for a little bit,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.570
and then I start
to hear some bit,

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.630
whether it's a rhythm that
I'm playing or I'm singing,

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.369
or it's a melody
that's happening.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:12.339
And I isolate a small bit of
that, and then I repeat it.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.869
So I repeat it to find out more
about it, through repetition.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.960
And usually when I find
out something about it,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.420
then something else
happens that changes,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.540
and that's usually how
an idea starts for me.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.410
VIVIEN LEWIT: So it
builds organically.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.660
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, through--

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.970
Yeah, through improvisation
and listening.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.511
VIVIEN LEWIT: Do
you think the fact--

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.490
because the first record was
very synth and organ sounding,

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.960
and the "Black Terry Cat" is--

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.010
there's something smoother
or more jazzy, more melodic

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:44.630
about it.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.090
Do you think any of that
had to do with the bass,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.990
with you just
pulling out that bass

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.767
and beginning to write
the record with it?

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:52.740
XENIA RUBINOS: Definitely.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.410
Writing a lot of songs
on bass, you know,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.990
influenced-- the sound of the
album is very bass centric.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.565
A lot of the melodies came from
playing on that instrument.

00:18:00.565 --> 00:18:02.023
VIVIEN LEWIT: It's
really rhythmic.

00:18:02.023 --> 00:18:04.050
XENIA RUBINOS: Mhm.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.700
The first record was kind of a
piano trio, power trio record.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.380
So it was very minimal with
bass drums and keyboards mostly,

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.620
there's not much else
in the sound palette.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.390
And in this record, I
expand that a little bit.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.917
And I did more vocal
stacks, like in my--

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:24.750
in the vocal arrangements,
I have these kind

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.730
of fat vocal stacks
of layering that I

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.050
haven't done as much before.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.695
I used to loop my
voice and use my voice

00:18:30.695 --> 00:18:32.570
as kind of like horns
and different textures.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.801
Which I'm still doing on
this record, but I expanded

00:18:34.801 --> 00:18:36.300
the sound palette
a little bit more,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.940
with more synth, some guitar.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.940
But I think ultimately
what changed on this album

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.580
for me was also the music I
was listening to at the time.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.170
So I was really into--

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.740
I was discovering a
lot of hip hop music

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.110
that I didn't know about,
some groups like Slum Village.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.930
VIVIEN LEWIT: No.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:55.530
XENIA RUBINOS: Yes.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.860
VIVIEN LEWIT: I
represented Slum Village.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.360
XENIA RUBINOS: Really?

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.335
VIVIEN LEWIT: Yes.

00:18:58.335 --> 00:18:58.830
XENIA RUBINOS: [GASP]

00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:59.380
VIVIEN LEWIT: Yes.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.300
XENIA RUBINOS: Were
they good clients?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.800
VIVIEN LEWIT: I was
a music attorney

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.860
before I joined YouTube in 2011.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.160
And in 1997, I think--

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.970
'96?

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.340
I represented this artist
named Slum Village,

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.430
and I didn't know that
anybody knew Slum Village.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.756
XENIA RUBINOS: Girl.

00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:16.200
VIVIEN LEWIT: [LAUGHING]

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.116
XENIA RUBINOS: I was--

00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:21.870
Yeah, that was some of
J Dilla's masterful work

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:22.590
at the beginning.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.714
VIVIEN LEWIT: The producer
who was Slum Village--

00:19:24.714 --> 00:19:26.630
XENIA RUBINOS: J Dilla
produced those tracks--

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.480
VIVIEN LEWIT: But there was
another artist, his name was--

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.712
Bryce was his last name.

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:32.670
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh gosh.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.440
VIVIEN LEWIT: I won't remember.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.020
XENIA RUBINOS: You caught me.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.950
You caught me on that one.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.500
VIVIEN LEWIT: Really
hilarious reference--

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.400
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh,
they're incredible.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.250
Yeah.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.280
Black Moon and J Dilla.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.324
I mean, just discovering
sampling kind

00:19:44.324 --> 00:19:45.240
of for the first time.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.656
I mean, I knew what sampling
was, but I was just kind of--

00:19:47.656 --> 00:19:51.000
I haven't really been
digging into that music.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.850
I kind of was coming
out of a period

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.900
where I was discovering
punk for the first time,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.820
and I had been listening
to jazz for a while,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.280
but I had kind of
been suppressing

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.720
some of those interests in my
music-- or not suppressing now,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.950
I was just on another tip.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.109
And this time around I was kind
of digging into this music,

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:12.900
going back listening
to Busta Rhymes, who I

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.092
listened to as a child as well.

00:20:15.092 --> 00:20:17.550
Listening to Kendrick Lamar's
album, "To Pimp a Butterfly,"

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.990
was also really
influential for me,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.823
at the time that I was
finishing this album.

00:20:20.823 --> 00:20:25.230
That album came out, and I
was thinking about lyricists,

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.900
rappers, and people who
use their voice, you know,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.280
to tell stories.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.950
And listening to
Kendrick's album,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.640
and how he sounds like 10
different people on one album.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.230
And thinking about different
ways to use your voice.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.820
So all of those things
influenced me on this album.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.360
I wanted it to be really
beat driven, really soulful

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.310
and funky, and
also kind of focus

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.667
on the vocal performances.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:49.500
VIVIEN LEWIT: Right.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.364
Right, well what you do with
your vocals is incredible.

00:20:52.364 --> 00:20:53.280
XENIA RUBINOS: Thanks.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.071
VIVIEN LEWIT: So
"Pitchfork" got it right--

00:20:55.071 --> 00:21:00.420
I pulled a quote that pitchfork
referred to your music as,

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.620
"adept at punk confrontation
as R&amp;B run-ons."

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.630
Which is very interesting
to have punk and R&amp;B

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.020
in the same sentence.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.200
And then from--
there's also outside

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.530
of the sound, the music,
there's really deep messages

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.810
in the work on this album.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.600
And the last one too, but I
wanted to focus on this one,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.810
because when you
performed "Mexican Chef."

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.230
What are you trying to convey?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.730
XENIA RUBINOS: Well, that song,
"Mexican Chef," just started

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.350
out as kind of an observation.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.850
I was walking around
running errands

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.141
in my neighborhood in Brooklyn,
and there were kitchens

00:21:35.141 --> 00:21:36.940
that we're setting
up for the night.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.699
And they had the back
door open, and you

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:41.490
could see the kitchen
staff, like you know,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.740
cleaning up, setting
things up, prepping.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.050
And they were blasting bachata,
and rancheras, and salsa.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.730
Today in the Google
cafeteria actually

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.974
they were listening to
salsa like on blast.

00:21:52.974 --> 00:21:53.890
I was like, what's up?

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.650
Who's playing all
this old school salsa?

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.024
And they were
like, Yeah, we are!

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.572
What's up?

00:21:58.572 --> 00:21:59.280
So that was cool.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.779
But so all of the kitchen staff
was listening to this music,

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.930
and then in the front
of the restaurant

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.050
the wait staff
was mostly white--

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.870
and the kitchen staff
was mostly Latino,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.721
and in the front
of the restaurant

00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:14.220
was completely different sound
palette, completely different

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.600
kind of music playing.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.290
And I just thought
it was so funny.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.310
So I started kind of
improvising on these words.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.900
I thought was writing
a short story,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.410
or like a funny rhyme to myself.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.660
I didn't think anything of it.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.576
And when I got home, I
just wrote it all down,

00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:30.300
and I thought it was just
kind of making myself laugh.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.890
It was a joke, you
know, but then it

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.220
ended up becoming that
song "Mexican Chef."

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.960
So people are responding to--
have responded to it a lot,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.090
in terms of saying that it's
very political and very social.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.890
Which I guess it is very social,
but I didn't intend for that.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.954
I didn't set out to
write a song like that.

00:22:49.954 --> 00:22:52.120
I was kind of just having
fun, and observing things.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.760
But my mom used to
say when I was a kid,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.040
I always remember her
saying this one thing,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.530
that the hands of brown women
welcome you into the world

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.150
and clean you.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.399
And you're an infant, and
welcome you in the hospital.

00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:10.000
And they're the same ones that
kind of take you out of this--

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.450
not take you out, but take care
of you when you're on your way

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.430
out.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.700
They are the same ones
who take care of you

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.033
when you're on your way out,
in nursing homes and stuff.

00:23:18.033 --> 00:23:19.420
My mom worked in a nursing home.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.550
She's a registered nurse.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:26.480
One of her first big
jobs in this country.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.260
So yeah, she talks about
the labor of brown people.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.760
So that's kind of
what I'm referring

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.510
to in the song is a kind of
somewhat invisible workforce

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.250
that, you know, makes
our cities function.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.860
Especially in a
city like New York,

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.070
but all of these big
metropolitan cities

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.740
where we have all of
these incredible services.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.010
You can have your laundry--

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.200
you can have your
clean underwear

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.950
delivered to your
doorstep if you want to.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.030
It's absurd, but you
know that's the luxuries

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.110
that we live in these cities.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.650
And a lot of the
times, the people

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.890
who actually make those services
function are people of color.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.080
So it's kind of a shout
out to that workforce.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.690
VIVIEN LEWIT: That's great.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.690
I've had the experience.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.650
I've been in the nursing
home with my parents

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.626
and had that experience
that you're referring to.

00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:19.000
And I've had the experience
of birthing, my own children,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.839
and having exactly
the same experience

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:21.880
that you're referring to.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.608
And both were beautiful.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.330
So when you think about
your processing your music

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.550
and the meaning,
you know, there's--

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:37.340
I think that, as an artist,
you have your own perception

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.030
of your music, and then you have
all these external accolades

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.720
and critiques of your music.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.860
Are they the same for you?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.290
Do you feel about
your music the way

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.750
that you read people
writing about it,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.782
and the way you hear or see
people responding to you?

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:56.240
XENIA RUBINOS: Well, it's like
when you look in the mirror.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.920
The eyes that you
see yourself with

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.620
are totally different
than the eyes

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.990
that others see you with,
that a lover sees you,

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:05.420
or a stranger sees
you, you know.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.580
So no, it's not
the same, you know.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.860
You know, sometimes
there are synergies.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.051
Sometimes when I'm
performing I might be--

00:25:16.051 --> 00:25:18.050
that day I might have
been working on something,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.000
and channeling something where
I might have been listening

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.460
to like an Erykah Badu
song or something before I

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.360
come on stage.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.750
And then after the show
someone will be like,

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:26.230
oh you remind me of Erykah Badu.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.920
And I was like,
whoa, that's weird.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.336
And I'm like
channeling, you know.

00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:34.790
Like just because in that
day I think that I was maybe

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.200
channeling that
or projecting that

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.870
through our transfer of energy,
like somebody received that.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.499
So I think that kind of
stuff happens sometimes,

00:25:44.499 --> 00:25:46.040
where someone will
perceive something

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.380
that is a new thought for
me that I'm working on,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.700
and in that way we'll agree.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.950
But a lot of times I'm
surprised, you know.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.240
And it's fun.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.730
It's fun to see how people,
you know, perceive your work.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.780
Sometimes more than
others, you know.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.490
But cause--

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.600
VIVIEN LEWIT: How do you want
the music to make people feel?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.080
XENIA RUBINOS: Well, I would
like people to feel joy,

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:19.660
and to feel enraptured
by my music; to feel

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.650
inspired to listen to
music or to make something

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.720
when listening to my music.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.730
VIVIEN LEWIT: Do you do
any other form of art?

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.740
Do you write?

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.670
Do you paint?

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.837
Is there any other kind of--

00:26:31.837 --> 00:26:33.336
XENIA RUBINOS: I
wish I could paint.

00:26:33.336 --> 00:26:34.177
I can't even draw--

00:26:34.177 --> 00:26:36.010
I can't even draw like
a square or a circle.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.810
It's really sad.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.730
But I do enjoy writing.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.520
I've just been in a fight with
words for like a decade now.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.150
So I'm working.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.080
Something I'm working
on-- something

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.621
I was working on
this album, I wanted

00:26:45.621 --> 00:26:49.180
to work on my lyric
writing a little bit,

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.580
because I felt like that my
first album I relied a lot

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.090
on kind of figurative language.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.590
And a lot of my lyrics were
super open to interpretation,

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.500
which they always are,
but I was wondering

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.750
what it would be like to
approach lyric writing

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.370
in a more literal sense.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.100
And I guess one of
my big fears is--

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.160
two big fears is talking
about things I don't know

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.040
and just adding to
the noise of people

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.580
just talking about things
they don't know about,

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.800
and the second was about
being corny or cheesy.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.707
Like being so literal
that it's corny.

00:27:21.707 --> 00:27:22.540
VIVIEN LEWIT: Right.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.800
XENIA RUBINOS: So now,
I just went for it,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.890
and I was, you
know, was literal.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.650
But writing is something
I'm really curious

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.422
about, and interested in.

00:27:31.422 --> 00:27:33.880
VIVIEN LEWIT: Right, there are
some artists and songwriters

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.390
that actually put
down the lyrics first,

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.737
and they create music to
it, right, or vice versa.

00:27:39.737 --> 00:27:40.570
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.685
Yeah, in my case, I've always
done it the other way around.

00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:46.540
The sounds, the melodies,
and rhythms come first,

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.710
and the lyrics have
always been last.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.300
But on this record, I was I
was like, no girl, you go in,

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.220
and you write the words down.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.053
What does that mean?

00:27:53.053 --> 00:27:55.220
So I was trying to
be more specific.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.279
And you know, it was tough.

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.320
The only way I convinced
myself a couple of times

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.280
just being like,
don't worry, you're

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.696
going to throw it
away afterwards.

00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:03.160
Like no one will ever see this.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.300
So I just had to--

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.602
it can be petrifying
just to be that specific.

00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:10.060
And now, you know, we're just
always throwing out words all

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.490
the time to each other, you
know on Twitter or whatever.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.531
We're just always like,
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:16.420
Everything is--
everyone is so entitled

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.510
to say whatever they want all
the time, and write it down,

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.930
you know, and maybe not
always think about it before.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.600
VIVIEN LEWIT: Do you
use social media,

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:30.670
in like promoting your
shows, or things like that?

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.480
Your music.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.250
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah I do.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.170
It's complicated.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.317
Yeah, we have a
complicated relationship.

00:28:36.317 --> 00:28:37.150
We're working on it.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:37.750
It's a work in progress.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.080
VIVIEN LEWIT: I don't
think you're only

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.720
artist that has a complicated
relationship with social media.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.370
You know, one is--

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.750
and you probably feel this
also, is there's so many

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.170
different places to go
to reach your fans today.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:52.570
And you know, I hear
sometimes from artists,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.320
well I'm on YouTube, and I'm on
Twitter, and I have Facebook,

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.100
and I have Instagram, and I have
Snapchat, and I have WhatsApp.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.720
You know, it's like the
litany of different outlets,

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.070
and where should I go first.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.403
And where should I reach my fan.

00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:09.355
And I think it's kind of
difficult when, you know.

00:29:09.355 --> 00:29:11.090
And I think some
artists will just

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.559
select one place to really
focus on, and build a fan base.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:16.100
I don't know.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.520
How do you address that?

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.130
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, I
just have fun, you know.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.930
I think ultimately
people can tell

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.630
when you're not about
something, just in general.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.330
Like if you're playing a song
that you don't believe in,

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.030
or that you don't like what
you're doing, people can tell.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.682
So I think, you know,
audiences are smart,

00:29:33.682 --> 00:29:36.140
and people are smart, smarter
than we give them credit for.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.950
So I think like trying to
be genuine in all of those

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.660
things-- so you know, I might--

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.940
I tried Snapchat, but it
just makes me feel old.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.398
I don't understand
what's going on.

00:29:44.398 --> 00:29:45.340
I can't ever find--

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.850
like trying to respond,
trying to do the thing,

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.340
but I can't figure it out.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.390
But yeah, I just try to have
fun, and figure out my way

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.711
and not force things, you know.

00:29:57.711 --> 00:29:59.710
VIVIEN LEWIT: What's your
favorite song to play?

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.480
XENIA RUBINOS: Oomph.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.110
"See Them," which is a
jam I didn't play today.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.050
That's kind of like a b-side
jam from "Black Terry Cat."

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:13.060
And it's kind of a choose
your own adventure song,

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.470
except I chose it for you.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:16.200
[LAUGHING]

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.530
But it kind of is-- kind of has
some similarities to a through

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.650
composed piece, which is
a piece that would have--

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.620
if your sections are lettered,
it would just be ABCDEFG,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.704
and it would never repeat.

00:30:27.704 --> 00:30:29.744
It would just go from one
direction to the other.

00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:31.450
So I kind of set out
in this structure

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:32.920
of writing this thing
that would never repeat,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.910
but then that didn't happen.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.680
I ended up repeating
a couple of sections,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.109
but it still has it's kind
of longer development in all

00:30:39.109 --> 00:30:40.150
these different sections.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.370
And I have so much
fun playing that,

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.197
like too much fun
playing that song live.

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:46.780
I need the help of
my band to play it,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.237
because there's so
many layers going on.

00:30:51.237 --> 00:30:53.070
Otherwise, I would just
be pressing a button

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.090
and singing to tracks.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.340
But I love playing
that song live,

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.520
and seeing how people are
connecting with it physically,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.202
it's cool too.

00:31:01.202 --> 00:31:03.160
VIVIEN LEWIT: When are
you playing in the area?

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.540
XENIA RUBINOS: I just
played in the area.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.600
You just missed me.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.299
Yeah, I just had my homecoming
show a couple-- like a week ago

00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:10.840
or something.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.489
I just finished my first
ever headline national tour.

00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:15.780
VIVIEN LEWIT: That's fantastic.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.420
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, thanks.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.370
VIVIEN LEWIT: Where did
you-- where do you go?

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.661
XENIA RUBINOS: All over the US.

00:31:19.661 --> 00:31:21.180
I went to Canada.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.420
I drove from coast to coast.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.320
Went to the South.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.860
VIVIEN LEWIT: Amazing.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.520
XENIA RUBINOS:
Went to the middle.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.390
I went to the West.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.098
Went to the East.

00:31:26.098 --> 00:31:27.310
Went to the North--

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.846
VIVIEN LEWIT: I watched
your tiny desk performance.

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:31.720
You must have done that
in the middle there--

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.830
XENIA RUBINOS: I did
that, I think this summer.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.730
They tape them in advance.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:36.864
Yeah, that was fun.

00:31:36.864 --> 00:31:38.530
VIVIEN LEWIT: Those
must be so much fun.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.100
XENIA RUBINOS: I
was really nervous.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.600
VIVIEN LEWIT: Have you guys
seen NPR tiny desk performances?

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.430
I love them.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.846
XENIA RUBINOS: I
was very nervous.

00:31:43.846 --> 00:31:45.200
But we got we got through it.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.180
VIVIEN LEWIT: It's
probably a little nerve

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.350
wracking in that space.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.255
XENIA RUBINOS: It is,
and also, you know,

00:31:50.255 --> 00:31:52.960
it's a lot of heavy
music cats in there,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.340
you know, that have played
there and that work there.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.260
So it was like, whoa, you
know, but we got through it.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.667
Yeah.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.500
VIVIEN LEWIT: Speaking
of heavy music cats--

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.790
I wouldn't have asked you this
question, but you said that.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.800
Who would be the one
person, the one musician,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.860
that you haven't met yet
that would be most inspiring,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.400
and, you know, cause
you to write more and--

00:32:16.379 --> 00:32:18.420
XENIA RUBINOS: Should've
told me that one before.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.250
VIVIEN LEWIT: I know.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.291
You could think about it
while I'm going to ask--

00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:26.276
to really ask if anyone in the
room has any questions or--

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:27.650
anything more
you'd like to hear,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.024
that you'd like
to share with us?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.000
So when I was first listening
through "Black Terry

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.480
Cat" I was thinking, OK this
is a little more political.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.430
But the thing that kind of
turned me around on that

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.570
was the song "Laugh Clown,"
which you just performed.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:02.040
So in the first line, you
talk about how, you know,

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.984
you're letting your
eyebrows grow back and--

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.400
XENIA RUBINOS: My mustache.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.960
AUDIENCE: Your
mustache as well, yes.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.530
And that kind of spun
me around, because--

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.350
I found that
political, but then I

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.310
questioned why I found it
political, because in effect

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:28.150
like, as a default
state, your body

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.660
is a statement to
the rest of society.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.200
And-- and that's really--

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.860
I think that also applies to
some of your other statements,

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.150
like in "Mexican Chef,"
that, you know, this

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:52.080
isn't necessarily you
going out to be political,

00:33:52.080 --> 00:34:00.900
but I see that in this society
your body is political.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.451
So could you comment
to that at all?

00:34:03.451 --> 00:34:04.326
XENIA RUBINOS: Oomph.

00:34:06.891 --> 00:34:07.390
Yeah.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:10.320
Well, it is interesting.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.330
Thanks for the great
question, by the way.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:24.429
I think that by virtue
of just being who I am,

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:29.489
looking how I look and where I
come from, and being a woman--

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:33.210
a lot of just observing,
and just saying what I see

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.080
or what I've lived, is
political, you know.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.570
It's just as simple as that.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:40.489
But it may not be
of someone else.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.385
You know, maybe if you were
to say something that you saw,

00:34:43.385 --> 00:34:45.010
or something that
you lived, it may not

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.409
be perceived as
political, but just

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.199
by virtue of me telling you
my experience it's political.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:54.489
Maybe because there
are less people who

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.900
look like me in certain
contexts and situations that

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.580
are expressing, you know, their
lived experiences and things

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.990
that they see.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.630
So, you know, that's one thing.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.850
And I think that this album,
this work, is really personal.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:16.660
The song "Laugh Clown,"
at the beginning,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.480
I'm really talking more
about like personal hygiene

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.150
and the passage of time,
and how I'm-- you know,

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:30.500
I was also working through
depression and grief, and--

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:36.260
and kind of having that
beginning for me personally

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.390
is about I'm just--

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.960
I'm over it.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.810
Like I'm not even caring, like
when like I'm looking at myself

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.830
I'm like, whoa.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.716
I didn't pluck my
eyebrows for a month.

00:35:44.716 --> 00:35:45.590
Like what's going on?

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.730
What's the deal?

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.520
But it's more about just
being in that kind of state.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.300
But I do but I am also in this
album talking about brown girls

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.690
and people of color--

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.110
brown boys too.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:03.940
And, you know, talking
about body issues.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.730
I have a song called
"I Won't Say,"

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.880
where I quote a piece
from one of my heroes.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.800
Maybe that's who I would like to
meet, Abbey Lincoln, vocalist.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.900
She was a contemporary
of Billie Holiday,

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.290
but she's a little
bit less well-known.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:25.900
And Abbey's work and voice
is so rich and so beautiful,

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.880
and has a lot to say
a lot of commentary

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.670
about things that
she's lived and seen.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.527
And she wrote an essay
that was published in-- it

00:36:33.527 --> 00:36:35.110
was called "Negro
Digest" at the time.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.880
I think it might be "Ebony" now.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.210
And it's called "Who Will
Revere the Black Woman."

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:44.170
And it was talking
about how in our society

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.290
the black woman is kind of
disposable and thrown away

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:51.400
and not championed, and her nose
is too wide, and her, you know,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.340
her feet are too flat, and
her face was too black,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.550
and all this kind of thing.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.630
So in this-- and I cite some of
that in my song, "I Won't Say."

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.590
And I'm dealing with some
of these body image issues

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.490
that are universal, you know,
regardless of your ethnicity.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.630
You know, of feeling
like you don't fit in.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.510
You know, just like kind
of universal things.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.700
But so ultimately, this work
is very personal for me,

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.060
even more so than political,
but it's the other--

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.560
it's the others who
do the othering.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.320
It's the others who say
that I'm being political,

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:29.227
but I'm just sharing
my personal experience.

00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:31.060
I don't know if that
answered your question,

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.487
but a couple of
thoughts on that.

00:37:32.487 --> 00:37:33.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.611
XENIA RUBINOS: Yeah, thank you.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.440
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.660
First I just wanted to say
this is kind of weird for me,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.480
because earlier this week I
found out you were coming,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.440
and I was just like, oh shit!

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.120
And I got here really
early, because I

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.870
was like this place
is going to be packed.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.150
I can't believe
she's coming here.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.566
And now I'm just
like, apparently,

00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:02.970
I have to tell everyone to
listen to you, because they

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.430
haven't already.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.540
But I was wondering two things.

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.570
First, have you always
lived in Brooklyn?

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:16.770
Or I guess just wondering
about where you grew up,

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.449
and how that like
influenced you.

00:38:19.449 --> 00:38:20.490
XENIA RUBINOS: Thank you.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.920
AUDIENCE: Also wondering your--

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.460
just more of your musical
influences, I think.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.180
I don't know if you listen
to it, but I kind of--

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.250
I'm reminded of like
early Regina Spektor

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.749
sometimes with your like vocal--

00:38:35.749 --> 00:38:36.790
VIVIEN LEWIT: I see that.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.760
AUDIENCE: It's
like, I don't know--

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.250
it's nice.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.010
XENIA RUBINOS: Cool, thank you.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:45.630
Yeah, tell everybody
listen to me.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:48.770
AUDIENCE: Just not
Googlers, I guess.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:49.561
XENIA RUBINOS: Aha.

00:38:51.837 --> 00:38:52.420
It's all good.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:52.990
It's all G.

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.980
VIVIEN LEWIT: We're
going to spread the word.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.855
XENIA RUBINOS: Happy.

00:38:54.855 --> 00:38:56.570
Happy to be here.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.480
I am not from
Brooklyn originally.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.422
I've lived here in New
York City for 10 years.

00:39:02.422 --> 00:39:04.630
So I guess that's a cut off
that makes you a real New

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.110
Yorker, right, like 10?

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:06.610
I heard.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.661
I don't know, whatever.

00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:08.160
But--

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.379
VIVIEN LEWIT: I give it two.

00:39:09.379 --> 00:39:10.170
XENIA RUBINOS: Two?

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.295
VIVIEN LEWIT: I don't know.

00:39:11.295 --> 00:39:12.849
Like New York's a
really hard place.

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:14.765
Like if you can make it
two years in New York,

00:39:14.765 --> 00:39:16.840
you're safe to call
yourself a New Yorker.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.590
XENIA RUBINOS: OK.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.730
VIVIEN LEWIT: I've been
living here for 20.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.250
XENIA RUBINOS: Well, so you
are definitely the real deal.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.021
VIVIEN LEWIT: 22.

00:39:22.021 --> 00:39:24.020
XENIA RUBINOS: So you've
got me beat times two--

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.970
two and a bit.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:25.924
Well I'm--

00:39:25.924 --> 00:39:27.090
VIVIEN LEWIT: Oh my god, 24.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.480
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh my!

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.490
Time flies when
you're living life.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.620
Yeah, so I was born in
Hartford, Connecticut.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.450
So it's just two hours
north of here, smack

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.590
dab in the middle of
the state Connecticut.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.860
And I've lived my
whole life here

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:50.920
in the Northeast of the states,
and I guess the majority

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.970
of my life in Hartford.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:59.500
And that is a very
oppressed city financially

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.030
and culturally, which
is ironic because it's

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.340
like one of the richest
states in the country,

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:11.579
but there is a lot of poverty.

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:13.120
There's a lot of
cultural oppression.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.452
There's not much
going on arts wise,

00:40:17.452 --> 00:40:19.660
although you know folks are
always constantly working

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.180
to change that.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.140
But a very racially
segregated city.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.520
Very large Hispanic
community that lives there.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.090
My mom is from Puerto Rico,
and my father was from Cuba.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.660
And they met in
Hartford of all places.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.690
I'm like, really?

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.690
I could have grown up on a
beautiful Caribbean island.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.720
But so that's where they
met, and in the 70s,

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.260
there was an effort
to recruit laborers

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.530
for the industries in Hartford.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.790
There was a Colt--

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.990
huge Colt weapons
manufacturing companies--

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.810
huge industries in
Hartford, and they

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.710
needed people to come and work,
probably on the cheap side,

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.530
in these factories.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.610
So they actually went to
Puerto Rico to recruit workers,

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.990
and offered them housing.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.795
And I think--

00:41:14.795 --> 00:41:17.420
I have to do more research, and
I'm very curious on this topic,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.920
and I hope to be
able to do it soon.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.540
But I think that was how the
ghettos were built in Hartford.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.600
And I always wondered like how
did all these Puerto Ricans end

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.990
up here in this cold place,
this cold unfriendly kind

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.892
of climate.

00:41:30.892 --> 00:41:32.350
My mom was always
like, oh you know

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.807
it's like somebody's
cousin said it was there

00:41:34.807 --> 00:41:36.140
was work there, somebody's aunt.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.848
It's always like
somebody's family member

00:41:37.848 --> 00:41:41.000
told them to go for work.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.277
But I've recently
read that, about kind

00:41:43.277 --> 00:41:45.610
of like this recruitment
effort in the '70s, which makes

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.940
sense of why so many Latinos.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.910
But that's where I grew up.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.560
And I couldn't wait
to leave, you know.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.920
And I spent a lot of my teenage
years, I guess as many of us

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.390
do, like wanting to get
away from where I was.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.339
My family was great and very
supportive, and very loving.

00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:06.130
I came from a very
loving, supportive home.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.940
Not musicians, no
one in my family

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.230
is a musician, but music lovers.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.010
They love to dance
they play music

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:18.160
at all the family functions,
as many Caribbean folks do.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.140
So I grew up dancing to salsa.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.660
I grew up listening
to classical music.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.500
My father who was the Cuban--

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.500
my Cuban side, he grew up
listening to the radio.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.740
Classical music, he discovered
on the radio in Havana,

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.100
and he had a lifelong
love of classical music.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.360
And for him, modern music was
like Stravinsky or something.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.447
So he wasn't sure like
what I'm trying to do.

00:42:43.447 --> 00:42:46.030
VIVIEN LEWIT: How old were you
when you started playing music?

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.910
XENIA RUBINOS: Well he--

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.410
took me to like a toy store,
and there was a piano in there,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:51.618
I guess when I was like four.

00:42:51.618 --> 00:42:53.440
And I supposedly sat
down on the piano,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.037
and really couldn't
stop playing.

00:42:55.037 --> 00:42:57.370
I don't know if it was me who
did that or if it was him,

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.010
because he had always
wanted to be a pianist.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.980
But in that time it
wasn't acceptable for men

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.590
in that community to be
artists, because it would imply

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.540
that something about
their sexuality,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:12.330
or it just wasn't an
acceptable career choice.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.530
VIVIEN LEWIT: In Cuba?

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.280
XENIA RUBINOS: In his community.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.112
I don't know if that's
true for all of--

00:43:17.112 --> 00:43:19.320
VIVIEN LEWIT: When he was
in Cuba, but not after he--

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.700
XENIA RUBINOS: No, no.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.408
Yeah, as a child, when
he was growing up.

00:43:21.408 --> 00:43:23.950
Maybe it was something
in his household.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.140
His dad was not a
classical music fan.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.030
He would say that's
music for dead people.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.450
Like, don't play that
when I'm here or whatever.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.722
So anyway, my dad says
that I couldn't, you know,

00:43:33.722 --> 00:43:34.680
stop playing the piano.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.540
So he got me the piano,
and I couldn't wait.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.956
He was like, oh she's going
to be a pianist, or like she's

00:43:38.956 --> 00:43:40.980
going to be an opera singer.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.380
But then I was like, I really
like Mariah Carey actually.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.786
I just want to--

00:43:45.786 --> 00:43:46.660
I just want to like--

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.910
[SINGING] I just want to
do my Carey songs all day,

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:49.540
and he didn't.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.110
He was like,
[SPANISH ACCENT] if you

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.651
want to be like
Mariah Carey you need

00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:55.120
to learn how to read music.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120
I was like, really?

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.620
You sure?

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.170
Can I just not--

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:03.280
So he encouraged me to
choose another instrument,

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.100
aside from voice, to learn
also how to read music.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:11.980
And so I started lessons, and
he like met people at my school.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.480
He was always into
something, trying

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.240
to encourage me to be musical.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.610
And met somebody
at the school who

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.370
was able to fund a scholarship
for me to study privately,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.990
and that's how I learned
how to read music.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.320
Yeah.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.440
And some of my musical
influences, I mean,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.610
I grew up listening
to classical music.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.270
Ravel is one of my favorites.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.240
His beautiful piano sonatas.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.400
And hip hop I talked
about earlier, J Dilla.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.260
It was important for
me to discover Bjork

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:48.370
when I was in my 20s, which I
when I first heard her album

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.857
"Post" I was like, what is--

00:44:49.857 --> 00:44:51.190
I don't understand what this is.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.660
I hadn't ever listened
to electronic music.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.910
I didn't know what that meant.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.284
I didn't know what
she was doing.

00:44:55.284 --> 00:44:57.670
It took me like a good year
to really kind of come back

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.430
and realize the
depth of, you know,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.160
her compositions
and her sound world.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.870
And that was really
inspiring to me too.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.619
Another question?

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:08.160
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:08.910
XENIA RUBINOS: Hi.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.260
AUDIENCE: So music is probably
one of the main reasons

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.040
I ended up moving to New York.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.010
And I especially like
listening to bootlegs

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:18.550
from places like Arlene's
Grocery and places like that.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.590
Or Jeff Buckley
playing at Sin-e.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.510
But a lot of those
places are gone,

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.530
or they still exist but they're
in a different location.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.990
And I'm kind of curious what
your favorite places are

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.650
to play around the city, or
to see new music that you

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.870
are discovering?

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.920
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh yeah,
that's a great question.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.670
There's a newish
venue in Brooklyn,

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:46.350
called Come On Everybody,
that has a really great

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.280
curatorial program.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:52.490
A lot of diverse
groups playing there.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.420
It's not one-- it's not
specific to one style or one

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:57.819
social scene.

00:45:57.819 --> 00:46:00.110
It feels like there's a lot
of different kinds of music

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.280
coming through there.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.680
And it's a new space and
a very welcoming space--

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.990
feels like a safe space
for people to gather.

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:10.790
So I really like going there.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:13.400
It's one of my favorite venues
to just kind of hang out

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.370
at and check out music.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:19.640
Trans-Pecos, in Ridgewood,
is also a really great venue.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.510
That's run by Todd P,
kind of a famous promoter

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:28.880
who kind of came up during
punk shows and DIY shows.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.160
He runs Trans-Pecos, and
also the Market Hotel

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.170
that just recently
reopened also in Brooklyn.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.250
So there are a lot of great
venues to check out music--

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:42.230
check out music.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.180
I guess one of my
favorite spaces

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.930
that I've ever played in New
York, that I love the sound of,

00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:49.370
is Bowery Ballroom.

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:51.620
I mean, that room sounds
incredible, and the house

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:52.440
engineer--

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:52.790
VIVIEN LEWIT: Agree.

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.914
XENIA RUBINOS: is a legend.

00:46:53.914 --> 00:46:58.030
Like you know, such a
pleasure to work there,

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:02.102
and I love that, the
sound of that room a lot.

00:47:02.102 --> 00:47:02.810
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:03.550
XENIA RUBINOS: Sure.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.716
VIVIEN LEWIT: But that is
actually a great question,

00:47:05.716 --> 00:47:11.390
because I was going to Sin-e
and Arlene's, and Brownie's.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.990
You know, it was like there was
a scene in the East Village,

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.970
and then it moves
further down to Ludlow.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.430
And then Arlene's
opened, and Sin-e closed.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.400
And everything just kind
of kept moving south.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.900
And then it moved into Brooklyn.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.000
In the 10 years that
you've been here,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.240
have you seen a radical shift?

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:31.040
I mean, I spent some time in
LA, I spent time in Nashville,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.010
and there's been a
little bit of an exodus,

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:37.832
it feels, for musicians
and artists from this area.

00:47:37.832 --> 00:47:38.790
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh yeah.

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:39.650
VIVIEN LEWIT: Do you sense that?

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:40.858
XENIA RUBINOS: Oh absolutely.

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:41.630
Yeah, definitely.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.470
I mean, when I moved
here 10 years ago,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.987
you know, the
Williamsburg of today

00:47:46.987 --> 00:47:49.070
had nothing to do with the
Williamsburg of even 10

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.170
years ago, and I don't even know
about before that, who knows.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.770
But yeah, I used to hang
out a lot in Williamsburg.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:59.130
I had some my first shows
there, at this place

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.220
that was called
Galapagos, that used

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.840
to be on North 6th
Street right next

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.150
to what is now Music
Hall of Williamsburg.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:10.097
Then they moved to
Dumbo, and then there's

00:48:10.097 --> 00:48:11.930
a big article of them
like moving to Detroit

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.690
and buying a fabulous
building in Detroit

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.039
for like $5 or something.

00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:18.080
So there's all of that--
yeah, that kind of stuff

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.340
going down for sure
in the last 10 years.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.670
And lots of great venues--

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:26.060
Glass Lands on North, you know--

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.522
oh geez-- on Kent, Kent
Avenue, that whole scene

00:48:28.522 --> 00:48:29.480
there with Glass Lands.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.460
There's another place,
called Monkey Town,

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.260
that was my hang out.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.400
That place was wild.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.579
It was like this cube
room, really small.

00:48:36.579 --> 00:48:38.870
You could probably fill like
30 people in there, maybe.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:40.880
Or maybe it was
100, I don't know.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.594
But it was all
these video walls,

00:48:42.594 --> 00:48:44.510
you know, that you were
surrounded by and then

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.087
these couches, and the artists
would play in the middle.

00:48:47.087 --> 00:48:48.170
And they would have like--

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.140
kind of this like
video music sets,

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.530
like veejay sets, and
mostly experimental stuff,

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.311
like late night vibes.

00:48:56.311 --> 00:48:57.560
But it was such a great space.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.190
And so many great venues
that have moved on

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.340
and don't exist anymore, but
there are new places to play.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.680
But of course, a lot
of recording studios

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.940
also have shut down
and moved away.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.530
You know, it's an
expensive city.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.177
It ain't cheap.

00:49:13.177 --> 00:49:15.510
We get all those services we
were talking about earlier,

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.270
you know, it's not
cheap to live here.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:21.980
So that's not conducive
to folks who are maybe

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:24.680
trying something new, and
starting new adventures

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.790
or new businesses.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:29.120
It can be a little
challenging, certainly when

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.920
real estate is pricey when
your rent is too damn high.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.590
I don't know if you can
say it on here, but--

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.865
You know, that that's
the vibe for sure.

00:49:38.865 --> 00:49:39.740
But there are still--

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.580
I love New York City.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.620
I love living here.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.740
I've met incredible people.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.910
And I meet new people working
on really exciting ideas a lot,

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.340
and that's what keeps me here.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.090
VIVIEN LEWIT: That's great.

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.840
Well, thank you so
much for being with us.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.500
XENIA RUBINOS: Thank you.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.090
VIVIEN LEWIT: Fantastic.

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.590
XENIA RUBINOS:
Thanks for having me.

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.480
[APPLAUSE]
