00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.860
In examples in previous lessons we have introduced to you

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.470
various ways of building models.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.820
We investigated applicability and merits of the various models and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.210
went through some of the steps of questioning and validation.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.350
Iterating between these steps towards building the models.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.160
In this lesson, we will take a deeper dive into the model validation process.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.830
Before getting into this, let us think of a situation where we

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.620
want to teach a six year old how to multiply two numbers.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.240
To do so, we show her how to multiply by using many pairs of numbers.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.520
Let's say we use 100 pairs of numbers.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.210
After a while we are convinced that she can multiply two numbers and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.920
want to test her skill.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.090
Now if we test her multiplication skills on the same numbers that we gave her

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.930
to learn multiplication with there is always the possibility that she

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.880
did not figure out the underlying algorithms or

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.320
patterns for multiplying, but has simply memorized all the values.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.470
A good test will be to ask her to multiply numbers she has not seen before.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.310
We want to test how well she learned by giving her

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.260
data which she has never seen before.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.990
A similar approach is required in testing models.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.550
How well the model learns needs to be verified on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.070
data that the model has not seen before.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.740
It is like giving the model an exam or a test.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.500
And the test scores give us a way of estimating how well the model will fare.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.910
Much like we test children's ability to use the knowledge they learn in school

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.410
through tests and use the test scores to evaluate and rank their abilities.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.750
So now that we know that we will need some data to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.960
test our models we can either go and collect more data to test them.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.400
Or simply set aside a part of the data that we have already collected for

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.480
the purpose of testing.
