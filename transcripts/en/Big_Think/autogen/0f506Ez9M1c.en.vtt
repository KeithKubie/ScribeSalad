Jobs such a genius was that he had this
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.619 align:start position:0%
Jobs such a genius was that he had this

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 align:start position:0%
belief in the power of simplicity and he
 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.750 align:start position:0%
belief in the power of simplicity and he
wanted<00:00:57.629><c> to</c><00:00:57.750><c> ensure</c><00:00:58.260><c> that</c><00:00:58.290><c> his</c><00:00:58.799><c> products</c>

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that his products
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that his products
embodied<00:01:00.510><c> that</c><00:01:00.540><c> and</c><00:01:01.500><c> the</c><00:01:02.460><c> way</c><00:01:02.610><c> the</c><00:01:02.820><c> company</c>

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 align:start position:0%
embodied that and the way the company
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
embodied that and the way the company
communicated<00:01:03.930><c> with</c><00:01:04.110><c> people</c><00:01:04.140><c> embodied</c><00:01:05.070><c> that</c>

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 align:start position:0%
communicated with people embodied that
 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.950 align:start position:0%
communicated with people embodied that
so<00:01:06.330><c> I</c><00:01:06.360><c> think</c><00:01:07.159><c> simplicity</c><00:01:08.159><c> is</c><00:01:08.250><c> this</c><00:01:08.750><c> thing</c><00:01:09.750><c> it's</c>

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
so I think simplicity is this thing it's
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 align:start position:0%
so I think simplicity is this thing it's
a<00:01:10.049><c> concept</c><00:01:10.590><c> really</c><00:01:10.950><c> that</c><00:01:11.130><c> gets</c><00:01:11.340><c> applied</c><00:01:11.790><c> to</c><00:01:12.330><c> so</c>

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
a concept really that gets applied to so
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.370 align:start position:0%
a concept really that gets applied to so
many<00:01:12.690><c> different</c><00:01:13.230><c> things</c><00:01:13.500><c> it's</c><00:01:14.460><c> not</c><00:01:14.670><c> just</c><00:01:14.730><c> oh</c>

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 align:start position:0%

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
look it's a simple product it's it's the
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.890 align:start position:0%
look it's a simple product it's it's the
