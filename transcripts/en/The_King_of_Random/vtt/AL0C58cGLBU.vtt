CHICKEN, Hey, what's up guys in my last video(?)

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.200
I spent the entire video pouring about four pounds of [silicone] over top of a fresh cooked chicken. A lot of you wondered

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.010
Why now, it's been about 48 hours later and the silicone has fully cured.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.069
So why don't we cut it open and see just what happened to the chicken inside?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.660
Now the coolest thing about a two-part silicone kit is both parts start out as liquid,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.510
But when you mix the [two] parts together it begins a chain reaction that cures the two materials into a silicone rubber

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.330
Silicone is a very cool material. when it sets,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.479
It doesn't stick to anything, so by encapsulating my chicken with silicone rather than wasting it I immortalized it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.480
Let me show you what I mean.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.300
Now honestly. I'm really curious to see exactly what happened to the chicken inside,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.660
And I am a little bit concerned because one thing I didn't expect was the chicken was less dense than the silicone itself. There was

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.989
Actually one part near the edge where the chicken started floating up in [the] silicone

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.468
Which made me realize I probably should have waited it down with a rock or something heavy

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.019
And this did get me pretty worried that we ruined the whole batch.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.459
I did try pushing it down with a spatula to hold it down until the rubber started setting a little bit more,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.660
But then when I took it out,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.889
I found a soft spot in the top of the rubber which made me think we might have trapped an air bubble.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.159
Look at the bowls and look at the mixtures. This stuff is really cool because it still looks like liquid frosting,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.869
But if you touch it you can see, it's quite rubbery and where we've got the beaters here.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.859
We don't have to wipe that off with a cloth because it's not that messy, you can actually just grab it and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.080
Peel strands of the rubber off. It's the coolest thing you can see it cleans up. You don't even need to wash it,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.580
Just pull the rubber off and it's as good as new.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.300
That's because silicone does not stick to things. In fact, the only thing that it really does stick to is other [silicones]

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.810
So by using a silicone spatula I've pretty much ruined it because this is turned into one big block chunk of silicone, so unfortunately I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.920
Got to throw that away, but that's really not that big of a deal. I wonder if you can make your own balloons?

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.000
Oh, yeah

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.589
Now honestly, I'm just as curious as you to see what happened to the chicken inside.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.549
You can see 48 hours later this has completely turned to rubber.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.809
I mean, I got my kids poking their fingers into it you can see it's no longer a liquid.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.070
I'm guessing the chicken is basically just going to fall out of the mold the meat should be totally fine.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.070
We could just heat it up and have it for lunch.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.180
So let's cut this open and see if that's really the case

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.160
I decided to make my chicken mold in an acrylic box because that way we could get some different camera angles.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.110
That's really neat.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.419
But I also designed it so that it bolts together and the reason I did this is because this chunk of Silicon will be extremely

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.040
Difficult to get out like this

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.930
but if we unscrew the different Walls

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.689
We can take the panels apart and basically knock the rubber block out until we've got just one big chunk of rubber that we can

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.709
Deal with a lot more conveniently this chunk of rubber probably weighs about [5] pounds

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.449
There's a chicken in there somewhere if I cut away this top flap you can actually see the chicken inside there

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.439
And it looks like cold chicken

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.019
It's maybe a couple of days old

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:39.799
but
No

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.989
Big deal the cool thing is you can see the silicone isn't sticking to it at all and we could just cut this straight in

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.950
Half but [I] want to use this as a mold

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.470
[so] I think the best way to do that is to make kind of jagged cuts back and forth almost like a saw blade

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.889
Because that's going to help the mold close back together a little more seamlessly for when you go to pour things like chocolate and gummies

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.869
all right the chicken is out and you can see the silicone has a cavity where the chicken used to be that means if we

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.120
Mixed up some gummy syrup and poured it in there

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.959
we [should] be able to cast ourselves [a]

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.658
Lifelike replica of the chicken itself and if you look at the chicken you can see the meats actually in really great condition

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.870
And it tastes just like chicken. It's just a little bit cold

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.269
There's nothing quite like having cold chicken for breakfast

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.319
So check this out guys my wife actually just went and heated up the chicken and brought it back

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.728
So we could try it and tell you how it tastes after sitting in silicone for two days surprisingly

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:39.469
It actually smells pretty good actually smells as fresh and delicious as it did the day it came from the store

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.359
I'm gonna go ahead and let my wife have the first bite so she can give you some honest and genuine feedback about what she

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.750
really thinks

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.639
He's a chicken. [it's] actually really good. All right. It's good chicken is good

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.529
Nothing wasted because [this] sat in a block [of] silicone for two days there was no air that was able to get

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.610
So no Bacteria was the only decomposing plus. We had it sitting in the fridge as well still tender and juicy

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.949
Now let's take a look at our rubber pieces just to see how well they turned out you know surprisingly

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.720
I didn't actually find an air bubble in there at all

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.550
I think this is just from wearing the chicken raised up it got really thin and that's why I was able to push down on

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.649
It but the rubber seems to be in really good [shape] and if we push the two pieces together you can see all the seams

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.730
Disappear and it actually looks very promising that we could cast ourselves the gummy chicken

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.690
What do you think should we try that in the next video?

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.769
So we've got ourselves a rubber chicken mold. We've got an acrylic box

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.140
that's designed so we can flip this thing upside down pack it back inside and bolt it [back] together and now we've got ourselves a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.840
Silicone Candy mold for making gummy chickens

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.399
I went to the local Super center, and I got a ton of Karo syrup some jello and some gelatin

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.019
I'm going to make up a big batch of gummy syrup and see if we can make ourselves a gummy chicken. Will it work?

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.640
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.509
We're going to find out in the [next] video, but until then thanks so much for joining me for this experiment

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.519
I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then.
