HENRY GREEN:
Splenvid is a new way

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.160
to relive and share your life
through automated content.

00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:15.130
JEFF RAUBITSCHEK: A lot of
computer vision algorithms

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.900
have been applied to
different problems,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.610
but this is basically
taking these algorithms that

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.640
have existed for a while and
bringing them to consumers

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.520
and making it help
their curation process.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.990
So we've built on top
of open source tools,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.880
but are really
leveraging those tools

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.090
to figure out how
to use that metadata

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.910
to create the best
movie as possible.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.800
Or you might actually find that
we didn't do the perfect job,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.180
and you can go in and
tweak it and customize it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.066
for exactly what
you're looking for.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.440
And then, on the
technology side,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.730
we actually take that
feedback and make sure

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.720
that the movies that we
create for you the next time

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.210
are going to be better and more
customized to what you like.
