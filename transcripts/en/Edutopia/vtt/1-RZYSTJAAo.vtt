00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.260
- First I'm gonna read a quote.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.715
To succeed, you must first improve.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:12.160
To improve, you must first practice.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.810
Young people have to be given

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.560
space to grow and to feel
like, okay, I made a mistake

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.389
but from this learning
experience I can continue

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:23.110
to become better.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.310
To learn, you must first fail.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.750
- When you're talking
about student discipline

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.090
a lot of times we are
punitive because it's faster

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.697
and restorative takes more time.

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:41.710
But restorative practices
are better long term.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.889
So at Pearl Cohn, we have
a place called the Zone

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.895
which we use in lieu of suspension.

00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:49.502
- Welcome to the Zone.

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:51.391
- [Sonia] It's a collaborative space

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:53.382
where kids get into a
circle and they discuss

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:55.665
what their behaviors were
and ways to correct it.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.970
- [Woman] We have the Zone every morning

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.651
from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m..

00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:01.900
- [Student] They put you
back in the same situation.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.310
And then they expect (mumbles).

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.944
- Today, we had eight
students in the Zone.

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:11.250
We're here today to talk
about how to make things right

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.150
when we make mistakes, poor choices, uh

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.349
Usually the infractions
are cell phone use,

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.841
disrespect, cursing, but it could also be

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:23.212
that there was an argument in a classroom

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:27.441
or more aggressive behaviors
that also get sent to us.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.375
So even though you had a
conflict that brought you here,

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:33.103
if we can bring our best
selves to the circle

00:01:33.103 --> 00:01:35.634
we can get a lot done, we
can learn from each other

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:39.369
When students come in we
go over circle guidelines

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.944
so that there are agreements that we hold

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:43.700
within this space.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.430
What does it mean to
listen from the heart?

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.290
- You're tryin' to feel
like you're relatin'

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.560
to the situation.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.710
- Just like, show respect to them.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.056
I talked to (mumbles) about the situation,

00:01:55.056 --> 00:01:56.400
about my phone situation.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.600
- Once we teach them,
really what the Zone is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.370
and how this is not a space
where there's a power dynamic

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.740
between you and another
person, then they kinda disarm

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.338
and get to what's causing that behavior.

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:10.830
- I had somebody come to me
and tell me that a friend

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.330
said something bad about me...

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.090
Most the time when you're in
trouble you get a referral

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.280
and you have a consequence.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.230
They don't really wanna
hear your side of the story.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.150
- Well what happened?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.280
- When you come into Zone
they have a conversation

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.580
with you and they kinda tell
you how to solve your problem.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.590
The positive way.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.491
I was able to go to her
and like, work it out.

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:29.930
- We're really just trying to get context.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.020
Whenever there's a conflict
right, both parties contribute

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.932
to the conflict.

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.900
Although you might not
feel like you contributed

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.330
to the problem, you played a piece in it,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.040
and that's a part of the
social-emotional learning

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.890
that we're trying to get them to see.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.700
We really want to have a
discussion about the things

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.891
you can control.

00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:50.439
- I just need to catch myself
and know my surroundings...

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.428
- It is a place for students
to process their role in it,

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:59.640
understanding who was harmed,
but then also understanding

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.280
that it's okay to reflect on
what you as a student needed

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.893
in that situation.

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:09.050
- I don't need anything
from others to make it right

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.393
cause I can be mature on my own.

00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:12.940
- But how can we help you
in the maturing process?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.360
Cause we gonna be here too.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.490
What I usually say is
I don't want to change

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.300
you're behavior, I want
you to think about it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.619
before you do it.

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.860
Really I've seen them
becoming very intentional

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.636
about what they do, what they say.

00:03:24.636 --> 00:03:27.490
- Everybody has to own
up to their consequences

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.760
- [Jamel] And that's the
whole purpose of the Zone.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.160
- And me ownin' it, that's
gonna help me better.
