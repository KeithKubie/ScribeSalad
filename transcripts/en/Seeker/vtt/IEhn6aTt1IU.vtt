00:00:00.161 --> 00:00:01.660
What if Mars
astronauts get infected

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.900
by some kind of crazy
Martian disease?

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.500
Do we just leave them out there?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.170
Hey spacefarers.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.820
Trace here with our weekly
D News space update.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.200
I know it sounds like a
science fiction horror film,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.860
but seriously,
pathogens may exist

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.130
on Mars that could potentially
infect visiting humans.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.930
It's possible.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.330
Back in the 1960s,
NASA was worried

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.390
that astronauts from Apollo 11
may have unknowingly picked up

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.020
some kind of alien bacteria
while traipsing around

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.736
on the moon.

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:34.110
And in response, they rescued
them from their splashdown,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020
put them in special
isolation suits,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.710
and into a quarantine
trailer for weeks

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.700
until they were completely
cleared and safe.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.422
NASA has long been concerned
about bacterial contamination

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:45.130
of their spaced-out
humans, checking them

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.447
before their flights and
then rechecking them after.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.030
Not only do we want
to avoid some kind

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.390
of alien super plague--
that would be really bad--

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.006
but contamination of alien
worlds with Earth bacteria

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:55.630
could really screw
things up out there.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.760
To protect us from messing
up each other's planets

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.370
is NASA's Planetary
Protection Office.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.560
But still, sometimes
bad things happen.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.050
Astronauts going to Mars will
spend months and maybe even

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.490
years exposed to
only each other.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.990
Because of this
limited environment,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.390
the bacteria living in
their digestive tract,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.380
nasal passages, and upper
airways will mutate,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.060
and their body's immune
system will slowly weaken.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.030
One infection of concern
is staphylococcus.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.390
It's commonly found during
sweeps of the International

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.400
Space Station already.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.110
This little guy can become
MRSA, an unfortunately common

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.060
infection fought in hospitals,
prisons, and nursing homes,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.130
places where immune
systems are weaker.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.820
Once humans show up
in the red planet,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.620
they would instantly contaminate
any of their equipment

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.420
with bacteria.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.337
We just can't help it.

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:39.128
They're everywhere.

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:40.730
The mere presence
of humans would

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.870
cause a bacterial infestation,
and Mars's environment

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.010
would be akin to a trial by
fire for an invasive species.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.580
Bacteria on a contaminated
Rover, for example,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.770
could infect areas of Mars
suitable for Earth life.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770
Then, without competition
from other strains,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730
that area would become a Petri
dish for mutated superbugs.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.890
So what's the plan to
protect NASA's astronauts

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.723
from getting up there
and becoming infected?

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.390
Beforehand, we could irradiate
their foods to kill bacteria.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.430
They do that already.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.360
But the effect of
long-term ingestion

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.320
of microorganism-free
food on our gut bacteria

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.120
isn't really clear.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.775
While on Mars, NASA has set
up already human restriction

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:17.920
zones, where a robot will have
to check the area before one

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.100
of us meatbags can visit.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.280
But even with restrictions,
inevitably, someone's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.030
going to get sick.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.300
In the case of
illness, according

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.820
to the planetary
protection office,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.050
one crew member will
have the responsibility

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.530
to implement planetary
protection protocol

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.800
and will determine how to act.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.710
NASA will monitor the health
of their men and women,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.150
and hopefully the
infection can be

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.440
treated with the equipment they
brought during that 20 million

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.310
mile trip.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.939
If not, then we're not sure
what's going to happen.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.730
It's kind of scary.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.940
We can't have a, quote, horribly
infectious, horribly damaging

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.120
organism brought back
to Earth from Mars.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.880
Though, the way
I see it, if they

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.967
catch some kind of
Martian flu, maybe they

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:53.800
can just go live with
those Mars One crazies

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.810
and never come back.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.360
What do you think?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.984
Were you worried
about space infection?

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:58.000
Are you now?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.430
Tell us in the comments below
and find us on social media

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.310
so we can be friends.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.490
We'll see you next
time on D News.
