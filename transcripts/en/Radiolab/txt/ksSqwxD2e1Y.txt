Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you Robert? Nice to speak to you after all these years. Yes, it's been quite a few years. I should let you know the Jad Abumrad has just wandered in. Hello. Hi Jad, this is Adrian Noey.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Last name is N. O. E. N. I'm director of the National Museum of Health and medicine.

Speaker 1:          00:30          So you know why we're calling you, right? Yes. Okay. So what's the spring it on the audience? Um, I don't remember how I happen to bump into you. I don't even know how this came up.

Speaker 2:          00:41          I think you and I had, um, been coke presenters at a ted conference probably a decade ago. We may have been talking about, um, important events in New York or civic architecture, but I, but I do remember perking up at the phrase grants too. So Robert said something to you about grants tomb. Yes. And then you turned to be, say it again. Now you may know who's buried in grant's tomb, but I know it's buried in grant's tumor.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Yes. He turns it out at the museum. She works at, there is a

Speaker 2:          01:19          tumor that had been excised from the throat of president grant in the 1880s actual tissue from grant's tumor. Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Yes. Here we are, the National Museum of Health and medicine in Gladesville name. It is kept behind several locked doors, so you guys don't have an inkling of what you're about to see if we go in there now, but it's a privileged area. This is Brian's Spatola. He's the collections manager and he let us down a long hallway to some doors and took me back. Oh, holy moly. Oh my God. There's like other twin babies and in Formaldehyde look, Greens heads torsos and majority even gotten to the tumors. Right. So he let us out of that room and into another one in the, you're sitting on a table and waiting for us is this, is this, the thing about which we spoke it is was President Ulysses Simpson grants tumor. Oh Wow. Lots of it was resting in a box that looked as it happen and it's exactly like a cigar box. Oh. Which is a little ironic. This was the guy who never ever stopped having a cigar in his mouth. He never stopped having cigars. He smoked as many as 12 cigars a day. Wow. So it was probably the cigars that made the tumor

Speaker 2:          02:41          February of 1885 tissue was removed, examined, and his physicians, um, concluded that he had a squamous cell carcinoma and ultimately he was treated for pain and died in July of 85. That same year.

Speaker 1:          03:01          Well, it's pretty fast. So that's what killed president grant then? It was a tumor. Yes. I didn't know that. So you see the staining that they use to bring out the details in the cells is the darkness, the tumor, the darkness is the tumor. Wow. The very stuff that even though president grant got through Vicksburg, I didn't even know he came east and they fight, tried to kill him here. They tried to kill him there. They tried to go. Then he goes and becomes president. This is what actually killed him. This is what kills him. Wow. Can I touch it? Um, no, we may not be able to touch the actual tumor of the president of the United States, but we can touch on this subject. We can grasp this subject. We can examine this subject coming up on radio lab for the next hour. It's totally tumors. Oh, come on. Don't call that. Cause really what we're going to talk about are not just any tumors but famous tumors, immortal tumors, devil tumors, he just tumors and tumors that speak up.

Speaker 3:          04:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:03          I'm Robert Krulwich. I'm about to be confused. The Big One and I'm Jad Abumrad this is Radiolab. Stay with us.

Speaker 4:          04:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:21          wow.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Alright. To get things to get things rolling. This first story is about something that we thought was not possible that we hoped was not possible. We learned it from, uh, I'll make it work from this Guy David Coleman. I'm a science journalist. He is, I think my favorite in my generation. I think he is the best writer that writes about science. I specialize in evolutionary biology and travel on assignment to far away places and interesting situations. All right, so first of all, where are you going to take us to? What part of the world? I'm going to take you to

Speaker 5:          04:53          Tasmania, which is the island state off the south coast of Australia. You know, you go to Australia and you think of Brock and deserts and red dirt and heat, but you keep going south all the way off the south coast. Suddenly you have these rolling green countrysides, lots of wallabies, one of the species of kangaroo that like bonding them countryside with wallabies. Is that the, exactly with small kangaroos hopping around,

Speaker 1:          05:24          but our story does not actually begin in Tasmania. Nope. It starts in Holland with a gentleman by the name of Christo Bosh. Is that bar as in B a r Bosh? Christo bars is a wonderfully independent spirited plumber. A plumber, plumber guy do to make a living on the photographing is for me a big hobby. I, we don't know just how great a plumber he is, but he's a very good wildlife photographer and he looks for interesting animals to shoot with the camera. I mean, so over the years, often he puts down his ranch and he travels. Yeah, well we don't have that many animals here in Holland. A little bit of Roe, deer and sometimes a Fox. And in the early nineties he goes to take his latest photography sabbatical in Tasmania. Have I gone to a attach mania on boat? And were you there to take pictures of wallabies or Kangaroos?

Speaker 1:          06:18          No, no, no, no. He was there this time to photograph devils. Tasmanian devils. Yeah. Oh, I quite liked the animals. What is, I mean, I know the cartoon, but what does a real Tasmanian Devil acce look like, whether they're about as big as a little pit bull, but look a little bit more like a bear cub white yoke on its chest. Big Set of formidable teeth. They'll eat almost anything. Anything, anything like Afar Plata, push, kelp, maggots and fish snakes, garbage cans, occasional rubber boot, you name it. Anyway, when crystal gets to Tasmania, he drives up the coast. He finds dead animals on the road, you know, roadkill, roadkill from the road to use as bait. What sort of roadkill? Oh, Kangaroos, a little devil can eat a kangaroo. Oh yeah. When the three four five together to eat a big kangaroo in an hour is gone. Wow. So he takes the dead kangaroo, drags it to clearing in the forest, sets up his photography equipment, very close. And then what happens? Well, you just wait

Speaker 3:          07:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:16          so he waited as the nightfall little black ships began to creep out of the, you can hear them sniffing and refine the roadkill.

Speaker 5:          07:33          Ah,

Speaker 1:          07:35          and then I just started eating and fighting with each other. [inaudible] this squad scary. If you don't know what what you're hearing as the e Christina, Danny, at a safe distance, English shadows takes their plunger. Okay.

Speaker 3:          08:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:10          over the years he's done this over and over and over, but he always sees lots of devils. Devils in front of his lenses. Sometimes 20 devil's running around, devil's in his kitchen or come into your tent. Devil's everywhere. But after a bunch of trips, something happened. It was Easter 1996 he was in the park watching a dead kangaroo and waiting for the devils to show. But only thing I saw was one devil, just one, eh? [inaudible] I'll try another spot. I had another spot, tried it at two devils. They're not gone entirely, but they're scarce. And you notice something strange about one or two of the devils. It was something on the face is fasion on the backend, on their mouth and something that looked like a growth, a large ugly growth thought. Oh well maybe uh, they've been bitten, are fighting with each other and bits troll on up. But it was really big, you know, and blood coming out. And this was the first alarm bell. So crystal, you were the first to see it. Yes. And this was just the beginning.

Speaker 3:          09:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:24          like a pie out of hell and dark death is sweeping Tasmania. Television reporters got this. Don't fronted anything like this. And began reporting that more and more. Tasmanian devils had these lumps on their faces. They fill the eye sockets, they puff out the lips, they infect the gums. It's really sad and hideous and whatever they were, they turned out to be lethal. To jump ahead a little bit. The effect that it's had in the population, in some cases, devil populations collapsed by 90%, died off very quickly. Scientists looked at the disease and determined that it was some kind of tumor cancer, a cancerous tumor. And then the question was what's causing them? So what, what, what did they think? Well, the toxic chemical was guest number one, some poison or pesticide from the environment. Yes, number two was a virus. So they tested in places where the doubles, they're looking for something toxic or some virus and they found nothing.

Speaker 1:          10:18          And then along comes a woman named Anne Marie Pierce. She looked at some tumors close up, um, very close up from 11 different devils. So she's looking at the first tumor and she found that the chromosomes were sort of mangled, which isn't really that strange because that's what cancer is. It's like your genetic stuff gone screwy. Right? But then she looked at the tumor from the next note and she found not just also mangled chromosomes, but chromosomes that were mangled in exactly the same way as they had been in the first devil. Hmm. So now she looks at a third identical metaphor, identical and then a fifth identity. All 11. Exactly the same pattern in each [inaudible]. Does that I, I feel the sensation of awe, but I don't quite have these understanding attachment. Does that mean that that these tumors are all brothers? What that meant was that these tumors were all genetically identical. They were all the same tumor. How can they all be the same tumor? Well, they can't because, because that wouldn't mean that these Tasmanian devils caught the cancer from some other Tasmanian Devil. Exactly. Wait, what do you mean exactly? You can't catch cancers. Epidemic of cancer in Tasmanian devils was a crazy impossible tumor that was jumping

Speaker 3:          11:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:45          with leaping from one devil to another.

Speaker 3:          11:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:50          raping tumor. Yeah, a leaping tumor

Speaker 6:          11:53          [inaudible] point in this tale where we really have to question everything that we thought. We knew. No cancer. Now most people think of cancer as like a situation in which one of your cells

Speaker 7:          12:09          starts replicating and it doesn't stop. It replicates uncontrollably

Speaker 6:          12:19          until it destroys you. Okay. So that's like the one cell theory, which is frankly how I thought cancer worked. Oh Peter, we have to go ahead. Just start. But then we spoke with this fellow. Yup. His name is Carlo Maley, cancer biologist at the Wistar Institute. And he told us if you really want to understand what's happening with the devils, you're going to toss out the one cell theory. Cause cancer is not just not just a cell going haywire. No, it's actually many cells competing, competing for space, competing for resources and in the process driving each other haywire. Like if you were to somehow go into a tumor, he says what you would find is between a billion and a trillion cells in there. So these are different cells, this huge clump of cells in there. They're all fighting it out. Cause you know space is tight, food is scarce. And what'll happen is in the middle of this melee and you as the sales are competing each individual sellers trying to copy itself, copy, copy Gabby. And somewhere along the way you get eventually a copying error. And every so often says, Carla, one of these mistakes, we'll give the new sale a new talent. In the case of cancer, it usually starts with something pretty simple, like the ability to slurp up food, Fester nutrients like oxygen and glucose. Now with this advantage, that mutant and all of its progeny will take over that area of the tissue,

Speaker 8:          13:49          but

Speaker 6:          13:50          not for long because now you've got all these beauties and they start to randomly again, you get another copy of the state and maybe this second copying mistake gives the cell the ability to divide faster, right? So there it is proliferating faster than its neighbors and it takes over growing and displacing the other cells. But yeah, it just keeps getting worse because now you've got these double meals. They can eat fast, they can divide quickly, and they start to fight until you get a third mutation, then a fourth, and you just keep ratcheting it up and eventually roughly five to 20 mutations, you end up with a cell that is so gnarled, so mutated, and so powerful that it can literally spit a kind of acid

Speaker 7:          14:40          called a matrix metallo protease that allows it to rip through the membrane barriers, and

Speaker 6:          14:46          this is when you're really in trouble because now the cell can roam

Speaker 9:          14:52          and so the cells leave the primary tumor, they've got dissolved their way into a blood vessel. That's a mutation. Then they've got to survive and the blood, another mutation, then they've got to stick somewhere else yet another. Then they've got to dissolve back through the RTL adding in another. Yeah, so it sounds like cancer is always evolving to be more cancerous. It totally, yes. This also explains why we haven't been able to cure it. Why when a person takes chemotherapy drugs, the cancer will go away for a while, but then it'll come back

Speaker 6:          15:28          stronger cause the cells have evolved a resistance to those drugs. When I first got into work on cancer, I was impressed at how malevolent the disease seems as if it's being designed to kill us. So here's my question. Um, this leaping tumor in the devils [inaudible], is this a case where the tumor is actually evolving into a new form like after, say the 50th mutation or whatever? Like now it doesn't just have the ability to travel in a body, but it can somehow leap out of a body through the air

Speaker 9:          16:00          and into another body? Sure.

Speaker 1:          16:05          I mean, the only, that's really scary. Yes it is. It is pretty scary. But, but this is amazingly rare and according to Carlo demand, some pretty special circumstances. Oh, would m a Tasmanian devil would some tumor get from one individual to another? What would, well, how would that happen? Tasmanian devils. God bless him, bite one another in the face a lot.

Speaker 5:          16:30          They're scrambling over carcasses. They're fighting and biting, swallowing, crunching, and the males also bite females during the meeting period. He's

Speaker 1:          16:45          a little bit of a rough lover. So you have the male and the female biting each other in the face. So, uh, devil with a tumor on its face, let's say it's mating with another devil and it bites that second devil in the face. What exactly happens at that point? Is it just rubbing its tumor? When you think of these big ugly tumors, think of fetter cheese. And when one devil bites another, there's a tendency for the tumor to crumble and to shed tumor cells that then fall into the wounds on the second devil. But um, some of you I don't understand. Um, why wouldn't the immune system of the devil's kill those cells prevent those cells from taking root? Yeah. Cause that's what immune systems do. And the latest answer is that, well, Tasmanian devils don't have as much genetic diversity as you would expect. Whether that means David explained to us is that the Tasmanian devil population has gotten so inbred, they are so alike at a genetic level that their immune systems now confused.

Speaker 6:          17:50          They don't know the difference between their own cells and invading cells coming in from other devils. Exactly. Which doesn't actually sound like the tumor is all that powerful. So I asked Carlo Maley, you get a mutation. That's really the story of a tumor evolving, more adaptive or is it just the story of a tumor getting lucky them those. I think those are the same story. How do you mean? I mean evolution is all about dumb luck. The way he explained it, it's dumb luck that the tumor was on the outside of the face. It's dumb luck that they bite each other a lot. That a cell could come along that could shed and fall into a wound. It's all dumb luck. But that he says is what makes evolution happen. That's natural selection right there. And when you step back, sometimes the results are just nuts. Yeah, just nuts. This is the point. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          18:41          Where we need to talk about a transmissible tumor in, in dogs, canine transmissible venereal tumor.

Speaker 6:          18:48          This is a tumor. He says it's evolved way beyond the one in the devils and way longer. How long is that

Speaker 5:          18:55          Donna? Well, it's been going on for somewhere between 220 500 years.

Speaker 6:          19:01          Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Between 220 500 years.

Speaker 5:          19:06          Yeah. Yes. Unit. Yes. Over to millennia. Exactly. And if that's the case, then it's the oldest continuous animals cell line in existence on planet earth. You might need to say that again because that is just too strange. It is. It is. Even stranger, it says David [inaudible]. When a tumor lives this long propagates itself this long, you can only really call it one thing. This tumor is essentially an animal, a parasite, not a species of parasite, but one individual parasite that may never die.

Speaker 10:         20:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          20:02          David Corbin is the other sauna at the Dodo natural acts.
