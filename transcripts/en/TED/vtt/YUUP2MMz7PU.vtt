00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:15.810
A confession:

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.807
I am an archaeologist
and a museum curator,

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.020
but a paradoxical one.

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:24.268
For my museum, I collect things,

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:27.700
but I also return things
back to where they came from.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:33.371
I love museums because
they're social and educational,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:37.125
but I'm most drawn to them
because of the magic of objects:

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:40.292
a one-million-year-old hand axe,

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.270
a totem pole, an impressionist painting

00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:46.219
all take us beyond our own imaginations.

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:53.658
In museums, we pause to muse,
to gaze upon our human empire of things

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:55.729
in meditation and wonder.

00:00:57.315 --> 00:00:59.549
I understand why US museums alone

00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:03.938
host more than 850 million
visits each year.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
Yet, in recent years, museums
have become a battleground.

00:01:09.564 --> 00:01:12.428
Communities around the world
don't want to see their culture

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:16.187
in distant institutions
which they have no control over.

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:18.924
They want to see their cultural treasures

00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:22.666
repatriated, returned
to their places of origin.

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.465
Greece seeks the return
of the Parthenon Marbles,

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:30.671
a collection of classical sculptures
held by the British Museum.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.210
Egypt demands antiquities from Germany.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:37.983
New Zealand's Maori want to see returned

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:42.356
ancestral tattooed heads
from museums everywhere.

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:48.085
Yet these claims pale in comparison
to those made by Native Americans.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:52.770
Already, US museums have returned
more than one million artifacts

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:56.768
and 50,000 sets
of Native American skeletons.

00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.588
To illustrate what's at stake,
let's start with the War Gods.

00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.311
This is a wood carving

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:08.726
made by members
of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.598
In the 1880s, anthropologists
began to collect them

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.009
as evidence of American Indian religion.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.099
They came to be seen as beautiful,

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:24.096
the precursor to the stark sculptures
of Picasso and Paul Klee,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.643
helping to usher in
the modern art movement.

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:32.806
From one viewpoint, the museum
did exactly as it's supposed to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.250
with the War God.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:36.693
It helped introduce
a little-known art form

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:38.583
for the world to appreciate.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.717
But from another point of view,

00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:46.184
the museum had committed
a terrible crime of cultural violence.

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.620
For Zunis, the War God
is not a piece of art,

00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:53.613
it is not even a thing.

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:55.136
It is a being.

00:02:57.521 --> 00:03:00.197
For Zunis, every year,

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.443
priests ritually carve new War Gods,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:03.959
the Ahayu:da,

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:06.586
breathing life into them
in a long ceremony.

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:09.380
They are placed on sacred shrines

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:12.645
where they live to protect the Zuni people

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.983
and keep the universe in balance.

00:03:15.856 --> 00:03:18.158
No one can own or sell a War God.

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:20.379
They belong only to the earth.

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:24.610
And so Zunis want them back from museums

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:26.744
so they can go to their shrine homes

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:30.792
to fulfill their spiritual purpose.

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:34.784
What is a curator to do?

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:39.056
I believe that the War Gods
should be returned.

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:42.321
This might be a startling answer.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.924
After all, my conclusion
contradicts the refrain

00:03:44.948 --> 00:03:47.495
of the world's most famous archaeologist:

00:03:48.174 --> 00:03:49.728
"That belongs in a museum!"

00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:52.688
(Laughter)

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:56.736
is what Indiana Jones said,
not just to drive movie plots,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.518
but to drive home the unquestionable good
of museums for society.

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:05.544
I did not come to my view easily.

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:08.377
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona,

00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.210
and fell in love
with the Sonoran Desert's past.

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:16.018
I was amazed that beneath
the city's bland strip malls

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:19.915
was 12,000 years of history
just waiting to be discovered.

00:04:20.983 --> 00:04:24.250
When I was 16 years old,
I started taking archaeology classes

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:26.059
and going out on digs.

00:04:26.896 --> 00:04:30.168
A high school teacher of mine
even helped me set up my own laboratory

00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:31.769
to study animal bones.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:34.211
But in college,

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:39.480
I came to learn that my future career
had a dark history.

00:04:40.372 --> 00:04:43.103
Starting in the 1860s,

00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:47.254
Native American skeletons
became a tool for science,

00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:49.136
collected in the thousands

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.444
to prove new theories
of social and racial hierarchies.

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:59.243
Native American human remains
were plundered from graves,

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:01.933
even taken fresh from battlefields.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.823
When archaeologists
came across white graves,

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:09.283
the skeleton was often quickly reburied,

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:14.326
while Native bones were deposited
as specimens on museum shelves.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.705
In the wake of war, stolen land,
boarding schools,

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.516
laws banning religion,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.642
anthropologists collected sacred objects

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:26.657
in the belief that Native peoples
were on the cusp of extinction.

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:32.545
You can call it racism or colonialism,
but the labels don't matter

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.377
as much as the fact
that over the last century,

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:39.011
Native American rights and culture
were taken from them.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.250
In 1990, after years of Native protests,

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:45.707
the US government,
through the US Congress,

00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:50.081
finally passed a law that allowed
Native Americans to reclaim

00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:53.699
cultural items, sacred objects
and human remains from museums.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.458
Many archaeologists were panicked.

00:05:58.713 --> 00:05:59.887
For scientists,

00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:06.151
it can be hard to fully grasp
how a piece of wood can be a living god

00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:08.403
or how spirits surround bones.

00:06:08.427 --> 00:06:12.229
And they knew that modern science,
especially with DNA,

00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:15.792
can provide luminous insights
into the past.

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:19.714
As the anthropologist
Frank Norwick declared,

00:06:19.738 --> 00:06:23.869
"We are doing important work
that benefits all of mankind.

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:26.920
We are not returning anything to anyone."

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:32.358
As a college student,
all of this was an enigma

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:34.777
that was hard to decipher.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.402
Why did Native Americans
want their heritage back

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:40.806
from the very places preserving it?

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.071
And how could scientists
spend their entire lives

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:46.586
studying dead Indians

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.687
but seem to care so little
about living ones?

00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:55.412
I graduated but wasn't sure
what to do next,

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.094
so I traveled.

00:06:58.897 --> 00:07:00.596
One day, in South Africa,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.079
I visited Nelson Mandela's
former prison cell on Robben Island.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.477
I had an epiphany.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.774
Here was a man who helped
a country bridge vast divides

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:14.695
to seek, however imperfectly,
reconciliation.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.829
I'm no Mandela, but I ask myself:

00:07:18.853 --> 00:07:22.813
Could I, too, plant seeds of hope
in the ruins of the past?

00:07:23.586 --> 00:07:25.955
In 2007, I was hired as a curator

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.777
at the Denver Museum
of Nature and Science.

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:32.013
Our team agreed that unlike
many other institutions,

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:36.587
we needed to proactively confront
the legacy of museum collecting.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.065
We started with
the skeletons in our closet,

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:42.476
100 of them.

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.782
After months and then years,
we met with dozens of tribes

00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:48.082
to figure out how to get
these remains home.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.198
And this is hard work.

00:07:50.222 --> 00:07:54.301
It involves negotiating
who will receive the remains,

00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:56.253
how to respectfully transfer them,

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:58.007
where will they go.

00:07:58.734 --> 00:08:02.341
Native American leaders
become undertakers,

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:06.944
planning funerals for dead relatives
they had never wanted unearthed.

00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:11.816
A decade later, the Denver Museum
and our Native partners

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.606
have reburied nearly all
of the human remains in the collection.

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:18.677
We have returned
hundreds of sacred objects.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.764
But I've come to see
that these battles are endless.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.598
Repatriation is now a permanent feature
of the museum world.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.548
Hundreds of tribes are waiting their turn.

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:35.841
There are always
more museums with more stuff.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.679
Every catalogued War God
in an American public museum

00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:43.933
has now been returned -- 106, so far --

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.997
but there are more
beyond the reach of US law,

00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:49.988
in private collections
and outside our borders.

00:08:51.225 --> 00:08:56.329
In 2014, I had the chance to travel
with a respected religious leader

00:08:56.353 --> 00:09:00.195
from the Zuni tribe
named Octavius Seowtewa

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:02.908
to visit five museums
in Europe with War Gods.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.339
At the Ethnological Museum of Berlin,

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:10.092
we saw a War God
with a history of dubious care.

00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:14.062
An overly enthusiastic curator
had added chicken feathers to it.

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:17.022
Its necklace had once been stolen.

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:20.316
At the Musée du quai Branly in Paris,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.673
an official told us that the War God there
is now state property

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:26.530
with no provisions for repatriation.

00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:29.466
He insisted that the War God
no longer served Zunis

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.807
but museum visitors.

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:34.418
He said, "We give all
of the objects to the world."

00:09:35.487 --> 00:09:36.939
At the British Museum,

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:40.971
we were warned that the Zuni case
would establish a dangerous precedent

00:09:40.995 --> 00:09:42.440
for bigger disputes,

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:46.018
such as the Parthenon Marbles,
claimed by Greece.

00:09:46.574 --> 00:09:49.043
After visiting the five museums,

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:52.867
Octavius returned home
to his people empty-handed.

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:55.594
He later told me,

00:09:55.618 --> 00:09:58.919
"It hurts my heart to see
the Ahayu:da so far away.

00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:00.617
They all belong together.

00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:05.344
It's like a family member
that's missing from a family dinner.

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:09.716
When one is gone,
their strength is broken."

00:10:10.848 --> 00:10:13.662
I wish that my colleagues
in Europe and beyond

00:10:13.686 --> 00:10:17.163
could see that the War Gods
do not represent the end of museums

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:19.384
but the chance for a new beginning.

00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:23.457
When you walk the halls of a museum,

00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:26.250
you're likely just seeing
about one percent

00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:27.493
of the total collections.

00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:29.511
The rest is in storage.

00:10:29.535 --> 00:10:33.322
Even after returning
500 cultural items and skeletons,

00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:39.218
my museum still retains 99.999 percent
of its total collections.

00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:41.647
Though we no longer have War Gods,

00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:44.051
we have Zuni traditional pottery,

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:47.487
jewelry, tools, clothing and arts.

00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:51.288
And even more precious than these objects

00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:54.645
are the relationships that we formed
with Native Americans

00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:57.295
through the process of repatriation.

00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:03.347
Now, we can ask Zunis
to share their culture with us.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.469
Not long ago, I had the chance
to visit the returned War Gods.

00:11:09.263 --> 00:11:14.791
A shrine sits up high atop a mesa
overlooking beautiful Zuni homeland.

00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:20.681
The shrine is enclosed
by a roofless stone building

00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:23.133
threaded at the top with barbed wire

00:11:23.157 --> 00:11:25.093
to ensure that they're not stolen again.

00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.894
And there they are, inside,

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:30.122
the Ahayu:da,

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:35.557
106 War Gods amid offerings
of turquoise, cornmeal, shell,

00:11:35.581 --> 00:11:36.787
even T-shirts ...

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:40.097
a modern gift to ancient beings.

00:11:41.306 --> 00:11:43.021
And standing there,

00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:46.488
I got a glimpse at the War Gods'
true purpose in the world.

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:49.161
And it occurred to me then

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:53.240
that we do not get to choose
the histories that we inherit.

00:11:54.043 --> 00:11:57.178
Museum curators today
did not pillage ancient graves

00:11:57.202 --> 00:11:58.988
or steal spiritual objects,

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:03.274
but we can accept responsibility
for correcting past mistakes.

00:12:04.232 --> 00:12:06.472
We can help restore dignity,

00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:09.933
hope and humanity to Native Americans,

00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:13.774
the very people who were once
the voiceless objects of our curiosity.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.481
And this doesn't even require us
to fully understand others' beliefs,

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.598
only that we respect them.

00:12:22.732 --> 00:12:25.457
Museums are temples to things past.

00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:30.278
Now they must also become
places for living cultures.

00:12:32.466 --> 00:12:34.736
As I turned to walk away from the shrine,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.134
I drank in the warm summer air,

00:12:37.158 --> 00:12:40.239
and I watched an eagle
turn lazy circles high above.

00:12:41.483 --> 00:12:42.936
I thought of the Zunis,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.155
whose offerings ensure
that their culture is not dead and gone

00:12:47.179 --> 00:12:48.821
but alive and well,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.390
and I could think of no better place
for the War Gods to be.

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:55.220
Thank you.

00:12:55.244 --> 00:13:00.500
(Applause)
