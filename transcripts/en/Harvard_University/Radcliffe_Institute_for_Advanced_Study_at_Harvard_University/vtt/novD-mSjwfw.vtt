00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.297
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.270
- Thank you, Judy.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.830
And thank you to everyone
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.280
And I want to give a special
thanks to my Radcliffe research

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.059
partner, Harvard
senior, Sally Yi.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.000
When I tell people that I'm
writing a book about celebrity,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.870
they ask a lot of questions.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.650
But three crop up
over and over again.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.740
The first is, what is
a celebrity, really?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.980
The second is, have
celebrities always existed,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.810
or is there something
radically new

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.020
about our
celebrity-crazed present?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.500
And the third is, why
do so many people care

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.290
so much about celebrities?

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.800
These are the questions
that I plan to answer today

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200
by sharing with you material
from the introduction

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.640
to my soon-to-be completed
book, The Drama of Celebrity

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.100
And in addition to sharing
my research with you,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.800
I am going to ask you to
be part of my research.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.330
So periodically I am going to
pause to ask you questions.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.610
You are free-- we are all free--

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.720
not to answer them.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.620
If you want to answer them,
you can write your answers

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.440
on the pieces of paper
that have been provided,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.170
along with what I have learned
are called "golf pencils."

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.301
If you prefer to
use your phone--

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:21.550
judging from this crowd, I
don't think that's likely--

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.420
but if you're on Twitter, you
can tweet your answers me.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.430
This is my Twitter handle.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.680
That is my cat, who
I have been trying

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.720
and failing to turn into a
feline internet celebrity.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.510
And this is my first question.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.430
"Who is the first
celebrity in whom you

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.722
remember taking an interest?"

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:45.490
If the answer is no one,
right down "no one."

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.800
And this is my answer
to that question.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.400
So celebrity might
seem like an odd topic

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.820
for a professor of 19th
century literature to tackle.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.650
But in my case,
celebrity actually

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.950
inspired my love of
Victorian novels.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.830
So you see here the cover
of the first "grown-up"

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.362
book that I bought as a child--

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:05.195
not in this edition.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.880
I bought an
English-language addition.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.410
I wasn't that precocious.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.270
I found this book on
the remainder table

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.190
of a Barnes &amp; Noble in Queens.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.860
I convinced my father
to buy it for me.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.080
And reading this book,
I learned many things.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.660
I learned that you
can have five husbands

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.740
and even marry the
same person twice.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.820
I also learned that
Elizabeth Taylor started out

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.870
as a child star and played a
small role in the 1941 film

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.271
version of Jane Eyre.

00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:32.020
And since I was a child
reading this book,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.730
I found that very interesting.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.700
A few years ago when I saw
Charlotte Bronte's novel

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.130
on a shelf, I
recognized the title

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.290
from my Elizabeth Taylor phase.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.540
And I decided to try to read it.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.460
The rest was personal history.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.590
I fell in love with
Victorian novels,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.530
but I never lost my
interest in celebrity.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.640
So to the first question that
I said people commonly ask me--

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.620
not the question I
asked you to answer--

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.810
what is a celebrity, really?

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.230
One reasonable
definition of celebrity

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.350
is, anyone known during his
or her lifetime to more people

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.480
than could possibly
know one another.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.980
By this definition, there
have always been celebrities.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.270
Of course, the heroes and
conquerors of antiquity

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.240
were as preoccupied with
achieving immortal fame

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.030
as with being well-known
in their lifetimes.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.370
And similarly, the saints
of the Middle Ages,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.010
though often popular
figures while alive,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.220
were canonized only
after their deaths.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.100
The use of the word
"celebrity" to refer

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.410
to people well-known
during their lifetimes

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.530
first became common
during the 18th century.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.350
When asked, have
celebrities always existed?

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.390
I answer that modern celebrity
has existed for over 200 years.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.640
There is surprisingly
little that is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.360
truly novel about our
celebrity-crazed present.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.270
For me, this is a
deeply historical point

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.450
about continuities
persisting over periods

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.540
of significant change.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.270
And it means that if we want to
understand how celebrity works,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.000
we have to turn to the
moment when celebrity first

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.570
inquired the global
dimensions it enjoys today.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.110
The history of celebrity culture
begins not with the internet,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.339
nor with film, but in the
18th century when "celebrity,"

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.980
the word, and its French
equivalent, "célébrité,"

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.100
first began to acquire
their modern meanings.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.290
Before the 18th
century, a celebrity

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.120
was a ritual festivity--

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.720
the celebrities of weddings,
funerals, the Sabbath.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.290
But in the middle of the
18th century, usage shifted.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.950
Celebrity was first something
that one could have,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.050
both during one's lifetime
and after one's death.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.580
So when the word originally
came to be used commonly

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.950
to refer to being
well-known, it wasn't

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.870
distinguished that much
from the notion of fame.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.240
An 18th-century
writer could refer--

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.630
could and did-- refer to a
cleric possessing oratorical

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.450
celebrity or to a
future prime minister

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.860
having obtained celebrity while
an undergraduate at Oxford.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.150
Publishers began to cater to
interest in the private lives

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.590
of public figures.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.930
As Harvard English Professor
Deidre Lynch and others

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.660
have shown, 18th
century books started

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.560
to include frontispieces
featuring portraits of authors,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.780
actors, and statesmen.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.460
Philosopher
Jean-Jacques Rousseau

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.110
published an
autobiography in which

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.300
he confessed to
spanking fantasies

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.940
and then complained that people
were gossiping about him.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.520
Lord Byron, pictured here,
wrote a confessional poem

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.050
and then, as the saying went,
woke up to find himself famous.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.800
In the 18th century however, a
fully-fledged global celebrity

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.410
culture had yet to emerge.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.140
Images remained
time-consuming to produce

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.450
and costly to purchase.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.740
Best-selling books often sold no
more than a few hundred copies.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.340
Newspapers had circulations
in the low thousands.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.580
Roads were improving, and
postal systems expanding.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.920
But information still
took weeks to circulate

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.270
within national borders--

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.760
even longer across
national lines.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.270
Only in the 1840s
did a celebrity

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.060
become something one could be.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.400
Instead of simply
possessing celebrity

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.130
as one trait among
many others, celebrity

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.820
became, for the first time
in history, an identity.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.790
Who were these
19th-century celebrities?

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.770
How did they compare
to the people

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.130
that we consider typical
celebrities today?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.580
Before I answer that
question, another one for you.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.400
"Name at least five
living figures--" today,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.680
living figures, not
just in our minds,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.872
"whom you consider celebrities."

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.270
When I participated
a couple of years

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.160
ago in a Reddit
"Ask Me Anything"

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.720
on the topic of celebrity.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.630
Many of the hundreds of
people who participated

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.420
named Kim Kardashian
as the epitome

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.970
of contemporary
celebrity culture.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.220
They also had nothing
good to say about her.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.500
"Famous only for being
famous" was a phrase

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.360
that came up
repeatedly-- a phrase

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.770
to which I will return
towards the end of this talk.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.380
Their responses suggested that
today the word "celebrity" has

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.270
quite negative connotations.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.430
For many people, the
typical celebrity

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.080
is someone who does not deserve
the attention that we pay them.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.780
So this brings me to
the second big question

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.120
I'm so often asked--
what, if anything,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.760
is new about today's
celebrity culture?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.880
My answer is very
little, except that

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.170
for much of the 19th century,
books and magazines equated

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.430
celebrities with, quote unquote,
"distinguished individuals

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.560
renowned for their genius
and strength of character."

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.300
The 19th-century
celebrity was much more

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.310
likely to be a man than a woman.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.050
There were female
celebrities, but if you

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.960
look at books about
celebrities, men absolutely

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.180
dominate the table of contents--

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.530
and as likely to be a general,
an archbishop, or a scientist,

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.380
as an opera singer
or a ballet dancer.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.410
In 1855 for example,
a Boston minister

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.460
published a book entitled
Visits to European Celebrities.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.460
The figures he discussed
included abolitionist William

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.320
Wilberforce,
pictured on the left,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.800
and scientist Alexander
Von Humboldt on the right.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.590
To be sure, then as now,
celebrity had its seamy side.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.850
Writers in the 1840s referred
to courtesans, for example,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.830
as "celebrities of vice."

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.130
But they had to qualify the
word "celebrity"-- "celebrities

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.270
of vice," to give the term a
tawdry ring that at the time

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.490
was not at all a given.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.770
19th-century books
about celebrities

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.170
featured figures such
as Abraham Lincoln.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.270
Now my point here is not
a sensationalist one.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.760
Abraham Lincoln was
nothing but a celebrity,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.660
but rather that for decades
the term "celebrity" typically

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.150
included the most
venerable figures--

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.950
figures such as Lincoln,
who credited this photograph

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.530
for helping him win the
1860 presidential election.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.860
Other 19th-century figures
referred to at the time

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.337
as celebrities included-- well,
you can tell they're important

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:13.420
because they have beards--

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.120
included authors
Alfred Lord Tennyson,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.510
on the left, and poet,
politician, and novelist,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.760
Victor Hugo, on the right.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.490
In 1879, three-volume compendium
entitled Celebrities at Home

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.190
even included a profile of
the Pope at the Vatican.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.550
And I don't know if you can
read the table of contents,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.310
but those of you who could
probably also be flying planes

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.824
will be able to
verify that here is

00:09:37.824 --> 00:09:40.240
an instance of many, many
people being called celebrities,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.440
most of whom are male figures--

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.670
I'll read you-- I can see it.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.750
Cardinal Manning, Doctor Pusey,
also a cleric, Father Ignatius,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.390
[? Gambetta, ?] who was
an Italian nationalist.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.730
The list goes on.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.520
In most other respects, however,
today's celebrity culture

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.490
can be traced back
to the 19th century.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:05.170
In 1968, Andy Warhol memorably
referred to the future--

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.720
future being now-- as a
time when everyone would

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.060
get their 15 minutes of fame.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.730
19th-century news
cycles works slower,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.590
but journalists of
the day similarly

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.620
evoked nine-day wonders.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.170
Tie-in products and
celebrity endorsements

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.780
have existed for over 200 years.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.540
In the late 18th
century, shops sold mugs,

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.960
walking sticks, and figurines
representing the theater stars

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.830
of the day, such as these
objects featuring actor David

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.330
Garrick.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.640
A host of 19th-century
celebrities

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.640
endorsed wigs, face
creams, powders, pianos,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.380
and bottled water.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.320
Celebrity chefs--
the 19th century

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.430
already had its share, including
Alexis Soyer, a French cook

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.090
based in London, who sold his
own brand of kitchen gadgets

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.510
and bottled sauces, whose
labels, which you see here,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.420
pictured him wearing
his trademark red beret.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.600
The late 20th century,
celebrity-hosted telethons

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.330
and star-studded concerts
for charitable causes

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.130
had their counterpart
in benefits

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.130
that 19th-century
performers regularly held

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.180
for victims of
fires, earthquakes,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.150
and in the example
pictured here,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.050
those suffering
from yellow fever.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.750
Celebrity activism-- sorry
that this is a bit blurry.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.970
It's a newspaper photograph.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.670
There is only so big
you can blow them up.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.990
In 1913, a half century before
country-western singer Johnny

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.770
Cash famously performed
live at Folsom Prison,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.080
the legendary actress,
Sarah Bernhardt,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.510
pictured in the Napoleon hat--
so she's in the dark jacket--

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.010
she's actually not
that easy to see,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.650
but she's on the far left--

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.940
visited San Quentin prison.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.530
She's pictured here in
a photograph whose frame

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.400
was crafted by prisoners.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.200
Journalists reported that
Bernhardt became pals

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.040
with the convicts, one of
whom recited a speech praising

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.940
her wondrous personality and
entrancing art from liberating

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.400
the prisoners' souls and minds.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.580
A month later, the star
published an article

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.730
in The Boston Globe,
making an impassioned plea

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.880
to abolish the death penalty.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.430
Our fascination with the
private lives of celebrities

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.910
also has a longer history
than we might expect.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.280
Stalkers have long existed.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.260
Actress Sarah
Siddons, for example,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.120
complained of strangers
forcing their way

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.650
into her London drawing room.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:34.340
Figures as different as Queen
Victoria and the local poet

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.250
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
allowed photographers

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.970
to take, publish,
and sell photographs

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.850
of them with their families.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.790
Fan mail, too, is as
old as the cheap postage

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.190
rates that first democratized
the males in 1830s England

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.640
and 1840s United States.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.400
When sending letters
became more affordable,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.860
celebrities found themselves
deluged with requests

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.790
for autographs.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.020
At one point, Longfellow
received 400 of these a week.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.890
Actor Edwin Booth, the most
renowned Shakespearean actor

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.250
in the United States of his
day and brother of John Wilkes

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.280
Booth, received hundreds
of letters begging him

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.776
for photographs, free books,
shoelaces, and locks of hair.

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:18.550
[FAINT LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.300
Shoelaces-- and I've seen them--

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.860
not the shoelaces, but the
letters asking for them.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.020
Some correspondents
also sent him gifts--

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.790
books, flowers, religious
tracts, medical advice.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.950
Men asked for jobs and
free acting lessons.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.580
Women, such as the
Boston correspondent

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.780
whose letter is pictured
here proposed assignations.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.320
Before moving on to ask why
celebrity culture took off

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.840
when it did in the
1940s, I'd like

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.380
to ask you to help me strengthen
my claim about celebrity

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.940
culture's 19th-century
affinities by challenging it.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.940
So this one, I'm going
to give you a little more

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.110
time because it's a
lot more complicated.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.500
So, "What elements of
recent celebrity culture

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.050
would you argue are actually
unique to the present?"

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.390
OK, so feel free to
continue writing.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.940
And of course, you might
have a brainwave later,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.950
and you can add to your answer.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.080
So why did modern
celebrity culture

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.880
explode in the mid-19th century?

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.340
Many reasons.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.670
To begin with, the rise
of democratic movements

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.610
in England, France, and the
United States in the 1820s

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.630
and 1830s transformed how
individuals and collectives

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.400
imagined themselves.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.160
Those movements played out
differently in each country,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.620
but in each case
democratization made

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.880
people eager to track current
events that they saw themselves

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.530
as shaping.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.560
Literacy increased, extending
the number of people

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.870
able to read about celebrities.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.200
Leisure expanded, affording
more people more time

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.500
to visit theaters, opera
houses, and lyceums, where

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.530
they saw celebrities in person.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.840
As many cultural
historians have noted,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.760
this period in Europe
and the United States

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.660
also gave rise to a new
emphasis on individuality.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.970
The 19th century
began by ushering

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.150
in a romantic cult
of genius, epitomized

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.460
by our previous
acquaintance, Lord Byron,

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.550
and ended by worshipping
the notion of personality,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.980
epitomized by Oscar Wilde.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.180
Indeed, in 1911, one could find
a theater producer explicitly

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.080
speculating that the star system
loomed so large in the United

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.140
States because Americans
were what he called

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.590
"an individual-loving people."

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.980
Catering to this
interest in individuals

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.900
was the burgeoning
commerce in photographs.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.380
Around the 1860s, affordable
celebrity portraits

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.700
became widely available in
shops and via mail order.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.550
In the 1890s,
heavily-illustrated niche

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.840
magazines devoted to stage
stars began to flourish--

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.870
here is an image drawn
from one of them--

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.930
anticipating the
film magazines that

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.210
first took off in the 1910s.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.800
Around the same time
that there began

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.400
to be a new value
assigned to individuality,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.550
important transformations
in the newspaper industry

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.680
encouraged publishers
to increase

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.990
their coverage of celebrities.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.750
Until the 1830s, most
newspapers in England, France,

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.440
and the United States
were costly publications,

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.350
sponsored by wealthy
patrons and read

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.870
by a small, select
group of subscribers,

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.480
who received their
papers through the mails.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.180
Starting in the 1830s,
however, newspapers

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.570
became more commercial, with
entrepreneurs in all three

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.260
nations producing papers that
cost only a penny instead

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.050
of the traditional $0.06.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.710
Newspapers began to rely on
advertisements, subscriptions,

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.950
and daily sales,
including street sales.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.500
Instead of targeting a
select group of insiders

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.770
willing to pay a high price
for privileged, specialized

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.230
information,
newspaper publishers

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.950
began to do a volume business.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.420
And so they had to appeal to
general interests in an effort

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.420
to reach the largest number
of customers possible.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.530
As the number of
commercial papers grew,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.740
competition for
readers increased.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.440
More than influencing
and leading the public,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.380
the commercial press
needed to please it.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.109
Addressing journalism
students in 1912,

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.860
a newspaper man explained,
"In publishing a newspaper,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.010
you endeavor to print what
the people want to read."

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.740
The people wanted to
read about celebrities.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.780
An 1855 issue of the Illustrated
London News, pictured here,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.260
featured what the caption refers
to as "chess celebrities."

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.170
So micro-celebrities have been
around for a long time, too.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.450
An 1862 issue of the
Illustrated London News covering

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.870
a royal marriage
sold 930,000 copies,

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:57.870
which was more than three times
the paper's usual circulation

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.950
rate.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.950
Articles about celebrities,
especially when illustrated

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.630
with lithographs
and engravings--

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.120
it wasn't really possible
to incorporate photographs

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.370
into newspapers
until the 1890s--

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.580
became a reliable way
to boost circulation.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.130
In turn, celebrities
themselves began

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.800
to focus on newspapers
as important organs

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.680
of communication, even
arguing with editors

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.820
about their coverage.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.110
The actress Sarah Bernhardt,
who you saw earlier,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.350
and who is one of the
focal points of my book,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.840
was a ceaseless writer
of letters to the editor,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.120
complaining about her
coverage, contesting

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.030
the facts of a story published
the previous day, which

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.460
of course was a great
way to make the story

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.520
have a new lease on life
for a few more days.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.540
In 1829, two popular
London actors

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.310
sent letters to a
newspaper addressed

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.430
to the public, in which
they accused that newspaper

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.560
of misrepresenting them.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.270
The editor published
those letters

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.870
to demonstrate his fairness,
to avoid a libel suit,

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.800
but also because the actors
protesting their coverage

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.380
were leading figures in London's
theater scene and celebrity

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.590
sells.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.500
At the very moment
that newspapers first

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.710
came to depend on large
publics for their success,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.680
technological changes
were making those publics

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.020
larger than ever before.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.870
Some figures, to give you a
sense of the shifting scale

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.860
of the newspaper-reading public
across the 19th century--

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.860
in the 1820s, one of the
best-selling Parisian

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.930
newspapers of the moment
had 16,000 subscribers.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.820
By 1865, the
best-selling Paris Daily

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.310
was selling more than
250,000 copies a day.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.660
15 years later, that number
had more than doubled.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.850
Another technological
development that was important

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.740
was in transportation.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.590
Steamships and railways
delivered publications

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.210
to readers around
the world with what

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.670
was then unprecedented speed.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.090
By the 1860s, transoceanic
telegraph cables

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.930
enabled news to travel around
the world instantaneously--

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.220
or close to it.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.610
An actress could, as Sarah
Bernhardt did in 1882,

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.940
get married in London
one day and have

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.910
the news reported in Paris,
Rio de Janeiro, and Chattanooga

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.890
within a week.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.650
Beginning in the 1840s,
steamships and railways

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.130
also began to deliver
celebrities themselves.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.820
In 1840, Austrian ballet
dancer Fanny Elssler

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.860
visited the United States.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.950
The next year, a
steamship named after

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.230
the celebrated ballerina--
the Fanny Elssler--

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.630
was plying the Atlantic.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.080
The ship familiarized the
world with a celebrity dancer

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.740
in person, and in turn,
the celebrity dancer's name

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.140
helped to familiarize the
world with what was then

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.230
a novel form of transportation.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.620
Authors and activists also
took advantage of the new modes

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.010
of travel, with many crossing
the Atlantic to conduct

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.160
readings and deliver lectures
that were the 19th-century

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.800
versions of today's TED Talks--

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.890
British author Charles
Dickens, on the left,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.780
visited the United
States in 1842.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.990
In 1845, abolitionist Frederick
Douglas, on the right,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.020
spent over a year in England.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.050
Three decades later,
extensive railway networks

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.310
enabled celebrities to visit not
only a nation's major cities,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.360
but also its obscure
nooks and crannies.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.300
In the 1870s and 1880s,
actor Edwin Booth,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.810
whom you saw earlier, toured
with Polish actress Helena

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.980
Modjeska.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.440
And they performed in
world theater capitals--

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.400
Paris, London, Berlin,
Warsaw, and New York.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.780
But they also
visited small towns,

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:39.560
ranging from Davenport,
Iowa to Zanesville, Ohio,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.170
with stops in larger cities,
such as Indianapolis.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.630
A poster for one of their
Indianapolis performances

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.670
is pictured here.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.540
During one 1887 to
'88 tour, Edwin Booth

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.840
appeared in 72 towns.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.060
Performers spent so
much time touring,

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.090
that actor Maude Adams-- you
saw her before with her long,

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.800
red hair, but she also played
a lot of trouser roles--

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.890
had sliding scenery installed
on her customized train car

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.500
so that she and her troupe
could rehearse while traveling.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.730
The 19th century's
most renowned figures

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.940
garnered kudos because
they had talent, ambition,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.240
and understood how to capture
the public imagination.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.550
But had they not come
of age in an era that

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.180
invented cheap postage
rates, photography, the penny

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.760
press, telegraphic news
agencies, and steam and train

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.720
travel, they never would have
become global celebrities.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.580
Because without
those developments,

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.660
global celebrity culture
would not have existed.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.550
Until I began the
research for this book,

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.300
I thought-- as many still do--
that the film industry invented

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.220
modern celebrity culture.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.800
But in fact, the
Hollywood studio system

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.470
was more of an
exception than the rule.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.920
Far from creating
the star system,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.030
20th-century movie
studios simply

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.900
adapted one that the theater
had invented decades earlier.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.810
A global star system
had already existed

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.970
in theater in the 19th century.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.700
Indeed, "star" was
a 19th century term,

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.550
coined in English, along
with "étoile" and "vedette"

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.060
in French, to designate a
theatrical troupe's most

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.550
compelling lead actors.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.740
As a young, middle-class
woman living in Glasgow

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.150
announced in 1855, "Unless there
is some star in the theater,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.720
we do not go."

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.870
Plus ca change.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.090
And though we may now
think of live theater

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.970
as a niche form
of entertainment,

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.260
before the advent
of film theater

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.510
reached millions annually.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.410
In 1865, London shows attracted
almost 12 million viewers

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.520
a year.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.020
In 1905, New York City alone
had 18 million theatergoers.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.900
And Chicago newspapers would
publish articles claiming that

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.810
their theater scene was even
more lively and vibrant than

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.250
New York's.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.680
Theatrical culture
it was also global.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.180
A play might open in London then
tour the entire United States,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.390
or start out in Paris and then
be adapted for performance

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.640
in Berlin, Stockholm,
and New York.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.220
Not surprisingly, given
the depth and breadth

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.530
of the theatrical
celebrity system,

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.340
early film producers used
established stage stars

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.275
to lure people to the
new medium of cinema.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.510
The famous 1896 Thomas Edison
film now known as The Kiss

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.930
was originally billed
as The May Irwin Kiss

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.690
because it featured
well-known theater star May

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:35.160
Irwin in a popular scene from
her play, The Widow Jones.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.520
The very term "movie star" arose
because stars were presumed

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.830
to belong to the theater.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.120
Many of the most famous
early film producers,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.480
directors, and performers,
from Lillian Gish to Barbara

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.120
Stanwyck, started on the
stage and often continued

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.740
to shuttle between
Hollywood and Broadway.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.190
Eventually however, Hollywood
did, for a few decades,

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.970
change celebrity culture in
at least one important way.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.180
In the 19th century, the
biggest stage celebrities

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.030
exercised significant autonomy.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.980
They had the power to choose
their roles in most cases,

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.070
unless they belonged to a
national theater troupe,

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.050
but those were the exception.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.880
They could control
their schedules.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.770
They could select
supporting cast.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.860
They designed costumes and sets.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.820
The leased and managed theaters.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.490
And they crafted
their public persona.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.670
Now, were a few important movie
stars, such as Carole Lombard

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.960
and James Stewart--

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.000
James Stewart, who
started in theater--

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.130
were freelancers
who retained some

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.180
of the independence enjoyed by
their theatrical predecessors.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.450
But in most cases, at the
height of the Hollywood era,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.590
film studio heads effectively
used restrictive contracts,

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.630
well-oiled publicity
departments,

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.550
and their influence
over the press

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.590
to control what
movie stars could do

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.290
and what the public
could learn about them.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.840
During the decades when-- and
these are some of the people

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.070
you see pictured here--

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.530
studio heads Louis B.
Mayer, the Warner Brothers,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.280
and Harry Cohn--

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.220
all notoriously dictatorial,
even abusive-- reigned supreme.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.880
Many stars received orders
about what roles to play,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.310
whom to date, how to dress.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.290
In exchange, they
received the support

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.740
of a powerful, integrated
entertainment industry.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.830
Those who balked, such as
Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.110
Marilyn Monroe, often
found themselves

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.350
subject to retaliation--
lawsuits, smear campaigns,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.690
and periods of unemployment.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.820
But the decline of
the film studios

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.450
in the 1960s, the breakdown
of broadcast television

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.330
that began in the 1980s,
and the rise of the internet

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.790
since the 1990s
have in many ways

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.570
returned celebrity culture
to its 19th-century roots.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.880
No single medium
or industry today

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.300
controls stars or stardom.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.420
So to recap, the answers to
the question, have celebrities

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.050
always existed or is there
something new about today's

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.550
celebrity culture--

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.290
modern celebrity
culture first began

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.980
to emerge in the 18th century
and exploded in the 19th.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.050
A few features of
celebrity culture

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.810
have changed since
the late 1700s.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.120
Everything moves
faster today and ways

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.420
of engaging with celebrities
that used to be more private--

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.460
sending a fan
letter, for example--

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.260
can now be much more public.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.110
If you tweet at Beyonce,
all of her followers

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.120
can see what you write.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.280
Throughout the 19th
century, celebrity

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.070
had more positive
connotations than it does now,

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.130
perhaps because a celebrity
then was as likely or more

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.270
likely to be a respected male
scientist, statesman, or artist

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.520
than a female performer.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.630
19th century celebrities also
had more autonomy and privacy

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.370
than mid-20th century stars.

00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:47.040
And in terms of privacy,
they had much more of it

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.050
in the 19th century than now.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.720
But in most other respects,
today's celebrity culture

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.440
remarkably resembles
that of 150 years ago.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.570
So if you don't like
celebrity culture,

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.970
don't blame the internet.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.100
The first part of my talk
is focused on the history

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.220
of celebrity culture.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.330
The last third--

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.030
I'm more than halfway through--

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.720
will offer a theory that aims
to answer the third question

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.340
I am so often asked--

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.780
why do so many people care so
much about celebrity culture?

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.630
But first, let me
pause to ask you,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.970
"Do you care about celebrities?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.290
Why or why not?"

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:31.410
Now, if you don't care about
or don't care for celebrities,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.960
you are in excellent company.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.200
Intellectuals love to
hate celebrity culture.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.770
Despite its popularity,
or perhaps because of it,

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.800
many of celebrity culture's
most widely cited scholars--

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.950
and you see here five of
the most widely-cited books

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.030
on celebrity--

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.850
view celebrities and
fans as trivial at best,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.950
pernicious at worst.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.130
Millions of people admire
and even envy stars,

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.290
but most pundits
dismiss celebrities

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.070
as empty [? ciphers, ?] famous
merely for being famous.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.730
Even scholars with a more
favorable view of celebrities,

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.680
such as Richard Dyer, whose
book, Stars, is not pictured

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.100
here, ultimately see
celebrities as reinforcing

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.640
the status quo, which in his
view, is not a good thing.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.370
While a few
commentators see fans

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.860
as helping to create
the celebrity culture

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.760
they consume--

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.070
Jackie Stacey and
Henry Jenkins have

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.980
been very important in
promoting that view--

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.380
most commentators tend
to envision publics

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.200
as either gullibly
imagining that they truly

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.760
know their idols or as cruelly
reveling in their downfalls.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.350
The ultimate villain
in this bleak tale

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:43.450
is almost always an
abstraction called "the media."

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.140
Theodore Adorno charged what he
called "the culture industry"

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.290
with promoting,
quote, "mass deception

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.800
and impeding the development
of autonomous, independent

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.630
individuals who judge and decide
consciously for themselves."

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.040
Strong words.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.490
By these lights, fans
are passive fools,

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.580
celebrities are deceptively
glamorous pawns,

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.400
media companies are
evil puppeteers,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.300
and celebrity culture is a
zero-sum game in which one

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.295
and only one party takes all.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.440
In the drama of celebrity,
I propose a different way

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.570
of understanding
celebrity culture.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.020
Instead of seeing it as a binary
contest in which one side has

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.580
all the power and
the other has none,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.380
I conceive of celebrity culture
as a triangular game involving

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.630
three equally powerful groups--

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.960
publics, media
producers and owners,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.840
and celebrities themselves,
who are surprisingly

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.350
absent from much of the
academic discussion of celebrity

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.651
culture.

00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:48.900
In a minute, I'm going to
give you a concrete example,

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.980
but bear with me as I lay
this out somewhat abstractly.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:56.390
In this articulation of how
celebrity culture works,

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.930
all three entities
compete and collude

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:03.140
to assign value and meaning
to renowned individuals

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.360
and to those who take
an interest in them.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.750
Sometimes this game ends up
reinforcing dominant values,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:12.500
as when a culture elevates a
figure such as Pat Boone, who

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.930
was a bit of a nut in
private, but his image

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.030
was extremely conformist.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.920
Often, however,
celebrity culture

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.880
privileges those who elude
constraints and defy norms.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.520
Here's Lady Gaga wearing a
dress made entirely of meat--

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.290
now preserved in the Rock &amp;
Roll Hall of Fame as a jerky--

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.460
I am not joking.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:31.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.340
And Sinead O'Connor,
many years ago,

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.690
tearing up a picture of
the Pope on live television

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:42.380
to protest the abuse
of children by people

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.630
in the Catholic church.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.600
In the game of
celebrity, all players--

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.610
and here we have them again--

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.270
have some power to form
and execute intentions,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.060
to express preferences
and pass judgments,

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.940
and to exercise
intelligence and initiative.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.750
Each of the three players can
create artful representations,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.210
interpret them, repurpose them.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:10.250
Most importantly, each requires
the others in order to play.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.010
Each can resist the others
or collaborate with them.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.410
And each can, at
least for a while,

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.590
influence, succumb to,
or dominate members

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.310
of the other two groups.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:25.300
So to take an example,
when thousands of people

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.360
gathered outside
Kensington Palace in 1997

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.360
to mourn Princess
Diana, they participated

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.430
in a media event that
was not simply being

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.760
staged for the public but also
being created by the public.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.000
The spontaneous gathering
of so many mourners

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.710
attracted reporters.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.600
Their coverage
attracted more members

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.000
of the public, who
were commoners seeking

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.280
to influence the
actions of the surviving

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.560
members of the royal family.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.570
For days after
Princess Diana died,

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.630
the media and public wondered
if Queen Elizabeth II

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.300
would appear to greet the
London crowds gathered

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.630
to mourn Princess Di.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.460
The contest to define the
meaning of Diana's death

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.810
came after a decades-long tussle
over who would define her life,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.150
itself a proxy for
debates about what

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.690
it meant to be a woman, a
mother, a wife, a member

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.420
of the elite, and,
most fundamentally,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.450
as is always the case with
celebrity, a human being worthy

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.520
of admiration.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.230
The participants
in those debates

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.960
included the many journalists
reporting on Diana,

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.420
often competing with
one another for access

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.550
to her and for the
public's interest

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.660
and attention, other
celebrities in Diana's orbit--

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.480
how many times has Elton John
played Candle in the Wind?

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.290
And ordinary people who
identified for diverse reasons

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.050
with the story of a very
privileged person who

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.380
nonetheless faced challenges
similar to their own.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.920
At the center of the struggle to
define the Princess stood Diana

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.040
herself, often credited
with being a savvy,

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.640
self-presenter who understood
contemporary media relations

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.820
far better than did other
members of the royal family,

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.850
whether using a 1980s
photo op to demonstrate

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.060
that it was safe to touch
people with AIDS or a television

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.239
interview to reveal that her
husband's infidelities had

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.900
preceded hers.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.719
Publics influence media
coverage by deciding

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.570
which media to consume
or not consume,

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:22.020
by sending letters to editors,
posting comments online,

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.659
or producing
old-fashioned applause.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.020
Some fans create their own
celebrity representations,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.469
but most content themselves
with collecting and arranging

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:35.070
materials produced by others,
as in these 19th-century

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.949
scrapbooks, hundreds
of which still

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.030
survive in theater archives and
represent a really interesting

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.120
way to recreate how
people in the past

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.969
interacted with newspapers
and magazines that

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:51.300
were, as we heard earlier,
covering celebrities

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.130
in great detail.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.920
Celebrities, too, vary
in the degree of control

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.440
that they can exert over their
self-presentation and careers.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.950
Some are content to let
photographers and journalists

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.260
define them, while
others excessively craft

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.560
their own persona and find
ways to connect directly

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.840
with readers and viewers.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.350
Media producers, journalists,
publicists, photographers,

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:16.320
publishers, executives
can position themselves

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.290
as fans, critics, or kingmakers.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.480
Some even become
celebrities themselves,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.700
as gossip columnist
Hedda Hopper and Walter

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.470
Winchell did in the middle
of the 20th century.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.040
To the extent that media outlets
and platforms themselves also

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.980
seek to become iconic
brands and acquire

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.380
large, loyal
followings, they do not

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.500
function so very differently
from celebrities,

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.010
in addition to using celebrities
to publicize themselves.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.800
New media formats,
from sound recordings,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.500
to television, to
digital social media,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.290
have long marketed
themselves by forging links

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.360
with established
celebrities who have already

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.870
made a name for themselves,
using older media forms.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.170
Photography, as we saw
earlier, first became popular

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.060
when commercial
studios began to sell

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.570
images of celebrity royals,
politicians, and performers,

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:09.300
who had already been rendered
familiar to the public

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.310
through press coverage.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.270
In the 1890s, companies
selling newfangled phonographic

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.810
cylinders-- and a label
from one is pictured here--

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.980
used celebrities to promote
their novel product.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.830
Early short film similarly
attracted audiences

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:29.700
by portraying famous royals,
politicians, and stage actors.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.730
Television at its inception
featured stars from the radio.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.220
In the 21st century,
digital platforms

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.970
such as Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and Tumblr each

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.350
expanded astronomically when pop
stars such as Lady Gaga, Katy

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.370
Perry, Beyonce, Adele,
Rihanna, and Taylor Swift

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.440
began to use them.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.680
Other celebrities, from Ashton
Kutcher to Donald Trump,

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.470
were drawn to Twitter because
the relatively new media

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.230
platform helped them to
bypass those standing

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.330
guard at older ones.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:05.510
During the 2016
presidential campaign,

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.330
many rightfully decried
the free publicity

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.060
that television and
the press gave Trump,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.510
but the game of celebrity is
not that simple with established

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.630
gatekeepers exercising
top-down control over who

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.280
and what they cover.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.640
Far from simply using their
platforms to advertise Trump,

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.330
news outlets were using Trump
to advertise themselves.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.220
Faced with declining
circulations

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.740
the press latched
on to Trump's savvy

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.740
for galvanizing
public attention.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.800
Now my final
question for you is,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.730
if you can think of any
examples of celebrities publics

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.040
in the media either
competing or colluding?

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.090
So something where this
triangular dynamic is in play.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.330
And as you mull that over, let
me offer some final examples

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.010
that illustrate how
what I'm calling

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.380
"the drama of celebrity" works.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.110
While scholars often
assign absolute power

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.140
to the culture industry
to media companies,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.350
the biggest celebrities can
break a media company's stride

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.870
in quite significant ways.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.710
That is what pop singer
Taylor Swift did in 2015,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.310
when with one Tumblr post in
which she said, "we don't ask

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.570
you for free iPhones," she
forced Apple to pay royalties

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.750
to artists featured on
its new music platform--

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:26.460
not just to her,
but to all artists

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.830
featured on its
new music platform.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.020
Only a few weeks
ago, singer Rihanna

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.170
caused the shares of social
media platform Snapchat

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:38.010
to lose $800 million in
value in a single day

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:41.100
after she criticized the
app for creating a game that

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.830
had mocked her for having been
a victim of intimate partner

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.120
violence.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.240
Rihanna affected this
by taking to Instagram

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.940
to protest Snapchat
and to encourage her

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.860
over 60 million followers to
discard and delete the app.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.050
Many discussions of
celebrity culture

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.270
assume that journalists
and editors alone

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.330
decide who gets free publicity
and what kind of publicity

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.560
that will be.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.190
But celebrities can also quite
successfully conceal facts

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.980
from the public or spin
them for the media.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.050
Joan Crawford, for
example, successfully

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.980
posed as a doting
mother for decades.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.120
She was exposed as being
something other than that

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.090
by her daughter, and she went
the old-fashioned route--

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.410
a book.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.340
Nor are members of the public
uniformly passive consumers.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.990
Some are cynical
about celebrities,

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.910
while others push
back against the press

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:34.530
as did the armies of "Beliebers"
who stood ready in 2016

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:37.080
to defend pop singer
Justin Bieber against even

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.410
the mildest criticism,
only to turn against Bieber

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.370
himself soon after.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.310
All of these examples suggest
that we care about celebrity

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.610
culture not simply because we
are interested in celebrities

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.220
themselves, but because
celebrity culture

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.190
is a suspenseful,
interactive drama in which we

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.710
ourselves play a leading role.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.960
Because publics,
media, and celebrities

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.660
all have considerable
power, these contests

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.580
are very evenly matched.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.250
As a result, their outcomes
are not predictable.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.040
That unpredictability
lends celebrity the drama

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.560
that keeps millions engaged.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.990
Adding to the drama of
celebrity is the fact

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.260
that each of the three
players constitutes a diverse

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.555
and internally fractious group.

00:40:20.555 --> 00:40:24.980
The media proliferate and borrow
from one another, compete.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.100
Celebrities are a varied
lot, ranging from micro-stars

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.730
with 50,000 Instagram followers
to superstars like Rihanna,

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:37.760
who, in 2017, had over 84
million Twitter followers.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.750
Some celebrities joined forces,
as film stars Charlie Chaplin,

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.030
Mary Pickford, Douglas
Fairbanks, and director

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:48.500
DW Griffith did in 1919, when
they formed United Artists.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.040
Some celebrities compete
and get together,

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.150
as when great athletes
compete against one another

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.980
on different teams,
but then joining forces

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.010
on all-star teams, or when
actors Sarah Bernhardt

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.680
and Maude Adams
joined forces in 1991

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.160
to play the same role
on alternating nights.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:10.370
Stars can also change direction
and find their meanings

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:13.640
altered, as when America's
beloved First Lady Jackie

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.820
Kennedy morphed into America's
scarlet woman, Jackie O.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.040
Of the three players
in the triangular game

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.410
of creating celebrity
culture, the public

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.920
is the most complicated, which
is why I, like many scholars,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.970
consider it more accurate
to use the plural "publics."

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:32.830
Publics are dynamic,
heterogeneous,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.160
and unpredictable.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.510
They tend not to think
as one for very long.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.980
Fans can be fickle.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.140
Someone might gush about
a celebrity in one breath

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.120
and belittle them in the next.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.220
Subcultures peel off
from the mainstream

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.520
and abandon favorites when
they become too popular.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.690
Niche markets form.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.200
Die-hard fans argue amongst
themselves, often fiercely,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.400
about the best Billy Joel song
or who was the cutest Beatle.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.630
In 1964, US teenagers
voted for Ringo.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.020
It was in the newspaper,
so it must be true.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.350
The drama of celebrity
also derives from the fact

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:15.880
that publics are genuinely free
to ignore celebrity culture.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.160
Some of us may feel
like captive members

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.260
of an involuntary
public, flooded

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.870
with celebrity factoids
we'd prefer to ignore,

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.550
but we can opt out.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.380
And that ability is crucial.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.860
Celebrities cannot
exist without publics.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:34.010
But publics can and do
exist without celebrities.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.790
So to conclude,
celebrity results

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.770
from large numbers
of individuals

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.010
deciding which stars to
like, hate, or overlook.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.620
And usually the ways
in which publics

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:51.740
do that is mediated by
newspapers, film, and the list

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.050
goes on-- radio, the internet.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.240
Because each of those
many individuals

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.490
exercises idiosyncratic
taste, it's

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.760
not easy to predict how publics
will respond from one moment

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.050
to the next.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.030
Marketers and
entertainment industries

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:09.350
do not make stars, they
nominate candidates for stardom.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:11.870
As a journalist observed
over a century ago,

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:16.400
celebrities are elected
by the will of the people.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.560
To this day, publics enjoy
the drama of celebrity

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.070
because they are stakeholders,
not mere onlookers,

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.810
who care about the
outcome because they

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.210
help to determine it.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.970
The prevalent academic framework
for understanding celebrity

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:33.990
culture has been commodification
theory, which views only one

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.490
group as wielding power--

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.250
the capitalists who allegedly
manipulate the public

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.250
into thinking that stars
have special qualities,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.050
and who turn
celebrities into objects

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.590
for sale in order to extract
profits, and reinforce

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:49.640
dominant belief systems
and power structures.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.180
To this way of
thinking, celebrity

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.960
is an illusion or hoax that
critical thinkers must expose.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.520
And celebrity
culture offers only

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.730
two antagonistic
positions-- duper and duped,

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.944
faker and sucker.

00:44:01.944 --> 00:44:03.360
This view has been
around at least

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.410
since 1961, when Daniel
Boorstin defined a celebrity as,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.850
quote, "a person who is known
for his well-knownness."

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:15.630
So that's the original variant
on "famous for being famous."

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.730
Not variant--
that's the original,

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.390
and the rest is variance.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.600
Boorstin's phrase has acquired
an enviable fame of its own,

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.040
but as definitions go, it is
more catchy than accurate.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.870
Indeed, its own
popularity might be

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.580
one of the few
instances in which

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.630
its claim about celebrities'
lack of substance holds true.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:33.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:37.200
As a theory of celebrity, it is
steeped in the dualistic model.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.780
By Boorstin's [? light, ?]
public relations firms--

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.570
and he writes a lot about
them-- trick most people

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.480
into thinking that celebrities
merit our attention, when

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.360
in fact, they don't really
merit our attention.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.940
I would say that's
a strange claim.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.510
The Beatles, Madonna, Audrey
Hepburn, Muhammad Ali,

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.390
Steve Jobs, celebrities
all, and all

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:00.800
became celebrities because
they created memorable songs,

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.390
gave brilliant performances,
were exceptionally

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:06.510
beautiful and stylish, had
amazing athletic abilities,

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.370
invented something
important, and were

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.910
willing to work with the
media to turn themselves

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.250
into public icons.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.480
Various forms of manipulation,
from payola to promoted tweets,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.960
do often first push a celebrity,
or a would-be celebrity,

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.200
into the limelight, but
those who stay famous

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.800
usually remain so thanks to some
extraordinary talent, skill,

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.600
or achievement.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.140
To be sure, there are always
celebrities who in their day

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.510
were widely perceived as
famous only for being famous.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.360
That's an inevitable
part now of how

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.600
we think about celebrity
culture and experience it.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.210
Kim Kardashian's
19th-century forebearers

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.790
included the courtesan
known as Skittles,

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.550
pictured in the center,
and professional beauty,

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.140
Lillie Langtry.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.401
You can figure out who
Kim Kardashian is, so.

00:45:55.401 --> 00:45:55.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.710
Even these figures, however, fit
author Zadie Smith's definition

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:00.940
of an artist--

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.900
as someone with an expressive
talent that most of us

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.420
do not have.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.560
In Kardashian's
case, that talent

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.250
is a notable ability to promote
herself and her products.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.130
If anyone could do that,
everyone on YouTube

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.230
would be a millionaire.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.470
Many scholars have taken the
triviality attacked by Boorstin

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.190
to be definitive of celebrity,
but because the category

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:26.230
of celebrity
encompasses everyone

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.840
from Albert Einstein
to Paris Hilton,

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.570
I prefer the definition
with which I began--

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.180
celebrities are people
known during their lifetimes

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.216
to more people than could
possibly know one another.

00:46:37.216 --> 00:46:38.590
The biggest
celebrities are those

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:40.420
known to the largest
numbers of people,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.550
for the longest periods of time.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.730
And their history holds the key
to a new and improved theory

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.650
of celebrity culture.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.240
Celebrity results
from large numbers

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.420
of individuals
deciding which figures

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.160
to like, hate, or overlook.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.210
Publics enjoy the
drama of celebrity

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.990
as participants,
not mere onlookers.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.050
Members of the public who care
about the drama of celebrity--

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:03.430
and millions do--

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.220
care because that drama
establishes channels

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.490
that link publics, media
producers, and celebrities

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.340
themselves, all of
whom work together

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.585
to create the drama of celebrity
