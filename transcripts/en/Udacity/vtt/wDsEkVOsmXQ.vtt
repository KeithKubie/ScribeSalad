00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.850
As an entrepreneur when you're
looking at your product and

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.300
you're trying to determine whether
an MVP is good enough, and

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.980
whether you have to reach your product
perfection before you can go out to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.480
customers, some of this depends on
what customers you initially go after.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.460
And as an entrepreneur,
part of being an entrepreneur is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.020
maybe selecting the right
customers out of the gate.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.540
Can you find customers who are willing
to take something that's not

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.420
quite finished and
provide valuable feedback?

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.780
Are they willing to take something and
incorporate it into their business?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.150
Those are the first
customers that you want.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.170
Because some customers on
the other hand might tell you,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.790
we don't want to try this or use it in
our business until it's completely done

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.580
and it's out in the marketplace.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.620
And if those are your
initial set of customers,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.110
then the bar is too high
before you can get feedback.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.070
And so part of figuring out what that
MVP is, is actually figuring out who

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360
your first customers are and selecting
the right set of first customers.
