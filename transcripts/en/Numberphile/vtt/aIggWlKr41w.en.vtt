00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.890
SIMON PAMPENA: The point about
points is that our idea of

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.650
points, like when we go
like this, we go,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.300
here's my point, 3.5.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm going to move
it over here.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.720
Here's 3.5, right?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.290
That's wrong.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.650
That's not 3.5.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.280
If that was really 3.5,
we wouldn't be

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.350
able to see a thing.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.790
A point is not a small
tiny circle.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.520
That's just a representation.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.810
And what it does is it gives
us the wrong sense of how

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.710
things are.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.540
Like if you remove a point,
OK, and if it was, in your

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.280
mind, of a ruler, you should be
able to hold it up to the

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.960
sun and see a little bit of
sunlight shine through.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.870
But that's wrong.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.630
It's impossible.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.740
Because if that was the case,
we'd be removing a little bit

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.530
of length, and then we
wouldn't have one.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.390
So this is pushing our notions
of what maths is, which

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.485
is why I love it.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.162
I love this stuff.

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:54.020
BRADY HARAN: But your whole
premise, your discussion here

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.290
is how do we measure numbers.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.001
SIMON PAMPENA: Yeah.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.444
BRADY HARAN: Who wants
to measure numbers?

00:00:57.444 --> 00:01:01.050
Who said numbers were measurable
in the first place?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990
Why is this a problem for you?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.030
SIMON PAMPENA: Why is
this a problem?

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.650
BRADY HARAN: You don't
measure numbers.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.010
Numbers are--

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.020
SIMON PAMPENA: Why this
is a problem?

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.180
BRADY HARAN: Numbers are what
you do the measuring with.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.150
SIMON PAMPENA: Why is
this a problem?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.040
Because we are using stuff
that we haven't proved.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.460
We're using naive notions
of measure.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.530
That's why that's a problem.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.270
We're making assumptions.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.980
This almost broke maths, where
I'm going with this.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.350
It almost broke maths.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.860
And that sounds like I'm being
really full-on, but it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530
absolutely true.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.850
And I know I'm going to be able
to show you the exact

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.160
reason why it almost
broke maths.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.720
But what I'm talking about here,
I can tell you right now

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.870
what this led to.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.820
This led to the computer,
what I'm talking about.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.190
The hair's standing up in the
back of my neck when I talk

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.940
about this.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.500
That's how exciting this is.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.920
It's so exciting that people
started going, oh, I know how

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.620
to measure.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.240
You take one.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.080
You take the final.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.970
You take the initial.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.300
Sure.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.870
That's all right.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.620
Well, what happens when
you remove points?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.500
What happens when you remove an
infinite number of points?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.190
Let's just think about
it like this.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.640
Let's go from 0 to 12.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.060
So the length of that is 12.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.690
So 12 take 0 is 12.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.120
That's the length.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.945
So then I'm going to wrap
it around a clock face.

00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:14.340
Whoops.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.280
That's not a very good clock.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.960
It's more like an egg.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.110
So there's 12 there, 9, OK?

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.960
And the reason why I'm going
to show you this is because

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.410
now I'm going to mark
out every fraction.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.270
So it's almost like every single
way that you could

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.760
divide up time in a way that
would be sensible.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm actually going to put holes,
tiny little holes all

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.880
around the clock face.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.640
Now, this is where I'm hopefully
going to break your

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.140
brain, because now I've removed
every single fraction

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.050
on the segment of
the number line.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.280
And the fact that I've made
it 12 doesn't matter.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.990
What's the length of
this line now?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.520
Remember, the real number line
contains numbers other than

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.220
fractions because most of
the real number line are

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.710
transcendental numbers.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.020
What's kind of crazy is that in
this case, though, between

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.640
any two fractions, so between
any two fractions, so let's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.300
just say here between 0 and 1,
you have removed 1/2, yeah?

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.880
But you've also removed 1/4, and
1/8, and 1/16, and a 32th.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.510
Rah, rah, rah.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.700
It keeps going do, do, do, do,
do, do, all the way down.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.110
So between any two fractions
is another fraction, and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.570
between any two fractions
is another fraction.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.540
So in maths, they
call it dense.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.770
It's dense with numbers.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.170
So it should make you feel a
little bit uneasy that you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.790
might be making a mistake.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.040
What we can play with is how
many points there are.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.850
So what you can do is you can
count out all the numbers.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.980
This is a fraction here.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.140
So you could go-- it's this
on this, whatever it is.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.050
So that's 2 on 1.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.980
This is 2 on 2.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.910
This is 2 on 3.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.740
This is 2 on 4, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.000
So each point represents
a fraction.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.490
And you've kind of covered every
single possible fraction

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.840
that there is, right?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.580
And what we're trying to do is
we're trying to show that

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.970
this, all the fractions, are
countable or listable.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.180
So this is the really
great thing.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.770
And what you do is you
draw this snake.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.100
So you draw the snake like so.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.480
And you draw it like that.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.260
And you're basically going,
I can create a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.720
list of all the fractions.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.550
If we know that we can list all
these points, let's make a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.300
list of them.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.630
So let's talk about
all the fractions.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.640
Let's call it F, all the
fractions between 0 and 12.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.680
So 1/2 will be in there.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.530
2/3 will be in there.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.540
4/3 will be in there,
whatever.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.750
If that's listable,
let's measure the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.570
length of all of them.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.860
So the length, what's
the length of 1/2?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.660
Well, that's 0.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.790
What's the length of 2/3?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.610
Well, that's 0.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.510
What's the length of 4/3?

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.310
Well, that's 0.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.680
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.440
So I've got an infinite
sum of 0.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.790
So 0 added to itself infinitely
many times?

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.040
0.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.450
So it's because of the number,
in a sense, the number, even

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.400
though it's infinite, and
infinite really isn't a

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.800
number, but the fact that the
type of infinite it is--

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.850
a countable infinite,
and it's listable--

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.920
means that if we remove a
countable number of points, a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.760
listable number of points, we
haven't changed the length

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.390
because the length of all those
points have to be 0.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.030
BRADY HARAN: If I remove
your feelings--

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.290
SIMON PAMPENA: Yeah?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.480
BRADY HARAN: --your
size won't change.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.800
Just like if I remove the
numbers, the infinitely small,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.610
abstract numbers from a line,
the length of the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.110
line doesn't change.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.830
Numbers don't have volume or
size, because they're just an

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.700
abstract thing.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.120
They're a describing word.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.660
Are we starting to come towards
philosophy here?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.830
SIMON PAMPENA: No.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.540
I'm just a bit weirded out by
you removing my feelings.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.750
Without my feelings,
I can't do maths.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.100
Because it's all
very emotional.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.780
See, this is the thing, is that
you're putting a nice

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.250
analogy on something when this
is already an analogy.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.970
The problem is that humans--

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.880
and mathematicians--

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.250
we are really analogizing.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.770
Even the maths that you see, in
a sense, it's an analogy.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.640
Just like how Roman numbers
was like-- they

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.570
thought they had it.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.360
They thought, yeah.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.170
We know numbers.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.480
They're never going to change.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.620
We're in charge.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.360
They're never going to change.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.780
And they've changed.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.720
And it's because there's
been a better way

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.500
to represent numbers.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.360
And I think what I love about
this is that we draw a line.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.610
Well, first of all, you
can't draw a line.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.560
It's impossible.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.480
It's just a very, very
thin rectangle.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.640
And you draw points.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.255
That's ridiculous.

00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:43.610
You can't draw points.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.440
But there you go.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.710
We draw points.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.980
And then suddenly, we go, oh,
I know what to do there.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.790
Because I know how
to use a ruler.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.600
You do final, take initial,
fantastic.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.910
Suddenly something make
sense in maths.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.250
[BUZZER NOISE]

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.970
It doesn't make sense.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.810
Suddenly, you're confronted with
these conundrums of like,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.190
what happens when I
take away a point?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.940
Well, nothing, because there is
no next point, like there

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.560
is no hole per se.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.330
And so, when you try thinking
about it, you actually have to

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.570
start questioning every
single assumption.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.470
And this is where
this led into an

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.270
analysis of set theory.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.810
What assumptions were
mathematicians

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.630
making about maths?

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.950
Very heavy questions.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.320
What mathematicians
were able to do--

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.265
should I go here?

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:35.780
OK, I'll go there.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.320
What mathematicians were able
to do, were able to create

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.190
sets of numbers that you
couldn't measure.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.920
And it was linked to these
kinds of ideas.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.440
So you're actually picking all--
the guy who did it was a

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.650
guy called Giuseppe Vitali.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.150
And he came up with this idea of
consider the solid segment

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.040
between 0 and 1 and consider
all the fractions.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.670
Then he considered every single
copy of that in 0 to 1.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.400
And what that means is it's
very complicated.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.430
It's called a partition.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.450
But basically, he found all
these different copies of it.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.480
Then he just took one point
from every single copy.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.630
And that set you could
not measure.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.120
There was no way you could
get a sensible answer.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.340
Getting 0 is a sensible
answer.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.160
This gave no sensible answer.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.000
It gave a contradiction.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.965
You look at it one way,
you get one answer.

00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:31.850
You look at it the other way,
you get a different answer.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.470
That's a problem.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.809
Because I thought I knew
how to measure.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.700
I thought I knew how
to use a ruler.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.640
I thought I knew maths.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.049
And this guy realized that there
were these sets that you

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.050
couldn't measure, and that
caused massive problems.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.910
Mathematicians were
very, very upset.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.790
The thing that I realized when I
studied this is that it made

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.100
me question what I knew
about numbers.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.070
So my life I see as a timeline
of discovery of numbers.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.120
Why not?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.275
I discovered numbers the way,
watching "Sesame Street" or

00:09:06.275 --> 00:09:09.250
whatever you do, and you get a
sense of, oh, yeah, one, two

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.560
fractions, you start getting
your head around these things.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.680
But suddenly, when you come to
the point where you think

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.910
about how numbers are related
and points and decimal

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.840
expansions, all that sort
of stuff, you start

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.730
going, wow, 3 is weird.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.410
I thought I knew 3, but
3 is very strange.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.890
The abstraction of these numbers
are very strange.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.250
And what it really drove me to
is to question everything.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.630
You have to question everything
in maths.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.410
There's so much that we bring
in from the outside world,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.590
which just gives you
the wrong idea.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.570
We thought we knew
measure because

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.350
measurement was about numbers.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.630
So a ruler, you could
go, there's a ruler.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.360
There a real ruler.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.120
There's a mathematical ruler.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.240
It looks like a ruler.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.980
Surely I can't go
wrong with this.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.640
But what you can do, the sorts
of sets that you can make, the

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.990
removal of points, you're really
doing things there's no

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.950
way you could do in reality,
no way at all

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.810
you could do in reality.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:12.790
So this is the stuff.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.880
And then exploring
these things,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.220
that's what really gets--

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.900
I mean, people actually started
to question reasoning

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.900
out of this, how we reason.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.570
And it actually did lead
to the computer.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.420
It actually led--

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.700
Alan Turing was the guy who was
trying to reformulate some

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.710
of the questions that
came out of this.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.010
He started reformulating
Kurt Godel's work.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.540
And out of that came the Turing
machine, which is, for

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.920
all intents and purposes,
the first computer.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.790
It might not be exactly.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.470
But anyway, he's the guy
who came up with it.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.970
And now we're just
trying to think.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.360
Now we're trying to go,
how do you think?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.420
What are the assumptions
we make?

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.110
So yeah, so for me, this was
the crowning glory of my

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.000
mathematical education, was
really getting to the bottom

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.510
of like if I was a musician,
it was like, what is music?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.580
What is it?

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.520
Why does it make you
feel a certain way?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.850
BRADY HARAN: But it sounds like
your conclusion is, we

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.500
don't know.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.430
SIMON PAMPENA: What
don't we know?

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.680
BRADY HARAN: What numbers are.

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:25.700
SIMON PAMPENA: I would love that
because I I'm assuming

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.100
it's going to be completely
incomprehensible to me.
