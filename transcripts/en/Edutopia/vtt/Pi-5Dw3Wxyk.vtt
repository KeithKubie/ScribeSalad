00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:02.746
&gt;&gt;Student: More and more
people are coming out.

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:05.466
And then more and more people are
becoming accepting of LGBT rights.

00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.546
&gt;&gt;Soljane: If you are
personally connected to an issue,

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:12.556
might that make it harder or easier
for you to go to that other side?

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:15.966
&gt;&gt;Student: If you have been affected by
an issue and it's like really, really--

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.666
that made you who you are
today, I think it's really hard

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.506
to change your views on that.

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:22.616
&gt;&gt;Pedro: I think this
class has brung all

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.446
of the seniors together a little more.

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.376
It just taught us a lot in how
to get along with each other

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:29.856
and how to agree to disagree.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:38.696
&gt;&gt;Jessica: At Highlander,
we want students to be able

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.206
to look at something critically.

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.906
They need to know how to advocate
for themselves, but they also know

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:45.726
that they have to take
in various perspectives.

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:50.306
&gt;&gt;Soljane: Our students come with
these very firm ideas and beliefs

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:54.146
about certain topics, because it's
the only perspective they've known.

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.676
So, I really like to push
the envelope with them.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.826
&gt;&gt;Soljane: We're going to revisit
today some of those really tough issues

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.896
that we've looked at this year.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:04.256
&gt;&gt;Soljane: We've covered
things like abortion,

00:01:04.516 --> 00:01:09.116
sexual assault on college campuses,
immigration, presidential appointments.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.236
So, as the news has been happening

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:14.406
and our country's been
evolving, that's what we cover.

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:18.166
&gt;&gt;Alex: Today's class the main focus
was to see others' perspective.

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:22.036
That's a recurring problem in the
United States where we are too divided

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:23.706
and we don't listen to the other side.

00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:26.226
&gt;&gt;Soljane: You know, it's really
an important skill for you to have,

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.696
looking at things from the point of view
of someone who has a different opinion.

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:32.826
It's not a wrong versus right.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.076
It's a "Well, you know, what?

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:36.646
Let me take a step over to your side."

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:41.216
&gt;&gt;Pedro: Prior to this I honestly wasn't
interested at all in any current events.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:44.656
I could care less about
the news or anything,

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:47.736
but ever since this class
it made me more aware of,

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:49.926
like, what's going on around me.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:51.126
&gt;&gt;Soljane: How many of
you are thinking you'd

00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:52.576
like to revisit community police divide?

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:54.396
Poverty blame game?

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.066
And the LGBT debate?

00:01:57.486 --> 00:02:00.576
So, you'll have ten minutes to review
any of the resources for your topic.

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:03.286
&gt;&gt;Pedro: First, we learned
background information.

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:07.696
&gt;&gt;Pedro: Blacks are twenty-four-point
one percent-- that's the poverty rate.

00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:10.506
And Hispanics are twenty-one-point five.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:13.656
&gt;&gt;Alex: And mostly we have
discussions to see where we stand

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:15.726
and we share our ideas and opinions.

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.666
&gt;&gt;Student: I put that
it's not their fault.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:19.506
It's how they grew up.

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:21.786
&gt;&gt;Pedro: And we kind of debate and try

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:23.966
and play devil's advocate
for both sides.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:28.556
&gt;&gt;Pedro: I don't agree with that,
because there's a bunch of Hispanics

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:32.296
that are not poor and they chose
to make the change in their life

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:34.466
to get them out of the poverty.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:38.516
&gt;&gt;Student: For a long time, LGBT groups
have been attacked by religious groups.

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:41.146
I think there has been a lot of
laws that, like, discriminate.

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:45.286
Like, because you're a trans, don't go
use that-- the bathroom that, you know--

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:48.876
&gt;&gt;Kadeem: I'm from a
very homophobic country.

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:51.726
LGBT persons are usually
being discriminated against.

00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:57.706
So, now I see the need to fit myself
in their shoe and also accept them.

00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:01.706
&gt;&gt;Soljane: I wanted to take a few
minutes to maybe debrief this process.

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:02.876
What was this like for you?

00:03:02.876 --> 00:03:05.746
Where is another place you might
potentially be able to apply this?

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:10.056
&gt;&gt;Alex: I believe that we can apply
this in the real world right now,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:14.566
because in America I feel like we pretty
much block what we think is wrong.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:18.566
&gt;&gt;Alex: What I have learned in class
has prepared me to talk to new people

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.696
and maybe people that I disagree with.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.536
Maybe you can educate them, maybe
you can do your research and see

00:03:25.536 --> 00:03:26.826
if what they're saying is right.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.186
&gt;&gt;Soljane: I just really
want them to have, like,

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:31.716
a tool belt when they
go into the real world.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.936
&gt;&gt;Soljane: The fact that you were
at least willing to step outside

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.396
of your comfort zone and
listen and acknowledge people--

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:40.496
&gt;&gt;Soljane: It's all about your
ability to present yourself in a way

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:44.326
that people will be receptive to what
you want to say, even if it's something

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:45.086
that they don't agree with.

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:47.696
&gt;&gt;Pedro: If you learned how
to argue your point and listen

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:51.196
to another person's point without
completely shutting them out,

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.566
you can get where that
person is coming from.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.976
That's what makes us the strongest.
