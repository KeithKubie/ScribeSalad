it's not that bad

it's not that bad
well<00:03:19.519><c> I</c><00:03:19.549><c> guess</c><00:03:19.819><c> I</c><00:03:19.970><c> can</c><00:03:20.180><c> do</c><00:03:20.329><c> it</c><00:03:20.540><c> it's</c><00:03:20.810><c> like</c><00:03:20.989><c> an</c>

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 align:start position:0%
well I guess I can do it it's like an
 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.900 align:start position:0%
well I guess I can do it it's like an
