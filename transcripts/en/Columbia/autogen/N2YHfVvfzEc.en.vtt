just the thing for you it's a little

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:25.929 align:start position:0%
thing about the size of a matchbox and
 

00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:29.369 align:start position:0%
thing about the size of a matchbox and
it's<00:13:26.589><c> extremely</c><00:13:27.249><c> accurate</c><00:13:27.939><c> it's</c><00:13:28.179><c> runners</c><00:13:29.050><c> and</c>

00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:29.379 align:start position:0%
it's extremely accurate it's runners and
 

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:32.609 align:start position:0%
it's extremely accurate it's runners and
bicyclists<00:13:29.920><c> use</c><00:13:30.339><c> it</c><00:13:30.579><c> for</c><00:13:31.179><c> for</c><00:13:31.660><c> timing</c>

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:32.619 align:start position:0%
bicyclists use it for for timing
 

00:13:32.619 --> 00:13:35.309 align:start position:0%
bicyclists use it for for timing
themselves<00:13:33.249><c> and</c><00:13:33.399><c> so</c><00:13:34.119><c> we</c><00:13:34.300><c> got</c><00:13:34.449><c> that</c><00:13:34.689><c> one</c>

00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:35.319 align:start position:0%

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:36.629 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:39.790 align:start position:0%
that and and and so that's we set out to
 

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.929 align:start position:0%
that and and and so that's we set out to

we could do about that we just had to
 

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:23.250 align:start position:0%
we could do about that we just had to

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:23.260 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to fix it so that we
 

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.049 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to fix it so that we

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:25.059 align:start position:0%
got really true and accurate numbers and
 

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:27.029 align:start position:0%
got really true and accurate numbers and
and<00:17:25.569><c> that's</c><00:17:25.750><c> that's</c><00:17:26.049><c> what</c><00:17:26.289><c> it</c><00:17:26.409><c> looks</c><00:17:26.589><c> like</c><00:17:26.740><c> in</c>

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%

one<00:17:30.190><c> plaza</c><00:17:30.549><c> to</c><00:17:30.850><c> that's</c><00:17:31.149><c> a</c><00:17:31.240><c> start</c><00:17:31.570><c> and</c><00:17:31.779><c> stop</c><00:17:32.049><c> and</c>

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:32.380 align:start position:0%
one plaza to that's a start and stop and
 

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.529 align:start position:0%
one plaza to that's a start and stop and
then<00:17:32.980><c> the</c><00:17:33.130><c> distance</c><00:17:33.580><c> and</c><00:17:33.820><c> then</c><00:17:34.090><c> the</c><00:17:34.299><c> speed</c>

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:34.539 align:start position:0%
then the distance and then the speed
 

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:36.750 align:start position:0%
then the distance and then the speed
calculation<00:17:35.260><c> so</c><00:17:35.500><c> you</c><00:17:35.559><c> had</c><00:17:35.679><c> a</c><00:17:35.710><c> million</c><00:17:36.010><c> 4</c>

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
calculation so you had a million 4
 

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.430 align:start position:0%

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
million records like it ended up for
basically<00:17:39.100><c> when</c><00:17:39.370><c> I</c><00:17:39.399><c> say</c><00:17:39.610><c> false</c><00:17:39.880><c> reading</c><00:17:40.270><c> sort</c>

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:40.510 align:start position:0%

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.450 align:start position:0%
basically when I say false reading sort
of<00:17:40.570><c> like</c><00:17:40.690><c> a</c><00:17:40.720><c> house</c><00:17:40.960><c> of</c><00:17:41.140><c> mirrors</c><00:17:41.590><c> when</c><00:17:42.220><c> you</c><00:17:42.309><c> go</c>

of like a house of mirrors when you go
 

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.070 align:start position:0%

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:03.990 align:start position:0%
name one we got a different answer and
 

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%

then<00:25:04.170><c> we</c><00:25:04.290><c> realize</c><00:25:04.590><c> the</c><00:25:04.800><c> odometers</c><00:25:05.430><c> just</c>

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:05.730 align:start position:0%
then we realize the odometers just
 

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.150 align:start position:0%
then we realize the odometers just

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.220 align:start position:0%
aren't as precise as we need them to be
because<00:25:08.550><c> we</c><00:25:08.580><c> had</c><00:25:08.880><c> certain</c><00:25:09.270><c> toll</c><00:25:09.900><c> booths</c><00:25:10.140><c> that</c>

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
because we had certain toll booths that
 

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
because we had certain toll booths that

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
were only you know a couple of miles
 

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.220 align:start position:0%
were only you know a couple of miles

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.230 align:start position:0%
apart or even less than that so if
 

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.930 align:start position:0%

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
you're off by a tenth of a mile that
 

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.810 align:start position:0%
you're off by a tenth of a mile that

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
really affects the speed so then we went
 

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.580 align:start position:0%
really affects the speed so then we went

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.210 align:start position:0%
to another did you take into account the
 

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.340 align:start position:0%
to another did you take into account the

have to happen and because that would
 

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.260 align:start position:0%
have to happen and because that would

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:51.270 align:start position:0%
actually bring the whole speed down and
 

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.770 align:start position:0%
actually bring the whole speed down and

outside<00:27:08.840><c> on</c><00:27:09.840><c> the</c><00:27:10.410><c> first</c><00:27:10.650><c> question</c><00:27:11.630><c> yeah</c><00:27:12.630><c> we</c>

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:12.990 align:start position:0%
outside on the first question yeah we
 

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
outside on the first question yeah we
calculated<00:27:13.620><c> average</c>

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:14.350 align:start position:0%
calculated average
 

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
calculated average
speed<00:27:14.530><c> and</c><00:27:14.860><c> so</c><00:27:15.490><c> if</c><00:27:15.610><c> somebody</c><00:27:15.910><c> was</c><00:27:16.030><c> going</c><00:27:16.210><c> 90</c>

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:16.690 align:start position:0%
speed and so if somebody was going 90
 

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.690 align:start position:0%
speed and so if somebody was going 90
miles<00:27:16.840><c> an</c><00:27:17.080><c> hour</c><00:27:17.230><c> and</c><00:27:17.620><c> they</c><00:27:17.770><c> got</c><00:27:17.950><c> a</c><00:27:18.190><c> average</c>

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:18.700 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and they got a average
 

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
miles an hour and they got a average
speed<00:27:18.880><c> was</c><00:27:18.910><c> 90</c><00:27:19.450><c> and</c><00:27:19.690><c> they</c><00:27:19.960><c> got</c><00:27:20.110><c> off</c><00:27:20.320><c> on</c><00:27:20.500><c> an</c><00:27:20.620><c> exit</c>

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
speed was 90 and they got off on an exit
 

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
speed was 90 and they got off on an exit
they<00:27:21.160><c> were</c><00:27:21.220><c> going</c><00:27:21.490><c> even</c><00:27:21.760><c> faster</c><00:27:22.000><c> most</c><00:27:22.510><c> of</c><00:27:22.690><c> the</c>

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:22.750 align:start position:0%
they were going even faster most of the
 

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.750 align:start position:0%
they were going even faster most of the
trip<00:27:22.960><c> and</c><00:27:23.230><c> what</c><00:27:24.220><c> was</c><00:27:24.309><c> the</c><00:27:24.370><c> second</c><00:27:24.669><c> question</c>

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
trip and what was the second question
 

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
trip and what was the second question
the<00:27:25.660><c> second</c><00:27:25.990><c> question</c><00:27:26.110><c> was</c><00:27:26.470><c> yummy</c><00:27:26.950><c> yeah</c><00:27:27.850><c> the</c>

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:28.090 align:start position:0%
the second question was yummy yeah the
 

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
the second question was yummy yeah the
reason<00:27:28.720><c> was</c><00:27:28.809><c> because</c><00:27:29.970><c> the</c><00:27:31.350><c> all</c><00:27:32.350><c> of</c><00:27:32.410><c> the</c><00:27:32.830><c> toll</c>

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.070 align:start position:0%

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
some of the the time and so you know we
 

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
some of the the time and so you know we
couldn't<00:27:53.140><c> say</c><00:27:53.350><c> a</c><00:27:53.620><c> hundred</c><00:27:53.770><c> percent</c><00:27:54.090><c> with</c>

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:55.090 align:start position:0%
couldn't say a hundred percent with
 

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.390 align:start position:0%
couldn't say a hundred percent with

certainty that that those were off duty
 

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
certainty that that those were off duty
so<00:27:58.059><c> that's</c><00:27:58.240><c> why</c><00:27:58.390><c> we</c><00:27:58.510><c> phrase</c><00:27:58.720><c> it</c><00:27:58.900><c> that</c><00:27:58.929><c> way</c>

00:27:59.039 --> 00:27:59.049 align:start position:0%
so that's why we phrase it that way
 

00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
so that's why we phrase it that way
there<00:27:59.320><c> just</c><00:27:59.470><c> weren't</c><00:27:59.590><c> any</c><00:27:59.830><c> toll</c><00:28:00.159><c> plazas</c><00:28:01.120><c> that</c>
