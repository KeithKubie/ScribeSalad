00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.900
I'm sitting here with Carl
the UX engineer from Google.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; Hey Jay.
Thanks for having me.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.100
&gt;&gt; So Carl, let's talk a little bit
about how to get useful feedback

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.619
from our users when we're
sitting down with them to test.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.877
&gt;&gt; Hm, so sitting down with users,

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:15.273
there's a variety of ways
that we can go about it.

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:19.058
I think I like to start out with
when we're looking at paper,

00:00:19.058 --> 00:00:22.420
I like to start out kind
of an informal setting.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.850
I like to leverage
folks that are nearby.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.490
And involve them in
the brainstorming process

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.430
as we start to flesh out
features through our prototype.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.260
&gt;&gt; Ok, and do you start with
a task that you want them to do,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.820
do you start with just like
a flow that you've designed,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.080
do you start with
a blank piece of paper?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.540
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it's actually all three.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.540
It could be any of the above.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.540
There are certain times when you're
trying to conceptualize new features,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.460
things like that.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.259
Simple sketching is
the right place to start.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.360
Just drawing boxes and
arrows and circles, and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.430
things like that on paper is
a really good way to start,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.950
especially when you have folks
that are in non-design roles.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.910
Making them feel comfortable with
paper is a really important part of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.820
the prototyping process, but we want to
collect as many ideas as we can.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.990
So, we want to make sure
that we include those folks.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.360
So, paper sketching is
a good way to start.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.300
We can then evolve into
looking at specific tasks.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.020
So, we might choose to
prototype a specific task.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.320
We might choose to
look at holistic flow.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.370
We might choose to do that
through a set of drawings or

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.940
through high fidelity mocks,
maybe that we print out.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.640
And then we can walk through
specific screens within that flow.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.910
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.660
So, pretend for a moment that I'm
a user and I've sit down with you.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.140
How do you get me to give you
the feedback that you need?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
&gt;&gt; So that's a great question.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.800
We like to be really,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.450
really specific about the feedback
that we're looking for.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.230
We really want to make sure that we
don't just leave an open slate, because

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.100
when we leave an open slate, folks will
tend to focus on maybe design elements.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.640
Oh, I don't like
the color of that thing,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.210
I don't like the position of that thing.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.690
So we want to very specific with
the feedback that we're looking for.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.370
The best thing to do is come up with a
set of directed questions that will lead

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.490
the user in the direction that
you're wanting them to go anyway.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.770
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Maybe through a flow or

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.470
with a specific screen.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you'll ask me a set
of directed questions and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.510
I'll sort of go through and
talk about them.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.890
When I'm stuck or confused,
you ask me to do a certain task,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.320
at what point do you intervene and
say the button's right here?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.250
Do you ever do that?

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.000
Do you say,
just let them be confused and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.390
record that you're confused
about where this menu button is?

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.970
&gt;&gt; Actually it's a really good
thing to record confusion, right?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.430
So when a user gets stumped,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.560
we want to do our best to help
them move through the flow.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.160
But we also really need to capture that
the user got stumped in that case.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.720
The value there is that we can
understand why they got stumped.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.260
We can probe just a little bit more,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.930
understand the difficulty that
they came across with that UI.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.680
Was a particular affordance missing,
is there something that we can do,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.300
maybe highlight it with a different
color, make it bigger, make it bolder,

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.390
that kind of thing?

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.364
But it also is good to nudge
the user through a flow.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:18.945
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.474
&gt;&gt; If they do become hung up,

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:23.681
you want to progress through
the entire test, right?

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.793
You need to address all of the research
questions that you set out with.

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:27.374
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.416
&gt;&gt; And so, letting your user get stuck
and spin in a particular area or

00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:36.850
on a particular screen is
something that we want to avoid.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.770
&gt;&gt; So let's talk a little bit about the
questions that we might want to answer.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.850
We've got, you said we need to go
through the entire set of questions,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.800
what kinds of questions do we
want to be asking about an app.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.880
So we've got some design in our head or
on mocks already.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.346
What kinds of questions do we want
to be asking about those mocks,

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:56.633
about that prototype?

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:58.160
&gt;&gt; Sure.
Questions will tend to be

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.960
very specific to the prototype itself.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.190
And so you are going to look for things.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.330
Particular interaction
questions might come out.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.080
Does the user know how to get
from screen A to screen B?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.730
Do they know where to find button A?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.440
Can they complete a specific task or

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.459
something along those lines
going through a flow?

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.860
Can they find something that maybe is
buried three or four screens deep?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.220
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Those are the types of questions we

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.895
want to start with.

00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:28.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.980
So in our example app,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.270
we might have questions like,
can a user check off this task?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.960
Does a user know where
the menu button is?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.528
Things like that?

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:37.217
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:38.019
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.519
&gt;&gt; Yep.
