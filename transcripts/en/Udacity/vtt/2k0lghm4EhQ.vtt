Thanks, Rado.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.740
Now that we know the distinct
advantages of using a list view,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.750
we can use a list view to display the list
of weather forecasts in our app.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.140
Now which file in the layout folder
should we modify to accomplish this?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.530
Well, we want to add the list view
directly to the fragment.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.670
If you open up the fragment_main.xml file,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670
you'll notice that the layout includes
a RelativeLayout as a parent view,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.096
as well as a child TextView.

00:00:25.096 --> 00:00:28.692
Modify this file so that we show
a ListView instead of a TextView

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:33.840
and assign it an ID ListViewForecast
so we can reference it later.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010
Also, since this layout only contains
one child's view,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.840
it would be more efficient
to actually switch to a FrameLayout

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.940
instead of a RelativeLayout.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020
After you make the changes,
compile and run your app.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.200
You will be a little bit underwhelmed
with the blank screen, but that's okay.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.030
That's because we haven't populated
the list view with data yet,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.929
and that will come in a later step.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.559
Check the box when you're done.
