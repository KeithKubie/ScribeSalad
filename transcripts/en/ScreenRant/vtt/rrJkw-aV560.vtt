00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.970
In an entertainment industry that is packed
full of superhero crossovers and tie-ins – where

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.690
bigger team-ups and shared universe stories
are becoming the norm – it’s becoming

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.670
increasingly important that superhero films
do more than increase the amount of CGI mayhem

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.820
on screen.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.520
Long before they were all the rage in Hollywood,
superhero stories were allegorical reflections

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.460
of our world at pivotal points in time.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.820
They might be fun and colorful but many comics
are also layered with powerful messages of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.050
inspiration - tales of everyday people overcoming
the odds.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.720
Comics teach us that some battles aren’t
won by the strongest or most powerful heroes;

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.060
sometimes, everyday heroes can win – even
when they lose.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.329
But what if the hero that wins by losing is
also one of comic book history’s favorite

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.450
crime-fighters – who happens to be facing
off against an equally beloved Justice League

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.450
hero?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.850
For years fans have debated whether Batman
can beat Superman – but today, in our latest

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.059
docu series video, we suggest that not only
can Batman beat Superman, the Caped Crusader

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
can still win even if he loses.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.600
Batman Meets Superman

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.770
It be surprising to hear that, despite near-instantaneous
popularity back in the 1940s, it took several

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
years for Batman and Superman to appear in
a comic book story together.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.229
The pair graced the cover of World’s Best
Comics #1, joined by Robin, but the Batman

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.810
and Superman adventures inside those printed
pages remained entirely separate.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.530
Strangely, the first time the heroes actually
shared a storyline, it was on the radio – not

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.329
in a comic book – when the Dark Knight made
a guest appearance on The Adventures of Superman

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.459
program – marking the first of several guest
spots from the Caped Crusader.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.239
Nevertheless, it took another seven years
for the heroes to appear in a comic book cross-over

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:54.399
– in a campy 1952 story that saw the future
Justice League leaders, or more specifically

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.520
their alter egos Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne,
sharing a cabin on a cruise ship (where, of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.149
course, hilarity and trouble ensues).

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.729
Several more years followed, and in 1954,
World’s Finest Comics officially became

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.979
a Superman and Batman book series – in which
the pair fought villains together.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.480
World’s Finest Comics was an important moment
in DC Comics – as well as the cascade of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.530
team-ups that would follow in the coming decades
but it also marked the foundation of a key

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.420
dynamic in Batman and Superman’s relationship:
Batman was the brains, even though, on his

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.111
own, the Caped Crusader was still a capable
fighter - and Superman was the brawn, even

00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:32.540
though, on his own, the Man of Steel still
possessed a keen mind.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.100
It was a necessary distinction – previously,
the heroes had existed in entirely separate

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.790
worlds, where Superman took-on super-powered
threats and Batman solved crime as The World’s

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.570
Greatest Detective but – bringing the heroes
into the same world, meant that comic book

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.250
writers needed to ensure that Batman was still
just as fun to follow as his god-like partner

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.480
in crime-fighting.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.430
Over the years, as Superman writers gave the
Man of Steel new abilities and greater feats

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.710
of strength, and Batman writers armed the
Caped Crusader with slick gadgets and high-powered

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.480
vehicles, the dynamic between the heroes was
taken to its logical conclusion: where Superman

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.790
battled with raw physicality and super-human
powers, Batman contributed with tactical savvy

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.750
and specialized implementation of custom-built
weaponry.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.690
However, even as the friends grew closer – and
inspired an entire “league” of justice-seeking

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.440
heroes to join their cause, DC writers began
to explore ideological differences between

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.040
the two iconic heroes.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.090
An Ideological Conflict

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.900
Where Superman wears a symbol on his chest
that stands for hope and endeavors to inspire

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.240
and protect all mankind, Batman is the product
of a city overrun with corruption – where

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.620
only vigilante justice could wrong the rights
of a failed system.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.769
For Batman, Superman’s optimistic outlook
wasn’t a strength, it was a sign of naivety

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.680
- and a dangerous liability in the hands of
an extra-terrestrial with god-like powers.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.150
Specifically, would happen when Kal-El was
driven mad or became frustrated with humanity

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.130
– and sought to protect the world through
dictatorial acts of intimidation and aggression?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.430
It’s the kind of worst-case scenario that
only an obsessive and pessimistic vigilante

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.400
like Batman could see coming – but, given
his outlook and the people in his life that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.370
had been corrupted, it’s understandable
the Caped Crusader would be tempted to take

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.590
precautions - in order to protect humanity
from any potential threat (foe or good friend,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.590
alike).

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.910
Driven by these ideological differences, with
Batman fearing that Superman could become

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.400
an unchecked threat to life on earth and Superman
believing that Batman’s brand of vigilante

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.700
crime-fighting is a threat to true justice,
Kal-El and Bruce Wayne have (on several occasions)

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.969
forgone friendly debate in favor of a full-on
fist fight.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.300
On the surface, a god-like superhuman with
the Man of Steel's powers should make quick

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.320
work of a billionaire in a cape and cowl;
yet, Bruce Wayne is more than your typical

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.789
costumed vigilante – he’s a costumed vigilante
and genius inventor with access to kryptonite.

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.699
Batman V Superman

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.110
The Dark Knight has used a myriad of strategies
to subdue Superman – including controlling

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.460
Kal-El by (an admittedly hollow) threat to
the lives of innocent civilians (exploiting

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.349
the kryptonian’s need to protect innocent
life) – but two of the Caped Crusader’s

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.240
counter-Superman measures rise to the top:
power armor and kryptonite-infused weaponry.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.520
Despite its armored bulk and shock absorption,
the armored Batsuit is deceivingly nimble

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.139
- enabling Batman to put up a respectable
fight.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.699
An integrated hydraulic exoframe enhances
Wayne's movements and attacks - while also

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.509
protecting him from the full-force of Superman's
abilities.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.789
In the power armor, Batman can deliver ground-shaking
punches and kicks, capable of sending the

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.030
Man of Steel reeling, while also providing
enough flexibility for the Dark Knight to

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.949
dive, dodge, and counterattack.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.180
Conversely, when Batman couldn’t overpower
Superman with power armor, he’s also tried

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.659
weakening the Man of Steel.

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.460
While the Dark Knight has infused dust from
Superman's home planet into everything from

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.639
smoke bombs to liquid capsules, on two separate
occasions Batman outright forged kryptonite

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.360
weapons in service of punching the Man of
Steel into submission.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.659
Kryptonite gauntlets were introduced in the
divisive follow-up to Frank Miller's Dark

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.809
Knight Returns, The Dark Knight Strikes Again
but, given that Batman can't always predict

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:00.999
when he might need to fight-off Superman (and
it isn't practical or fashionable to bring

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.259
kryptonite gauntlets everywhere), the Dark
Knight is also revealed to carry a kryptonite

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.970
ring in the center pocket of his utility belt.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.199
Still, even with the use of power armor and
kryptonite, Batman has never been able to

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.699
outright defeat Superman physically – only
subdue him.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.099
Which brings us to the real reason that Batman
would ever fight Superman: to remind that

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.400
world that even god-like kryptonians can bleed.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.199
Do You Bleed?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.680
the Caped Crusader is often depicted as wary
of the Man of Steel - and has, in the past,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.719
created myriad contingency plans For that
reason, it's no surprise Ben Affleck's Dark

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:41.909
Knight in Batman V Superman seems suspicious,
looking to actively knock "Metropolis' Savior"

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.059
off his high horse.

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:47.419
Batman might not be able to kill a fully-powered
Superman but armor and kryptonite weapons

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.800
have given the Dark Knight enough of an edge
to succeed in his primary goal: reminding

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.479
Kal-El (and the rest of the world) that, should
the Man of Steel ever overstep the line between

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.819
do-gooder and despot, heroes will rise to
stop him.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.400
Achieving victory isn't always the same as
winning.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.509
After all, Superman defeated General Zod in
Man of Steel but it’s still hard to call

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:12.029
the outcome a win for the Big Blue Boyscout
– given the death toll, collateral damage,

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:15.199
not to mention Kal-El’s neck-snapping end
to Zod).

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.710
Even though he is beloved by millions, many
DC characters (whether human, superhuman,

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.810
or supervillain) still consider Superman a
potential danger to Earth – but feel powerless

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.589
to hold the kryptonian accountable.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.770
To that end, what if Batman doesn't need to
beat Superman to a bloody pulp, but only needs

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.520
to show that Superman can bleed, that he's
not invincible, to beat him?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.210
Fans will have seen a similar idea played
out in countless other stories, including

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.999
Zack Snyder's breakout film 300 (where a group
of Spartans gave their lives to make Xerxes

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:48.750
bleed - and prove he is not a god), as well
as Miller's "Dark Knight Returns" - where

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.520
Batman doesn't necessarily expect to kill
Superman, he just wants to push back against

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.119
a fascist government that wields Superman
like a blunt instrument.

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:02.080
Taking a stand to gain an ideological victory
may sound like a purely intellectual distinction,

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.189
but it's one that modern comics have explored
in depth - including Marvel’s "Civil War"

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:07.189
event.

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:10.580
To that end, the Dark Knight doesn’t need
to knock Superman out in order to win (and

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.220
make his point), he just needs to last long
enough to show the people of Earth that, together,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.619
they are not powerless against Superman - and
that the Man of Steel will be held accountable

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:21.430
if he ever loses sight of his “humanity.”

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.229
Simply put, if a single man in an armored
exo-suit can go toe-to-toe with a super-powered

00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:30.729
extraterrestrial, Batman’s stand would make
Superman and the people of our world think

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:32.490
twice.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.690
It might sound high-minded (especially in
a conversation about a hunky, spandex-wearing

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.250
extra-terrestrial battling it out with a billionaire
vigilante dressed in bat costume) - but a

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.220
moral, not physical, victory is usually the
outcome in nearly every time Batman and Superman

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.760
have faced-off (at least in the battles where
mind-controlling neuro toxins aren’t a factor).

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.410
Given the pair’s history, and mutual respect,
it makes sense that the most important thing

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.100
that Batman may ever do, is keep his super-powered
friend grounded – even if he has to take

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.510
a beating in order to secure an ideological
victory.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.970
