00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.960
As humans, we have evolved such that we're able to be aware of both our

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.530
internal world and our external world. This is what we mean by consciousness.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.306
And we vary in our level of awareness and arousal throughout the day from when

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:17.752
we wake to when we sleep. Sleep is vital for healthy functioning, both

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:22.230
physiologically and psychologically. It allows our body to restore itself after

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.946
a long day of activity. In addition, sleep aids us in memory consolidation and

00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:32.258
it helps us learn. Dreaming that occurs during REM Sleep also assists in brain

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:37.597
growth and development. Humans have a long history of taking psychoactive drugs

00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:42.066
to change their consciousness. And we have many reasons why we take drugs

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.970
including recreational, social, spiritual, and medical or psychological

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.883
reasons. Depressants like the barbiturates, benzodiazepines and alcohol,

00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:56.891
depress central nervous system activity. Therefore, they can cause relaxation,

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:03.760
and decrease anxiety. Opiates are very effective in treating pain. Stimulants

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.325
like cocaine and methamphetamine increase sympathetic nervous system activity.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:12.249
Cannabis has been used medicinally. But it can also cause perceptual

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:17.806
distortions. The hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin produce profound changes

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:22.828
in perception. Finally, although MDMA is also used recreationally, it is

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:28.398
showing promise as a new treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:32.193
Psychoactive drugs produce their effects by interacting with receptors, such as

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:36.694
dopamine and serotonin receptors. And they mimic our naturally-occurring

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:40.565
substances produced by the brain, such as our endorphins.
