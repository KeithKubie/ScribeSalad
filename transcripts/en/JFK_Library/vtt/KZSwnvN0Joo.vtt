00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.707
- Adams, actually, he's
only eight years older,

00:00:02.707 --> 00:00:04.741
but he thought of
Jefferson as a younger man,

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.188
almost like his son.

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.771
And Jefferson, of
course, deferred to Adams

00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.970
which is why Adams liked him so much.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.390
(audience laughing)

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.850
And they brought him into their family.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.881
And Jefferson was
fascinated by this family.

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.288
He's fascinated by Abigail

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.458
because he had never,
never met a woman like her

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.870
who managed the household,
was all of that,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.421
had all those skills, but at the same time

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:33.923
was intellectually the
equal of the two of them.

00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:37.944
She could command quotations from Milton

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:40.694
or from other poets, Shakespeare.

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:46.216
And she could talk to
them as an intellectual.

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:49.529
Jefferson, I don't think had
ever met a woman like her

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:51.696
until he met Maria Cosway.

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:55.515
So I think he took to this family,

00:00:55.515 --> 00:00:57.392
and he became a member of the family.

00:00:57.392 --> 00:00:59.271
They would take John
Quincy, who was with them,

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.574
the young boy, and they would

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:04.564
go to a concert together or to a symphony.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.617
And so he became part of their family.

00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:10.660
That's when the real bonding
took place, in the 1780s.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.943
And then, of course,
when they were separated,

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:17.443
Abigail and Mr. Jefferson
exchanged letters and gifts.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:23.085
And he flirted with her, mild flirtation.

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:25.987
He said to her at one point,

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.902
"I was going to buy a
little statue of Venus

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.554
for your dining room, but then I thought,

00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:34.295
two Venuses in the same
room would be a mistake."

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:36.370
(audience laughing)

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.886
That little kind of--

00:01:37.886 --> 00:01:40.803
but she said, "He is a choice one."

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.765
She really admired him.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.631
And he admired her.

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:47.224
The two of them were really quite close.

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:48.724
- [Moderator] And they shopped,
they were shopping buddies.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:49.729
They loved to shop.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.446
- They shopped together, that's right.

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:53.800
He bought things for her, and
she bought things for him.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.109
Especially after they got separated

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.531
because John and Abigail
went on to London,

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.030
as ministers to London.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.649
And Jefferson remained in Paris

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.794
as the minister to France.

00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:07.218
So they had an extraordinarily
close relationship.
