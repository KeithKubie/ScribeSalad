00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.460
So far we've talked about how
the Fed can control the money

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.770
supply by performing these open
market transactions where

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.195
they're buying and selling
Treasury securities.

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:13.480
But you're probably asking,
when I read the newspaper

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.960
headlines about all of this,
I don't hear about the open

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.890
market transactions so much and
I don't hear about them

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.880
buying treasuries so much.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.030
I always hear them setting the
Federal funds rate, or the

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.980
discount rate, or
the target rate.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.110
And what do these words mean
and how do these relate to

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.520
open market transactions?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.260
So that's what we'll try
to go over right now.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.870
So what we're going to focus
on is the target rate-- and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.790
then probably in the next video
or in a couple more

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.070
videos, we'll focus more
on the discount rate.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190
And they're two different
things, although they're often

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.080
used in conjunction with each
other and they move in tandem,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.150
but let's focus on the target
rate because this is how the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.510
Fed, under normal conditions,
normally sets

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.340
its monetary policy.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.010
So, the target rate.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.860
So just so you know the
definition, this is the rate

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.640
that the Fed wants banks to lend
reserves to each other on

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.830
a very short term basis--
so, overnight.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.810
What does that mean?

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960
So I drew two banks here-- and
I drew a little bit different

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.820
than I normally do.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.740
The left-hand side
is the assets.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.860
The red box is the liabilities
and this blue over here, this

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.800
is the equity.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.960
And the thing that I did
different is, every video so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.520
far, I've been drawing
the reserves on the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.220
bottom of the assets.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.770
And that actually made it a
little confusing when you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.510
compare the reserves to
the demand deposits.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.150
I'm assuming all the liabilities
are demand

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.020
deposits-- that they're not
taking other types of loans.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.610
So these are all checking
accounts, all of this red area

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.780
right here.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.080
So I actually finally figured
out that it would be easier to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.480
compare the reserve ratios if
I had it drawn side by side.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.710
So let's say this bank right
here-- these are its reserves

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.930
in green-- and these could be
actual dollars, this could be

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.130
actual cash that's sitting in
there in their vault, or it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.710
could be reserve deposits with
the Federal Reserve.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.810
They're really the same
thing and they

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.750
can go back and forth.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.440
And I think that's kind of--
you understand that now.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.510
And just so you understand, this
asset is a liability of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.390
the Federal Reserve.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.550
It's roughly that much of it.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.340
So that's that.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100
An asset for the bank, liability
for the Federal

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000
Reserve-- and this reserve for
this bank is a liability to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.830
the Federal Reserve.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.490
And if these were actually
cash-- if this was actually

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.120
dollar bills and this would say,
notes outstanding-- if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.840
this asset is a demand deposit
account or reserve deposit

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.500
account with the Federal
Reserve, then this would just

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.170
say, reserve account
for bank B.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.440
With that said, so this bank,
just visually the way I've

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.200
drawn it-- let me just
fill this in.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.680
I think looks nice when I
color in the squares.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.820
This bank-- its reserves just
the way I've drawn it are

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.980
clearly-- its reserve ratio is
clearly lower than this bank

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.150
because this is its demand

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.750
deposits, this is its reserves.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.240
Let's say that this bank has
reserves-- I'm just eyeballing

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.670
it-- looks like about if you
take the ratio of this height

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.486
to this height, it looks like it
has reserves of maybe-- I'm

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.800
just going to say 10%, while
this one looks more like it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.000
has-- I don't know-- closer
to 20% reserves.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840
And now remember, banks-- we
talked about regulations, so

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.090
there is some minimum reserves
that a bank needs to keep.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.470
And then, of course, even if
there were no regulation, a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.110
bank would want to keep some
reserves just in case some of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.520
these demand deposits-- people
want their cash, so you always

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.060
want to keep some reserves, but
you don't want to keep too

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.780
much reserves.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.210
Because what happens with
too much reserves?

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.440
Reserves-- you don't get any
interest on a reserve account

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.300
or on cash.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.630
And that's actually how the--
if you were curious how the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.020
Fed actually supports itself--
well, it gives these banks

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.120
reserve accounts, which are
essentially checking accounts

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.870
at the Fed-- and it gives
them no interest on it.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.580
It gives them no interest so
it has no interest on the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.810
right-hand side of their
balance sheets.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.320
So it pays no interest
on its liabilities.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.690
And its liabilities are these
things right here.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.680
It pays no interest on these
things, but it gets interest

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.670
on some of its assets.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.480
So here I drew a little
bit of gold.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.620
This yellow part is
gold right here.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.530
Let me write that-- gold.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.440
This right here is gold and then
this brown color-- we'll

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.910
assume that these are
treasuries, right?

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.870
So if I have a government
treasury, it gives me some

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.420
interest. So I'm paying no
interest if I'm the Fed.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.070
I'm paying no interest on these
reserve deposits or on

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.360
these notes outstanding.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.490
And I get interest
on my assets.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.630
So that's easy money and it
actually turns out that what

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.720
the Fed does-- and this is why
it's very ambiguous whether

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.170
it's really independent of
the government or not.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.260
It is officially a private
institution, but it's a board

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.570
of directors that's appointed
by the government and even

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.440
more, this money that it makes,
any surplus money that

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.690
it has after paying all of the
expenses of the Federal

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.240
Reserve, it actually goes
back to Congress.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.980
So don't think that somehow
there's this private bank with

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.560
this great money making scheme
because all the money goes

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.250
back to Congress.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.250
Although that goes both ways.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.410
If for whatever reason, the Fed
were to do really stupid

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.650
things and it were to become
insolvent, Congress is

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.900
obligated-- we learned before
that these treasury notes are

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.550
obligations of the
U.S. government.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.500
So it goes both ways.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.730
So even though it's officially
independent, it really isn't.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.760
It really is almost a part of
Congress-- or at least a part

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.220
of the government.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.770
But with that said-- actually,
I should say part of the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.090
Treasury, not so much
part of Congress.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.040
I don't want to be technically
incorrect.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.250
But with that said, let's go
back to this example with

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.300
these two banks.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.380
So this guy, he probably has
more reserves than he needs.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.500
And he doesn't like having too
much reserves because you

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.500
don't get any interest on it.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.940
Let's say that this guy--
he wants 15% reserves.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.220
He figures that that's more
than enough that he needs.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.935
And this guy, he feels like he's
getting a little bit low

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:53.620
on reserves.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.010
He would also like
to get to 15%.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.610
So this guy would like to
borrow this much money.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.270
Reserves would actually be
physical cash or reserve

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.570
deposits with the Fed.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.310
And this guy, he has about
this much to lend.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.700
He has roughly about this much
right here to lend-- and so

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.620
the obvious thing, since there's
only two banks in this

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.470
universe, is that this guy
would lend to that guy,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.570
probably overnight because you
don't know what's going to

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.160
happen tomorrow.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.320
Maybe some people are
going to want their

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.140
money back, et cetera.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.120
So we're just lending
overnight.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.053
And if this guy still feels
comfortable with the

00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:32.860
situation, he can continue
that lending.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.490
This guy can renew his
lending and this guy

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.200
will renew it-- whatever.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.470
You get the idea.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.670
So the question is, what
interest rate does this guy

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.350
charge to that guy for lending
this little chunk of money?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.520
Let's just say right now, this
bank says, well, I'll charge

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:06.650
you-- I don't know-- I'll charge
you 10% overnight.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.480
So it's not like you're paying
10% just for a one night loan.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.300
It's an annual rate of 10%.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.110
So overnight, you're paying
this to the 1/365 power or

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.350
however many business
days there are.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.770
So it's actually a very small
amount of interest. These are

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.840
kind of the annual rates if
this guy were to continue

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.510
borrowing it overnight and
overnight for a whole year.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.280
With that said, let's say that
the Fed decides the money

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.440
supply isn't big enough.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.360
That the Fed wants to expand
the money supply.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.170
So let's see what happens
in that situation.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.175
So what was that mechanism?

00:07:37.175 --> 00:07:43.495
So what the Fed does is,
it can print notes.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.280
Let's just say it's actual
physical cash.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.480
That's an asset that the
Fed is holding now.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.290
And of course it has an
offsetting liability now,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.980
which is notes outstanding,
right?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.030
And then what the Fed does is,
it uses these notes and it can

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.340
buy treasuries, it
can buy risk free

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.780
government debt, right?

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.260
And it buys them in
the open market.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.560
That debt might be being
held by China.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.960
It might be being held
by your grandmother.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.880
It could be being
held by anyone.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.100
It might even be being held by
some of these banks, but

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.330
needless to say, they take
this and they buy

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.730
treasuries with it.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.909
So then that asset then turns
to treasuries on the Fed's

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.350
balance sheet.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.860
But where did all that
cash go, right?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.470
Well, that cash will then go
to your grandmother who was

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.690
holding the treasuries.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.340
And what is your grandmother
going to do with that cash?

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.020
Well, your grandmother is going
to put that cash in

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.590
their bank, right?

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.280
And maybe they're buying it
from a lot of people's

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.620
grandmothers.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.090
And so let's say some of the
grandmothers put the

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:03.860
money in this bank.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.670
I'm trying to draw it.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.240
So this bank gets a little
bit more reserves.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.160
And then some of the
grandmothers put it in this

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.280
bank over here, right?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.530
And so what happened?

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.390
What was the net
effect of that?

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.790
The government's balance sheet
increased a little bit.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.100
If you look at its total
assets, it's

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.980
expanded a little bit.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.170
Or if you actually just look
at its total liabilities.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.330
Its balance sheet grew.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.390
It took on some treasuries-- and
we'll have a whole video

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.970
on what the impact on treasury
interest rates that does.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.550
But in the process, when it
bought those treasuries on the

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.070
open market, more cash
got deposited

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.630
into the banking system.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.970
And this could be cash or it
could be reserves with the

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:44.960
central bank.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.770
But now let's think about
this situation

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.270
between these two banks.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.910
Now all of a sudden this bank
here needs less money, right,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.210
because he got some reserve
deposits from our

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.460
grandmothers.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.930
And also, this bank-- maybe now
this guy went from 10%--

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.730
maybe now he has a 12% reserve
ratio because he got some

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.250
deposits of actual cash.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:14.160
And maybe this guy went from 20%
to-- I don't know-- 22%.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.720
So now this guy needs
less money, right?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.686
His demand for money has been
lowered, or for cash has been

00:10:21.686 --> 00:10:24.440
lowered, or his demand for
reserves has been lowered.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.200
And this guy has even
more to lend, right?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.340
He already had a surplus and
now he has an even bigger

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.650
surplus, right?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.790
So the supply of reserves
has increased

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.460
in the banking system.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.720
The supply his increased from
the lending bank and the

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.310
demand from the borrowing
bank has lowered.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.130
So now for this transaction to
occur, the demand has gone

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.180
down, the supply has gone up.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.180
The price has got
to go down for a

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.600
little borrowing overnight.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.140
And what is the price
of borrowing?

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.510
Well, that's interest rates.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.780
So now for this transaction to
occur, all of a sudden maybe

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.160
this guy needs it less, this
guy wants to lend even more

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.850
because he has more.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.530
So now maybe this transaction
will occur at

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.280
an 8% interest rate.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.080
And maybe the Fed has
a target rate of 5%.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.510
They want to see a reality where
this bank is lending to

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.880
that bank at a 5% rate.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.820
So what would they do?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.940
Well, they would just keep
doing this process.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.760
They would issue a
little bit more.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.720
I realize I'm not going
to have time.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.580
But you see the process.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.450
They'd issue some more notes,
buy some more treasuries.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.430
Those notes would end up in
the banking system so the

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.730
demand for overnight lending
will go down and there'll be

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.220
more of those reserves
out there.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.430
So the rate at which
people lend to each

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.740
other will go down.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.570
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
