00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.810
We need to evaluate the limit,
as x approaches infinity, of 4x

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:18.350
squared minus 5x, all of that
over 1 minus 3x squared.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.120
So infinity is kind
of a strange number.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.940
You can't just plug in infinity
and see what happens.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.450
But if you wanted to evaluate
this limit, what you might try

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.420
to do is just evaluate-- if you
want to find the limit as this

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.020
numerator approaches infinity,
you put in really large numbers

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.840
there, and you're going to see
that it approaches infinity.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.980
That the numerator
approaches infinity as

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.200
x approaches infinity.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
And if you put really large
numbers in the denominator,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600
you're going to see
that that also-- well,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.780
not quite infinity.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.230
3x squared will approach
infinity, but we're

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.190
subtracting it.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.280
If you subtract infinity from
some non-infinite number, it's

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.220
going to be negative infinity.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.610
So if you were to just kind
of evaluate it at infinity,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.260
the numerator, you would
get positive infinity.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.915
The denominator, you would
get negative infinity.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:06.260
So I'll write it like this.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.420
Negative infinity.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.800
And that's one of the
indeterminate forms

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.770
that L'Hopital's Rule
can be applied to.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.040
And you're probably saying,
hey, Sal, why are we even

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.400
using L'Hopital's Rule?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.450
I know how to do this
without L'Hopital's Rule.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.130
And you probably
do, or you should.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.160
And we'll do that in a second.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.220
But I just wanted to show you
that L'Hopital's Rule also

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.150
works for this type of problem,
and I really just wanted to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.190
show you an example that had a
infinity over negative

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.510
or positive infinity
indeterminate form.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.320
But let's apply
L'Hopital's Rule here.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.360
So if this limit exists, or if
the limit of their derivatives

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.380
exist, then this limit's going
to be equal to the limit as x

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.000
approaches infinity of the
derivative of the numerator.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.750
So the derivative of the
numerator is-- the derivative

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.130
of 4x squared is 8x minus 5
over-- the derivative of the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.420
denominator is, well,
derivative of 1 is 0.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.200
Derivative of negative 3x
squared is negative 6x.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
And once again, when you
evaluated infinity, the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.930
numerator is going to
approach infinity.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.310
And the denominator is
approaching negative infinity.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.240
Negative 6 times infinity
is negative infinity.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.390
So this is negative infinity.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.240
So let's apply
L'Hopital's Rule again.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.250
So if the limit of these guys'
derivatives exist-- or the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.620
rational function of the
derivative of this guy divided

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.870
by the derivative of that guy--
if that exists, then this

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.010
limit's going to be equal to
the limit as x approaches

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.280
infinity of-- arbitrarily
switch colors-- derivative

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.570
of 8x minus 5 is just 8.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.710
Derivative of negative
6x is negative 6.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.040
And this is just going to be--
this is just a constant here.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.910
So it doesn't matter what limit
you're approaching, this is

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.200
just going to equal this value.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.670
Which is what?

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.540
If we put it in lowest
common form, or simplified

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.670
form, it's negative 4/3.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.440
So this limit exists.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.920
This was an indeterminate form.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.060
And the limit of this
function's derivative over this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.680
function's derivative exists,
so this limit must also

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.190
equal negative 4/3.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.610
And by that same argument,
that limit also must be

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.520
equal to negative 4/3.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.950
And for those of you who
say, hey, we already

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.540
knew how to do this.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.470
We could just factor
out an x squared.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.400
You are absolutely right.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.440
And I'll show you
that right here.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.580
Just to show you that it's
not the only-- you know,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.920
L'Hopital's Rule is not
the only game in town.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.630
And frankly, for this type of
problem, my first reaction

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.380
probably wouldn't have been to
use L'Hopital's Rule first.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.360
You could have said that that
first limit-- so the limit as x

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.630
approaches infinity of 4x
squared minus 5x over 1 minus

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.830
3x squared is equal to the
limit as x approaches infinity.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.940
Let me draw a little line here,
to show you that this is equal

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.010
to that, not to this
thing over here.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.790
This is equal to the limit
as x approaches infinity.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.020
Let's factor out an x squared
out of the numerator

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.690
and the denominator.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:15.750
So you have an x squared
times 4 minus 5 over x.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.220
Right? x squared times 5
over x is going to be 5x.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.440
Divided by-- let's factor out
an x out of the numerator.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.750
So x squared times 1
over x squared minus 3.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.540
And then these x
squareds cancel out.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.920
So this is going to be equal
to the limit as x approaches

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.990
infinity of 4 minus 5 over x
over 1 over x squared minus 3.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.760
And what's this going
to be equal to?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.610
Well, as x approaches
infinity-- 5 divided by

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.050
infinity-- this term
is going to be 0.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.160
Super duper infinitely
large denominator,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.650
this is going to be 0.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.800
That is going to approach 0.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.900
And same argument.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.400
This right here is
going to approach 0.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.010
All you're left with is
a 4 and a negative 3.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.130
So this is going to be
equal to negative 4 over a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.610
negative 3, or negative 4/3.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.270
So you didn't have to do
use L'Hopital's Rule

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.910
for this problem.
