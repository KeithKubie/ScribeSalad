00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:08.482
(playful piano music)

00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:12.383
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:13.622
Bipedal,

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:14.910
naked,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.077
large brained,

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.696
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:25.940
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.261
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.428
yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.908
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:37.528
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:39.611
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:41.990
We shape the future

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.490
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:50.200
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.224
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:54.891
and how we got here.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:01:00.080
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.913
like you.

00:01:15.202 --> 00:01:18.119
(electronic music)

00:01:20.598 --> 00:01:23.515
(electronic music)

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:42.729
- [Ajit Varki] And so
we humans ask ourselves,

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.646
who are we?

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:47.184
What are we doing here?

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:48.834
Where did we come from?

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:50.233
How did we get here?

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.606
And where are we going?

00:01:52.606 --> 00:01:56.828
As you know, Carta focuses
on two of these questions,

00:01:56.828 --> 00:01:59.490
in the form of the study of anthropogeny

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.618
explaining the origin of humans.

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:06.396
And we access all disciplines
that we can possibly access

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:08.575
to interact, to come to some conclusions

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.492
on these two questions.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.900
And this symposium is
co-sponsored by Carta and

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.910
the KAVLI Institute for Brain and Mind.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.170
And we're a transdisciplinary
collaboration

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.992
between faculty at UC San Diego and Salk,

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.128
along with interested
scientists at other institutions

00:02:26.128 --> 00:02:29.161
and our mission is to explore
and explain the origins

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:31.161
of the human phenomenon.

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:35.217
And so along with me as Co-Directors,

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:37.157
are Rusty Gage and Margaret Schoeninger,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.782
and Associate Director Pascal Gagneux.

00:02:39.782 --> 00:02:42.097
And the KAVLI Institute
is also run by Rusty,

00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:45.764
along with Nick Spitzer
and Ralph Greenspan.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.968
And a special thanks
to our major sponsors,

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:53.720
the Harold and Leila Mathers
Charitable Foundation New York,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.307
Howard Chester, Executive Director,

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:58.674
and in this symposium,
the KAVLI Institute.

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.648
And a special thank you
to Annette Merle-Smith,

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:03.002
for her support of the
Graduate Specialization

00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:04.335
in Anthropogeny.

00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:07.112
And a thank you to the supporters

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:08.639
of the James Handelman Endowment

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.639
for the Exploration of Anthropogeny.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.953
These lists will be circulating
during the intermissions.

00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:17.432
Special thank you to Cheryl
and Kenney Griffiths,

00:03:17.432 --> 00:03:19.709
for sponsoring this
symposium's closed captioning

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.759
of the videos on Youtube, as
they'll come out eventually.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.759
And of course, thank you to

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.567
the many individual
supporters who are named here,

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:30.966
and I'm just showing
the slides very briefly,

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:33.782
we'll show them as we go along.

00:03:33.782 --> 00:03:36.123
And special thanks to the Carta staff,

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:39.877
Ingrid, Rachel, Kate, Linda and Jesse,

00:03:39.877 --> 00:03:41.597
and the UC TV group,

00:03:41.597 --> 00:03:45.514
Rich, Matt, Steve Anderson,
Marci and Domenick.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.885
And Kent Schnoeker and Michael Jeffs,

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:53.543
and the guitarist of
course, who we just heard,

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:54.793
George Svoboda.

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.909
So with that I'll hand over to the chairs.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.938
- [Tim White] Thank you,
good afternoon and welcome.

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:10.688
On Sunday March 30th,

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:12.546
1997,

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:16.786
I received Professor Varki's announcement

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:19.451
of something called Carta.

00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:20.820
The vision was ambitious-

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.184
to create a unique, San
Diego-based enterprise

00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:29.475
to engage scholars and
students at the highest level

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:32.367
across the wide range of
disciplines contributing

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:36.284
knowledge about our place
in the natural world.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.796
Or, as the initial announcement put it,

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:43.429
"the ultimate objective of the group

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:45.104
"is to completely explain

00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:46.953
"the phenomenon of humans".

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.106
(audience laughter)

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:52.809
Now that was a tall
order even 21 years ago.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:53.892
Your presence here,

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.134
and your presence online

00:04:56.134 --> 00:05:00.385
is one indicator of the
success of this enterprise.

00:05:00.385 --> 00:05:02.826
Carta's local and global
impacts have been impressive

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:04.234
by any measure,

00:05:04.234 --> 00:05:07.102
making it a shining jewel in the crown of

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:10.143
the University of California system.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.643
So Carta was launched in 1997.

00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:17.068
That was a decade

00:05:17.068 --> 00:05:19.985
before the first generation iPhone.

00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:23.913
And here we are today.

00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:26.096
I'm going to read a
passage from Stewart Brand,

00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:29.540
who you may know as the editor
of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.800
and President of the Long Now Foundation.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.467
Brand wrote in 2011,

00:05:35.883 --> 00:05:37.763
"civilization is revving itself

00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:41.961
"into a pathologically
short attention span.

00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:44.671
"The trend might be coming from

00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:47.380
"the acceleration of technology,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.032
"the short horizon perspective
of market-driven economics,

00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:56.633
"the next election
perspective of democracies,

00:05:56.633 --> 00:06:00.633
"or the distractions of
personal multi-tasking."

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:05.486
That's your reminder to please
turn your cell phones off.

00:06:05.486 --> 00:06:08.970
(audience laughter)

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.470
That was only seven years ago.

00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:16.375
Today's invited speakers

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.208
come from a wide range of disciplines.

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:23.591
I'm going to illustrate a
bit of the temporal spectrum,

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.174
that they'll cover.

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:27.813
I'll start with this.

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.450
This is a cobble.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.117
An original artifact

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:39.493
from the bottom of a gorge in Tanzania.

00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:43.517
It was shaped by someone,

00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:45.350
1.8 million years ago,

00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:51.814
and it represents the
earliest technology made

00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:53.231
by our ancestors.

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:59.012
Literally on the other hand,

00:07:01.382 --> 00:07:04.382
(audience laughter)

00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.064
This,

00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:10.134
is a now obsolete iPhone.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:13.134
(audience laughter)

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:19.758
The range of technology.

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:26.498
Today in the invaluable spaces
that Carta has established,

00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:29.843
we will be treated to
an intellectual banquet,

00:07:29.843 --> 00:07:34.843
that will reach far beyond
these two technological markers.

00:07:34.926 --> 00:07:37.442
On behalf of all of us here,

00:07:37.442 --> 00:07:39.362
and all of you out there online,

00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:43.130
let me thank the visionaries
who created Carta,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.865
and the supporters and students and staff

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.711
whose efforts continue to make this broad,

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.358
and productive intellectual space

00:07:50.358 --> 00:07:53.366
available to the widest audiences.

00:07:53.366 --> 00:07:56.283
(electronic music)
