00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Hello everyone,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.750
I'm Juan Felipe Herrera
US Poet Laureate.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.570
I'm here at the Library of
Congress in the Hispanic Division

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.010
and I have here Georgette Dorn
who is the Chief of the Division.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.310
Hi, Georgette.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.570
What can you tell us
about what's going on?

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.870
What's new?

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: We have some
wonderful materials from Cuba.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.340
This is called Ediciones Vigía
that began publishing in 1985

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
in Matanzas, Cuba by
Rolando Rodríguez.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.180
And they are very unique
artists materials

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.390
on common paper, illustrated
by artists.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.460
And they had major
poets cited, Borges.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.960
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Borges,
Jorge Luis Borges.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.610
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Federico García
Lorca, Emily Dickinson and it is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
on common paper but it is also
supplemented with natural materials

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.700
like string, seashells...

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Seashells?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, it's very Cuban

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.070
and at the beginning the
government didn't really like it,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.000
but now they are really
protecting it.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.970
And these little artist books have
found their way to the Library

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 position:56%
of Congress, to the British Library,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.070
and to the many university
libraries.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.090
This is an example of
materials that are used

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.760
on common paper, wonderfully
illustrated.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes, and do
they make their own paper?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.190
&gt;&gt; Dorn: No, but they
use very natural papers.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.420
But they use their own
ink and their own poetry.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.620
This is a homage to the workers on
the [inaudible] River for instance.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.980
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Oh, look at that.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So this is an extraordinary
collection and the Library

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.100
of Congress actually has the
biggest Vigía collection.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.440
And it began at the old colonial
house of Vigía in Matanzas, Cuba.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.680
So it's, right now they are like
you know they are keeping them

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.980
in Rare Books actually.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.400
This is part of our
Rare Book Collection.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.960
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's beautiful
and who was Vigía?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.140
Who was Vigía?

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.580
&gt;&gt; Dorn: But that was just
a house called Vigía.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.880
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's a
house called Vigía.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.180
&gt;&gt; Dorn: A colonial
house Vigía in Matanzas,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.050
Cuba which is on the eastern,
far eastern side of Cuba.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: On the far eastern side.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.650
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.950
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I really like
them because of the, you know,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.660
common paper and the perhaps, this
kind of, it looks like a paper bag.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.960
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It is.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.260
It is brown paper, yes.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.020
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Brown paper
and then the ink.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.600
Do they have their own presses?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.900
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, they do.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.810
They have their own press
and artists from all

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.650
over the world contribute
artwork and poetry

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.770
so it has become quite
international since 1985.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.070
&gt;&gt; Herrera: In Matanzas.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.370
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, in Matanzas, Cuba.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.610
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Is it a
small group of artists?

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.950
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It began as a small group.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.250
Now it's actually quite large.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.550
It's Island wide.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.000
And as I say, also
from other countries.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.740
They write, they contribute,
they send their poems,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.740
they send their artwork,
so it's very interesting.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.530
There are poems, there
are also essays,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.090
"novelletas," you know,
short novels.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.850
So it's a very large collection.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.250
We have actually thousands of Vigía
books in the Library's collection.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.560
&gt;&gt; Herrera: They are
different sizes.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.860
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.160
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I love this.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.170
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And as you see, they
keep them in very special housing

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.260
because they are very fragile.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.240
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I notice it's
not only different materials,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.890
but it's also some kind of
collage, they do collage.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.530
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, it is collage, yes.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.940
Some of them have seashells, some
of them have, you know, strings

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.240
and other materials

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.870
so it's very...and you
also have to preserve them.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.920
So we do a great emphasis on
preserving them in the proper light

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.650
so they will last for a long time.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.950
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Well this is beautiful.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.780
I have seen in another visit to
the Hispanic Division that they had

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.580
like a shoebox approach
to a magazine.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.880
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.180
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And this
is more like revista,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.030
open-folded magazine approach?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.330
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It is.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.420
It is like each issue
is completely different.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.690
But it is sort of like
a serial, yeah.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.990
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yeah, it is.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.290
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And we call it
Colección de Vigía.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.790
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Colección de Vigía.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.860
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And they have
Colección de Lorica and many,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.190
many other famous,
you know, writers.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.490
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I saw that.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.380
This is something everybody can
do, maybe not at this level,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.160
or maybe yes, but this is very
available if we want to do it,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.490
let's say for Casa de
Colores out in the cities

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.350
and towns of the United States.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.650
&gt;&gt; Dorn: I think that
would be very nice.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.950
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Don't you think?

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.250
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah, if the community
could contribute to it, yes.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.550
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Yes.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It would be a great effort.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.850
And artists would contribute
very original artwork to it too.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.250
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I think it's a great
thing, you know, we could think

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.590
about that and start doing it.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.480
You go to the store and
bring back the paper bag

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.620
or whatever bags you bring
back or even the cardboard.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.870
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, this is
actually a paper bag

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.580
and then they paste it on...

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.880
&gt;&gt; Herrera: I love it!

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.670
&gt;&gt; Dorn: ...and then of course it
has to be preserved very much so,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.590 position:56%
so the glue does not ruin the paper.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.020
So that's where our experts
come in, in Preservation.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.320
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That's right.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.620
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So, they keep it very...

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.170
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And they have the
famous little dust jacket here.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.470
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.770
&gt;&gt; Herrera: With a little bio?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.690
&gt;&gt; Dorn: This is an artist
born, I mean poet born in 1972.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.990
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Poet?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.290
&gt;&gt; Dorn: So his prior work is here.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.590
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Bio.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.890
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And there is his poetry.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.090
&gt;&gt; Herrera: And there's the
poetry, El violinista desnudo.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.770
&gt;&gt; Dorn: The Naked Violinist.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.570
&gt;&gt; Herrera: The Naked Violinist

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.840
and then there's other
designs, designios.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.460
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Designs, yes.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.680
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Designs, and
then there's...what is this?

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.820
This is the title of
the piece is it?

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.120
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.420
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Oficios para el olvido.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.720
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.130
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Kind of
Projects for Oblivion.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.460
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Project to Forget.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.760
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Projects to Forget.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.610
&gt;&gt; Dorn: By this very
poet, by Luis Pita García.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.910
&gt;&gt; Herrera: By Luis Pita García.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.210
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And he is
also from Matanzas.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.510
&gt;&gt; Herrera: From Matanzanas.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.810
&gt;&gt; Dorn: One of the
big cities of Cuba.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.520
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Number 36.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.820
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.120
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Number 36.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.460
Shall we show them Number 36?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.760
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Here's Number 36, folks.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.820
And here's what it
looks like on the back.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.810
And here's what it looks like
with your little, what is this?

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.110
&gt;&gt; Dorn: It's a string.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.480
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Just strings,
with some strings,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.430
and you can open it and enjoy.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.730
You can feel it.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.030
How you can feel it really well.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.330
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes, I think
it is interesting.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.400
It's Colección de San, Ediciones
Vigía Colección Del San Juan.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.220 position:56%
And this one is a little bit larger.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.520
&gt;&gt; Herrera: It's larger.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.820
&gt;&gt; Dorn: They are in
different sizes.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.120
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Different sizes.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.420
This one, look it's black.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.720
Look at this, look how
it feels really good.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.020
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Interesting,
interesting paper.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.820
This is very good quality
paper actually.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.730
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Is this
like tissue paper on,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.230
on paper bag, on top of paper bag?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.530
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.830
I think this is like more...

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.130
&gt;&gt; Herrera: See?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.430
&gt;&gt; Dorn: More elegant paper, yes.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.300
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Then here's a paper
bag and they put it together?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.600
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yes.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.270
&gt;&gt; Herrera: You, see, I know
a little bit of something.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.950
&gt;&gt; Dorn: This is called
Transfiguraciones.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.250
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Transfiguraciones.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.590
&gt;&gt; Dorn: And it is
divided by this very...

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.670
&gt;&gt; Herrera: That sounds like
Borges, Transfiguraciones.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.210
Oh, look at that!

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.510
&gt;&gt; Dorn: Yeah.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.810
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Look at that!

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.110

show the people what is this,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.300

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.020
by José Jacinto Milanés.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.900
&gt;&gt; Herrera: Okay, the prize-winning
poetry by it's kind of,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.660

on top of this tissue paper.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.960

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herrera: See, that's what I like.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.160
It's torn and it's
wrinkled, aesthetically, huh?

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.460

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.320

with aesthetic feeling.

impact actually.
