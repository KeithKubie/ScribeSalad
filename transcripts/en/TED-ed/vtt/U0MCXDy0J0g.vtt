00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.866
Beatbox is the original instrument.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.225
It all comes from the voice.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:47.254
Today, we're going teach you
the three basic sounds of beatbox,

00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:48.945
which make up the foundation of it.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.269
Now, the "kick"
is the kick drum on the bottom

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.900
and it makes the loud bass sound.

00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:54.095
It sounds like this:

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.285
(Beatboxes bass sound)

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.468
Alright? You hear that?

00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:57.556
(Beatboxes bass sound)

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.873
How do you make that sound?

00:00:58.897 --> 00:01:02.201
Well, the way you make that sound
is you take a "p" and you take a "b"

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.051
and you mesh those two together

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:07.305
and it's going to give you
what we refer to as the kick drum.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.722
Pb! Pb! Pb!

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:10.435
So, alright, so you try this:

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.706
Pb!

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.887
Pb!

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:14.412
Excellent!

00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:17.626
Now, the next sound
is the almighty snare sound.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.044
And the snare sound
is basically taking a "k" and an "a"

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:23.901
and putting those two sounds together.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:25.298
And it sounds like this:

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.449
Ka! Ka! Ka!

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:29.876
Alright? So just try that, really easy.

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.257
Ka! Ka! Ka!

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.222
Now, the last sound
is one of my favorite sounds.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.635
It's the hi-hat.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.144
The hi-hat's my favorite sound,

00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:40.329
because it's always
on the tip of your tongue.

00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:43.147
You basically take a "t" and an "s"

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:44.860
and twist those two together,

00:01:44.884 --> 00:01:46.649
and it's going to sound like this:

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.043
Ts Ts, Ts, Ts.

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:49.853
It's great, right?

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:51.313
So, you put all those together

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.826
and you can make some really
amazing, wonderful music

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.074
that you can do anywhere.

00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:56.947
We can make beats in the car, right?

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.464
So we can just drive
through the city, making a beat.

00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:01.694
And it sounds a little
something like this.

00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:03.386
Let's speak to them.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.410
(Beatboxing)

00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:17.333
(Beatboxing ends)

00:02:17.357 --> 00:02:20.190
Alright, so that's how you can
actually speak to each other.

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:22.810
Now, those are really complex
beat patterns, right?

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:25.023
So, we'll do a few beat patterns with you

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:28.459
and you repeat after me so you can begin
to learn these sounds, alright?

00:02:28.483 --> 00:02:29.640
So check this out:

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:47.123 --> 00:02:49.590

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:51.713
[Ts Ts Ka Pb]

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.475
So we can take all of those
different rhythms and sounds,

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.216
and jam with each other
by listening to each other, right?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.624
So right now we're just rolling around,
we're going to drop a phat beat,

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.499
maybe see if we can find some friends.

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:04.673
Check this out!
