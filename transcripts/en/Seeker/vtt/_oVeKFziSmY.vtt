00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.440
I think I need help with my laundry.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.930
Hello washed and left out to dry, Trace here
rockin' new duds on DNews.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.189
You might think science is something only
done in labs, but every week-or-so chances

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.779
are you suspend organic and synthetic fibers
in a solution of water, enzymes, surfactants,

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.720
and detergents to confine particulates and
relax molecular bonds.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.259
In layman's terms: you do laundry, and when
you think about it, it really is like controlled

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.259
chemistry!

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.750
Unfortunately, we don't all do this at-home
science in the same way, which is why when

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.830
doing laundry, we've all messed up a favorite
sweater or shrunk a pair of [pants?] but why

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.180
do these things shrink at all?!

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.320
What's going on there?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.600
So, firstly, there are a couple kinds of fibers
used to make clothing: synthetic and natural.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.260
In general, synthetics are man-made polymers
like polyester, rayon, Kevlar, or acrylic.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.100
Their fibers are strings of petroleum-based
chemical chains.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.770
Synthetics made from petroleum products don't
typically shrink in laundry because the washer

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.479
and dryer do not get hot enough to mess with
their structure.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.040
So, let's ignore those.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Natural fibers, on the other hand, come from
animals and plants.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
The fibers of cotton, wool or silk are naturally
curly and tangled.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.869
When you want to weave these threads into
fabrics, you have to stretch and pull them

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.289
to make them straight.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.450
But if given the opportunity to return to
their natural curly state they will.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.820
And scientists have discovered the heat and
mechanical energy in laundry machines let

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.399
them do just that -- in a process called shrinkage.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.200
There are three kinds of shrinkage: Relaxation,
Felting, and Consolidation.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.909
Relaxing is the immediate release of that
stretching and pulling tension left behind

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.899
from the straightening of the natural fibers.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.049
That tension exists on a molecular level,
and is leftover from the manufacturing process.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.789
When tepid or warm water is added to the natural
fabric, the warmth will let the fabric swell,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.380
reducing the size by about 1 percent.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
Not too shabby.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.369
Felting shrinkage is when the fibers themselves
actually get shorter.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.960
If you magnify wool in an electron microscope
it's made of tiny scales, just like human

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960
hair.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.350
According to a paper in the Textile Research
Journal, the heat from the washer can expand

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.570
these scales letting water get between them.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.210
Water is slippery, so it reduces the coefficient
of friction, and those scales slide together,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.350
contracting rootward, like a retracting car
or radio antenna!

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.430
The third type is Consolidation shrinkage,
and it happens in the laundry process itself.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.470
The mechanical bouncing action of your washer
and drier beats up the fibers, curling them

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.600
back up again.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.580
A 2002 study in The Research Journal of Association
of Universities for Textiles.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.600
found the structure of the fabric affects
shrinkage too.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.870
Denim jeans are tightly-woven cotton so they
only shrink a little, but sweaters are mostly

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.870
air!

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.080
So they can shrink as much as 30 percent according
to Popular Science.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.900
Even the natural moisture content of the fibers
themselves can affect shrinkage: cotton has

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.050
about 5 percent, wool has about 17 percent,
so over-drying can will inevitably cause clothing

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.390
to change shape.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.370
In World War II, Nazi scientists added plastics
to wool to fill in the spaces and solidify

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.560
the fibers, sometimes, and today this continues
with manufacturers weaving in non-shrinking

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.080
synthetics, and chemists inventing new anti-shrinking
agents to cover natural fibers and keep them

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.110
from curling up.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.000
Look, scientists who did write papers on shrinkage
were quick to point out: everyone does laundry

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
differently.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.390
Water temperature, amount of time, detergent,
clothing fibers, and even machine manufacturer

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.790
all add variables to to the at-home science
project that is laundry.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.020
The best way to love your clothes is to remember:
one: follow the instructions on the tag because

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.020
the people who made it know what's in there
and how to clean it, but when in doubt don't

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.660
add heat and mechanical energy.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.610
Use cold water and avoid the dryer.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.820
And two: remember that natural fiber clothing
is made from the parts of living things!

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.460
Living things aren't supposed to last forever.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.570
And that's okay.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.550
We'd like to take a second and thank our sponsor
for this episode: AT and T. AT&amp;T Digital Life

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.840
smart home security helps keep you connected
to your home, so there are no more what ifs.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.700
Skinny jeans, sweaters, tiny t-shirtsâ€¦ why
am I reminded of hipsters?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.280
Oh, because they're all the same!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.620
At least, that's what this mathematician discovered!

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.980
I did a whole video about it here, so grab
your fancy coffee and give it a click.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.980
Do you love laundry?

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.980
Hate it?

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.740
Super meticulous about it?
