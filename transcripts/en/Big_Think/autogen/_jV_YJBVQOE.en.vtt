00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.800
As I mentioned, I’m at Washington University
which is in St. Louis.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.760
It’s actually quite a beautiful city.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.509
I moved there from Oakland, California—that
was the place I had lived before that.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.220
And moving there—having only lived on both
sides of the country and never in the middle,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.099
and I guess moving in particular to this city—really
opened my eyes to some of the systemic racism

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.940
that was apparent in the city.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.800
It’s a great place and it also has a big
divide.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.870
In fact, locally—and I’m not sure if this
goes on outside the city as well—it’s

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.469
often referred to as the divided city, and
there’s even a line that demarcates where

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:42.540
that divide takes place.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.170
I live one block from that line and I was
seeing, regularly, all kinds of things happen

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.579
that were really eye-opening to me.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.470
I think that the country’s eyes got opened
even wider after Ferguson and many other events

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.579
that continue to happen around the country.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.739
But as a developmental psychologist I really
took a lot of this to heart because I was

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.710
thinking about my kids and the kids that I
was seeing in my lab, and those kids that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.300
weren’t coming into my lab and that I know
lived across that line.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.000
And what should we and could we potentially
be doing, both for the kids but also looking

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.260
at kids with some hope for the future?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.860
Now what we do know, sadly, in children is
that there already are implicit biases that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.720
you can pick up and observe in kids at five
to six years of age.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.080
This is one example of a study that my colleague
Melanie Killen did.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.700
She is at University of Maryland, so close
to Baltimore, and what she found is that different

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.990
children will interpret these scenes very
differently.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.670
And what she discovered in this particular
study is that black kids actually are much

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.040
more optimistic about race than white kids.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.070
Already by first grade, which is the kids
she tested in this study, the white kids were

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.260
having much more negative or pessimistic kinds
of interpretations than the black children

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.760
who were trying to have much more positive
interpretations.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.489
An interpretation that’s positive, for example,
would be like, “Oh, it looks like he fell

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.380
off the swing and the other kid was waiting
to see if he needed help.”

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.840
A not so positive interpretation would be
something like, “I think he pushed him off

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
the swing so that he could use it.”

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.700
So what we were thinking about is how might
we go ahead and take action and be looking

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.800
at the kids?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.810
What could we do earlier?

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.560
Are we already seeing that these biases are
developing already in the preschool years?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.360
What might we be doing, are there ways that
we can step in and intervene on this?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.140
So we know that babies notice differences
between people of all kinds, whether people

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.420
speak different languages, have different
color skin, act differently.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.710
We also know that by three years of age children
are already noticing power and status differences,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.260
and that by five or six years of age, as I
said, we’re already seeing implicit biases

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.590
about these.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.210
What is happening in the preschool years?

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.220
We wanted to ask a few questions.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.630
I’m only going to show you two things that
we’ve been looking at in this.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.630
Now our participants, our kids that are in
these studies, are at preschools all over

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.880
the city of St. Louis.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.960
I’m going to report today data that’s
coming from kids that are in racially homogenous

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.900
schools so they’re schools that are mostly
all black kids and black teachers or mostly

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.550
all white kids and white teachers.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.130
But we’re also testing at a number of mixed
schools that are in the city.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.130
Most of the kids in homogenous schools also
come from pretty homogenous neighborhoods

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.360
of both races.And we put them in these two
tasks: Accuracy task, which is just having

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.990
somebody name those three objects and either
saying them accurately—it’s a cup, it’s

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.500
a ball, and it’s a book—or naming them
wrong, inaccurately—it’s a pencil, it’s

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.720
a fork, and it’s a shoe.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.880
And what we see in lots and lots of studies
previously, by many colleagues of mine and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.630
myself, is that children prefer the person
who is accurate, and they also prefer to learn

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.630
from that person.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.030
So what we wanted to ask them here is—all
we did was change out the race of one of these

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.750
speakers and ask them which one of these people
would you like to have as your teacher?

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.430
And we did that in the accuracy task.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.972
So one of these was always accurate and one
wasn’t.

00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:20.290
Then we also put them into a simple teacher
preference task.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.340
We didn’t give them any background information.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.410
We just asked which of these would you like
to have as your teacher.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.750
And these were always different people.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.780
I think I may have put the same faces up,
but they’re always different.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.570
And what we found in these racially homogenous
schools is that both white and black children

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.240
wanted an accurate person to teach them stuff
and to be their teacher.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.940
So it didn’t matter: black, white, they
wanted the accurate person.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.700
That’s who they wanted to be their teacher.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.220
However, when we simply asked them, “Which
one of these people do you prefer to be your

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.270
teacher?” both races of kids preferred the
white teacher.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.910
I’ll leave that there for a minute just
to sink.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.690
These are three- to six-year-old kids.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.210
Now we also put them in a marshmallow task,
which has long been used to look at how kids

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.030
delay gratification that has all kinds of
successful outcomes.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.889
But we wanted to look at something else.

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.930
More recently some findings have suggested
that you might get different effects in this

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.490
marshmallow test depending on how much you
trust that the speaker is going to come back.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.460
So we wanted to use this as sort of a measure
of trust in the speaker.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.740
And what we did is present kids—again, black
or white kids—and the only difference between

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.400
them was whether they got a black experimenter
or a white experimenter to do the marshmallow

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400
task with them.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400
And this is all they are.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.520
They’re sat down at a table in a room, you’re
given a big enticing marshmallow and they’re

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.960
told, “Just wait.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:07:27.580
I’m going to be back and 
if 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:08:53.290
you don’t eat that before I 

00:08:53.290 --> 00:09:21.899
get back I’m going to 

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:41.240
actually 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:10:01.939
give 
you another marshmallow so you’ll have two.

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:03.129
Bye!”

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:06.659
And they leave the room.
