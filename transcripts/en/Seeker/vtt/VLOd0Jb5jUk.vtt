00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.810
There’s a scientific consensus that the
4th Indiana Jones movie was the worst.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.650
You know what would have made it better?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190
Lasers.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.350
Hello adventurers, Julian here with DNews.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.360
As interesting as the future is to imagine,
discovering the past is also something that

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.369
fascinates us.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.070
Our species has such a short memory that we’re
always rediscovering who we were just a few

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.150
thousand years ago.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.619
But these clues to where we came from and
how we’ve changed are tough to come by.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.660
usually it takes months of careful work in
remote locations and the progress is slow

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.660
going.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.140
This is where LiDAR comes in.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.399
LiDAR is like RADAR except instead of using
radio waves reflected off of objects to find

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
them, it uses lasers, and as it turns out,
these lasers are perfect for penetrating dense

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.710
vegetation.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.540
LiDAR is speeding up the discovery process.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.360
Last year a team used it to map 140 square
miles of what was under cambodian vegetation

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.110
in less than two weeks.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.489
Researchers were looking in the vicinity of
Angkor Wat, the world’s largest religious

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.750
monument that’s been around since the 11
hundreds.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.490
They managed to find an even older city with
almost 30 previously forgotten temples, and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.280
because they were so overgrown with vegetation,
the temples may be unlooted.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.890
Something similar happened to Tutankhamun;
because his grave was missed by looters, it’s

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.530
one of the best windows into ancient Egypt
we’ve ever found.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.640
Flying lasers around isn’t cheap, it costs
about $350 per square kilometer mapped.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.369
But those who use it argue that it’s much
cheaper than hiring workers and hacking through

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.770
the jungle to discover a site.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.250
The time saving can be immense too.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.000
When researchers used LiDAR in Belize 5 years
ago, they found more in a week than they had

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.250
in the previous 25 years at the site.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.470
Of course there’s still a need for boots
on the ground.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.810
Once you map a site, there’s a lot more
digging and studying to be done to understand

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.810
it.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.960
In this way LiDAR is just another tool archeologists
can use, like a trowel that can see through

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.670
trees and is made of lasers.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.200
Still no advances in snake-spotting technologies
though.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.610
Archeologists hate snakes.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.390
If you want to keep digging into the past,
check out this video Trace made about really

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.600
really really old vintages of wine.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.690
I love the idea of being an archeologist.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.110
Traveling, exploring, having a good excuse
to carry my trusty whip.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.950
If you could be an archeologist anywhere,
where would you go?

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.439
