KATE: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.480
Welcome to Authors at Google
New York, our special

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.575
Valentine's Day Poetry
Workshop.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:13.160
What we're going to do today
is we have four fine poets

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.670
from Four Way Books who will
give readings of their current

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.120
work, and then they will provide
prompts for you to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.680
take home a poem to someone
you love today.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.760
Change it up a little bit
from what is expected.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.299
So it is my great pleasure to
introduce Victoria Lynn McCoy.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.940
She works with Four Way Books,
and has been integral in

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.480
bringing poetry to Google New
York office, and she will

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.880
introduce the first poet.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.120
Thank you.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600
VICTORIA MCCOY: Thank you, Kate,
and to Google for having

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.270
us back, and thank you, all
of you, for being here.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.110
My name is Victoria McCoy.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.270
I'm Assistant Editor and
Publicist for Four Way Books.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.340
We are a nonprofit literary
press based out in Tribeca.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.010
We publish 11 to 13 books
of poetry and short

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.100
fiction each year.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.920
And we are really excited to
have this ongoing partnership

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.350
with Google to bring
poetry to you guys.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.980
So I'll just get started.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.650
Our first reader is Alex
Dimitrov, who was born in

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.970
Sofia, Bulgaria.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.450
He is the recipient of the 2011
Stanley Kunitz Prize from

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.510
the American Poetry Review.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.440
He is the founder of Wild Boys,
a queer poetry salon in

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.380
New York City, works at the
Academy of American Poets,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.120
teaches creative writing at
Rutgers University, and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.880
frequently writes for "Poets
&amp; Writers Magazine."

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.740
Dimitrov is the author of
"American Boys," an e-chapbook

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
from "Floating Wolf Quarterly."
And his new book,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.070
"Begging For It," is just
out from Four Way Books.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.720
He received his MFA in poetry
from Sarah Lawrence College,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.370
and he lives in Manhattan.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.110
Please welcome Alex Dimitrov.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.140
ALEX DIMITROV: Hi.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.850
So I'm going to read
some poems.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.820
I'm thinking maybe
three or four.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.460
And my writing prompt actually
is on a piece of paper.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.390
It's questions, so I guess
I'll read them, but

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.000
I'll pass it down.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.000
Is everyone excited that
it's Valentine's Day?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.740
Yes?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.650
How you feel about
Valentine's Day?

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.000
I have complicated feelings
about that.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.080
OK.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.110
This first poem is called, "This
Is a Personal Poem."

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.170
My self's self is thinking about
itself, trying to sell

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.820
itself a new self.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.040
Don't worry, reader,
I'm not trying to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.040
fool you with language.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.670
I have eyes to do that with.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.110
I have forgotten our history.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.930
I have forgotten how we met.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.170
Reader, are you upset at
how fast we're moving?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.790
I'm likely with you in your
bed, between your hands,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.910
somewhere in your mouth,
before whatever it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.980
is you'll say next.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.580
Say yes, and now, and love to.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.750
Say, what did Judith Butler say
when saying, one is undone

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.980
in the face of the other, by
the touch, by the scent, by

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.400
the feel, by the prospect
of the touch, by the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.390
memory of the feel.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.790
I want to know you, reader.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.450
I want to know a
lot of things.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.600
Can we ever truly forget
about ourselves?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.930
Is every self a self that makes
itself available to

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.710
love, like death, and its
kind availability?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.500
Like language, reader.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.740
Would we still be so unhappy
if we could escape it?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.080
To name the namelessness that
is love in what we read and

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.300
what we see, and what are
feelings, really?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.870
Facts or flaws?

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.170
For something tells me now that
I must leave you, reader.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.390
It's not you, it's me.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.620
We guess at why things end.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.950
We ruin things.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.939
We start and stall, and all,
all, all we do is want.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.200
So it's kind of a poem about
love, but not really.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.770
I was thinking what love poems
to read from this book,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.680
because it's all love
poems, actually.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.170
They're just very different
love poems.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.740
Some are to my father, some are
to people that I've been

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.530
with, some are to women
that I love.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.940
How about--

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.750
this one's called "Uncomplicated
Happiness."

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.160
Maybe I don't want uncomplicated
happiness.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.680
In the morning, one of us turns
to dress away from the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.400
other, although little
has changed.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.690
In a better world, memory
would always

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.690
lead back to affection.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.110
Who is that person on the edge
of the bed looking back?

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.350
Nothing is uncomplicated,
traveler.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.700
Maybe I wanted you to stay
for the wrong reasons.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.130
Maybe it's the wrong
reasons I love.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.410
I, too, am somewhere over an
ocean, writing you this as

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.660
fast as I can.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.926
Now I'll read one
that's kind of--

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:55.190
I don't know, really
about love, or

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.440
apparently about love.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.250
"Sensualism." Sensualism
is not a word.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.015
It's a word that Susan
Sontag used in one

00:06:03.015 --> 00:06:05.830
of her journal entries.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.340
And I loved its use,
and I love her.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.280
So this poem's kind of thinking
about that word, and

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.370
what it is, and a lot
of other stuff.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.050
While lying in bed, I think
about sensualism.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.640
A mosquito presses into my
skin with such cruelty I

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.220
mistake it for love.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.800
The stranger above my window
decides to jump, and doesn't.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.460
Where was I?

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.280
I was opening the door to
your life and mine.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.400
We have some words for each
other, and then what?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.630
We have some nights in a city
next to an ocean filled with

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.050
more longing than
we can describe.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.260
I want to place your hand
close to the knife

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.310
and let it sit there.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.450
I want more than the cut or how
it will gently spill out.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.910
The mosquito will drink for as
long as I'll let it, and I do.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.600
I hold still waiting for you.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.930
The vein rises.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.495
It is this flood of
living that comes.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.800
I'll read one more, and then
I'll do the prompt.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.990
This one's called "The
Composer's Lover."

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:38.080
We had an hour without music, a
nerve brightly turning in a

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.400
closed room of the mind, the
heart's black pool, a word

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.790
that expired into the air
and woke everything.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.660
Your bed slid under an
invisible knife.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.110
What happened to us after
meeting, when the right note

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.770
claimed Manhattan's May morning
like an elegy already

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.100
moving through the living?

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.960
Today, we are among them, here
to unsettle each other, to

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.930
undress beside the piano,
elegant and unmistakably his.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.450
Once it has you, there is a
mouth that never releases, a

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.570
faint circle in a field of
rust hanging on the wall.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.360
We are not there.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.370
We are in our bodies.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.610
Like teeth marks in a shirt you
once saw falling off him,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.799
the delicate taste of blood that
passed between us before

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.774
lust, before anyone
could forgive us.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.610
So I did this project over the
summer called Portraits of 13

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.470
People I Don't Know
From the Internet.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.110
And what it was was this
questionnaire that I posted on

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.830
my Tumblr, and people could come
and, if they wanted to

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.220
engage with it, they could
answer the questions, but they

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.100
had to email me back.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.590
So I sort of tailored it to be
more about love, since it's

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.920
Valentine's Day.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.650
So I'm going to just pass
this out [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.560
So it's nine questions
and one command.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.470
This is called Love Poem, Nine
Questions, One Command.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.020
So I'll just read
the questions.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.300
And I also put my email on
there, if you guys want to

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.510
email me your responses,
if you feel like it.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.940
So it's called Love Poem.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.020
What was the happiest
time in your life?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.130
Do you think you'll
ever be happier?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.140
What wouldn't you do for love?

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.380
What do you want most
while you're here?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.580
What do you want that a
poem can't give you?

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.690
What is the dish you always
order at your favorite

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.420
restaurant?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.900
Do you have a sweater that
hugs you just right?

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.750
Who is the first person you
thought of this morning?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.160
Who is the last person
you thought of

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.290
before bed last night?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.840
And the command is, write
a ten line love poem of

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.100
questions like this one for
one of those people.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.080
So if you guys feel like
it, you can do it.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.000
And if you feel like it, you
can also send it to me.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.230
So thank you.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.480
Thanks for listening.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.290
VICTORIA MCCOY: Our next reader
will be Paul Lisicky,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.300
who's the author of "Lawn Boy,"
"Famous Builder," "The

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.290
Burning House," and most
recently, "Unbuilt Projects,"

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.050
from Four Way Books.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.210
A graduate of the Iowa Writers
Workshop, he's the recipient

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.990
of awards from the National
Endowment for the Arts, the

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.970
James Michener Copernicus
Society, and the Fine Arts

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.370
Work Center in Provincetown.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.380
He's currently the New Voices
professor in the MFA program

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.760
at Rutgers Camden.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.242
Please welcome Paul Lisicky.

00:10:55.242 --> 00:10:56.184
PAUL LISICKY: Hi, everyone.

00:10:56.184 --> 00:11:00.850
It's lovely to be here,
and I'm excited

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.020
about reading for you.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.670
I'm going to read some pieces
that I don't usually

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.540
read from this book.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.080
What's happened in the past few
months since this book has

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.170
been out is that I get notes
from people who identify the

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.500
pieces that--

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.460
the favorites seem to be the
pieces that I don't pick.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.800
So this is for all the people
who like pieces that I have

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.780
neglected, I think.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.960
So the first is called "The
Physics of the Known World."

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.810
It's very short.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.020
This book has a foot in poetry,
it has a foot in

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.590
fiction, and it has a foot
in the lyric essay.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.400
It really wants to live in the
cracks between genres.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.175
So this one is rather short.

00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:47.340
It's all of a paragraph, and I
think of it as a theory of

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.430
love-- one of my theories
of love.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.710
"The Physics of the
Known World."

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.360
That silly retriever.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.890
He doesn't go to the two guys
looking right at him, beaming

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.800
him awake with concentrated
joy.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.935
Not at all.

00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:05.030
He goes straight to the man with
his head turned to the

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.310
left who could care less about
doggie behavior, and isn't the

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.910
least bit stirred by the snout
parked in the knee and the

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.020
wagging hind parts.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.300
And that's it--

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.420
the physics of the known world,
which is why the trees

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.720
look better when they're
left unwatered.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.900
And the birds actually prefer
it when you don't

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.510
sing back to them.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.620
And the holy man crossing
the street with the

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.270
black brimmed hat?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.590
He knows better than to pick up
what he's dropped and lift

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.780
his face to the mountains.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.120
Take it from him, friend.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.830
You probably wouldn't even want
it if the light hit you

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.080
in your head.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.800
The next piece is
a bit longer--

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.640
a bit of a narrative.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.660
This is about a life and death
experience I had with my ex.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.760
And my ex wrote a version of
this-- a very well known poem

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.950
in which I appeared.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.850
And I happened to be in an
audience with him next to the

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.420
poet Brenda Hillman, who turned
to me halfway through

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.420
the reading and said,
Paul, you write

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.410
your version of that.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:15.400
So this is my version of Mark's
version of this story,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.160
and it's called "In the
Unlikely Event."

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.240
I don't know why I
never read this.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.830
There's something to be
unpacked in that.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.150
When I watched her teaching us
the fundamentals of emergency

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.970
crash position, I thought,
this woman likes

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.790
her movies too much.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.710
How else to account
for the way she

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.780
smiled through her tears?

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.370
Why turn her back on us
and sob into her fist?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.360
I looked over my shoulder.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.740
Were we sure this wasn't
being filmed?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.460
Allen Funt.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.970
Where on the plane
was Allen Funt?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.630
Nevertheless, I behaved as
I was supposed to behave.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.320
I tried not to fuss.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.760
I tried not to make too much of
the coiffed businesswoman

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.720
to our left, who reached into
the seat pocket in front of

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.300
her, and with refinement and
discretion, put her air

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.790
sickness bag to good use.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.630
Surely we'd laugh and clap and
laugh at the whole damn thing.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.110
And it was only when Mark took
my hand the way others around

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.540
us took their neighbors' hands
that I felt the surge of

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.180
heartbreak, adrenaline, and
embarrassment that lets us

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.370
know we're not asleep.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.880
How, then, in the time that
followed, did I become someone

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.620
I didn't know?

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.960
It wasn't wisdom.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.580
I had as much wisdom in my head
as there were pain pills

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.550
in my back pocket,
which meant none.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.650
And it certainly wasn't cool.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:42.140
Even strapped in my seat and
chastened, I felt my left hand

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.830
tapping out a warning code.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.040
Maybe some of it had to do with
the years I wouldn't get

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.750
to live out with Mark,
the fun we'd miss,

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.980
our house, our dogs.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.880
Who would watch over our dogs?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.560
At least the two of us would go
down at once, if that was

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.210
any kind of comfort.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.080
But what did comfort mean when
Mark looked so unguarded and

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.540
hurt, as if he were determined
to take it personally, and

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.180
couldn't foresee that he'd one
day get a poem out of the

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.200
experience?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.390
And here's where another
stepped in.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.420
I wouldn't have believed it
either, if you'd told me that

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.930
my mother leapt up from her
house in Florida like some

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.850
superhero ready to
save the day.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.320
But there she was, standing at
her sink, running hot water

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.800
over a jar she couldn't open.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.250
And when I thought of her
getting that phone call the

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.440
next morning, just
as she wrenched

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.340
off the lid, I numbed.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.570
Not because she loved me better
than anyone, or because

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.940
I remotely approximated the son
she'd wanted me to be, but

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.860
because she'd had enough for one
life, and the thought of

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.150
making her suffer--

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.920
guilt--

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.730
even in my last minutes above
Earth, was not something I

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.820
could take on right now.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.400
So my two legs pushed into the
floor as if it were possible

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.880
to pilot the plane myself, even
as the damn thing wobbled

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.010
and swung and the silos
of the Midwest

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.870
looked nearer and nearer.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.530
That's when I went through
the window.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.270
The tiny square window
to my right.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.230
Pinned to my seat, squeezing
Mark's hand, I thought myself

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.490
into that sky, taking myself out
of the body that was sure

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.740
to be pummeled and burned.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.170
I was aware of my ability to
influence and not, and there

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.670
was a calm to the procedure like
what must feel like to be

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.720
an addict on a good day, when
you push your blood back and

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.630
forth through the works.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.080
Was that why the treetops
beneath us were greener than

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.380
mangrove, or why I could so
readily think of each person

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:49.050
who mattered, and put a hand on
each forehead and each face

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.740
as if I'd always been faithful
to the god I'd prayed to as a

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.350
child, but hadn't known
that until now?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.340
I thought some of the light into
the head of each person

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.190
on the plane--

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.579
to Mark, to the flight
attendant, even to the pilot,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.700
who must have been doing the
best he could with the

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.950
creature that was trying and
failing to hold us aloft.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.240
Not to mention my mother.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.609
Maybe that's why we landed as
smoothly as we did, or I'm

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:18.829
kidding myself.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.490
Because just when it was
clear that we were

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.829
out of harm's way--

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.615
though I'm not telling
you the whole story.

00:17:24.615 --> 00:17:28.270
I'm leaving out firemen and
ambulances and a line of

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.330
tornadoes too obscene
to talk about--

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.350
I felt something like rage as we
waited to be transported by

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.930
bus by members of the
National Guard.

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.910
Rage to be back in a body
after the high of

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.310
being out of it.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.670
Rage to realize I'd never
outsmart death.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.240
Though a part of me had tricked
myself into thinking

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.490
I'd passed some test.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.060
And, I'm going to close with a
short piece called "Two Guys."

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.860
Do any of you guys remember
a discount

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.520
store called Two Guys?

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:10.000
It's very far from the
world of Google 2013.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.420
I guess it was a precursor to
Target and the discount stores

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.510
we know today, and that's sort
of the figure around which

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.305
this piece revolves.

00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:23.900
That's all you gotta
know. "Two Guys."

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.790
When you've lost what you
remembered, New Jersey became

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.000
as tired as they said it was,
and childhood sprang traps

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.325
ready to bite into the
skin of our ankles.

00:18:34.325 --> 00:18:36.080
Will we get it back?

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.170
Maybe it's a relief that we've
left it behind, and we can

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.200
both give thanks for the this
bout of forgetfulness.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.730
I never really missed Two Guys
as much as I missed you--

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.240
the automatic doors, the trading
stamps, the blinding

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.100
interior, monstrous
as a spaceship.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.440
You deserve better
than nostalgia.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.690
There's always more to give
our lives to, even if we

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.166
thought we'd landed at
the end of the world.

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.870
May the stores be better
where you are.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.750
May you not waste a single
second thinking about what you

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.230
should or shouldn't buy.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.950
And if you should hear a boy
calling for his mother by the

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.640
record department, walk on.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.210
He's doing much better than
you think, really.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.590
He owes you that.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.870
The songs are blue and
glistening, even if he has a

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.980
hard time making sense
of them from here.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.580
So thank you.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.255
My prompt.

00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.505
My prompt.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.770
Write about an object while
you think the word goodbye

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.250
without using the word
goodbye in the piece.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.430
I'll say it again.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:54.250
Write about an object, and think
about the word goodbye

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.860
without using the word
goodbye in the piece.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.870
And that is it.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.120
Thanks very much.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.590

Arts, and the Fine

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.110
Please welcome Victoria Redel.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.750
VICTORIA REDEL: I feel
like I should be

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.830
running a board meeting.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.680
That's what I was thinking.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.480
Like Alex, I feel like most of
my book is some version of a

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:01.370
love poem or the end of love,
so I'm going to read four

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:07.320
poems, and this first one is
a poem called "Upgrade."

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.210
I don't want to say it didn't
fit, never worked, or worked

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.750
at first, then in fits and
starts, the switches useless,

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.730
gears stripped.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.410
No, I don't want customer
service, a claims department,

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.420
complaint letters, an exchange
or credit towards the latest

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:31.100
model, an upgrade, or lifetime
parts replacement.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.540
Even now, broken, chipped, in
pieces, pieces lost, worn out,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.950
the original gone, there
are times still it

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.880
comes back to me whole.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.740
And I am amazed by what is
beyond fragile, by how

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.590
elaborately and generously
wrecked and beyond repair we

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.970
made use of our hearts all
those years, and then.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.390
So this poem sort of, I guess,
in a certain way, is a

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.660
Valentine, this next one.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.860
I think of a Valentine as being
some kind of direct

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.210
address to someone, you know?

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:15.620
Some little heart you're giving,
in some version of it.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.740
"Today We're This World's
Darling."

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:23.350
All the trees on Broadway
thrill white petals--

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.470
different time of year
than Valentine's Day.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.100
All the trees on Broadway
thrill white petals.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.280
Daffodils gather in bouquets to
fling themselves at us like

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.850
schoolgirls.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.930
Shopkeepers lean from doors, tip
hats, toss candy and fish.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.040
Sidewalks sparkle up
to catch our eye.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.050
Holy moly, even the incorrigible
past has arrived,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.680
pledging it will finally learn
goodness and mercy.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.120
Don't look up.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.530
Don't wave back or wink.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.410
Hurry off the avenue
and bolt the door.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:01.840
By tomorrow, snickering,
showoff, fake, they'll croon

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.280
for Lindsay, or Nick's black
eye, the publicist of

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.810
someone's rehabbed
heart rumors.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.960
Maples will turn gold
for his comeback.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.180
Ovid can tell you, give it 15
minutes, and if you're lucky,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.050
you're banished to an island.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:24.130
Or like Poe, your obit written
by the enemy Griswold declares

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.520
in print, few will grieve.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.920
There's Bessie Smith in
her unmarked grave.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.170
Let biographers flock to the
clever and pretty, declare us

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.080
old, drab, utterly
last season.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.130
And when they're gone, chasing
the next fabulous story, say

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.630
again just one of those things
I can't repeat here--

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.480
those gorgeous, scandalous,
tender words you say to me

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.420
each morning that would make
them quiver that would change

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.840
their lives.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.515
So this next one I'm going to
read I've only ever read out

00:23:57.515 --> 00:24:03.910
loud once before, and it's a
poem called "Kissing." And how

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.710
I came to write it was that I
had received an invitation to

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.070
be part of an anthology which
was an anthology called "Dirty

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.990
Words," and each of the writers
could choose a dirty

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.235
word and write a piece
about it-- a

00:24:18.235 --> 00:24:19.330
poem, a story, an essay.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.220
Whatever they wanted.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.820
I received my list of dirty
words, and they were really

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.650
pretty dirty words.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.430
And I kind of looked at
it, and I thought,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.460
oh, I'll choose later.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.770
And I freaked out and put it
away, and then didn't deal

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.550
with it for a while.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.920
And then they came back and they
said, well, it's great.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.880
Everyone's chosen words.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.900
There are two words left.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.950
And one word was condom,
and the other

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.700
word was a dirty Pierre.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.880
I didn't know what
dirty Pierre was.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.750
Oh, look, someone
knew what it--

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.380
I had no clue what it was, so
I thought, well, I'm really

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.840
out of this anthology.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.990
But I looked and looked at the
list, and I realized that the

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.630
word kissing wasn't on the
list of dirty words.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:03.940
So I decided to try to write a
poem called "Kissing," and try

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.560
to look at it as seriously
as I could.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.940
"Kissing."

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.750
The first surprise of your mouth
and mine, on streets, on

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.680
staircases, in bathrooms, in the
backs of cabs, in a field

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.250
against that wall and that
wall and that wall.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.480
Down on the floor, my hair
caught in it, in hotel beds,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.710
in a borrowed bed, and in the
same bed, night after night

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.030
after year after night, through
an open window, under

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.550
pines, underwater, on a raft,
in rain, salty with ocean, a

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.580
peck at the door, a
have a good day.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.210
Our mouths, prepositional.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.700
Eyes open, eyes closed, your
face in transport.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.200
Combustible.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.360
At the sink doing dishes, and
suddenly you're turning me,

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.880
saying, give me your mouth, and
I'm giving you my mouth,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:58.160
coming up out of it stunned,
like there is another room

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.860
inside, and then another room.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.000
Strawberries, sourness of
coffee, a slight fizzy

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.120
sweetness of a clean grass taste
as only you taste, your

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.400
face so close to mine.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.910
A fluency accented, each vowel
and consonant exactly formed.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.100
Sudden native speakers.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.900
Morning just wakened, still slow
and thick and dreaming,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.450
turning away from your reach.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.670
Kissing like nobody's business,
like something

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.550
windy, like good weather.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.260
In winter, our mouths the
warmest place in the city.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.800
A lower lip flecked by teeth
pulling back just a little to

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.350
breathe together.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:44.700
Snuck, stolen, last, first,
unbidden, forbidden, sloppy,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.900
delicious, French, farewell,
slippery, criminal.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.710
A private syntax.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.790
Pun and slang, slip of
tongue, intentional.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.470
Could I have known on the
Harwood building's stairwell

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.130
with my first fast dry
12-year-old kiss that I'd

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.930
become a woman who'd drive
across state lines for the

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.290
moment just before
the kiss begins?

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.920
What I miss is the makeout.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.860
That's what I go for if I had
an night on the lam, the

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.480
married woman says, looking at
a couple who have rolled off

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.830
their picnic blanket.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:22.580
One of us might say, only this,
and then it's the first

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.800
night all over again, tumble and
wrestle, every mystical,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.260
dirty, delicious thing
two mouths manage.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.060
Kiss me goodbye, you say, and
on a street among strangers

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.470
and floppy hats and winter
coats, we slip into one

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.180
another to say last apologies
and promises.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.460
In a bank line, or sitting
at a table with

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.250
friends, I touch my mouth.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:47.890
I am drifting, or you are
drifting, and one pressed

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.430
against the other whispers,
good night.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.640
The last one.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.380
The day's punctuation.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.210
This is the last one.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.850
"And Then."

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.960
What if, darling, tonight we
tell only the best stories we

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.150
have of other loves?

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.460
Not just nights of pleasure,
but the way he laughed from

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.600
the back of his throat, the
truthful things she said that

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.980
made you cry.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.590
What about that spring wind, and
when there was a bicycle,

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.250
a downpour, and someone had
or didn't have a poncho?

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.240
Someone said the very thing
you longed to hear.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.310
You told a secret,
and were safe.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.750
She had a fever.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.430
He lost a father.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.980
There were good meals.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.700
To think of those fine shoes we
scuffed about in, thinking

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.310
we were royalty.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.200
And remember that plastic tiara,
and the clumsy pavan?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.960
Remember what you wished,
and how he wished, too?

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.870
Look at us now drink coffee,
talk about the day's

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.200
particulars and possibilities.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.030
Morning light folds across
the wood table.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:56.280
Could we bear to look at one
another knowing how full the

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.260
heart has already been?

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.900
How we come together as not just
thankful refugees from

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.490
sorrow, but wild too, with easy
days of mismatched socks?

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.210
This morning, we think we
couldn't be happier.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.180
That's courage.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.580
We thought it before.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:20.220
So my prompt to you guys is
to think of objects--

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.700
socks, shoes, lights, tables,
all the things in a life.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.650
And think of them in relation
to the sentence, when you

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.010
left, what I started
to think about was.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.070
So, when you left, what I
started to think about was.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.320
Thanks.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.230
VICTORIA MCCOY: Our final reader
today will be Jonathan

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.210
Wells, whose poems have appeared
in "The New Yorker,"

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.710
"Poetry International,"
"Hayden's Ferry," and other

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.180
publications.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.950
He's the author of "Train Dance"
from Four Way Books,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:58.250
and edited "Third Rail, The
Poetry of Rock and Roll" from

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.700
MTV Books, which was
published in 2007.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.780
He lives and works
in New York City.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.725
Please welcome Jonathan Wells.

00:30:07.725 --> 00:30:08.206
JONATHAN WELLS: Hello.

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.456
Thanks for coming.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:18.700
I'm going to read a couple of
poems from "Train Dance,"

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.335
although I didn't really think
of it as a book of love poems

00:30:22.335 --> 00:30:27.170
in any conventional or
unconventional sense.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:32.210
So I may have to read a couple
which aren't in the book, just

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.910
because that's what the
situation demands.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.170
This is called "London
Plane," and it's

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.370
not a plane to London.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:48.780
It's a tree, which will
become very clear.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.180
"London Plane."

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:57.370
When I'm alone, the tree I love
whispers and calls to me,

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:00.020
indifferent to the season.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.910
I come to her in spring, when
she's in bud, and winter when

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.700
she's naked, only
one side warm.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.530
In fall, she forgets
herself and dreams.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.500
I come to her for learning and
read her bark like Braille.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:25.530
Her arms are twisted, lifted for
attention, glassed in rain

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.870
or wrapped in mist, or grey.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.360
She speaks from her own
wisdom, not always

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.250
prompted by the wind.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:41.430
I come without ideas of love,
for she is already rough and

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:46.750
rounded, cankered, tall,
and we are not alone.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:50.770
Finches listen from her
branches, and plastic bags

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:56.210
luff, confiding my desires
in the wind.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:32:00.250
The tree I love lowers me
from my window ledge,

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.680
equal to her height.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.240
She says, sit close to me.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.390
When I call to you, what
loneliness makes you listen?

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:24.830
The next poem is "Untitled,"
which is its title.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:31.560
You taught me the river, its
slender hands, fugitive smile,

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.040
and phosphorescence.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.280
The river became my
blood, my voice.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.580
Some mornings, when the earth
smells of earthworms and mist,

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.050
a guitar will steal the river's
chords from the

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.320
underneath of leaves.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.550
A violin will take its
deeper wood, the cat

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:56.110
gut strings its notes.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:33:00.890
We walk the river, rock to
rock, the river's shape a

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.730
fossil snake and a million
miles of rock.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:10.100
The ears, the mouth, the neck,
the bitten palm of rock.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.080
Watch it go.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.490
Oh, never let me go.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:27.180
As you'll see from my prompt,
I think I specialize in

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.520
indirectness.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:37.030
And so this is a poem called
"Squirrel Watching."

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:43.130
The leash is taut, her doleful
eyes transfixed as she lifts

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:47.720
her snout to heaven, every
imaginable taste

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.160
almost in her mouth.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.500
Tickling tail boa, crunchy
bones, and haunch.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:00.890
The squirrel freezes his body
spread eagled on the bark,

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:06.190
terrified alert, condescending
to a love that smells so much

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.130
like blood.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.449
Each feature is profound.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:15.949
Wide black eyes stunned open,
many paws circling a nut in a

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:21.500
blur, a dash of rust splashed on
his back, peaky ears, and a

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.100
white throat scarf.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.980
Her love is the devouring
of the whole in parts.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.690
She waits, measuring his speed
against her strike, and leaps,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.750
believing it was true.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:40.210
But if it were, the world would
be bare of squirrels

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:41.460
that looked away.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.510
And my poems are short.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:57.120
I guess I've got time
for one or two more.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.480
This is called "The Second
Book of Love."

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:07.310
He read aloud to her from "The
Second Book of Love," and all

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.300
the other books.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.440
She listened without listening,
as if it were a

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.480
mist that drifted through her.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.290
He read, not noticing
she slept.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.000
He didn't know these words would
one day shape his lips.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.220
The old feelings would slip
away and disappear.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.090
The trees would shine in an
amber light that the once

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.370
fresh light had turned into.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:41.810
Some pages would be as bright
as sun spots on the surface.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:46.050
Others would be torn or torched
under a magnifying

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.090
glass without remorse.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.600
Crossed out words could
still be glimpsed.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.130
It was a work still circling,
a story that lay open on the

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:03.500
lectern of crowded rooms and
distracted nights, written by

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.040
two unlinked hands.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.740
It was made from the five
senses, and the sense of

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.450
hovering above the air.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.240
It was the book of hours,
the strip of days.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.140
In its line was the confusion
between what was unsayable and

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.390
what can't be said.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.270
Last poem that I'll read is--

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:34.260
we moved into a new district
recently, which has a lot of

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.490
shops which sell wigs.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.850
So I always imagined
which one I'd like.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.640
And so I actually never went
into the wig shops, and wrote

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.250
the poem instead.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.090
"House of Wigs."

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.340
The sky was low.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.510
His head was a vase of
sorrows he wanted

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.740
to fill with blossoms.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.130
He stepped into the
house of wigs.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.730
The sales lady said,
try this one on.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.250
It's called the mind of fire.

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.470
It turns ashes into flame.

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.660
Prometheus was wearing it, they
say, when he was punished

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.420
by the gods for his
compassion.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:24.070
And he barely felt the eagle's
claws landing on his stomach.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.330
This one is known as the parable
of spring for its

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.700
rhythm and its pageant.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.630
The fresh grass and forsythia
will carry you towards summer,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:39.060
your body lithe and
unencumbered, your hunger fed

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.750
by fields of daisies.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.960
I'm wearing love's crown, she
said, because love shouldn't

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.350
be a neon idol shining
on a shelf.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:56.490
It must be worn and worn
through, and not just the love

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.730
you bring, but what you can
accept, especially when the

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:04.540
days are short and brooding.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.790
Go ahead, she said.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.070
Put it on.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.405
Stand next to the light.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:20.080
So I guess when I was trying to
think of a prompt, and what

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.500
might be helpful, I couldn't
really think about what I do,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.480
because I don't know
what I do.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.690
But based on what I've done, I
tried to figure out what I do.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:39.230
And so what I think that would
be helpful is to think about

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:45.800
someone or something you love,
and think of something as

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.170
specific, as particular as you
can get about the person.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:54.920
A look, an expression,
a gesture.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.880
And don't think about
naming the emotion.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:06.070
Think about the thing, and then
the emotion itself will

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.610
come through it.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:12.350
And so that's not as specific a
prompt as one could get, but

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.220
that's the best I can do.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.130
Good luck.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.380
Thank you.
