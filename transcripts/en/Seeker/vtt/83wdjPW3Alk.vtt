00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.130
A sand dune in Indiana has started swallowing
people walking on its face.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.880
It's like nature is fighting back.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.260
Hello there people of House Atreides, Trace
here reporting on a horrrrrible thing for

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.360
DNews.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.650
Science is now exploring how and why sand
dunes will eat you.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.060
No I'm not talking about the lighting sand
or pit of Sarlacc, Arrakis or any of that.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.269
I'm talking about REAL SAND ON REAL DUNES
HERE ON EARTH THAT CAN SWALLOW YOU WHOLE.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.149
The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is gorgeous,
I've been there a few times and it's beautiful,

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.350
but it seems, it has the potential to be deadly.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.489
Picture this, six-year-old boy walking down
a sand dune next to a beautiful freshwater

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.489
inland sea.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.280
Then suddenly, without warning, he disappears.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.289
His parents run screaming toward the boy and
find nothing but sand.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.819
A hole had appeared below this kids feet and
before he OR his nearby parents could do anything

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.579
he had disappeared beneath the sand!!

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.979
Three hours later, and eleven feet down, emergency
personnel pulled him out!

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:05.979
ELEVEN FEET.

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.350
Nearby, was a geologist from Indiana University
Northwest and she is now one of many studying

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.450
the dunes to find the cause of this sand swallowing.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.070
She believes we're seeing a new geological
phenomenon forming right under our feet.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.500
More holes have appeared and disappeared and
to find out what's going on, the National

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.720
Park Service is ON THE CASE.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.979
They're using GPS, ground penetrating radar
and other fancy technology to explore what's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.799
going on under the surface of this 200 foot
pile of sand.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.640
But so far they're not sure what's happening.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.140
Because dunes SHOULDN'T HAVE HOLES!

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.039
See, sand dunes form when the wind drops the
stuff it's carrying in the same spot for thousands

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.039
of years.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.049
When the wind blows over a sandy region, like
the warm beaches of Lake Michigan, sand particles

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.090
are pulled along with it -- bouncing a few
inches above the surface.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.929
If something blocks the flow of sand, like
denser air, mountains, opposing wind forces,

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.179
or even a small ridge; then WHAMMY, a dune
will form.

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.369
When conditions are perfect, giant dunes like
Mount Baldy can form.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.830
When you build a dune like this, one particle
of sand at a time, there's not a lot of room

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.019
for air or water to get trapped inside the
sandy mountain.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.099
Sinkholes // which are terrifying // form
when erosion removes the support structure

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.900
under a layer of earth.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.629
Quicksand is the same, it's water erosion
of the layers UNDER the sand.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.190
So, unlike quicksand or sinkholes there's
nothing under there making room for people

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.190
to be sucked in.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.459
One hypothesis claims trees and structures
once on a plain around the dune have now been

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.230
swallowed by this shifting mountain and as
they rot they leave spaces for more sand to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.230
fall in.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.090
But that doesn't fully explain the problem.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.340
Science is bumfuzzled!

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.340
So what's the fix?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.769
The National Park Service isn't sure.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.830
Like deserts and marshes, dunes are a delicate
balance of nature.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.900
Too much plant life solidifies the ground
creating a hill, too little and the dune blows

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.900
away.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.909
Baldy is in a sweet spot where the whole dune
can grow and shift; and it's currently moving

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.420
inland away from the lake, year after year.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.159
Dunes in China are going the same way, threatening
villages as they move 65 feet (20M) every

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.159
year.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.409
For the moment, the dune is close to the public
while they research what could be causing

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.040
these collapses, but this is a REAL science
mystery!

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.720
What do you think could be causing these holes?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
You should tell us your own cocka-mamy theories
down in the comments, I'm sure you've got

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.930
an idea.
