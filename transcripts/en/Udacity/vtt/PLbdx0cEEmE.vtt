00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The only one that is necessary is the second one--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
if the attacker doesn't know anything about the key.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A one-time pad is a perfect cipher, and as a perfect cipher,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the computation power of the adversary is irrelevant.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The first one is not true.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The second statement is true, because if an attacker knows something about the key,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
she or he will know something about the message,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which would compromise the confidentiality.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It is not necessary to assume that the attacker cannot modify the message.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Modifying the message only effects the integrity of the message,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but that does not effect the confidentiality.
