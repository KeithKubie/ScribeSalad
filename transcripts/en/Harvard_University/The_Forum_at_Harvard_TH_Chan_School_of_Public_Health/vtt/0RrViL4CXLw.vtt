MICHELLE WILLIAMS:
Welcome to the forum,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.200
live streamed, worldwide,
from the Leadership Studio

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.260
at the Harvard T.H Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.840
The forum is a collaboration
between the Harvard Chan School

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.090
and independent news media.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.030
Each program features
a panel of experts

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.900
addressing some of today's most
pressing public health issues.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.450
The forum is one way
the school advances

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.210
the frontiers of
public health and makes

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.230
scientific insights accessible
to policymakers and the public.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.740
I hope you find this program
engaging and informative.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.950
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:01.830
DAVID FREEMAN: Hello,
everyone, and welcome.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.960
My name is David Freeman.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.660
I'm the editorial
director of NBC News Mach,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.660
which is m-a-c-h.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.430
I'm also today's moderator, and
I'll introduce our panelists

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.970
right away.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.280
Starting to my immediate
right, Walter Willett,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.250
Professor of Epidemiology and
Nutrition at the Harvard T.H.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.470
Chan School of Public Health.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.305
Gina McCarthy, Professor
of the Practice

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:22.430
of Public Health in the
Department of Environmental

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.350
Health at the
Harvard Chan School,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.260
and also the 13th administrator
of the Environmental Protection

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.250
Agency.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650
David Bennell, the Manager
of Food, Land and Water

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.170
and Member Relations at
the World Business Council

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.820
for Sustainable Development.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.380
And on a Ana Sortun, chef
and owner of the restaurant

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.250
Oleana here in Cambridge,
and winner of the James Beard

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.270
Award.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.130
This event is being presented
jointly with NBC News Digital.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770
We're streaming
live on the websites

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.900
of the forum and NBC News Mach.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.410
We're also streaming live
on Facebook and YouTube.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.690
This program will
include a brief Q&amp;A,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.727
and you can email questions to
the forum at hsph.harvard.edu.

00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:02.060
You can also participate in
a live chat that's happening

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.970
on the forum site right now.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.830
So with a total population of
about 7 and 1/2 billion today,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.840
the world is already
pretty crowded

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.810
and the global population is
expected to reach 10 billion

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.340
by 2050.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.300
How can we feed
that many people?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
How can we do that while
protecting human health

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.280
and the health of the planet?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.950
One thing's for sure, I think
the panelists here would agree,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.690
we can't do what
we've been doing

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.560
because current patterns of
food production and consumption

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.410
aren't good for our
bodies or for the planet.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
Earlier this year, the
EAT-Lancet commission

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.330
introduced a planetary
health diet that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.420
offers possible solutions, and
Walter, you're a part of that,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.070
or you co-authored the report.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.310
Can you please tell us what
it is, and take us through it?

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.620
WALTER WILLETT:
Sure, the challenge

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.070
put to this commission was
to feed the world a diet that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.490
is healthy and
sustainable, and by 2050,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.160
will reach close to
10 billion people.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.280
And as you said, we're
currently far off track

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.260
from arriving at that goal.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.020
Therefore, the commission really
faced a tremendous challenge.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.920
In fact, just to
paint a quick picture,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.810
if we look at the nutritional
status of the world,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.780
it's not a pretty picture.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.630
We have, still, about
800 million people

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.040
who are undernourished.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.030
We have about 2 billion people
who are overweight or obese,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.170
and that number is increasing
rapidly all around the world.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.050
And most of the
rest of the world

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.870
is eating a diet that's
far from optimal.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.750
And to make it more
complicated, as you also

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.460
noticed, the way
we produce our food

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.650
and the way we produce
what we're eating today

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.630
is degrading the
planet, and really

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.310
undermining the
resources that are

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.960
critical to feed the future
population of the world.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.920
And then we are adding close
to 2 and 1/2 billion people

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.630
by 2050.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.450
That's a pretty
daunting challenge,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.570
given that, to arrive at a
sustainable and healthy diet

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.860
for everyone.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.390
So to get at this issue,
we broke the process down

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.930
into several steps.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.850
The first was to, using
the best available evidence

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.350
from all around the world, to
define what is a healthy diet.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.470
And I can't go into all
of the details of that,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.770
but if I could have a slide up,
basically, what we realized,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.630
putting all the
evidence together,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.610
was that there's quite
a bit of flexibility.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.510
And this allows a lot
of diversity of diets

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.320
from different cultures,
different agricultural systems,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
but primarily this will
mean a substantial shift

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.040
from what we're doing today,
to a diet that is largely

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.920
plant based, but still has some
meat, some dairy, fish in it.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.060
And plenty of healthy foods
in the diet, more nuts, more

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.350
fruits, vegetables, legumes,
and the amount of fish

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.280
would increase, given from
what we are doing today.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.810
Very briefly, this slide
shows the major food groups,

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.620
and the vertical line toward
the left of that figure

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.640
is, essentially, the target
numbers that we came up with

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.340
to define an optimally
healthy diet.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.150
And then the various
bars indicate

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.710
what different regions of
the world are eating today.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.880
And as you can see, we're
in general, quite a bit

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.887
over the target
numbers for red meat,

00:05:33.887 --> 00:05:35.970
but that's very different
for different countries.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.150
Southeast Asia, for example,
is below the target number.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.250
So there's a lot of variability.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.160
But toward the
bottom, we see again

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.310
that the healthy foods fruits,
nuts, legumes, soy products,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.460
nuts where we would be better
off with substantial increases.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.310
We use several
different approaches

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.010
to evaluate the
healthfulness of this diet,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.530
and they all converge to just
that if we did, our world, move

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.900
to this these
dietary targets, we

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.090
would prevent about 11 million
premature deaths per year,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.380
which is about 20% to 25% of
the total deaths for a year.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.170
So there's a huge health benefit
of adopting this healthy diet.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.880
We then, as a
second step, went on

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.670
to look at whether
we could possibly

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.520
produce this diet within
the planetary boundaries.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.370
We can't infinitely produce
more greenhouse gas,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.080
use unlimited amounts of water.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.620
There are planetary
boundaries that

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.130
have been defined by
other research groups.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.460
And the good news is when
we went through all of this,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.850
that it is possible to feed the
world a healthy and sustainable

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.480
diet by 2050, but it will
require major changes

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.525
in what we eat, and how
we produce our food.

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:51.650
DAVID FREEMAN: Will, and
part of that you mentioned

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.987
the role of environmental change
in global warming, and so on.

00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:57.570
That's going to be a big thing
that we'll talk about in a bit,

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.150
but let's watch a brief
clip at this point that

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.950
shows how climate change
has been affecting

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.160
the food that we--

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.630
affecting our planet.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.833
This clip refers to the
year 2000 through 2009,

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.750
and of course the four
hottest years of record

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.598
have occurred since then,
in 2015 16 17 and 18.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:15.140
And a warming planet
really does have

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.660
a big impact on our
systems, our food systems.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.540

Goddard Space Flight Center.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.480
Let's take a look at that.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.925
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.590
SPEAKER 1: All of the
events of the past decade,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.870
all of our memories,
have something in common.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.280
They all took place during the
hottest decade ever recorded

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.080
since humans began
keeping temperature

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.980
records about 150 years ago.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.300
In the last decade,
the Earth's temperature

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.300
rose roughly a third
of a degree Fahrenheit.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.410
Since 1880, it's risen
about 1 and 1/2 degrees.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.690
You might say the
Earth's running a fever,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.490
and scientists predict it's
going to get much worse.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.600
Already, we can tally the signs.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.660
Global sea level rose by over
an inch during the decade,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.700
almost twice as
fast as the average

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.300
during the 20th century.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.980
Arctic summer sea ice declined
by over 300,000 square miles,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.670
enough ice to cover the
states of Texas and Kentucky.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.680
The vast majority of
climate scientists

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.390
say evidence for human
caused warming is clear,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.390
but less understood is exactly
how this warming will change

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.419
the complex interactions
between our planet's land,

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.299
water, sky, and the
living organisms that

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.910
inhabit our world.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.610
DAVID FREEMAN: So Gina you're
kind of, as a former EPA

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.610
administrator, you're
kind of in a good position

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.000
to talk about the relationship
between climate and food.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.125
So if you would fill us in.

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:54.667
GINA MCCARTHY: Well
let me just start

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.580
by thanking Walter
for doing this report,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.970
and all the other researchers.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.480
It's remarkable that it's
the first time we've really

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.010
ever looked at what
is a healthy diet,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.010
and what are the foods
we need, and what does it

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.180
mean for the planet.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.910
It's great to be
healthy individually.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.800
I'd like to still
make sure people

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.730
are on the planet, as well,
which seems to be a key issue.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.660
And I think really that's
what it's all about.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.770
We have to look, as Walter said,
at how we produce our food.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.418
It's not just about what kinds
of food, but how we produce it.

00:09:26.418 --> 00:09:28.210
And when you talk about
what kinds of food,

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.500
we have to recognize that
food is really culturally,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.680
and in many cases,
religiously embedded in how

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.730
people think about their lives.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.120
This is a big shift
that needs to begin,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.690
or should have begun a long
time ago, in how we look at food

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.280
and how we get people
to demand food that's

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.220
both healthy for them, and meets
their cultural and religious

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.300
needs.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.830
And then secondly,
you have to look

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.960
at how you produce that food.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.620
Right now we have industrial
agriculture, factory farming,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.170
that we know is degrading
our environment.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.910
And we also know
you have to think

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.970
about the future under
a changing climate,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.550
with droughts and
intense floods,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.700
and how do we change the way
we think about growing food

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.450
to make sure that it retains
the carbon, that you have

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.920
rich soil, that you don't rely
on fossil fuel fertilizers

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.180
and pesticides, that you shift
to organically based farming.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.620
And you think about the
best way you can to actually

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.560
keep farms local, to
the extent that you can,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.350
because the third issue
is how do you manage food?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:40.952
Because we waste 40% of the food
between the farm and the table.

00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:42.660
And then we have to
think about how do we

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.440
get people engaged in this?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.720
We want them to
demand healthy food,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.780
but we also want them to
have a rich sense of where

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.420
their food comes from.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.810
I want them to be engaged
in the food process.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.120
And I want to think
about how we eliminate

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.010
that waste by engaging them.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.490
Because it's not just about
what happens from the farm

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.430
to a manufacturing
or a production shop,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.400
it is about what happens
in your own fridge.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.100
One of the best things you
can do to stop wasting food

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.920
is shop your fridge.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.680
Understand what
food labels mean.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.180
Don't throw it out before you
need to, but don't let it hang

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.110
in the back for a long time.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.910
These are small things, but they
engage people in the solutions.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.400
And where food is
concerned, it's personal

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.770
and we need people
to demand agriculture

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.590
that is respectful of the
environment, that understands

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.010
that we're already in a
changed environment, that takes

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.260
a look at what's happening
in Nebraska, and Iowa,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.060
and other places where farms are
now destroyed and flooded out.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.310
We need to figure out
how to do this better,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.240
keep our forests intact, keep
our ecosystems functioning,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.600
and figure out how we feed
these 10 million people.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.040
I have no doubt
that we can do it.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.790
The real question is how
do we engage enough people

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.940
to make the demands, and make
the shifts in behavior so

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.450
that this is what we
deliver to the world,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.870
and that's the challenge.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.530
And really climate change is the
biggest public health challenge

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.920
that we face today,
as is our nutrition.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.470
We have to blend them together
and think systemically

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.332
how to make this happen.

00:12:18.332 --> 00:12:20.790
DAVID FREEMAN: Well, David you
work with the companies that

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.832
are trying to make some
of these sorts of changes

00:12:22.832 --> 00:12:24.018
that Gina's talking about.

00:12:24.018 --> 00:12:25.810
Tell us about your
role, your organization,

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.200
and what businesses see
as the big obstacles

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.720
and opportunities, if there
are opportunities, as well.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.320
DAVID BENNELL: I'd be happy to.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.520
First of all, I want
to say thank you

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.280
to the School of Public Health
for inviting me and us here.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.600
Lillian, particularly you
and Walter, and a special

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600
thank you to the students
in the room and online

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.308
because I know it's
break time, and there

00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:43.452
are many, many other
things you could be doing.

00:12:43.452 --> 00:12:44.910
But I really
appreciate that you're

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.270
here and online and with
us because we need you.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.640
Can you queue the
first slide, please.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.890
The World Business Council
for Sustainable Development

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.200
is a Geneva, Switzerland
based organization.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.600
We're in other places
around the world, 200

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.320
multinational
companies, and CEO led.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.920
We have about 60 network
partners around the world, too.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.990
And of those 200
companies, about 80

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.600
are involved in the
food and ag space.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.235
And they're ones that
you would think of,

00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:14.610
but they're are also companies
like Google and Microsoft,

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.740
and some of the really
interesting ones

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.020
that I may touch
on in a little bit.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.990
We've got six primary
areas of focus.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.010
There are six
economic drivers we

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.230
believe we can most influence.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.120
You can see them
there on your screen.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.640
Circular economy, citizen
mobility, climate and energy,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.890
I'll skip over food and
nature, that's the way I work,

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.400
and I'll come back to that one.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.430
People, we have a really
interesting new program

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.000
called the future of work.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.850
Let's feed a planet
of 10 billion people,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.610
but we should probably
employ them, too.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.730
Everyone, not just
people that look like me.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.790
And then back to
redefining value,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.990
which is a fascinating one.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.240
Our CEO likes to
say that accountants

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.690
will save the world, and
I think he might be right.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.660
I mean, we really need to get
financial markets and capital

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.020
markets to reward the sorts of
things that I think many of us

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.380
in this room and online believe
in in our financial disclosure

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.110
and reporting.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.652
So we're working
hard to try and make

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:14.030
that happen through
working with the capital

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.630
markets and the securities
and other agencies that

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.100
reward them.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.250
Food and nature you see there
is the program I work in.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.320
About 80 different companies
involved in this space.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.820
And we try and work through
this lens of the Sustainable

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.690
Development Goals.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:32.240
They were referenced just
a couple of minutes ago,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.300
so go ahead and tee up
that next slide for me.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.880
If you haven't heard of the
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.320
there are 17 of them.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.760
This cool pin of mine is sort
of the graphic representation

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.260
of it.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.927
So if you ever see
anybody with this on,

00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:47.220
you can say oh, the SDGs.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.110
And if you think about
it, it really is--

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.014
the what?!

00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:54.170
You know, the SDGs.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.370
They are in 2015, basically
the world, 193 companies.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.875
The UN General Assembly
agreed on a path forward.

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:02.280
You can call it a roadmap.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.072
If you want to be more
politically correct,

00:15:04.072 --> 00:15:05.300
maybe it's a bike path.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.600
But it is an agreed
upon path forward

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.900
for how to do this thing that
we call the Earth, sustainably.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.870
The goals are set to
be achieved by 2030.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.820
That's a stretch, but what
are if we're not ambitious.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.380
And the slide up here is
one that we use specifically

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.820
to focus on sort of
the farm and ag space.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.610
17 different sustainable
development goals, 169 targets,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.940
and 232 indicators
backing up the targets.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.000
But here's an example of when
we work with our companies,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.390
looking at how do we achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals,

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.130
they oftentimes need
to focus, and should

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.470
focus on those
SDGs that are most

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.210
applicable to the business.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.875
And then next slide please.

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.750
I've been asked to focus
on technology, which

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.160
we'll do in the second half.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.910
Here's a cool one.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.643
This is called the CocoaCloud.

00:15:51.643 --> 00:15:53.810
This is a project you'll
see with some of our member

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.630
companies and partners we're
running in Ghana and the Ivory

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.370
Coast, using data
enabled climate solutions

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.100
through mobile phones and other
really interesting applications

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.450
to help, we hope, up to 1
million smallholder farmers

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.640
make better farming
decisions based

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.500
on better ability to forecast
and plan for weather.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.790
And as Gina's just
said, you can't

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.510
forecast for what's happening
in the Midwest right now,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.580
but to the extent we
can help farmers better

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.420
use data to plan their work,
we believe we can contribute

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.150
to the Sustainable Development
Goals, and as or more

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.450
importantly to the
livelihoods of those farmers.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.020
Thank you.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.410
DAVID FREEMAN: Thank you.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.350
Well, and Gina, and
I guess everyone,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.110
has mentioned to some extent
the one big challenge here

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.530
is getting everyone to
change eating habits.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.360
And the key here is
to make food that

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.390
is as tasty as it is healthful
and sustainable, and Ana,

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.950
you're well known for your
Mediterranean cuisine.

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.530
And so you're part of the
work on that delicious

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.117
part of the equation.

00:16:56.117 --> 00:16:57.950
So what do you see as
the biggest challenges

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.420
to bringing this
planetary health

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.690
diet that Walter was talking
about to people's plates,

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.369
and how can cooks at home
and in restaurants help that?

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.917
ANA SORTUN: Yeah, I think it's--

00:17:08.917 --> 00:17:11.000
first of all, it's an honor
to be with all of you.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.859
You guys are changing
the world as we speak,

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.480
and it's pretty fabulous.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.910
But I think we've
all touched upon it,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.380
and it really, to me, it comes
down to good ingredients.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.930
It can be, in general, hard to
find really good quality food

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.380
that's fresh and that's also got
some health benefit to it, as

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.810
well, especially when it's
on a bigger commercial scale.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.720
And I think ultimately
it's easier said than done.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.250
How do we buy less commercially
produced, industrialized food?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.670
How do we try to
keep it more local,

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.580
and use smaller
suppliers, especially

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.810
like when we're in the
airport, or we're traveling.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.780
It's just so hard to do
it on a constant basis.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.660
But there isn't enough access
to really good, fresh food,

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.250
and I think there could be more.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.280
And I think from a chef's
point of view, I mean,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.730
fresh equals flavor.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.563
And I'm one, I
can't even imagine.

00:18:10.563 --> 00:18:12.230
It's all I really
think about is flavor.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.060
I can't even imagine
not liking vegetables.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:21.710
So I think it's also a
little bit of a spin.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.320
It's really just sort of
understanding a little bit more

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.410
about how to find that
flavor, where to get it.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.880
Shopping farmer's
markets, and it

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.860
gets into sort of an
economical thing now,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.330
but I think there's
so much change,

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.270
as far as that is
concerned, and a lot more

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:46.600
access to locally grown
vegetables for everyone.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.040
And then it's also
in the kitchen.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.280
It's like, OK, how do I
achieve more flavor when

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.460
I'm cooking without
adding the cheap tricks?

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.210
And we all know what
the cheap tricks are.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.820
It's fat.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.990
It's sugar.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.070
It's salt. It's high
fructose corn syrup.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.920
It's all that stuff.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.140
And so, you kind of
have to be creative,

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.000
but not, at the
same time, there's

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.390
some really cool natural
high fructose corn syrup,

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.820
like onions can
be really amazing.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.330
Just adding onions
to your cooking,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.630
and using a lot of them
can transform things.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.990
And for me, I've always
been really focused

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.360
on the use of spice,
and how to use spice

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.930
in a Mediterranean way.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.220
And for me, that's where
the flavor, the depth,

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.640
the richness, comes from.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.400
And then nothing becomes heavy.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.920
So in other words,
you can eat, and you

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.140
can eat quite a
bit of vegetables,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.760
without having it being--

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.280
without feeling really bad.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.187
So finding flavors like--

00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:45.770
GINA MCCARTHY: She's
making me hungry.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.043
ANA SORTUN: --umami.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.440
Umami is another one, too.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.050
There's a lot of umami just
right under your fingertips.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:00.220
So it's kind of
reinvigorating your pantries,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.040
using a little tomato paste
here and there, which is umami.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.330
Soy sauce is sort of
a better known umami.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:11.390
A little bit of Parmesan
cheese goes a long ways.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.620
So it's really on how to
change the tools that you have

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.660
and the way you think
about what tastes good.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.120
I mean a donut tastes
good, but so does

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.120
broccoli if you cook it
with some of these tricks.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.110
It really, really does.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.380
And I know that's like
a really sad comparison,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.480
but it's the opposite.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.060
It's the opposite swing
of the pendulum, right?

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.640
And I think most of
all, I mean, this

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.300
is one of my favorite
quotes because I'm married

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.520
to an organic vegetable farmer.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.230
But Michael Pollan says that
the deeper the connection

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.560
we have with the person that
grows or makes our food,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.170
it tastes better, right?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.930
And then it's also,
it is about the soil.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.230
The soil is, really,
a big difference

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.230
when it comes to flavor.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.860
A tomato tastes so different
when it's grown in soil--

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.560
really rich soil versus sand.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.960
So I mean, there really
is a difference and sort

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.830
of being able to figure
that out is the fun part.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.350
It's kind of an adventure.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:15.020
So, yeah would all
organic be ideal?

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.520
Sure.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.800
I don't think pesticides are
doing any of us any good,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.530
but I think it's a tricky--

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.470
I think we want to
empower ourselves

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.140
to be a little bit more
creative to get through some

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.803
of these challenges, too.

00:21:27.803 --> 00:21:29.970
DAVID FREEMAN: OK, well I'm
not sure about the donut

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.300
versus broccoli, but I
guess we can move ahead.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.790
So now we're going
to shift a bit,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.640
not to lunch, unfortunately,
but to talking about solutions.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.660
But before we,
let's watch a clip

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.295
from the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development.

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:45.670
It shows some of these solutions
in action, particularly,

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.550
how new technologies are helping
make farming more sustainable.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:58.323
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.055
So David, you work
with companies,

00:23:02.055 --> 00:23:04.180
businesses that try to make
farming more efficient.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.455
Tell us about how that works.

00:23:05.455 --> 00:23:06.830
DAVID BENNELL:
Well first of all,

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.230
I want to talk about
the image of cops

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.120
in broccoli shops
instead of donut shops.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.250
I think that would be I think
we've had it solved now,

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.430
if we can move to that.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.110
How about that image?

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.640
And I had nothing to do
with that beautiful video,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.920
so I can't take credit for
that, but it does tee up

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.690
sort of this great
sort of conversation

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.723
about how are we
going to do this?

00:23:27.723 --> 00:23:30.140
And again, because I've been
asked to focus on technology,

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.040
I'm going to give three
different examples.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.610
One I referenced earlier is this
idea we call the CocoaCloud.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.880
You may not know this, but
it's climate week in Africa

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.030
this week, and we actually
launched this thing at climate

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.530
week.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.050
And CocoaCloud is a pretty
straightforward premise

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.650
that, as you know, many
people around the world

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.140
carry mobile phones,
and it's all of us

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.660
who get to live in places like
we're living now and watching

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.840
this from, but it also
includes many farmers

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.690
in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:06.520
And so the idea is could
we create a mechanism that

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.610
would enable, through
the mobile phone network,

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:11.320
to enable these
farmers to make better

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.570
predictions about
weather, and make

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.910
better predictions
about when to plant,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.650
when to harvest et cetera.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.020
So using the mobile phone
network and a series

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.950
of satellites and a series of
really interesting partnerships

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.510
against very interesting
bedfellows or bed-people,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.940
we're trying to
work this through.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.560
And the application of the
CocoaCloud if we get it right,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.570
I referenced it in
the opening comments,

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.510
it could impact 1 million
smallholder farmers

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.070
in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire
in the Ivory Coast.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.900
So if we get that right
there, the implications

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.510
and applications are really
interesting for other places

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.210
and space.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:51.490
So how do we sort of normalize
technology that's available,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.860
and we use every day--

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.980
it's OK if some of you
are texting right now.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.830
We're using, as we
speak, to really make

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.970
some very logical
and obvious solutions

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.602
available in the field.

00:25:05.602 --> 00:25:07.810
There's a great quote that
goes something like, look,

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.350
unpredictable weather makes
for an unpredictable harvest.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.090
Just ask anyone
who's trying to deal

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.180
with the deluge in the Midwest,
or drought in other places.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.400
So trying to really make
this available and affordable

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.670
and also contribute to the
equity that doesn't exist.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.190
Not in those two countries,
exclusively, but everywhere.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:31.260
So let's make this
normal for everyone.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.560
There's another
one, called Loop.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.020
Imagine Haagen-dazs
being delivered

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.260
to your house, like in the olden
days when you had a milkman,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.460
and sorry to use that
pronoun, but milk person.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.300
We still have that.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.308
I live in Maine, and there
are still milk people

00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:49.600
that will come once in a while.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.680
So there actually is
this really interesting,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.030
I'll call it a test, of a
number of different companies

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:58.510
across the value chain,
where you can order

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.990
certain kinds of consumables
that will be delivered

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:07.210
to your door door by UPS, in
containers, in a tote, that you

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:11.530
then eat, and you then get
online, and you send it back,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.690
and it comes back whenever
you're ready with more

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.000
Haagen-dazs, or more Dove.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.090
So really, I mean it's
happening now as we speak.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.870
If you think about sort of
these old models that are not

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.530
so crazy, how do we bring them
into the 21st century using

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.710
the technologies that we have?

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.660
And then the other one is
something really interesting.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.123
I, full disclosure, started
my career at Microsoft,

00:26:35.123 --> 00:26:37.540
and so I'm going to mention a
project from them, because I

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.560
know the company well.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.520
It's called FarmBeats.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.390
FarmBeats, have you ever
turned on your television,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.798
I know some of us on this panel
do know what I'm talking about.

00:26:47.798 --> 00:26:49.840
You turn on the television,
and there's a channel

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.760
that's just whitespace.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.040
Well those white spaces
exist all over the place,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.830
including on farms.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:02.240
That sort of television space
is available and underutilized.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.120
So there's a project
that Microsoft

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.970
is leading through
their AI for Earth,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.640
Artificial Intelligence
for Earth project,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.190
around the internet of
things to try and capture

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.950
that white space
and use it on farm.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:18.670
And so you can imagine, a
drone if you can afford it,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.410
but a helium balloon
if you can't,

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.560
that takes a mobile phone
up, gets a view of the farm,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.960
sends the data up
into the cloud,

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.822
and gets it right back
to you, very quickly,

00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:30.280
with real time data that you
can use to look at your field.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.860
What's over-watered,
what's underwatered.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.260
Where are the pests,
where aren't the pests.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.330
And that's being tested
right now by Microsoft

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.040
in places like Carnation
Washington and in other places.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.177
So really interesting sort of
things that some of our member

00:27:43.177 --> 00:27:45.760
companies are doing, and others
that are nonmembers are doing,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.530
and I just thought I'd
tee some of those up

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:48.905
DAVID FREEMAN:
Yeah, interesting.

00:27:48.905 --> 00:27:51.670
So and Gina, we're talking about
this kind of high technology,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.800
but also what can you
tell us about better ways

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.750
to use the agricultural
land that we do?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.610
What are some things that
we need to do with the land?

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.170
GINA MCCARTHY: Well let
me begin by saying, Ana,

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.740
you might think that we are
out to change the world,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.340
but you rock my world.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.160
I'm telling you, your food
experienced is quite amazing.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.080
So thank your husband.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.440
I had no idea it was part of it.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.810
Part of the challenge
that we face

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.720
is that agriculture
today, at least

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.670
the way the majority
of it is practiced,

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.010
it can be considerably
damaging to the environment.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.780
I mean, we see it.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.770
We see the harmful algal blooms
that are just about everywhere

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.180
across the United States.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.280
Most notably, we
saw it in Toledo,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.580
where they had
cyanotoxins created

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.920
by harmful algal
blooms, that were really

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.400
a result of runoff that
went into Western Lake Erie,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.780
and where the water gets
warmer and climate change,

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.180
those things happen.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.120
And we have to think about
keeping soil in its place.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.970
So every time you
till for farming,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.600
you have the challenge of
increasing carbon emissions,

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.240
and you have the
challenge of runoff,

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.850
that right now even
in the United States,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.850
55% of the river
and stream miles

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.100
are actually too
heavily contaminated

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.130
with nutrients from
runoff to be able to have

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.840
healthy ecosystems.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.880
So for many reasons
we need to change

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.350
the way we think about it.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.240
We need to store the
carbon in the soil.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.090
Soil is everything.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.250
I think people have
always known this,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.360
and we have to recognize that
with the exacerbated storms

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.880
that we're seeing with
a changing climate is

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.500
you have to plan for runoff.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.540
You have to think
about how you use

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.340
no till farming where you can.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.210
You have to think about how you
use the kind of technologies

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.480
you're talking about to be able
to understand where water needs

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.250
to be used and
where it's wasted.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.560
Because water is going to
compete between drinking

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.720
water and feeding people.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.050
That's a competition we don't
want either side to lose.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.480
And so there are
ways in which we

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.660
have to think about
feeding more people,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.390
but making our
ability to produce

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:06.150
that an opportunity to
reduce the current impacts,

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.090
and an opportunity to reduce
the methane and greenhouse

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.930
gases that are being emitted,
without eliminating the best

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.000
foods that are available
and nutritious for us.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.960
And I think it's a challenge,
but I think by no means

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.060
is it an insurmountable one.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.340
We have regenerative
agriculture that

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.420
is all about policies and
practices that do exactly this.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.590
That use natural systems,
ecosystems, biodiversity,

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.740
instead of looking at
dead end use of chemicals,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.350
where they have nowhere
to go, but in our food

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.890
or in our water.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.130
And so there are ways
in which this is already

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.450
being explored, successfully,
in so many places.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:48.280
The issue is how do
we scale that up.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.500
How do we spread the word.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.760
How do we change the
equation for agriculture

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.450
to shift from being a carbon
emitter to being a carbon

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.180
sink, which could make
them opportunities

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.520
for significant resources as
we start really valuing carbon

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.800
emissions and put
a price on carbon,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.860
the way I think everybody
knows and expects will happen.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.260
So there's opportunities
for agriculture

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.110
to do what they do best,
which is to protect the land

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.750
and produce our food,
and do it in a way that

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.890
makes them more economically
viable at the same time.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.952
And that's the win
that we have to go for.

00:31:25.952 --> 00:31:27.660
DAVID FREEMAN: Well,
so let's shift a bit

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.350
from production to consumption.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.997
So you're a nutrition
expert, as well as

00:31:31.997 --> 00:31:33.580
being part of this
commission, so what

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.670
does the EAT-Lancet
commission say about what

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.300
we should eat for health?

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.020
WALTER WILLETT: Yeah, well
we did spend a lot of time

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.790
on defining a healthy diet.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:44.580
I don't have time to
discuss the, really,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.600
hundreds of thousands--

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.500
DAVID FREEMAN:
Donuts and broccoli.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.920
WALTER WILLETT: -of
papers we looked at.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.930
That we did encourage
nuts, but not donuts.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.940
So, again, very broadly without
going into all the numbers,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.310
we did suggest more limited
amounts of animal source

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.150
protein, especially
red meat, because it

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:14.850
is a huge emitter of greenhouse
gases for all the time it's

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:19.440
living and breathing,
plus in general,

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.450
feeding grain to
cattle, in particular,

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.930
is hugely inefficient depending
on how you measure it.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.910
Roughly a 20 to 1
conversion of what

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:33.180
we feed cattle to convert it
to editable food for humans.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.290
Massively inefficient.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.540
And of course the production
of all that grain and soy

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.040
that we feed to
them has the kind

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.580
of environmental footprints
that Gina is talking about.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.460
So in the end, we came up
with some numbers per se

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.020
red meat which might be low by
what American expectations are.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:57.930
It's about 14 grams a day, with
some flexibility around that.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.120
That amounts to about
one hamburger per week,

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.050
or a big steak once a month.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.760
And some people would
think that's small,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.500
but actually the
amount of poultry

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.220
plus red meat that we suggest
in terms of target numbers

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.410
is a bit more than
what was consumed

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:18.580
in the traditional Mediterranean
diet when it was really

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.740
traditional, before the
industrialization of it

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.960
back in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.500
And at that time people had
the longest life expectancy

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.800
in the world, those men
consuming the Mediterranean

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.840
diet at that time.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.510
Now this is partly
how we think of food,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.990
red meat in the Mediterranean
diet is something special.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.900
We might have small
amounts in a mixed dish,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:45.150
or as a celebratory
event, and in fact

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.380
it's really about
we have to shift

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.700
our thinking into something
like I consider lobster, which

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.700
hopefully the Maine
people will appreciate,

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.750
that I really like it, but it's
not something I eat every day.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.680
It's a special event.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.920
And that's sort of
how we, I think,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.920
need to shift toward thinking
about some of the foods

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.090
we have in our diet.

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.260
We have, fortunately,
lots of traditional diets

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:15.730
from around the world that
are healthy and sustainable,

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.870
and the best studied one
is the Mediterranean diet.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:24.429
And we've learned a lot using
that as an example in terms

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.389
of analysis, and one of the
good things about all of this

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.580
is that we have a
double win situation.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.420
We can improve our
health and improve

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.790
the environmental
impact, in fact,

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.280
to make it sustainable
in the long run

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.500
by adopting this, what
some people would call it

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.510
a flexitarian diet.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.340
It's not a vegetarian
diet or a vegan diet,

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.520
but one that emphasizes
plant sources of protein.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.489
So better health,
better environment,

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.699
and as Ana has really shown and
that chefs across the country

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.250
have really shown to,
it can be a triple win,

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:01.330
with being marvelously
enjoyable and tasty.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:05.020
To accomplish this, we've worked
a lot with the culinary world,

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.360
in particular our partners
at the Culinary Institute

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.900
of America, bringing
together major food services

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:17.830
around the country, having chefs
really demonstrate and show how

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.700
to put this into practice.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.288
But as some have mentioned
m really starting at home

00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:23.830
is important.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.730
We worked right here with
Harvard Dining Service,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.560
and we've had good
partners there.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.870
We have really changed
our food service

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:36.460
in a way that emphasizes
the kind of dietary balance

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.780
that we're talking about.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.995
And actually our food service
is a destination place

00:35:41.995 --> 00:35:43.870
that people come from
around the medical area

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.150
to enjoy the food
that we have here.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:51.100
It's not just healthy and
sustainable, it's enjoyable.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.500
Some of this has been
behind the scenes.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.560
For example, we
worked with before it

00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.430
was widespread to
eliminate trans fat here.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.840
So we improved
the diet that way.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.900
We reduced the amount of
sodium, carefully and stepwise,

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.725
so nobody noticed, but even
without paying attention to it,

00:36:08.725 --> 00:36:10.600
people are eating a much
healthier diet here.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.760
But we've also we have
a great salad bar.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.380
We have creative use
of vegetables and fish.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.510
We have a connection
with a local fishermen.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.480
We eat here what's caught.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.720
It's not that we're ordering
10 pounds of salmon every day

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.240
or something like that.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.820
In fact, I think the fish
are fresher here at our food

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.860
service than any of the
major restaurants around town

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.120
because we get it directly,
whatever is caught that day.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.250
So there is many people
we have to work with.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:45.010
As Gina pointed out, the
agricultural system, but also

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:50.230
the food service system to make
healthy and sustainable eating

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.538
enjoyable for everybody.

00:36:51.538 --> 00:36:53.830
DAVID FREEMAN: Well, you
talked about the Mediterranean

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.598
diet a lot just now,
and Ana your world.

00:36:57.598 --> 00:36:59.140
And you talked a
bit about things you

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.060
can do with onions and so on.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.000
Any other specific kind of
guidance quickly about what

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.460
people can do to incorporate
this kind of diet

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.665
in their lives?

00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:09.790
ANA SORTUN: Olive oil is
a great trick, by the way.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:14.540
It's a good healthy fat, that if
you are using a great olive oil

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:18.050
It's adds an incredible
dimension to it.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:20.770
And I think we have to think
of our cooking as dimensional.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:24.480
It's not just like this way.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.520
It's more round.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.810
So you really want to think
about how to maximize flavor.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:35.050
And oftentimes even a vegetable
dish can be flavored with meat.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.720
So using broths and
using, in other words,

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.410
using the meat wisely.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.710
So if you're going to have
that less meat in your diet,

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.840
just using it to
actually flavor things,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.930
which can do
extraordinary things.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.330
But again, for me,
the longest time

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.100
I had cooked for what I thought
was Mediterranean cuisine

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.170
sort of focused on the
central part of it.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.560
And then I was invited to
Turkey and went a little eastern

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.630
in the Mediterranean,
and that's where

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.518
I saw the really exciting
stuff where I almost

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:09.060
couldn't sit down
it was so exciting,

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.980
and tasting things I--

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.730
what is this?

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.780
It's so rich.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.190
It has so much flavor.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:18.090
And then realizing that I had
tasted 30 things for lunch

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.100
and that's pretty impossible
to do without feeling bad.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.290
And so I realized
after kind of studying

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.960
this food that the
richness and the depth

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.120
comes from the spices.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.340
And they're not using the
spices in a heavy way,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.160
but they're using them to
add those dimensions that I

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.580
was talking about earlier,
which often can be found

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:42.000
in a glass of wine throughout
the rest of the Western part

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.617
of the Mediterranean.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.100
DAVID FREEMAN: One
other thing, too.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.070
Dave you talked about the
SDGs with your cool pin

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.612
and all that.

00:38:50.612 --> 00:38:52.360
So let's go back to
that for a second.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.162
And one aspect of
climate change.

00:38:54.162 --> 00:38:55.620
I guess a particularly
ominous one,

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:58.350
is that it increases
or kind of widens

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.270
the gap between rich and poor.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.820
So I wonder if you
can tell us about how

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:08.430
the UN is trying to, using
the SDGs, to prevent that

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.265
from happening and
getting any worse?

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.640
DAVID BENNELL:
Well, first of all

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.432
I live in Maine so
thanks for the shout out

00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:15.690
to Maine lobster, Walter.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.880
We appreciate it.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.690
I mean, WBCSD
looks at everything

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.690
we do through the Sustainable
Development Goals.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.090
So if you have not ever
heard of them, that's OK.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:30.780
You're normal, but it
really is a powerful--

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.570
it's a license to
operate on this Earth.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.700
So take a look at it.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.600
SDG2 Two, zero
hunger, is where I've

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.400
spent a good portion of this
week working in Washington DC.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.190
So if you look at SDG
Two on zero hunger,

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.830
and you start to look at the
targets and the initiatives,

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.330
you'll find it
really drills down

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.720
to things like gender,
and climate change,

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.860
and sustainable
consumption and production.

00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.270
Gina, very rightly
mentioned a huge amount

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:01.290
of food loss and waste.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.405
If food loss and
waste were a country,

00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:05.280
it would be about the
third or fourth largest

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.430
emitter of greenhouse gas
emissions in the world.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:10.230
So I mean there's so
much wrapped up just

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.090
in the idea of zero hunger.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.150
We have a program called
FRESH, which Walter knows well,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:18.000
Food Reform for
Sustainability in Health.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.240
And one of the work streams in
there, early on, was focused

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.347
on nutrition and security.

00:40:23.347 --> 00:40:25.680
Some of the most nutrition
insecure people in the world,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.200
paradoxically and
sadly, are farmers.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.780
And you start to
drill down into that

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.540
and you look at who has the most
nutrition insecure on the farm,

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.620
it's women and children.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.360
So I don't have
brilliant answers for you

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.170
on how to do this, but
if you look at SDG Two

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:47.520
and even Google the
SDG Two Hub, you'll

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.290
start to find some
really interesting work

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.160
by amazing people, like
Ana's cohort group The Chef's

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.560
Manifesto, that are
starting to try and put

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.780
this whole thing together
and trying to figure out

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.620
how do we challenge this.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.130
And the answer is, it's through
systems, and through systems

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:02.910
transformation.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.560
And some of you-- all
of you can't see this,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.980
but there's a person
sitting in the front row

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.070
here that has an amazing
patch on her coat

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.528
that says break the routine.

00:41:12.528 --> 00:41:14.070
I think part of this
is, yeah we have

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.080
to break to break the routine.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.420
DAVID FREEMAN: I
wonder if we can--

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.210
I knew it meant something.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:21.990
I didn't know what it meant.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.845
DAVID BENNELL: You
have seven cameras

00:41:22.845 --> 00:41:23.928
pointing at you right now.

00:41:23.928 --> 00:41:25.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:25.722 --> 00:41:27.180
DAVID FREEMAN:
Another thing that I

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.545
want to talk about,
Gina kind of referenced

00:41:28.545 --> 00:41:30.300
this earlier about the
idea of food waste,

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.668
and what are some of
the things that we

00:41:32.668 --> 00:41:33.960
might do to prevent food waste?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.730
As you said it's such
a huge contributor

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.987
to greenhouse gas emissions,
and as well as economic problem.

00:41:38.987 --> 00:41:41.070
GINA MCCARTHY: Well, it's
just like anything else,

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.600
waste comes at every
step of the process.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.810
So part of it is
keeping food locally.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.500
Part of it is making sure that
food is properly refrigerated.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.860
New technologies are
helping that happen,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.710
so that you can get
food away from the farm

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:00.990
and into our homes and
schools and supermarkets

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.740
and everything.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.460
But part of it is you just have
to look at wherever you are.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.770
We talked about the home,
but talk about schools.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.240
You mentioned this, Walter.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.700
One of the things that the
Office of Sustainability

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.390
here has not just done working
with the faculty, like Walter,

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:17.970
and the students to
improve the quality

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.950
of the food and the
nutritional value,

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.200
but they're also
develop sustainability

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.270
and healthful food
standards that

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.770
look at where it's
coming from, and how

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:30.180
I look at the full
lifecycle of the school.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.900
And it's available
online for other schools

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.900
that want to look at it.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.140
It's at green.harvard.edu/food.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.910
It's a way to just
tell the students what

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:46.320
the impact of this food is
so they can choose wisely.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.240
The more information we
have, the more transparent,

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.240
the more you can make good
choices, and that's important.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.540
But when I was at
EPA we worked a lot

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.000
with the James
Beard Society I went

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.220
to a lot of their conferences
mainly because they

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:03.120
had great food at them, but
mostly because we talked

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.240
about these issues to get
people involved and engaged,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.900
to talk about food deserts
and where they are.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.640
Cities now can
manage those issues.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.850
They can demand that
supermarkets go in places where

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.020
people need them most.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.970
One of the most
heartbreaking issues

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.420
I had to deal with it
at EPA was the lead

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.310
in the water in Flint, Michigan.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.620
When I went, there
every street corner

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.180
had nothing but a small
little five and dime

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.370
store, a little
store where you could

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.040
buy cigarettes and a place
where you could buy liquor.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.570
I couldn't find a supermarket.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:39.920
Now, granted, the city
now has in its midst

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:43.800
a really nice sort
of a farmer's market,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.880
but we have to address
these inequity issues.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.530
There's no question about it.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.850
And we can do that.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.980
We can demand more
of businesses.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.490
We can work in our
schools to make sure

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.400
that one of the things they do
is talk at a lot of colleges.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.240
What schools have figured out
is if you don't put trays out,

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.270
people don't throw food
away, because trays just

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.770
allow you to pile stuff on
that you're never going to eat,

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.560
but it looks good at the time.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.330
Sort of how we always act.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.010
Take the trays away.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.830
30% of the waste goes away.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:18.610
There's tricks to
dealing with human beings

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.230
because we're all
kind of quirky, right?

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.730
And then the other
thing we did is

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.620
work with supermarkets,
first of all,

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.180
in how they purchase their food.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.540
They overbought,
often, food that

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.910
was going to be perishable.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.940
And then when the food
didn't look spiffy pretty,

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.800
they'd toss it away, instead
of sharing it and sending it

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.470
to other places, like
food pantries or soup

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.520
kitchens, that can really
make something of this food.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.880
So there's ways in which we
can think creatively about this

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.990
and not make everything so
hard, instead of integrate it

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.450
into our lives in
an everyday way.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.990
It is only when you really start
to do that you get the breadth

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:04.010
and depth of actions that
are essential for our future

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.840
and our kids health.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.320
But when you do that, it becomes
ingrained in your own values

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.620
and your own behavior,
and it matters.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.540
And the last thing
I wanted to mention

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.840
is that I want to make sure
I don't leave oceans out,

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.820
because we talk
about soil a lot.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.850
Not particularly
as relevant there.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:26.310
But there is significant
challenge with our oceans

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:26.810
today.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.780
We now know that our
fisheries are being depleted,

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.420
not just because
of coral bleaching,

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.270
but because of the salinity
change in the oceans.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:42.170
And a lot of it has to do with
the ancillary issues related

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:48.120
to our lives, like plastics that
are ending up in our bodies,

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.190
in our blood, in our food,
the micro beads that happen.

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.560
We have to think
more systemically

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.820
about these issues.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.380
We cannot allow the sort of
things we use around our food

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.970
to actually end
up in our bodies.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:06.750
And so there's a lot of work to
be done in that area, as well.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.448
And I think it's part and parcel
of the discussion we're having.

00:46:10.448 --> 00:46:12.240
DAVID FREEMAN: OK we're
running a bit late,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.250
so let's go to
questions right away.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:19.975
And one that came, actually I
think before we came out here.

00:46:19.975 --> 00:46:21.350
Walter, you and
Dave were talking

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:22.808
about eating crickets
or something.

00:46:22.808 --> 00:46:24.650
So someone is
asking would insects

00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:26.270
be a good protein source.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.280
I guess yes, but
what role crickets

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.560
play in the world's food supply.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.530
WALTER WILLETT: Well, it
certainly is a hot topic now

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.540
and we need to
learn more about it,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.410
but many cultures have used
insects as a traditional food.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:42.080
From the nutrient content,
it looks pretty good.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.330
The reality is, of course,
we don't have any long term

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.880
studies that we'd really like
to have, but in the meantime,

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.070
we think integrating some of
these into our food systems

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.730
is useful way to proceed.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:01.310
But we should study them as
we go through this process.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.460
Insects can also have some
intermediate role, too,

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:09.500
taking foods that are high in
cellulose that we can't digest,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.690
and converting that
food to something

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.660
that chickens or fish can eat.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:16.850
And so there's some interesting
loops we can put into the cycle

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:19.610
there where insects could
play an important role.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.750
DAVID FREEMAN: David, any
thing you'd like to add?

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:22.583
DAVID BENNELL: Well.

00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:25.970
The last time I saw Walter
in person cricket bread

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:29.810
was served, and I tried it.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.438
I think that the bridge there--

00:47:31.438 --> 00:47:33.230
GINA MCCARTHY: You
didn't say you liked it.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.113
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:35.113 --> 00:47:37.113
DAVID BENNELL: There was
no jam and butter, but.

00:47:37.113 --> 00:47:39.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.570
I think the ick factor
for some people,

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.078
you can jump over that by
reminding sort of all of us,

00:47:44.078 --> 00:47:46.120
particularly those of us
that live in New England

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.900
and there's a slight
tick problem here,

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.650
that many animals that
we eat, eat insects.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.650
So maybe we flip this
thing on its head,

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.720
where we're growing food
to feed animals things

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.470
traditionally they didn't eat
for millennia, many millennia.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.190
And we remind each other that
in fact crickets and insects

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.560
are great sources of
food for the animals

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.303
that we may then well consume.

00:48:09.303 --> 00:48:11.720
So I think there is a really
interesting sort of construct

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.440
we could flip pretty quickly
back to what was once normal,

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.800
and we decided I don't know
why culturally, was not normal.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.702
So, David, I think
probably that's right so

00:48:20.702 --> 00:48:21.410
with that, first.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:22.822
Jam and bread.

00:48:22.822 --> 00:48:24.280
DAVID FREEMAN:
Donuts and broccoli.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.738
DAVID BENNELL:
Donuts and broccoli.

00:48:25.738 --> 00:48:27.300
ANA SORTUN: Ants
before crickets.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.890
DAVID FREEMAN: OK a
couple more questions.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.158
So I wonder if--

00:48:33.158 --> 00:48:34.700
someone's asking
about organic, which

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.240
has been mentioned here before.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.280
And one of the things
that's often said

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.738
is that, well, we really can't
grow enough food organically

00:48:39.738 --> 00:48:40.580
to feed the world.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.625
Can we achieve-- the question is
from a viewer in Washington DC,

00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:45.500
can we achieve feeding
the world's population

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.290
with organic
production principles?

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.460
You want to take that or Gina?

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.590
WALTER WILLETT: Yeah, we did
look at this in our report,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.020
our commission report where we
had agricultural experts there.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.420
And I think with today
we would probably

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.480
not be able to feed the
world with 100% organic,

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.930
but really applaud and encourage
every effort to produce food

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.060
in a more organic way.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:15.360
It's not just a yes/no answer,
but reducing our insecticides,

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.580
herbicides,
agricultural chemicals

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.920
is very possible by
employing organic principles.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.170
I think one of the
biggest constraints

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:28.340
is having enough nitrogen
fertilizer for parts of Africa

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.350
where yields are extremely low.

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.830
The long term solution will
involve some organic practices,

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:37.970
but in the interim, at
least maybe in the long run,

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.180
some modest amounts of
non-organic fertilizer

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.820
probably will be required.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:48.330
So again trying to move in that
direction as much as we can

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:52.320
is highly desirable, and
we should learn from that,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.370
but just a quick switch
to 100% organic today

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:56.822
is probably not feasible.

00:49:56.822 --> 00:49:58.280
DAVID FREEMAN: So
one more question

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.740
from my iPad here and then
we'll go to the audience

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.022
here, do the panel--
actually, Gina,

00:50:03.022 --> 00:50:04.730
this is a question
for you because you're

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:07.670
were talking before hand about
some people who are converting

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.070
lawns and tilling
lawns and growing crops

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.730
where there once was a lawn.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.780
So someone is saying
do the panelists see

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:18.200
some of the farming production
reverting to homegrown gardens,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.810
and gardeners similar to Victory
Gardens during World War II.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.090
GINA MCCARTHY: Oh absolutely.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:22.965
ANA SORTUN: Yes, yes.

00:50:24.548 --> 00:50:26.090
GINA MCCARTHY: Well
one of the things

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.650
I mentioned before
we came on was

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.820
that there was a young man who
I met during the climate summit

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.930
in California.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.930
I was in line, getting
coffee and he tapped me

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.060
on the shoulder,
and he said, hey,

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.410
I do this really cool thing.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.590
And he basically deals
with young people,

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:45.200
and I think he calls it
farms for bikes or something.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:49.220
And they go around
and they go in cities,

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.490
and they sign people up to be
able to use their front lawn

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:56.960
to grow food, and the people get
to really use the food as much

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.440
as they want, and they
harvest it when it's ready.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.380
And they sell the
what they harvest,

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.890
and it provides a
little good economic job

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:09.080
for a lot of young people.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.660
Only it provides
awesome opportunities

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.970
for fresh food for
those families.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:17.420
Now you have to be careful in
the city that the soil is good,

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:22.220
and it's clean enough to you to
not sort of sneak other things

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.140
into your food as it grows.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.060
But it's just there's so much
we could do to be more creative.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:33.080
And to me anything you can do
to personalize these issues,

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:37.340
make people have the
power over these things,

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.440
the better not they're
going to demand

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.090
that they have really
strong naturally

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:49.450
produced products that
they'll be comfortable with.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.950
And I think it's great.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:55.138
Everyone can get involved
in these types of issues.

00:51:55.138 --> 00:51:56.180
DAVID FREEMAN: Thank you.

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.512
So does anyone have a
question here in the audience.

00:51:58.512 --> 00:51:59.720
Yes, right here in the front.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.360
I think we can get
a microphone to you.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.510
AUDIENCE: I'm Lillian Chang from
the Department of Nutrition.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:12.110
And I want to quote
from a recent study,

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.530
or not study is a viewpoint from
my colleagues in the Friedman

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.670
School of Nutrition and
Science and Policy and that

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:25.640
was published in JAMA, and
at Tufts University there.

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:30.970
The farm bill remains a
powerful but under utilized tool

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.380
for promoting public health.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:38.300
Reducing health care spending
and improving disparities

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.230
and much more should be done to
fully leverage its potential.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:45.080
Right now in a 2018
allocation we're

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:50.450
talking about 86 billion
allocation annually,

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:54.620
and for the CDC it's
only $5 billion a year

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:59.780
and National Institutes of
Health $37 billion a year.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:09.770
And also what's interesting
is that half the recipients

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:17.870
of the farm bill either with
getting Medicaid or Medicare.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:21.470
So they're not in good
health, and in terms

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:25.320
of the recipients from
the farming perspective,

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:30.670
it's still crop insurance for
corn, wheat, soy and cotton.

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:33.260
We are trying to get the
public to eat more fruits

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.280
and vegetables, right?

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.340
But it's far from serving it
that amount, and where the farm

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:45.590
bill is talking about affecting
70 million acres of farmland.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:49.830
So I would like to ask the panel
how can we mobilize the public

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.750
on what other measures that--

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:57.178
actions we can do to move
the needle in the farm bill.

00:53:57.178 --> 00:53:58.220
DAVID FREEMAN: Thank you.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.750
GINA MCCARTHY: Can I just say,
I actually read that article,

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.270
and one of the people
who knew I read JAMA.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.560
It must have been a
clip somewhere, right?

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:11.180
One of the other
fascinating things

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.740
is how much of the money that's
invested through the farm bill

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:21.080
actually goes just to the
top 17% of the largest farms.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.860
So there is a
challenge here, and I

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.230
think one of the
interesting things when

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:31.010
you're in government and you're
trying to influence how markets

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.270
move to make sure that they
protect people's health is what

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:37.860
I did, is there's
two ways to do it.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.250
You can regulate it,
or you can incent it.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:42.530
The farm bill is one
of the biggest tools

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.690
we have in the United
States of America

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:46.820
to incent good public health.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.110
But it is generally not
rethought every year

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:53.180
with that in mind.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:58.130
And this is one area where
it's not about Democrats

00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.930
versus Republicans.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.870
It is everybody's all
in for agriculture,

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:05.810
but they do the same
thing with the farm bill

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:08.570
year in and year out.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.860
That ought to be rethought.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.522
AUDIENCE: So what can we do?

00:55:14.522 --> 00:55:16.480
DAVID FREEMAN: Well anyone
else with something?

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.798
We have to move on
to the end here?

00:55:19.798 --> 00:55:21.340
Walter did you want
to say something.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.410
WALTER WILLETT:
Well, just to add,

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:24.970
there's not a simple
answer to this,

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:27.970
and we were up against
very powerful lobbies here.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:33.310
But we do have to look at it
through the lens of health

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.630
and environment.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.510
That's not the usual
lens that it's looked at.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:43.900
Now it's political interest,
and powerful industries.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.480
But we also really do want to--

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.560
another goal is
sustainable incomes

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.990
for farmers who are really
trying to do the right /

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.880
And it's not easy.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:58.395
They're going bankrupt even
today in large numbers.

00:55:58.395 --> 00:55:59.770
DAVID FREEMAN:
Well, can you just

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.260
talk briefly about that,
about the economic aspect

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.120
of this or impact on farmers
and the agricultural industry

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:06.700
in general.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.908
WALTER WILLETT: Well, I'm
not an expert in that area.

00:56:08.908 --> 00:56:11.020
I really am looking
at food, but I

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.350
did grow up in a farming area,
in fact, a long term farming

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:15.620
family in Michigan.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.810
And so I do know
firsthand that there's

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:25.090
been a huge aggregation and
the economic incentives,

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:27.550
the way they are
today are pushing

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.990
people toward these mega farms.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:31.780
Small or medium sized
farms are having

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.260
a very hard time making it.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.000
Now some people say we
shouldn't have any government

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
intervention, but we clearly
are intervening already.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.250
And it's just
intervening in a way that

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.540
is not supporting health or
sustainability or incomes

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.280
in communities in rural America.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:56.320
So we really do need to
work with others organizing.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.450
This is a political issue
to a large extent, not

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.160
a scientific issue.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.820
DAVID FREEMAN: So
before we wrap up,

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.612
I just want to ask each
of you to give kind

00:57:03.612 --> 00:57:04.779
of a brief takeaway message.

00:57:04.779 --> 00:57:06.904
So why do you just continue
and we'll move on down.

00:57:06.904 --> 00:57:08.980
What's the takeaway there
we should leave with?

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:11.800
WALTER WILLETT: Very briefly,
there is a big triple win here

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.580
for adopting diets that
are both healthy for us

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:19.690
and that are sustainable
and that are enjoyable.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.010
That's my bottom line.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.010
DAVID FREEMAN: OK, good.

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.510
Gina?

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.160
GINA MCCARTHY: What
he said, plus I do

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.302
think there's a market
for a broccoli donut.

00:57:26.302 --> 00:57:26.802
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:26.802 --> 00:57:28.770
I just don't know
who's gonna produce it.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:30.494
ANA SORTUN: Or a cricket donut.

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:33.880
broadly

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.400
DAVID BENNELL: Broccoli
donut with a cricket chaser.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.140
I would just end with what
I started with, thank you.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.490
And for those of you in the room
that are much younger than me,

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.957
sometimes I get asked how
I got started on my career

00:57:44.957 --> 00:57:47.290
and sustainability and if you
look in my rearview mirror

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:48.160
it looks obvious.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:48.910
But it's not.

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:51.500
I think you just
have to be curious.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.560
And when people ask
me, they're typically

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.595
students like some of you who
want to do this sort of work.

00:57:56.595 --> 00:57:58.600
And the first thing
I say is, thank you.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.840
So I would ask you go
find 100 of your friends

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.360
and bring them on because
we absolutely need you.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.850
We're trying our
best to maybe correct

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.620
some of the sins of
the past, but it's

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.960
going to take all of
us and generations

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:13.030
to come to really
get this right.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.917
So go find a friend,
better yet find dozens,

00:58:15.917 --> 00:58:18.250
and convince them to come
over and do this work with us.

00:58:20.225 --> 00:58:21.850
ANA SORTUN: Yeah,
and for me, it always

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:25.240
comes down to the connection,
as I spoke about earlier.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.360
And I feel like we're all
connected in our own ways,

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:33.522
and every choice we
make makes a difference.

00:58:33.522 --> 00:58:35.230
And if you're just
not thinking about it,

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.105
and if it's just food
that's going to get you

00:58:37.105 --> 00:58:39.880
through the next
couple hours, or what's

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.100
the story behind this,
it starts becoming

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.260
a little bit more interesting.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:49.480
And I do think, I mean
nobody not everybody has

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.700
time or space to
grow their own food,

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.400
but even if you don't, try to
make a connection with someone

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.380
that does, improves
our health all around.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.510
I just think the
connection and the stories

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:04.385
and the people are a
big piece of it too.

00:59:04.385 --> 00:59:06.260
DAVID FREEMAN: OK, I
think we're out of time.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.335
So thank you very much.

00:59:07.335 --> 00:59:08.710
Thanks to all the
panelists here.

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:09.700
Thank all of you.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.910
Thanks to our audience here
in the studio and also online.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:14.743
And before we leave,
I'd like to encourage--

00:59:14.743 --> 00:59:16.785
I'm going to ask and
encourage all of you to tune

00:59:16.785 --> 00:59:19.420
into the next forum , which is
entitled High US Health Care

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.430
Costs, What Might Be Done?

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:24.040
That's on April 4 from
noon to 1 and more details

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.730
at forum.hsbc.org.

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.090
So thanks everybody.

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.290
GINA MCCARTHY: Thanks.

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:32.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:39.840
