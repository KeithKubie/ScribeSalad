00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.060
We also should check out
the SweepWatchFaceService to see

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.140
how to implement smoothly
moving analog watch hands.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.400
Most of the concepts in this code are
the same as in the digital service we

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.560
just reviewed.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.880
Let's look at onDraw.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.900
If we scroll down,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.280
you can see at the end we call
invalidate if we're in interactive mode.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.050
This forces an immediate
refresh as soon as possible,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.130
giving the smooth second-hand movement.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.690
Also, let's have a quick
look at onSurfaceChanged.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.560
This method is called to give us
the dimensions of the display and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.430
typically happens once when
the watch face is started.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.850
This is where we resize
the background image once so

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.680
it's ready for
use in the Android method later.
