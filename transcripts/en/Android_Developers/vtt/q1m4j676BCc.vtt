00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.549
&gt;&gt; Android allows devices to run several applications
simultaneously, switch between them, and at

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.379
the same time, notify you when something new
occurs in one of them. Let's see an example

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.990
of this on the world’s first Android phone,
the T-Mobile G1. When browsing interesting

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.420
photos, a friend pings me on Yahoo Messenger.
A notification appears on the status bar.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.440
I can click right on it to switch to the IM
and chat with my friend, letting him know

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.640
that I've almost found the perfect photo.
To switch between any of the applications

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.659
that are running on the Android, simply long
press the device’s “Home” button. You

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.559
can have several applications running simultaneously
in the background. I'm currently using a few

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:03.319
Apps my self: IM, the Browser, Settings, Contacts,
and Music. Let’s return to the browser.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.480
Say, I found some interesting pictures, using
“Long Press,” I can easily share the pics

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.320
with my friend. On the Menu, click, “Go
to URL,” to see the current location. Then,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.610
simply long press the URL you’d like to
copy and select “Copy.” Then, switch back

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.480
to IM by long pressing the “Home” button,
and paste the copied URL right into the IM

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.910
conversation. The Seamus Integration between
your apps on Android makes multi-tasking effortless.
