00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.104
( intro music )

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.242
There used to be more
than 4,000 elephants

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:13.046 line:0%
in the greater Gorongosa area.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.314 line:0%
And during the war

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.550
most of those elephants
were killed.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.253
Hungry soldiers ate their meat.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.789
<i> And traded their ivory
 for guns and ammunition.</i>

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.590
<i> When it was all over</i>

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.959
<i> there was only a few
 hundred traumatized</i>

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:28.661
<i> elephants left in the park.</i>

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.597
<i> People spoke of being charged
 and chased by elephants.</i>

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.466
<i> And having terrible
 experiences with them.</i>

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.138
And, having spent a lot of
time in my life with elephants

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:42.574
I thought, "Well,
maybe by running away

00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:44.543
under those circumstances that

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:47.280
the people were provoking
the elephants to charge."

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.750
<i> I talked to my sister,
 Joyce, about it</i>

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.719
<i> who by then had become</i>

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.853
probably the worlds
leading expert on

00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:56.890
wild African elephant behavior.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.457
And she agreed.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.693
So, she came to Gorongosa
to see for herself.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:02.395
<i> The first thing
 she had to do was</i>

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.064
<i> identify elephants
 in the population.</i>

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:08.267
<i> And that meant taking
 photographs and then video</i>

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.036
<i> so that she could
 study their behavior.</i>

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:11.437
We both agreed that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.106
we wouldn't run away from
charging elephants.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.176
And so I built this metal frame

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.078
for my Land Rover,
to protect us.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.280
If I was wrong about the
charging elephants.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.715
( audience laughter )

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.020
And, one day I was
out with Greg Carr

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.656 size:84% position:42%
and a ranger named Maveneco

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:33.493
<i> And the elephants were eating
 these Acacia Albida seed pods</i>

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.894
they are like candy
for the elephants.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.662
They just love them,
and they were

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.164
busy eating those
things and

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.566
eating all around the car
while the babies played

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.900
and it was absolute magic.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.968
We never had
an experience

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.071
like this in Gorongosa
with elephants.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.440
And, soon...

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.476
or later the elephants
moved on and it was late

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.679
and we had a long way to go
back to park headquarters.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.014
And on our way

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.550
an elephant had knocked this
tree down, across the road.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.386
And it was just
starting to get dark.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.288
And so I flicked
my lights on and

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.424
I bashed my way through the
forest around the tree.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.828
And suddenly I heard elephants
trumpeting on my left.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.164
And I looked up to see

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.966
three big adult females
charging straight at me.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:18.637
And so, I switched off the
car and we all sat quietly

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.240
while one of the
elephants came forward.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.443
And she towered above the car.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:28.280
And she raised her trunk
and she smelled us.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.185
And she gazed down at
us through the bars

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.753
of the open vehicle.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.221
I wasn't too worried though
because it was normal.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:37.523
You know, it was only
a matter of time

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.559
before she'd just
back slowly away

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.962
and join the rest of the
herd and we'd be free to go.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.397
But she didn't.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.665
She just stood there.

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:51.236
And time passed and I started
to worry a little bit.

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:53.872
And then suddenly she
lowered her head

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.408
and with the full
force of her body

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.977
she slammed into the
front of the car.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.846
She hit so hard that

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.214
she blew the tire off the rim
on the other side.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:03.248
( audience chuckles )

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:04.750
And the protective body armor

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.556
and the vehicle panels
just collapsed.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.927
And simultaneously
I heard this bang go off.

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.229
And I didn't realize until later

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.999
it was the sound of
Maveneco's .458

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.767
which is a
huge caliber rifle.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.202
You know,
the bullets are like this.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.438
It's an enormously loud noise.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.973
And the elephant backed away.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.143
He shot a warning
shot over her head

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.511
and she backed away.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.512
I thought it would
be a good idea

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:34.480
to give her some
more space.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.517
So, I turned the car on and
I backed up a little bit.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.986
At which point she put her
head down and charged again

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.254
and this time straight
between the headlights.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:48.327
And with my hands on the
wheel she drove us backward

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.763
with her head pressing against
the bars in front of me

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.364
and they buckled.

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:54.800
I kept trying to steer the car.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.336
But I had zero control.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:58.871
I didn't want her
to spin us sideways

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.607
where we would easily flip
and she'd just pummel us.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.810
But she drove us backwards
and we slammed into a tree

00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:09.281 size:88% position:44%
at which point
Maveneco shot another...

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.752
shot at point blank
over her head.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:16.355
And she backed away again,
this time into the forest.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.459
So, I pulled the car
back out onto the track

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.229
and we jumped out to
try to change the tire.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.264
At which point she
charged again...

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.832
( audience laughter )

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:29.969 align:start size:84% position:16%
And Maveneco fired
his last warning shot.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.937
They're given
three warning shots.

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.039
Luckily she never came back.

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:35.508
<i> My car was a wreck.</i>

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.510
( audience laughter )

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.079
<i> But the bars had held
 and no one got hurt.</i>

00:04:41.747 --> 00:04:43.816
<i> I was devastated though.</i>

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.952
<i>My confidence with the elephants
 was completely shattered.</i>

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.655
And I was no longer
willing to hold my ground

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.491
against charging elephants.
