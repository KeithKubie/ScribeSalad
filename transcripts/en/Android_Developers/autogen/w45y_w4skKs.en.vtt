v4 so everyone's familiar with this it's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
v4 so everyone's familiar with this it's
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660
v4 so everyone's familiar with this it's
where you have compatibility shims so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
where you have compatibility shims so
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520
where you have compatibility shims so
you don't have to do an if version check

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
you don't have to do an if version check
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.189
you don't have to do an if version check
it also contains a bunch of helper

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
it also contains a bunch of helper
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840
it also contains a bunch of helper
functions and utilities that you can use

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
functions and utilities that you can use
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.110
functions and utilities that you can use
to make your apps backwards compatible

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120
to make your apps backwards compatible
 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.060
to make your apps backwards compatible
as with each platform version we've put

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
as with each platform version we've put
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.670
as with each platform version we've put
in back ports for various functions that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
in back ports for various functions that
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410
in back ports for various functions that
have smart fall backs that you can use

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
have smart fall backs that you can use
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469
have smart fall backs that you can use
to target new api's on older versions

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
to target new api's on older versions
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810
to target new api's on older versions
and we also have a couple of features

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
and we also have a couple of features
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.410
and we also have a couple of features
that we'd really like to highlight today

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420
that we'd really like to highlight today
 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.300
that we'd really like to highlight today
so in fragments we have some lifecycle

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
so in fragments we have some lifecycle
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.149
so in fragments we have some lifecycle
improvements namely fragment transaction

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
improvements namely fragment transaction
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.179
improvements namely fragment transaction
now has asynchronous commit so if you're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
now has asynchronous commit so if you're
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.219
now has asynchronous commit so if you're
creating an encapsulated component

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
creating an encapsulated component
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510
creating an encapsulated component
that's working with fragment

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
that's working with fragment
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.749
that's working with fragment
transactions you can synchronously

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
transactions you can synchronously
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.179
transactions you can synchronously
commit your transaction if your fragment

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
commit your transaction if your fragment
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830
commit your transaction if your fragment
is being added it will be added and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
is being added it will be added and
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300
is being added it will be added and
brought to the host state immediately

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
brought to the host state immediately
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130
brought to the host state immediately
you don't have to worry about ordering

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
you don't have to worry about ordering
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719
you don't have to worry about ordering
conflicts with other fragment

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
conflicts with other fragment
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.499
conflicts with other fragment
transactions

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
transactions
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330
transactions
likewise if your fragment is being

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
likewise if your fragment is being
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.730
likewise if your fragment is being
removed it will be removed and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
removed it will be removed and
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410
removed it will be removed and
disconnected immediately so you can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420
disconnected immediately so you can
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149
disconnected immediately so you can
handle all of your life cycle without

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
handle all of your life cycle without
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.490
handle all of your life cycle without
having to worry about ordering this is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
having to worry about ordering this is
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859
having to worry about ordering this is
especially useful if you're a library so

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
especially useful if you're a library so
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780
especially useful if you're a library so
we actually use this in the view pager

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
we actually use this in the view pager
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.080
we actually use this in the view pager
fragment module in the library to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
fragment module in the library to
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.450
fragment module in the library to
prevent ordering conflicts Adam Howells

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
prevent ordering conflicts Adam Howells
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.950
prevent ordering conflicts Adam Howells
going to talk more about some of the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960
going to talk more about some of the
 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.330
going to talk more about some of the
changes to fragments in what the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
changes to fragments in what the
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.130
changes to fragments in what the
fragment which happens at 5:00 p.m. so

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
fragment which happens at 5:00 p.m. so
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.160
fragment which happens at 5:00 p.m. so
make sure to check that out we've also

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
make sure to check that out we've also
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.350
make sure to check that out we've also
made some changes in notifications in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
made some changes in notifications in
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300
made some changes in notifications in
particular we have a new conversational

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
particular we have a new conversational
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940
particular we have a new conversational
messaging style so when you have say a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
messaging style so when you have say a
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830
messaging style so when you have say a
hangouts conversation that's

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
hangouts conversation that's
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960
hangouts conversation that's
multiple parties back and forth that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970
multiple parties back and forth that
 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.940
multiple parties back and forth that
shows up in notifications and shows you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
shows up in notifications and shows you
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130
shows up in notifications and shows you
snippets of the conversation this is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
snippets of the conversation this is
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.320
snippets of the conversation this is
also supported by where 2.0 so when you

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330
also supported by where 2.0 so when you
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.850
also supported by where 2.0 so when you
have a conversation that shows up on

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
have a conversation that shows up on
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.229
have a conversation that shows up on
your watch

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239
your watch
 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.229
your watch
we've back ported this in Android so if

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
we've back ported this in Android so if
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.990
we've back ported this in Android so if
you have we're running on an API 18 and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
you have we're running on an API 18 and
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.869
you have we're running on an API 18 and
above device so that's when notification

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
above device so that's when notification
 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.729
above device so that's when notification
listener was added notification listener

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739
listener was added notification listener
 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.400
listener was added notification listener
service and you use the notification

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
service and you use the notification
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.229
service and you use the notification
compat builder to build your

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
compat builder to build your
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.440
compat builder to build your
notification and you use messaging style

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
notification and you use messaging style
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.460
notification and you use messaging style
even on an API 18 device that'll move to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
even on an API 18 device that'll move to
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.559
even on an API 18 device that'll move to
the where app which is also using

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
the where app which is also using
 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.240
the where app which is also using
support library and understands that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250
support library and understands that
 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100
support library and understands that
communication channel and you'll get the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
communication channel and you'll get the
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.780
communication channel and you'll get the
messaging style on your where device as

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
messaging style on your where device as
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.890
messaging style on your where device as
well we're also giving you more

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
well we're also giving you more
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.809
well we're also giving you more
information about what users think of

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819
information about what users think of
 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.270
information about what users think of
your notifications so one thing that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280
your notifications so one thing that
 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.979
your notifications so one thing that
developers have really wanted to know

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989
developers have really wanted to know
 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.199
developers have really wanted to know
for a long time is have users block

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209
for a long time is have users block
 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.930
for a long time is have users block
notifications from my app so in Android

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
notifications from my app so in Android
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
notifications from my app so in Android
end there is now an API that lets you

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
end there is now an API that lets you
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.160
end there is now an API that lets you
tell exactly that's and we've back

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170
tell exactly that's and we've back
 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.470
tell exactly that's and we've back
ported this to API 19 which is when

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480
ported this to API 19 which is when
 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.240
ported this to API 19 which is when
users were first able to block

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
users were first able to block
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.420
users were first able to block
notifications from packages so you will

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
notifications from packages so you will
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.879
notifications from packages so you will
get an actual value from this that

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889
get an actual value from this that
 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.379
get an actual value from this that
reflects whether the user has blocked

presenting web content you have a couple

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279
presenting web content you have a couple
 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.119
presenting web content you have a couple
of options right now you have an

of options right now you have an
 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.309
of options right now you have an
embedded webview maybe you launch a

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319
embedded webview maybe you launch a
 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.439
embedded webview maybe you launch a
browser instance and these have some

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449
browser instance and these have some
 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.629
browser instance and these have some
issues they can be a little bit slow if

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639
issues they can be a little bit slow if
 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.219
issues they can be a little bit slow if
you're launching a full browser instance

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229
you're launching a full browser instance
 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.529
you're launching a full browser instance
you kind of bring the user out of the

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539
you kind of bring the user out of the
 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.290
you kind of bring the user out of the
experience of your app so custom tabs

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300
experience of your app so custom tabs
 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.240

are a new way to present web content

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250
are a new way to present web content
 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.309
are a new way to present web content
that we've already presented and we're

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319
that we've already presented and we're
 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.499
that we've already presented and we're
making some improvements to those so

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509
making some improvements to those so
 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.629
making some improvements to those so
this is new in 23.2 with some

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639
this is new in 23.2 with some
 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.739
this is new in 23.2 with some
improvements in v.24 the minimum SDK

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:24.749
improvements in v.24 the minimum SDK
 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:27.559
improvements in v.24 the minimum SDK
target for this is 15 and the reasoning

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569
target for this is 15 and the reasoning
 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.980
target for this is 15 and the reasoning
for that is primarily motivated by what

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990
for that is primarily motivated by what
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.550
for that is primarily motivated by what
most apps are targeting now so chrome is

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
most apps are targeting now so chrome is
 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.850
most apps are targeting now so chrome is
has a minimum SDK target of 16 and above

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
has a minimum SDK target of 16 and above
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.659
has a minimum SDK target of 16 and above
so if you're using this on API 15 likely

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669
so if you're using this on API 15 likely
 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.459
so if you're using this on API 15 likely
your users device won't have any targets

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469
your users device won't have any targets
 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.679
your users device won't have any targets
and you'll just launch the regular

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689
and you'll just launch the regular
 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.029
and you'll just launch the regular
browser instance or you'll need to use

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039
browser instance or you'll need to use
 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.149
browser instance or you'll need to use
an embedded webview as I mentioned this

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159
an embedded webview as I mentioned this
 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.889
an embedded webview as I mentioned this
is alternative to a wedding embedded

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:51.899
is alternative to a wedding embedded
 

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:54.499
is alternative to a wedding embedded
webview that is performance focused so

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509
webview that is performance focused so
 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.969
webview that is performance focused so
it's going to share a cache with the

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979
it's going to share a cache with the
 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.309
it's going to share a cache with the
browser it's also going to share cookies

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319
browser it's also going to share cookies
 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.899
browser it's also going to share cookies
with the browser so if your user is

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909
with the browser so if your user is
 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.909
with the browser so if your user is
already logged into web content that

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919
already logged into web content that
 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.740
already logged into web content that
will be persisted when your application

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750
will be persisted when your application
 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.579
will be persisted when your application
loads that into a custom tab and because

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:07.589
loads that into a custom tab and because
 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:08.839
loads that into a custom tab and because
we don't want to leet we don't want the

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849
we don't want to leet we don't want the
 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.129
we don't want to leet we don't want the
user to feel like they're exiting your

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139
user to feel like they're exiting your
 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.899
user to feel like they're exiting your
application we have a high level of

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:11.909
application we have a high level of
 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.480
application we have a high level of
visual customized ability and navigation

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490
visual customized ability and navigation
 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.879
visual customized ability and navigation
callbacks so if the user leaves the

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889
callbacks so if the user leaves the
 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.529
callbacks so if the user leaves the
content that they landed in initially

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539
content that they landed in initially
 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.929

your application can perform something

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939
your application can perform something
 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.860
your application can perform something
in response to that so here's a quick

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870
in response to that so here's a quick
 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.339
in response to that so here's a quick
example from the chrome blog of how fast

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349

custom tabs is compared to some of the

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
custom tabs is compared to some of the
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.679
custom tabs is compared to some of the
other solutions because we have a

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689
other solutions because we have a
 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.809
other solutions because we have a
warm-up that can spin up the chrome

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819
warm-up that can spin up the chrome
 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.369
warm-up that can spin up the chrome
process in the background before you

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379
process in the background before you
 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:38.870
process in the background before you
actually launch your custom tab

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880
actually launch your custom tab
 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.360
actually launch your custom tab
and because we're able to preload and

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370
and because we're able to preload and
 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.400
and because we're able to preload and
pre-render content you can have an

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410
pre-render content you can have an
 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.350
pre-render content you can have an
almost instantaneous transition from

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360
almost instantaneous transition from
 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.360
almost instantaneous transition from
your app to your web backed content and

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370
your app to your web backed content and
 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.130
your app to your web backed content and
this is really simple to implement so

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140
this is really simple to implement so
 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.290
this is really simple to implement so
here we have an example of one-liner

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300
here we have an example of one-liner
 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.650
here we have an example of one-liner
warming-up of the chrome process and

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660
warming-up of the chrome process and
 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.790
warming-up of the chrome process and
launching a custom tab for a specific

launching a custom tab for a specific
 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.810
launching a custom tab for a specific
URL one downside of this is that because

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820
URL one downside of this is that because
 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.730
URL one downside of this is that because
we're just very quickly spinning up the

we're just very quickly spinning up the
 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.320
we're just very quickly spinning up the

introduced a new SML bundle format to

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:46.870
introduced a new SML bundle format to
 

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.300
introduced a new SML bundle format to
merge related SML files into one this is

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.310
merge related SML files into one this is
 

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.670
merge related SML files into one this is
in the latest bill qu and is also

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680
in the latest bill qu and is also
 

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.840
in the latest bill qu and is also
backward compatible and here is one

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:57.850

example the animated vector drawable is
referring to a vector drawable whose

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:03.490
referring to a vector drawable whose
 

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.720
referring to a vector drawable whose
name is called icon and sit in silence

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:06.730

enjoyed job or attribute into this new

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.490
enjoyed job or attribute into this new
 

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.620
enjoyed job or attribute into this new
apt tag then you can cut and paste the

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:19.630
apt tag then you can cut and paste the
 

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.040
apt tag then you can cut and paste the
vector drawable the whole file into this

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:23.050
vector drawable the whole file into this
 

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.230
vector drawable the whole file into this
tag and then you merge two files into

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240
tag and then you merge two files into
 

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.290
tag and then you merge two files into
one you can do the same trick for all

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:28.300
one you can do the same trick for all
 

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.030
one you can do the same trick for all
the object animators too

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040
the object animators too
 

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.850
the object animators too
so basically you just need one single

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:03.220
vector drawable XML in your job or
 

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.930
vector drawable XML in your job or
directory it will convert this XML file

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:06.940
directory it will convert this XML file
 

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.150
directory it will convert this XML file
into multiple PNG files for different

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160
into multiple PNG files for different
 

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.210
into multiple PNG files for different
dpi automatically in a generated

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:12.220
dpi automatically in a generated
 

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.750
dpi automatically in a generated
directory and then the XML file will be

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:15.760
directory and then the XML file will be
 

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.500
directory and then the XML file will be
used for API 21 and above and the PNG

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:19.510
used for API 21 and above and the PNG
 

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.420
used for API 21 and above and the PNG
file will be used for older versions

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.430
file will be used for older versions
 

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.400
file will be used for older versions
then the best thing for this solution is

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.410
then the best thing for this solution is
 

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.160
then the best thing for this solution is
simple adoption so the only thing you

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.170
simple adoption so the only thing you
 

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.680
simple adoption so the only thing you
need to do is to swap out the PNG SS

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:31.690
need to do is to swap out the PNG SS
 

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.160
need to do is to swap out the PNG SS
into the SML SS and then Gradle would do

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.170
into the SML SS and then Gradle would do
 

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.440
into the SML SS and then Gradle would do
this by default and it will check the

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.450
this by default and it will check the
 

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.420
this by default and it will check the
minimum SDK version automatically

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.430
minimum SDK version automatically
 

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.710
minimum SDK version automatically
there's also some downside for this

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720
there's also some downside for this
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.210
there's also some downside for this
solution

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220
solution
 

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.310
solution
there's no animation animated vector

a resource ID pointing to your resource
 

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.160
a resource ID pointing to your resource
and that will manually inflate that

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.170
and that will manually inflate that
 

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.610
and that will manually inflate that
resource and give you a drawback but we

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:33.620
resource and give you a drawback but we
 

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.980
resource and give you a drawback but we
know that's kind of clumsy to use for

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:35.990
know that's kind of clumsy to use for
 

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.240
know that's kind of clumsy to use for
two reasons number one you can only do

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.250
two reasons number one you can only do
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.130
two reasons number one you can only do
in code and number two you can't

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.140
in code and number two you can't
 

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.720
in code and number two you can't
actually use it from resources which is

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:40.730
actually use it from resources which is
 

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.650
actually use it from resources which is
you know it's the whole point you

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:41.660
you know it's the whole point you
 

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.010
you know it's the whole point you
actually have them so we went back to

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:45.020
actually have them so we went back to
 

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.390
actually have them so we went back to
the drawing board and before how can we

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400
the drawing board and before how can we
 

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.670
the drawing board and before how can we
actually implement in app compat because

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:48.680
actually implement in app compat because
 

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.290
actually implement in app compat because
that has a lot of resource management in

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:50.300
that has a lot of resource management in
 

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.390
that has a lot of resource management in
it anyway with views and stuff so I

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400
it anyway with views and stuff so I
 

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.470
it anyway with views and stuff so I
think that's really the best place to

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480
think that's really the best place to
 

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.550
think that's really the best place to
actually implement this feature so we

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:57.560
actually implement this feature so we
 

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.600
actually implement this feature so we
have a couple of ways of actually using

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:58.610
have a couple of ways of actually using
 

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.760
have a couple of ways of actually using
it within app compat we have a new

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:00.770
it within app compat we have a new
 

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.590
it within app compat we have a new
attribute on image view called source

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600
attribute on image view called source
 

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.190
attribute on image view called source
compact and that is basically a it kind

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200
compact and that is basically a it kind
 

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.260
compact and that is basically a it kind
of supersedes Android source and that it

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:08.270
of supersedes Android source and that it
 

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.120
of supersedes Android source and that it
allows vector drawables all the way back

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.130
allows vector drawables all the way back
 

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.080

image resource method so if you're using

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:19.100
image resource method so if you're using
 

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.370
image resource method so if you're using
that API anyway to set rebels you can

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.380
that API anyway to set rebels you can
 

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.320
that API anyway to set rebels you can
use vector drawables back to the same

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.330
use vector drawables back to the same
 

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.330
use vector drawables back to the same
API levels now for anything that compact

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:28.340
API levels now for anything that compact
 

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.580

it doesn't work in every situation so
that's why I put a bit of a caveat

problems if you manually call update
 

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.190
problems if you manually call update
configuration and that's quite an

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200
configuration and that's quite an
 

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.109
configuration and that's quite an
advanced call I don't imagine many

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:02.119
advanced call I don't imagine many
 

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:03.700
advanced call I don't imagine many
people are using it but if you do you

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:03.710
people are using it but if you do you
 

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.890
people are using it but if you do you
probably don't enable this feature

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:08.900
 
 

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.350
 
so to actually use his method this is

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360
so to actually use his method this is
 

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:11.920
so to actually use his method this is
what I got

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:11.930
what I got
 

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.500
what I got
I advise you to actually use it it it's

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:14.510
I advise you to actually use it it it's
 

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.330
I advise you to actually use it it it's
a really lightweight method so in each

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:16.340
a really lightweight method so in each
 

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.070
a really lightweight method so in each
activity just stick a static block at

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080
activity just stick a static block at
 

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.680
activity just stick a static block at
the top which calls true if you want to

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:20.690
the top which calls true if you want to
 

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.780
the top which calls true if you want to
use the feature and it's really

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:22.790
use the feature and it's really
 

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.799
use the feature and it's really
lightweight so don't worry too much

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:23.809
lightweight so don't worry too much
 

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:27.690
lightweight so don't worry too much
about you know putting in every activity

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:27.700
about you know putting in every activity
 

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.380
about you know putting in every activity
so we've talked about how to actually

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:29.390
so we've talked about how to actually
 

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.790
so we've talked about how to actually
enable it let's talk about what actually

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:30.800
enable it let's talk about what actually
 

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.520
enable it let's talk about what actually
gives you so as I said earlier it allows

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:33.530
gives you so as I said earlier it allows
 

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.860
gives you so as I said earlier it allows
you to reference vector resources and an

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:35.870
you to reference vector resources and an
 

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.720
you to reference vector resources and an
advanced effects of resources within

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:37.730
advanced effects of resources within
 

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.030
advanced effects of resources within
drawable containers so if you want to

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.040
drawable containers so if you want to
 

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.890
drawable containers so if you want to
use vector in a stateless drawable or

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:41.900
use vector in a stateless drawable or
 

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.020
use vector in a stateless drawable or
maybe a layer or insert or lever list or

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.030
maybe a layer or insert or lever list or
 

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.180
maybe a layer or insert or lever list or
whatever it is you can do so with this

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:46.190
whatever it is you can do so with this
 

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.230
whatever it is you can do so with this
feature enabled so we've got an example

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240
feature enabled so we've got an example
 

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.540
feature enabled so we've got an example
where we're gonna wrap a vector drawable

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:52.550
where we're gonna wrap a vector drawable
 

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.790
where we're gonna wrap a vector drawable
in an inset drawable now this is quite

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:54.800
in an inset drawable now this is quite
 

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.860
in an inset drawable now this is quite
good because in set drawable if you

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:56.870
good because in set drawable if you
 

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.840
good because in set drawable if you
don't actually give it in in sets is

00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:58.850
don't actually give it in in sets is
 

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.590
don't actually give it in in sets is
basically an invisible wrapper so you're

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600
basically an invisible wrapper so you're
 

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.060
basically an invisible wrapper so you're
basically just have the vector drawable

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.070
basically just have the vector drawable
 

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.700
basically just have the vector drawable
and the container won't actually add

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:06.710
and the container won't actually add
 

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.530
and the container won't actually add
anything to it which means it can

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:08.540
anything to it which means it can
 

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.720
anything to it which means it can
actually didn't use it in more places so

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:10.730
actually didn't use it in more places so
 

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.460
actually didn't use it in more places so
here we got a text view and you can set

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:12.470
here we got a text view and you can set
 

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.220
here we got a text view and you can set
that wrapper as the draw left or we've

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:15.230
that wrapper as the draw left or we've
 

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.660
that wrapper as the draw left or we've
got the right or top you know whatever

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:16.670
got the right or top you know whatever
 

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.190
got the right or top you know whatever
it is but basically you can use it in

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200
it is but basically you can use it in
 

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.760
it is but basically you can use it in
more places another example as a radio

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:21.770
more places another example as a radio
 

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.130
more places another example as a radio
button button these are just two

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.140
button button these are just two
 

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.710
button button these are just two
examples background works there's other

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720
examples background works there's other
 

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.430
examples background works there's other
place as well so at least is nicely onto

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440
place as well so at least is nicely onto
 

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.860
place as well so at least is nicely onto
app compat now app compat is designed to

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:32.870
app compat now app compat is designed to
 

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:34.720
app compat now app compat is designed to
be a kind of mini backboard the

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:34.730
be a kind of mini backboard the
 

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.060
be a kind of mini backboard the
framework so things like toolbar the

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:37.070
framework so things like toolbar the
 

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.380
framework so things like toolbar the
action bar all those sort of things I

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.390
action bar all those sort of things I
 

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.299
action bar all those sort of things I
mean back ported into here and they

00:25:40.299 --> 00:25:40.309
mean back ported into here and they
 

00:25:40.309 --> 00:25:44.620
mean back ported into here and they
currently was about to APR seven

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:44.630
 
 

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.340
 
recently so the pad sort past six months

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.350
recently so the pad sort past six months
 

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.010
recently so the pad sort past six months
the first big thing that I like is night

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.020
the first big thing that I like is night
 

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.110
the first big thing that I like is night
mode so that allows your application to

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120
mode so that allows your application to
 

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.360
mode so that allows your application to
be themed light or dark based on the

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:55.370
be themed light or dark based on the
 

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.120
be themed light or dark based on the
time of day so here I've got an

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.130
time of day so here I've got an
 

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.669
time of day so here I've got an
application which is opened at noon and

00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:00.679
application which is opened at noon and
 

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:02.860
application which is opened at noon and
it's a light background with dark text

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:02.870
it's a light background with dark text
 

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.580
it's a light background with dark text
and then if I ever use it open that at

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:06.590
and then if I ever use it open that at
 

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.090
and then if I ever use it open that at
10:00 p.m.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:07.100
10:00 p.m.
 

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.980
10:00 p.m.
it'll be the it will be inverted so a

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:08.990
it'll be the it will be inverted so a
 

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.630
it'll be the it will be inverted so a
dark background light text which is

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640
dark background light text which is
 

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.460
dark background light text which is
great for users if they've been in bed

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:12.470
great for users if they've been in bed
 

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.120
great for users if they've been in bed
let's go there so there's two things you

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:16.130
let's go there so there's two things you
 

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.440
let's go there so there's two things you
have to do to actually enable this in

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:17.450
have to do to actually enable this in
 

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.210
have to do to actually enable this in
your app the first is you change your

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.220
your app the first is you change your
 

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.940
your app the first is you change your
theme and change it to extend from one

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.950
theme and change it to extend from one
 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.490
theme and change it to extend from one
of the theme

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500
of the theme
 

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.660
of the theme
compact day/night variants so if you're

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:26.670
compact day/night variants so if you're
 

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.520
compact day/night variants so if you're
already using like no action bar or dark

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.530
already using like no action bar or dark
 

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.260
already using like no action bar or dark
action bar we also have those variants

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.270
action bar we also have those variants
 

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.820
action bar we also have those variants
on top of it and so it should be a

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:31.830
on top of it and so it should be a
 

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.310
on top of it and so it should be a
straight swap once you've done that

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320
straight swap once you've done that
 

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.590
straight swap once you've done that
great but you need to tell app compat to

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600
great but you need to tell app compat to
 

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.420
great but you need to tell app compat to
actually enable the feature and you do

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:38.430
actually enable the feature and you do
 

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.800
actually enable the feature and you do
that via the set default light mode

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:39.810
that via the set default light mode
 

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.400
that via the set default light mode
method now that method takes one of four

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.410
method now that method takes one of four
 

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.850
method now that method takes one of four
options the first is follow system now

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:46.860
options the first is follow system now
 

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.950
options the first is follow system now
most people don't know but night mode

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960
most people don't know but night mode
 

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.920
most people don't know but night mode
has been in the framework since API 8

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:51.930
has been in the framework since API 8
 

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.710
has been in the framework since API 8
but before marshmallow it was behind a

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720
but before marshmallow it was behind a
 

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.350
but before marshmallow it was behind a
couple of scenarios you had to be in car

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360
couple of scenarios you had to be in car
 

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.060
couple of scenarios you had to be in car
mode and docked if you remember what

00:26:59.060 --> 00:26:59.070
mode and docked if you remember what
 

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.240
mode and docked if you remember what
those were in marshmallow the feature is

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.250
those were in marshmallow the feature is
 

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.310
those were in marshmallow the feature is
actually always there but it you cannot

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320
actually always there but it you cannot
 

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.170
actually always there but it you cannot
eat like it's you can enable it

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:06.180
eat like it's you can enable it
 

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.150
eat like it's you can enable it
basically but there's no usable visible

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:08.160
basically but there's no usable visible
 

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.860
basically but there's no usable visible
feature like there's no setting in the

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:09.870
feature like there's no setting in the
 

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.560
feature like there's no setting in the
settings for it so if you use this mode

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.570
settings for it so if you use this mode
 

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.060
settings for it so if you use this mode
in app compat basically we will always

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.070
in app compat basically we will always
 

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.720
in app compat basically we will always
follow what the system is doing the most

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:17.730
follow what the system is doing the most
 

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.370
follow what the system is doing the most
interesting one is probably mode night

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380
interesting one is probably mode night
 

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.830
interesting one is probably mode night
auto and that will automatically change

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840
auto and that will automatically change
 

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.390
auto and that will automatically change
between light and dark based on the time

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400
between light and dark based on the time
 

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.390
between light and dark based on the time
of day and it will look at the last

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400
of day and it will look at the last
 

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.250
of day and it will look at the last
known location of the device and then

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260
known location of the device and then
 

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.260
known location of the device and then
try and work out a rough approximate

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.270
try and work out a rough approximate
 

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.090

sunset and sunrise time and then use
 

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.540
sunset and sunrise time and then use
that to say whether in day or tonight

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:34.550
that to say whether in day or tonight
 

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.950

that's very nice and then the follow to
 

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.830
that's very nice and then the follow to
that the last two yes and no which do is

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840
that the last two yes and no which do is
 

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.960

that you can using a color but you also

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:54.330
that you can using a color but you also
 

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.399
that you can using a color but you also
have this new functionality where you

00:28:55.399 --> 00:28:55.409
have this new functionality where you
 

00:28:55.409 --> 00:28:57.139
have this new functionality where you
can change the Alpha of the color at the

00:28:57.139 --> 00:28:57.149
can change the Alpha of the color at the
 

00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:59.389
can change the Alpha of the color at the
same time so using the Android alpha

00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399
same time so using the Android alpha
 

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:01.999
same time so using the Android alpha
attribute you can modulate the Alpha of

00:29:01.999 --> 00:29:02.009
attribute you can modulate the Alpha of
 

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.060
attribute you can modulate the Alpha of
the color to whatever you want now it

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.070
the color to whatever you want now it

the color to whatever you want now it
takes a float value from 0 to 1 we're

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:07.289
takes a float value from 0 to 1 we're
 

00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:08.629
takes a float value from 0 to 1 we're
just going to reference the system

00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:08.639
just going to reference the system
 

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:10.820
just going to reference the system

last year at last I've actually we
 

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.529
last year at last I've actually we
released it as a kind of first party

take implementing some of the components
for a material design since then we've

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:42.269
for a material design since then we've
 

00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:43.639
for a material design since then we've
been in kind of book fixed mode and not

00:29:43.639 --> 00:29:43.649
been in kind of book fixed mode and not
 

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:45.409
been in kind of book fixed mode and not
trying to stabilize it but we have added

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419
trying to stabilize it but we have added
 

00:29:45.419 --> 00:29:47.990
trying to stabilize it but we have added
some features recently the first big one

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000
some features recently the first big one
 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.299
some features recently the first big one
is bottom sheets now in spec there are

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:50.309
is bottom sheets now in spec there are
 

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:52.299
is bottom sheets now in spec there are
two types there's persistent and modal

00:29:52.299 --> 00:29:52.309
two types there's persistent and modal
 

00:29:52.309 --> 00:29:54.470
two types there's persistent and modal
persistent and when they are when the

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480
persistent and when they are when the
 

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.580
persistent and when they are when the
bottom sheet is always part of your

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:55.590
bottom sheet is always part of your
 

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.590
bottom sheet is always part of your
content you can't dismiss it so a good

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600
content you can't dismiss it so a good
 

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.389
content you can't dismiss it so a good
example is Maps here in that it shows

00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399
example is Maps here in that it shows
 

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.070
example is Maps here in that it shows
the detail for you know whatever the

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080
the detail for you know whatever the
 

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.100
the detail for you know whatever the
address is or whatever on the right they

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.110
address is or whatever on the right they
 

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.509
address is or whatever on the right they
got the modal ones and that's basically

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519
got the modal ones and that's basically
 

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:07.730
got the modal ones and that's basically
it described as being an alternative to

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740
it described as being an alternative to
 

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.460
it described as being an alternative to
dialog so let's take a quick look at

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:10.470
dialog so let's take a quick look at
 

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.899
dialog so let's take a quick look at
what they look like so this is the

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:11.909
what they look like so this is the
 

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:13.460
what they look like so this is the
actual implantation as you can see as

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:13.470
actual implantation as you can see as
 

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.899
actual implantation as you can see as
the user Scrolls up and down it

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:14.909
the user Scrolls up and down it
 

00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:17.749
the user Scrolls up and down it
collapses and expands but you can never

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:17.759
collapses and expands but you can never
 

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:20.930
collapses and expands but you can never
dismiss it and to actually use it the

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940
dismiss it and to actually use it the
 

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.399
dismiss it and to actually use it the
first thing you'll note is that the

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:22.409
first thing you'll note is that the
 

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:23.779
first thing you'll note is that the
parent needs to be a coordinator layer

00:30:23.779 --> 00:30:23.789
parent needs to be a coordinator layer
 

00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:25.549
parent needs to be a coordinator layer
so if you use an app bar layout and

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559
so if you use an app bar layout and
 

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:28.820
so if you use an app bar layout and
whatnot you're all set already and we've

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:28.830
whatnot you're all set already and we've
 

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.470
whatnot you're all set already and we've
been here you set the rest of your

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480
been here you set the rest of your
 

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.060
been here you set the rest of your
content so in the map example it'd be a

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:32.070
content so in the map example it'd be a
 

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.369
content so in the map example it'd be a
map view and then we have our bottom

00:30:34.369 --> 00:30:34.379
map view and then we have our bottom
 

00:30:34.379 --> 00:30:36.169
map view and then we have our bottom
sheet here we're using a linear layout

00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179
sheet here we're using a linear layout
 

00:30:36.179 --> 00:30:38.600
sheet here we're using a linear layout
but it could be whatever you want and

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:38.610
but it could be whatever you want and
 

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.610
but it could be whatever you want and
the way you actually tell it to be a

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620
the way you actually tell it to be a
 

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.740
the way you actually tell it to be a
bottom sheet is by setting this special

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:42.750
bottom sheet is by setting this special
 

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.470
bottom sheet is by setting this special
behavior on it now in light write a

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100
about behaviors so view one no more go
 

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.470
about behaviors so view one no more go
and read that first but this is the way

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480
and read that first but this is the way
 

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.370
and read that first but this is the way
you actually tell it to be a bottom

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380
you actually tell it to be a bottom
 

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.190
you actually tell it to be a bottom
sheet and then we also have an option by

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200
sheet and then we also have an option by
 

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.660
sheet and then we also have an option by
default it will just sit the bottom of a

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:56.670
default it will just sit the bottom of a
 

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.850
default it will just sit the bottom of a
default peak height but you can also set

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860
default peak height but you can also set
 

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.200
default peak height but you can also set
it to be what if you want the peak

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:00.210
it to be what if you want the peak
 

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:01.550
it to be what if you want the peak
height is how much it sits at the bottom

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:01.560
height is how much it sits at the bottom
 

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.380
height is how much it sits at the bottom
when it's collapsed the second type is

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:06.390
when it's collapsed the second type is
 

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.000
when it's collapsed the second type is
modal so I said it's like an alternative

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.010
modal so I said it's like an alternative
 

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.400
modal so I said it's like an alternative
to dialog so as you can see here when

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.410
to dialog so as you can see here when
 

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.410
to dialog so as you can see here when
the user clicks you get this modal

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:12.420
the user clicks you get this modal
 

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.760
the user clicks you get this modal
bottom sheet which you can scroll and

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:13.770
bottom sheet which you can scroll and
 

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:20.090
bottom sheet which you can scroll and
then dismiss so we know that most people

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100
then dismiss so we know that most people
 

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.620
then dismiss so we know that most people
we've already scribed them there's an

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:21.630
we've already scribed them there's an
 

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.840
we've already scribed them there's an
alternative dialog so the way we've

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:23.850
alternative dialog so the way we've
 

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.250
alternative dialog so the way we've
tried to implement this is as simple as

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260
tried to implement this is as simple as
 

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.480
tried to implement this is as simple as
possible

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:26.490
possible
 

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.580
possible
we know that majority people use and

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:28.590
we know that majority people use and
 

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.690
we know that majority people use and
dialogues we'll probably use a dialog

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700
dialogues we'll probably use a dialog
 

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.790
dialogues we'll probably use a dialog
fragment so we try to implement this

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:31.800
fragment so we try to implement this
 

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.100
fragment so we try to implement this
using that so you should be able to just

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.110
using that so you should be able to just
 

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:36.380
using that so you should be able to just
extend and change the superclass of your

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:36.390
extend and change the superclass of your
 

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.480
extend and change the superclass of your
any of your fragments so this new bottom

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:38.490
any of your fragments so this new bottom
 

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.100
any of your fragments so this new bottom
sheet dialog fragment and they will just

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:40.110
sheet dialog fragment and they will just
 

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.350
sheet dialog fragment and they will just
suddenly become a bomb sheet it's really

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360
suddenly become a bomb sheet it's really
 

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.030
suddenly become a bomb sheet it's really
simple to use I've used entirely in a

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:44.040

that you just create the fragment and

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:48.180
that you just create the fragment and
 

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.940
that you just create the fragment and
then call dot show which you know the

feature it's more of a bug with fixed is

00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:58.830
feature it's more of a bug with fixed is
 

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:02.060
feature it's more of a bug with fixed is
that any of the elevation handling was

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.070
that any of the elevation handling was
 

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.220
that any of the elevation handling was

ease of implementation for last year but
we should been trying to fix it so we

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.050
we should been trying to fix it so we
 

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.540
we should been trying to fix it so we
have there are free scenarios on the

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:11.550
have there are free scenarios on the
 

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.030
have there are free scenarios on the
material spec of app bar scrolling the

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.040
material spec of app bar scrolling the
 

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.810
material spec of app bar scrolling the
first is always elevated so here the

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.820
first is always elevated so here the
 

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.130
first is always elevated so here the
user Scrolls and regardless of the

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140
user Scrolls and regardless of the
 

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.990
user Scrolls and regardless of the
scroll position it is always elevated

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000
scroll position it is always elevated
 

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.340
scroll position it is always elevated
which means it casts a shadow basically

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.350
which means it casts a shadow basically
 

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:23.810
which means it casts a shadow basically
you probably can't see very well but it

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820
you probably can't see very well but it
 

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.410
you probably can't see very well but it
is elevated and then we have the second

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.420
is elevated and then we have the second
 

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.920
is elevated and then we have the second
type so here the the header is not

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:30.930
type so here the the header is not
 

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:32.390
type so here the the header is not
elevated so it's in line with the

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:32.400
elevated so it's in line with the
 

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.000
elevated so it's in line with the
content and then as the user Scrolls and

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.010
content and then as the user Scrolls and
 

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.040
content and then as the user Scrolls and
it collapses it then becomes elevated

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.050
it collapses it then becomes elevated
 

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.910
it collapses it then becomes elevated
and then as I scroll off it doesn't eat

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:40.920
and then as I scroll off it doesn't eat
 

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.410
and then as I scroll off it doesn't eat
it's no longer elevated so that is

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:42.420
it's no longer elevated so that is
 

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.030
it's no longer elevated so that is
implemented using a clapping table while

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:44.040
implemented using a clapping table while
 

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.300
implemented using a clapping table while
I am but there's a third scenario on

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:47.310
I am but there's a third scenario on
 

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.700
I am but there's a third scenario on
spec which we didn't support and that is

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:49.710
spec which we didn't support and that is
 

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.560
spec which we didn't support and that is
when you have a collapsing content but

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:51.570
when you have a collapsing content but
 

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.980
when you have a collapsing content but
you also want it to stay elevated so we

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:54.990
you also want it to stay elevated so we
 

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.030
you also want it to stay elevated so we
were trying to think of ways try to

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.040
were trying to think of ways try to
 

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.730
were trying to think of ways try to
implement this in a nice way and the way

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740
implement this in a nice way and the way
 

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.039
implement this in a nice way and the way
we sort fell with was stateless

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:02.049
we sort fell with was stateless
 

00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:04.049
we sort fell with was stateless
so now we now have a stateless animatic

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:04.059
so now we now have a stateless animatic
 

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:06.749
so now we now have a stateless animatic
which controls all of the elevation now

00:33:06.749 --> 00:33:06.759
which controls all of the elevation now
 

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:08.129
which controls all of the elevation now
this is similar to the button

00:33:08.129 --> 00:33:08.139
this is similar to the button
 

00:33:08.139 --> 00:33:09.869
this is similar to the button
implementation or material so when you

00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:09.879
implementation or material so when you
 

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:11.129
implementation or material so when you
present when you click on a button on

00:33:11.129 --> 00:33:11.139
present when you click on a button on
 

00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:12.509
present when you click on a button on
material it was supposed to come to your

00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519
material it was supposed to come to your
 

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.970
material it was supposed to come to your
finger and large now that uses a

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:14.980
finger and large now that uses a
 

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.129
finger and large now that uses a
stateless animator internally to

00:33:16.129 --> 00:33:16.139
stateless animator internally to
 

00:33:16.139 --> 00:33:18.479
stateless animator internally to
actually do that so we're choosing the

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:18.489
actually do that so we're choosing the
 

00:33:18.489 --> 00:33:21.779
actually do that so we're choosing the
same functionality so we've added two

00:33:21.779 --> 00:33:21.789
same functionality so we've added two
 

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:23.549
same functionality so we've added two
states which you can use in your

00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559
states which you can use in your
 

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:24.960
states which you can use in your
stateless animators to actually import

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:24.970
stateless animators to actually import
 

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.759
stateless animators to actually import
this the first is collapsible which

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:26.769
this the first is collapsible which
 

00:33:26.769 --> 00:33:29.159
this the first is collapsible which
means that there is classical content

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:29.169
means that there is classical content
 

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:32.070
means that there is classical content
within that bar layer and secondly it's

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080
within that bar layer and secondly it's
 

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.720
within that bar layer and secondly it's
collapsed and that means that there is

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:33.730
collapsed and that means that there is
 

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.430
collapsed and that means that there is
collapsible content and it is also

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440
collapsible content and it is also
 

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.590
collapsible content and it is also
collapsed so let's take a look an

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600
collapsed so let's take a look an
 

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.289
collapsed so let's take a look an
example so here we're gonna implement

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:40.299
example so here we're gonna implement
 

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:43.399
example so here we're gonna implement
the scenario where you want it to be

00:33:43.399 --> 00:33:43.409
the scenario where you want it to be
 

00:33:43.409 --> 00:33:45.479
the scenario where you want it to be
elevated when it's collapsed so the

00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:45.489
elevated when it's collapsed so the
 

00:33:45.489 --> 00:33:48.359
elevated when it's collapsed so the
second scenario now this is already

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:48.369
second scenario now this is already
 

00:33:48.369 --> 00:33:49.919
second scenario now this is already
giving you two by default you do not

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:49.929
giving you two by default you do not
 

00:33:49.929 --> 00:33:51.690
giving you two by default you do not
need to implement this we're just going

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:51.700
need to implement this we're just going
 

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.129
need to implement this we're just going
to use this as a sample to actually show

00:33:53.129 --> 00:33:53.139
to use this as a sample to actually show
 

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:56.340
to use this as a sample to actually show
you how to use the new States so here we

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:56.350
you how to use the new States so here we
 

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.720
you how to use the new States so here we
have two items with Miss Daley's

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:57.730
have two items with Miss Daley's
 

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:02.369
have two items with Miss Daley's
animator the first is ran when we have

00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:02.379
animator the first is ran when we have
 

00:34:02.379 --> 00:34:04.200
animator the first is ran when we have
some class for content and is also

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.210
some class for content and is also
 

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.509
some class for content and is also
collapsed so if you think back to the

00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519
collapsed so if you think back to the
 

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:08.099
collapsed so if you think back to the
scenario in that point it needs to be

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:08.109
scenario in that point it needs to be
 

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:10.589
scenario in that point it needs to be
elevated which means that we animate the

00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599
elevated which means that we animate the
 

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:12.450
elevated which means that we animate the
elevation up to eight dip now it could

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:12.460
elevation up to eight dip now it could
 

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.069
elevation up to eight dip now it could
be any value whatever you want look at

00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079
be any value whatever you want look at
 

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:15.599
be any value whatever you want look at
spec for the actual value should use

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:15.609
spec for the actual value should use
 

00:34:15.609 --> 00:34:17.159
spec for the actual value should use
which is going to use eight dippers an

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:17.169
which is going to use eight dippers an
 

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:21.180
which is going to use eight dippers an
example and the second item doesn't have

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:21.190
example and the second item doesn't have
 

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:22.889
example and the second item doesn't have
any states which means it's the default

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:22.899
any states which means it's the default
 

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:24.750
any states which means it's the default
item therefore it'll be ran whenever the

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760
item therefore it'll be ran whenever the
 

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.299
item therefore it'll be ran whenever the
first item doesn't hold true at this

00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:27.309
first item doesn't hold true at this
 

00:34:27.309 --> 00:34:31.559
first item doesn't hold true at this
point it is when the classical content

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:31.569
point it is when the classical content
 

00:34:31.569 --> 00:34:34.260
point it is when the classical content
is no longer collapsed therefore we want

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:34.270
is no longer collapsed therefore we want
 

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.059
is no longer collapsed therefore we want
to elevate bring the elevation down to

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:36.069
to elevate bring the elevation down to
 

00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:38.849
to elevate bring the elevation down to
zero and therefore it's not elevated so

00:34:38.849 --> 00:34:38.859
zero and therefore it's not elevated so
 

00:34:38.859 --> 00:34:40.049
zero and therefore it's not elevated so
as I said you don't need to implement

00:34:40.049 --> 00:34:40.059
as I said you don't need to implement
 

00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:41.490
as I said you don't need to implement
that that is done by default for you

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:41.500
that that is done by default for you
 

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.220
that that is done by default for you
just using an example if you think back

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:44.230
just using an example if you think back
 

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.599
just using an example if you think back
there was a third scenario which we

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:45.609
there was a third scenario which we
 

00:34:45.609 --> 00:34:48.720
there was a third scenario which we
didn't model don't currently support now

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:48.730
didn't model don't currently support now
 

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.889
didn't model don't currently support now
that's a really simple stateless

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:49.899
that's a really simple stateless
 

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:52.680
that's a really simple stateless
animator it just has one item so it

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:52.690
animator it just has one item so it
 

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.930
animator it just has one item so it
doesn't even look at the states and it

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:54.940
doesn't even look at the states and it
 

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.200
doesn't even look at the states and it
just sets the elevations at a tip that's

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.210
just sets the elevations at a tip that's
 

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.780
just sets the elevations at a tip that's
all it does

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:00.790
 
 

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.270
 
to actually use this you just set the

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280
to actually use this you just set the
 

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.370
to actually use this you just set the
stateless animator tag on your layouts

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:05.380
stateless animator tag on your layouts
 

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.020
stateless animator tag on your layouts

enough to tease that we're telling you

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:25.900
enough to tease that we're telling you
 

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.720
enough to tease that we're telling you
about future things in support library

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:27.730
about future things in support library
 

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.230
about future things in support library
this morning so let's start out with a

this is going

00:36:13.269 --> 00:36:13.279
this is going

this is going
we are dropping support for api's below

00:36:16.759 --> 00:36:16.769
we are dropping support for api's below
 

00:36:16.769 --> 00:36:19.779
we are dropping support for api's below
9 this has been a long time coming so

00:36:19.779 --> 00:36:19.789
9 this has been a long time coming so
 

00:36:19.789 --> 00:36:25.849
9 this has been a long time coming so
less than it's only it's only API 9

00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859
less than it's only it's only API 9
 

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:29.059
less than it's only it's only API 9
don't get too excited so less than a

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:29.069
don't get too excited so less than a
 

00:36:29.069 --> 00:36:31.579

access to Play Store are supporting API

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380
access to Play Store are supporting API
 

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.019
access to Play Store are supporting API
is less than our running API is less

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:36.029
is less than our running API is less
 

00:36:36.029 --> 00:36:40.219
is less than our running API is less
than 9 so dropping support means 1 we

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:40.229
than 9 so dropping support means 1 we
 

00:36:40.229 --> 00:36:41.989
than 9 so dropping support means 1 we
have fewer methods so we're taking a

00:36:41.989 --> 00:36:41.999
have fewer methods so we're taking a
 

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.690
have fewer methods so we're taking a
couple of steps back from your ProGuard

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700
couple of steps back from your ProGuard
 

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:52.279
couple of steps back from your ProGuard
X limit yeah so about 130 methods right

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:52.289
X limit yeah so about 130 methods right
 

00:36:52.289 --> 00:36:54.680
X limit yeah so about 130 methods right
now just remove from v4 we're still in

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:54.690
now just remove from v4 we're still in
 

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.620
now just remove from v4 we're still in
the process of backing things out this

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:57.630
the process of backing things out this
 

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.029
the process of backing things out this
is also going to reprove improve our

00:36:59.029 --> 00:36:59.039
is also going to reprove improve our
 

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:01.130
is also going to reprove improve our
release cycle so we're able to now focus

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140
release cycle so we're able to now focus
 

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.140
release cycle so we're able to now focus
on the same platforms that you actually

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.150
on the same platforms that you actually
 

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.599
on the same platforms that you actually
care about as it turns out supporting

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:05.609
care about as it turns out supporting
 

00:37:05.609 --> 00:37:07.969
care about as it turns out supporting
API for takes a lot more effort than

00:37:07.969 --> 00:37:07.979
API for takes a lot more effort than
 

00:37:07.979 --> 00:37:11.539
API for takes a lot more effort than
supporting API 9 or 14 which is why most

00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:11.549
supporting API 9 or 14 which is why most
 

00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:14.209
supporting API 9 or 14 which is why most
people here aren't supporting API 4 so

00:37:14.209 --> 00:37:14.219
people here aren't supporting API 4 so
 

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:15.440
people here aren't supporting API 4 so
we're going to be able to iterate faster

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.450
we're going to be able to iterate faster
 

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.329
we're going to be able to iterate faster
we're gonna be able to focus our fixes

00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339
we're gonna be able to focus our fixes
 

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:19.849
we're gonna be able to focus our fixes
and our workarounds for platform bugs

00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859
and our workarounds for platform bugs
 

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:22.640
and our workarounds for platform bugs
and our testing on the API is that you

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:22.650
and our testing on the API is that you
 

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.309
and our testing on the API is that you
actually care about so hopefully that'll

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319
actually care about so hopefully that'll
 

00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:27.099
actually care about so hopefully that'll
make your life a little bit better

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:27.109
make your life a little bit better
 

00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:31.700
make your life a little bit better
second as I mentioned earlier support v4

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:31.710
second as I mentioned earlier support v4
 

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.209
second as I mentioned earlier support v4
contains backwards compatibility shims

00:37:34.209 --> 00:37:34.219
contains backwards compatibility shims
 

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:36.469
contains backwards compatibility shims
so this is so you don't have to wrap

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:36.479
so this is so you don't have to wrap
 

00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:38.420
so this is so you don't have to wrap
everything with a version check and then

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.430
everything with a version check and then
 

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.309
everything with a version check and then
figure out some reasonable fallback

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319
figure out some reasonable fallback
 

00:37:40.319 --> 00:37:43.489
figure out some reasonable fallback
behavior and support before started out

00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:43.499
behavior and support before started out
 

00:37:43.499 --> 00:37:46.940
behavior and support before started out
only containing this and then we added

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:46.950
only containing this and then we added
 

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.410
only containing this and then we added
some other things so we added fragments

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420
some other things so we added fragments
 

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.940
some other things so we added fragments
in API 11 we figured it'd be good to

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:49.950
in API 11 we figured it'd be good to
 

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.160
in API 11 we figured it'd be good to
have a backwards compatible way to get

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.170
have a backwards compatible way to get
 

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.359
have a backwards compatible way to get
people on board with fragments

00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:53.369
people on board with fragments
 

00:37:53.369 --> 00:37:55.190
people on board with fragments
supporting older devices and then we

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200
supporting older devices and then we
 

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.539
supporting older devices and then we
added some helpers for things like

00:37:56.539 --> 00:37:56.549
added some helpers for things like
 

00:37:56.549 --> 00:37:59.479
added some helpers for things like
accessibility and drag and drop and then

00:37:59.479 --> 00:37:59.489
accessibility and drag and drop and then
 

00:37:59.489 --> 00:38:01.549
accessibility and drag and drop and then
we added some more stuff and some more

00:38:01.549 --> 00:38:01.559
we added some more stuff and some more
 

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:05.599
we added some more stuff and some more
stuff and support v4 alone has become a

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:05.609
stuff and support v4 alone has become a
 

00:38:05.609 --> 00:38:07.489
stuff and support v4 alone has become a
very large library so we're gonna be

00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:07.499
very large library so we're gonna be
 

00:38:07.499 --> 00:38:11.359
very large library so we're gonna be
breaking that up into more focused

00:38:11.359 --> 00:38:11.369
breaking that up into more focused
 

00:38:11.369 --> 00:38:13.969
breaking that up into more focused
modules and the important thing here is

00:38:13.969 --> 00:38:13.979
modules and the important thing here is
 

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:16.400
modules and the important thing here is
that we're going to support we're gonna

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:16.410
that we're going to support we're gonna
 

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:18.680
that we're going to support we're gonna
hold your hand through this process so

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:18.690
hold your hand through this process so
 

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.910
hold your hand through this process so
we're not changing any of the package

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920
we're not changing any of the package
 

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.969
we're not changing any of the package
names I should also mention for the

00:38:22.969 --> 00:38:22.979
names I should also mention for the
 

00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:25.009
names I should also mention for the
minimum version change we're not

00:38:25.009 --> 00:38:25.019
minimum version change we're not
 

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:26.539
minimum version change we're not
changing any of the package

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:26.549
changing any of the package
 

00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:29.410
changing any of the package
so support v4 is still support v4

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:29.420
so support v4 is still support v4
 

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.299
so support v4 is still support v4
support v4 dot media is still support v4

00:38:32.299 --> 00:38:32.309
support v4 dot media is still support v4
 

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.609
support v4 dot media is still support v4
media we're gonna be moving them into

00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619
media we're gonna be moving them into
 

00:38:34.619 --> 00:38:36.769
media we're gonna be moving them into
different modules and we will have a

00:38:36.769 --> 00:38:36.779
different modules and we will have a
 

00:38:36.779 --> 00:38:38.509
different modules and we will have a
meta module that includes everything

00:38:38.509 --> 00:38:38.519
meta module that includes everything
 

00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:41.180
meta module that includes everything
under the old name so all of the

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:41.190
under the old name so all of the
 

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.009
under the old name so all of the
libraries that you use that depend on

00:38:43.009 --> 00:38:43.019
libraries that you use that depend on
 

00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:45.829
libraries that you use that depend on
the package naming structure and the

00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839
the package naming structure and the
 

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:47.480
the package naming structure and the
package names themselves of the module

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:47.490
package names themselves of the module
 

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.640
package names themselves of the module
names themselves will be fine we're not

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:49.650
names themselves will be fine we're not
 

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.079
names themselves will be fine we're not
going to end up in a situation where you

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:51.089
going to end up in a situation where you
 

00:38:51.089 --> 00:38:52.640
going to end up in a situation where you
need a special version of a library

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:52.650
need a special version of a library
 

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:59.390
need a special version of a library
dependency let's say so hopefully this

00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400
dependency let's say so hopefully this
 

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.370
dependency let's say so hopefully this
is going to be a completely source code

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380
is going to be a completely source code
 

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.079
is going to be a completely source code
compatible and binary compatible with

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:03.089
compatible and binary compatible with
 

00:39:03.089 --> 00:39:05.029
compatible and binary compatible with
your existing applications and library

00:39:05.029 --> 00:39:05.039
your existing applications and library
 

00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:07.700
your existing applications and library
jars and hopefully this is gonna make

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.710
jars and hopefully this is gonna make
 

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.109
jars and hopefully this is gonna make
your life as a developer a little bit

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119
your life as a developer a little bit
 

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:19.420
your life as a developer a little bit
easier so thanks everybody for coming

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:19.430
 
 

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.190
 
we have some other talks that you may be

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200
we have some other talks that you may be
 

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.559
we have some other talks that you may be
interested in what the fragment today at

00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:24.569
interested in what the fragment today at
 

00:39:24.569 --> 00:39:26.870
interested in what the fragment today at
five data binding and recyclerview

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880
five data binding and recyclerview
 

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.269
five data binding and recyclerview
thanks again everyone we'll see you

00:39:29.269 --> 00:39:29.279
thanks again everyone we'll see you
 

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:45.230
