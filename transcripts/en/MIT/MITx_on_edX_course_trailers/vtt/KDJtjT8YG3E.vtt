00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.800
ANANT AGARWAL: Welcome to MITx, MIT'S
worldwide online learning initiative.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.930
We are delighted to have you join us for
6.002x, Circuits and Electronics,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.815
the inaugural course of MITx.

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:21.360
PROFESSOR: OK, welcome to 6.002.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.250
ANANT AGARWAL: 6.002x is the same as the
electronic circuits course taken

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.500
by MIT students as their first course
in an EE or EECS major at MIT.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.900
This course will help you make the
transition from physics to electrical

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.620
engineering.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.840
In this course you will learn about
a lot of fun things, including the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.540
foundations behind many cool devices
such as the smartphone.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.592
The course will be hard, and we
want you to stick with us.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:55.520
It is our hope that you will have
a lot of fun in this course.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.690
Let me start by introducing
you to our team.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.760
I am Anant Agarwal.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.379
Like most MIT faculty, I have a wide
range of interests, including a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.629
fascination around chainsaws.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.630
GERRY SUSSMAN: Hello, I'm Gerry Sussman,
professor of electrical

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.980
engineering at MIT.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.310
Been a faculty member here since 1973.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.190
I build electronics, optics, computer
software, and I repair

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.440
watches as a hobby.

00:01:31.838 --> 00:01:33.450
PIOTR MITROS: I'm Piotr Mitros.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.460
I'm a research scientist at MIT, and
I was in charge of developing the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.310
software infrastructure for MITx.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.685
As a graduate student I spent a lot of
time traveling around India, Nigeria,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.270
and China, mostly as part of educational
technology projects.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.620
So I'm very excited to be helping
out with this course.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.880
ANANT AGARWAL: Whether we like chainsaws
or watches, we're all

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.050
passionate educators.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.200
This course is free.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.780
In this experimental first course of
MITx, the certificates are also free.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.930
Now, this is a prototype course, and we
welcome your participation and any

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.680
feedback you might have to improving
the learning experience.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.930
Let's get started.
