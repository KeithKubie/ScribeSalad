00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.101
You're watching,
When "Keeping it Real"

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:03.837
Goes Wrong.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.974
Vernon Franklin was
an exceptional young man.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.077
He was the valedictorian
of his high school class,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.678
won several scholarships,

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:16.349
and became the first person
in his family to attend college.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:20.686
He got a good job and worked
14-hour days, 6 days a week,

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.222
quickly becoming
the youngest vice president

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.892
in the history
of the Via Corp Corporation,

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.428
ending the cycle of violence
and drug addiction

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.164
that had plagued
his family for generations.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.802
The officers of his company
were wrapping up the usual

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.604
Thursday meeting
in the South Conference Room

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:41.607
when Frank Murphy,
the man who had mentored Vernon,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.543
made an awkward comment.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.145
Vernon, great job, buddy.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.181
You the man.
Give me some skin, huh?

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.418
Vernon got along with all
of the people he worked with,

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.889
which in his heart of hearts
made him feel like an Uncle Tom.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.958
Though he could have ignored
the simple comment

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.695
his mentor made,
Vernon decided to keep it real.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.864
Get your motherfucking hand
out of my face.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.800
You heard me, motherfucker.
Get your hands outta my face.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.070
What you think this is, man?
Just shake my hand like a man.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.239
"All right, give me some five
on the backhand side

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.574
with all this crazy jive."

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.976
It's bullshit.
Want a little soft shoe?

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.011
Should I juggle some
watermelons for you, boss?

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.279
Fuck all that, nigger.

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:21.514
Hey, Vernon, buddy.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.683
Get your motherfucking hands
off me, Frank.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.917
This ain't a game.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.953
This isn't the Vernon I know.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.189
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
My name is Hov

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:31.824
You never heard that before,
have you?

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.094
Rap music is dangerous.
I used to beat motherfuckers up

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.063
just like you just for
walking around my way, nigger.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.297
Vernon, Vernon, buddy.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.532
You better sit the fuck down,
Frank.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:40.733
Excuse me?

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.401
I said sit down, bitch.
Thug life.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.137
You think this
is a game, nigger?

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.639
Wu-Tang.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.509
Today, Vernon works
at Sonny's Fill 'Er Up

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.577
on Route 80 in New Jersey.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.780
He makes $6.45 an hour
and stinks of gasoline,

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.716
even when he's not
at the station.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.785
It's as real as it can be.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:02.555
Dollar? What I'm gonna
get with a dollar, nigger?

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.958
I got kids,
and that's real.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:10.663
Vernon Franklin, once a heart-
warming story of perseverance.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:11.864
Wu-Tang.

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:16.068
Today, a sparkling example
of when keeping it real

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.804
goes wrong.
