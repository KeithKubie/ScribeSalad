this in ways where there's real
 

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.960
this in ways where there's real
causality in there there's a

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:13.970
causality in there there's a
 

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.900
causality in there there's a
contribution so it matters so what's

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:16.910
contribution so it matters so what's
 

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.210
contribution so it matters so what's
interesting is that we've got these

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:19.220
interesting is that we've got these
 

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.250
interesting is that we've got these
generalizations we know in general what

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:21.260
generalizations we know in general what
 

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.000
generalizations we know in general what
sorts of foods are better but what's

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.010
sorts of foods are better but what's
 

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.670
sorts of foods are better but what's
fascinating to me is that how very

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680
fascinating to me is that how very
 

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.590
fascinating to me is that how very
little we understand about what's

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600
little we understand about what's
 

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.870
little we understand about what's
actually best for us as we go through

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880
actually best for us as we go through
 

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.900
actually best for us as we go through
all our life course is the food that you

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:34.910
all our life course is the food that you

how we told longitudinal but it's N
 

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.670
how we told longitudinal but it's N
equals 1 so we need more really it'd be

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:10.680

work a lot with disease and that's not

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:30.450
work a lot with disease and that's not
 

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.170
work a lot with disease and that's not
what it should be and we see all the

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:33.180
what it should be and we see all the
 

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.180
what it should be and we see all the
relation between their food habits that

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:35.190
relation between their food habits that
 

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.220
relation between their food habits that
are changing replacing the traditional

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.230
are changing replacing the traditional
 

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.710

foods for the industrialized ultra
 

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.480
foods for the industrialized ultra
processed foods and that's directly

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:41.490
processed foods and that's directly
 

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.810
processed foods and that's directly
correlated to chronic disease to

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:43.820
correlated to chronic disease to
 

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.790
correlated to chronic disease to
increasing obesity and also to not

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:46.800
increasing obesity and also to not
 

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.380
increasing obesity and also to not
having enough micro nutrients and I

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.390
having enough micro nutrients and I
 

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.910
having enough micro nutrients and I
that's all associated because it's a

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:49.920
that's all associated because it's a
 

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.690
that's all associated because it's a
whole food pattern

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700
whole food pattern
 

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.700
whole food pattern
going on but on the other hand we do

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:52.710
going on but on the other hand we do
 

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.550
going on but on the other hand we do
have all of this heritage or the culture

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:55.560
have all of this heritage or the culture
 

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.740
have all of this heritage or the culture
behind it and Brazil is a very vast

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:57.750
behind it and Brazil is a very vast
 

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.490
behind it and Brazil is a very vast
country and has had immigration and also

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500
country and has had immigration and also
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.590
country and has had immigration and also
the indigenous populations mixing

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600
the indigenous populations mixing
 

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.810
the indigenous populations mixing
together and that's how I can actually

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820
together and that's how I can actually
 

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.820
together and that's how I can actually
build many different food cultures in

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:07.830
build many different food cultures in
 

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.740
build many different food cultures in
the country and the most interesting

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:09.750
the country and the most interesting
 

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.450
the country and the most interesting
interesting part is that we found that

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460
interesting part is that we found that
 

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.640
interesting part is that we found that
each one of them this in its uniqueness

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.650
each one of them this in its uniqueness
 

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.730
each one of them this in its uniqueness
it has is healthy because it was built

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740
it has is healthy because it was built
 

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.470
it has is healthy because it was built
to that as the food has their own

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480
to that as the food has their own
 

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.260
to that as the food has their own
history of being non-random group of

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.270
history of being non-random group of
 

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.610
history of being non-random group of
nutrients we do have the meals having

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620
nutrients we do have the meals having
 

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.680
nutrients we do have the meals having
the same meaning so they evolved

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:27.690
the same meaning so they evolved
 

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.050
the same meaning so they evolved
culturally and sociologically through

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.060
culturally and sociologically through
 

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.180
culturally and sociologically through
time and that brings us to a whole

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:32.190
time and that brings us to a whole
 

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.400
time and that brings us to a whole
mixing pot which is Brazil but with all

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:34.410
mixing pot which is Brazil but with all
 

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.320
mixing pot which is Brazil but with all
the differences and we see that each

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.330
the differences and we see that each
 

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.810
the differences and we see that each
region has different foods and actually

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820
region has different foods and actually
 

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.550
region has different foods and actually
you can build very healthy diet centene

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:40.560
you can build very healthy diet centene
 

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.590
you can build very healthy diet centene
each one of them and that's what I

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600
each one of them and that's what I
 

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.270
each one of them and that's what I
actually have how our food Baker food

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280
actually have how our food Baker food
 

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.310
actually have how our food Baker food
guidelines were built because we were

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320
guidelines were built because we were
 

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.800
guidelines were built because we were
able to see any in each region what were

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:48.810
able to see any in each region what were
 

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.020
able to see any in each region what were
healthy foods people were eating so it's

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.030
healthy foods people were eating so it's
 

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.900
healthy foods people were eating so it's
very feasible right so we're talking to

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:53.910
very feasible right so we're talking to
 

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.160
very feasible right so we're talking to
Elizabeth hear about the link between

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:55.170
Elizabeth hear about the link between
 

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.550
Elizabeth hear about the link between
food and health so you are concerned now

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:58.560
food and health so you are concerned now
 

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.920
food and health so you are concerned now
in Brazil because as there's growing

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:00.930
in Brazil because as there's growing
 

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.250
in Brazil because as there's growing
affluence amongst some communities in

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260
affluence amongst some communities in
 

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.050
affluence amongst some communities in
the country they're shifting from those

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.060
the country they're shifting from those
 

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.600

traditional foods to more of a Western
diet and that's really increasing the

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:11.730
diet and that's really increasing the
 

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.020
diet and that's really increasing the
level of communicable diseases diabetes

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.030
level of communicable diseases diabetes
 

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.790

obesity I think you said it's tripled in

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:16.800
obesity I think you said it's tripled in
 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.950
obesity I think you said it's tripled in
the last 20 years imagine tripled in the

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960
the last 20 years imagine tripled in the
 

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.380
the last 20 years imagine tripled in the
last 20 years in Brazil because of this

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:21.390
last 20 years in Brazil because of this
 

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.050
last 20 years in Brazil because of this
shift in diets so I wonder if you could

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:24.060
shift in diets so I wonder if you could
 

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.090
shift in diets so I wonder if you could
just tell us a bit more about that yeah

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100
just tell us a bit more about that yeah
 

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.500
just tell us a bit more about that yeah
it's something that we should just be

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:27.510
it's something that we should just be
 

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.360
it's something that we should just be
actually because the rice and beans

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.370
actually because the rice and beans
 

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.250
actually because the rice and beans

easily wouldn't matter why do you treat

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320
easily wouldn't matter why do you treat
 

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.620
easily wouldn't matter why do you treat
bad thing but I think that the the bad

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:18.630
bad thing but I think that the the bad
 

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:22.010
bad thing but I think that the the bad
things there are nowadays we decide that

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020
things there are nowadays we decide that
 

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.990
things there are nowadays we decide that
but some things are bad and we can

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000
but some things are bad and we can
 

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.510
but some things are bad and we can
probably identify them but the truth is

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520
probably identify them but the truth is
 

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.580
probably identify them but the truth is
that our life expectancy has increased

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:28.590
that our life expectancy has increased
 

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.400
that our life expectancy has increased
for instance in Western Europe and but

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:31.410
for instance in Western Europe and but
 

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.730
for instance in Western Europe and but
something like 20 years since 1936 so if

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740
something like 20 years since 1936 so if
 

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.880
something like 20 years since 1936 so if
it was that bad you know I heard last

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:37.890
it was that bad you know I heard last
 

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.980
it was that bad you know I heard last
year for the first time they said that

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:39.990
year for the first time they said that
 

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.140
year for the first time they said that
the life expectancy in France had been

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:42.150
the life expectancy in France had been
 

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.270
the life expectancy in France had been
decreasing so I looked up the data and I

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280
decreasing so I looked up the data and I
 

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.580
decreasing so I looked up the data and I
have a former student who's into these

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:46.590
have a former student who's into these
 

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.770
have a former student who's into these
things and it turns out that it's about

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780
things and it turns out that it's about
 

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.710
things and it turns out that it's about
people over 65 because they weren't

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720
people over 65 because they weren't
 

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.310

doing their their flu shots ah i see

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320
doing their their flu shots ah i see
 

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.839

nothing to do with it because that's the

00:35:56.839 --> 00:35:56.849
nothing to do with it because that's the
 

00:35:56.849 --> 00:35:58.640
nothing to do with it because that's the
anti-vaccine movement or that sort of

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:58.650
anti-vaccine movement or that sort of
 

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.190

they get very stressed out and then you

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:32.310
they get very stressed out and then you
 

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.880
they get very stressed out and then you
give them equal access to either really

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:34.890
give them equal access to either really

and they don't need that many more

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:49.890
and they don't need that many more
 

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.740

into our physiology and then it starts

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040
into our physiology and then it starts
 

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.589
into our physiology and then it starts
setting up reward centers in the brain

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599
setting up reward centers in the brain
 

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.839

to these high sugar things too so

00:37:05.839 --> 00:37:05.849
to these high sugar things too so
 

00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.400
to these high sugar things too so
there's physiology there and if we

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:07.410
there's physiology there and if we
 

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.589
there's physiology there and if we
understand it we get away from the blame

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599
understand it we get away from the blame
 

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.690
understand it we get away from the blame

relatives yeah i mean the the reason

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:26.840
relatives yeah i mean the the reason
 

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.540
relatives yeah i mean the the reason
that that we like all these bad things

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:28.550
that that we like all these bad things
 

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.610
that that we like all these bad things
is we haven't had the opportunity to

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:30.620
is we haven't had the opportunity to
 

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.040
is we haven't had the opportunity to
have them in the past but but all

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:33.050
have them in the past but but all
 

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:36.400
have them in the past but but all
primates absolutely adore sugar and many

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:36.410
primates absolutely adore sugar and many
 

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.580
primates absolutely adore sugar and many
of them really like fat so the reason

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:39.590
of them really like fat so the reason
 

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.470
of them really like fat so the reason
that we like them so much of course is

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480
that we like them so much of course is
 

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.330
that we like them so much of course is
that there were never enough of them in

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:43.340
that there were never enough of them in
 

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.210
that there were never enough of them in
the in the past all wild animals in my

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:46.220
the in the past all wild animals in my
 

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.420
the in the past all wild animals in my
experience are hungry all the time

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.430

being able to satisfy the their food
desires on a regular basis so the

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:57.460
desires on a regular basis so the
 

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.920
desires on a regular basis so the
solution of course is not to make these

00:37:59.920 --> 00:37:59.930
solution of course is not to make these
 

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.900
solution of course is not to make these
things so available whether or not

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:01.910
things so available whether or not
 

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.000

that's a politically acceptable solution

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.010
that's a politically acceptable solution
 

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.550
that's a politically acceptable solution
