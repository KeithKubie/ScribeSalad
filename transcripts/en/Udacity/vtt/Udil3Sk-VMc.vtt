For this problem, let's imagine Justin here is mowing the lawn.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
His lawnmower has a mass of 7 kg, and when he mows,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
he pushes down with a force of 20 N and angle here of 60Â°.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If Justin has to push the lawnmower a total distance of 150 m to completely mow this lawn,
