00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Hello, and welcome back to the lab where we take your questions and turn them into experiments.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.160
My name is Mitch - and I'm Greg, and a lot of you been asking us about the next big superfood

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.929
Which is kelp, and you know we're very skeptical superfood claims, but this one could be a miraculous

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.399
Solution for climate change, and it's super healthy. There's only one issue

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.980
- which is that -

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.570
It's really slimy and very gross and American markets are not interested in eating it, so we decided to team up with one of our -

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.000
favorite chefs, the lovely Hannah Hart, to see if we could make kelp taste good

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.410
Hello!

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.340
[Hannah] What is it? [Mitch] What is it, Greg?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.560
This is kelp. It's seaweed.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.820
It's grown in Maine.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.540
Alright, so this is the dried kelp.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.420
Yeah, so this is before they put the water in -

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.340
- so it'll be salty, and it's actually the saltwater of the ocean.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.680
[?] on your carpet.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.580
Oh, no!

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.040
[Greg] To making kelp taste good. [Hannah] To some good old fashion [?]

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.740
Agriculture accounts for one-third of greenhouse gas admissions

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.840
But kelp has a negative footprint as it absorbs dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon dioxide.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.830
We use 40% of Earth's land and three-fourths of the freshwater for land agriculture.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.360
But the production of seaweed doesn't require any land to grow on, any freshwater, or the use of fertilizers and pesticides. It's like the Tesla of food.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.880
Recipe number one is the KLT. It's supposed to be a BLT, but we're replacing bacon with this kelp.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.220
And then, lettuce, L; T, tomato... [Hannah] And D, delicious.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.920
Wait, so, there are different types of kelp? [Greg] Yeah, this is dulse.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.800
There's about thirty kinds of kelp that people are working with, but yeah, this one is particularly known for tasting like bacon.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.140
Try it now - it won't taste like bacon yet - I don't think.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600
It smells heavily of foot.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.920
So how do we turn kelp in the bacon? [Greg] We can just straight up fry this.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.620
Kelp contains iodine, magnesium -

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.020
selenium, fiber, and it's rich in protein, Vitamin B12 and even omega-3 fatty acids.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.320
There's a lot of good stuff in there. One study even found that the alginates in brown seaweed may inhibit the uptake of fat.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.480
[Hannah] That was so fast - I would say two minutes? [Greg] Yeah, that was very easy. [Mitch] Quick, easy. Let's give it a try.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440
I'm in! Sold! Yeah!

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.780
[All] Mmmm!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.960
Not gonna lie. I'm convinced - this is totally a substitute for bacon. If you stop eating bacon and start eating kelp -

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.540
You may also lose weight. [Mitch] True! [Hannah] Just in general.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.020
[Hannah] Just in general. [Mitch] Double whammy!

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.000
You're probably already consuming kelp without realizing it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.020
This is because seaweed actually has much less rigid cell walls than land plants -

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.260
and they're rich in sugars that help them to bend and sway during the swells of the ocean. These sugars are known as -

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.540
Alginates, carrageenans, and agars, and they are used to help bind and thicken things like toothpaste, shampoo, skin cream...

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.300
They're also used in industrial foods like ice cream, and also can make the head of your beer even better.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.880
Number two is our kelp and beans, which is a play on for pork and beans.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.840
So we have our kelp that's been soaking to make it a bit easier to work with

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.280
and we are just going to chop it up into lots of tiny pieces, so -

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.900
Do we have a knife?

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.420
[All] Oooh, wow.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.280
This is good. [All, harmonizing]

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.640
That doesn't look like dog food at all!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.080
[Hannah] There we go!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.380
You know what? This looks delicious.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.680
[Hannah] Here's your kelp and beans.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.320
[Greg] You can taste, like, the fishy flavor. [Mitch] The more like [?]

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.840
Nothing says a natural combination like sweet salty beans -

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.560
[Hannah and Mitch] And fish.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.480
I would say that, like, the taste is much better than the smell.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.100
[Mitch] Yeah. [Greg] It's not bad, though.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.920
What if we put a little bit of the crunchy stuff on top? I just can't kelp myself.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.160
Well, it's more kelp-y.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.360
Yeah, it just tastes like more kelp.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.080
I had a moment where I was like, "Am I going to gag?"

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.980
[Hannah] I don't think it's good. [Greg] We've gone too far.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.180
I'm gonna go ahead and say a hard no to kelp and beans. [Greg and Mitch] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.620
Near many major cities, there's a big issue because there's too many nutrients in the water and actually negatively affect the ecosystem.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.920
But kelp needs these nutrients to grow so they actually grew kelp near the Bronx in New York City, where there's obviously like -

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.540
Probably not, like, the safest, cleanest water, and it didn't take in any heavy metals or toxins or PCBs.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.630
It was able to grow and flourish there - actually grow faster because there was more nutrients.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.760
So, you could grow this kelp down the street in New York City

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.200
And then you could just eat it and it'd be great for the environment.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.160
Recipe number three is candied kelp - now that's a catchy little phrase.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.660
So, all you'd really do is - you take your kelp

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.800
You have to soak this one, too, so we're gonna soak it in here -

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.260
Oh, how long do you soak it for?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.360
Uh, it says it can be anywhere from an hour to twelve hours - so, it's up to you.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.840
You just take it, cut it up, and then you mix it in with half a cup of water, half a cup of honey -

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.580
For about an hour. Then you have to bake it for 30 minutes at 390 degrees.  So, it takes a little bit of a process.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.560
That's... un-bear-liable.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.980
Okay, so we have our final product - which is the candied kelp for us to try.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.440
You know what?

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.360
[Greg] It's not that sweet. [Hannah] I think this is the best one so far.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.740
[Mitch] Really? [Hannah] This is my favorite.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.420
And I feel like it would - not fill you up, but you don't need a lot of it. My sweet tooth is being, like - [Mitch] - satisfied.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.060
[Hannah] I'm satisfied. I'm done.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.850
I'm happy we were able to at least make some kelp yummy foods that we did like. It's awesome to know that it has like -

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.220
A good environmental effects as well.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.820
Kelp, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. Let's do it, guys, let's open a food truck.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.660
Thank you guys so much for watching. We want to make sure that you know we made another video on Hannah's channel.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.460
It was about the science of love. [Greg] Yeah. [Mitch] Science of love.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.740
Make sure to check our her channel. We'll leave a link for her video.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.780
Otherwise, thank you so much for watching. We hope you try out these recipes. [Greg and Hannah] Thank you!

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.720
Yeah, I'm really happy. I'm very, very full of kelp.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.660
We'll see you soon.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.720
[Greg and Mitch] Peace.
