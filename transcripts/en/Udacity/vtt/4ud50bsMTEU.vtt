00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.800
Another way to look at the size of human genome instead of just counting

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.278
the number of letters it has, is to think about it in physical size.

00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:10.720
Remember that's three billion base pairs that

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.520
takes up space, but how much space?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.090
Well, let's imagine that a base pair is about the size of a light bulb.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.440
&gt;&gt; A light bulb is about 13 cm from tip to tip. And let's imagine that

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.262
like our base pairs we could stack our

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:25.660
light bulbs end to end, thirteen centimeters long each.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.970
If we had three billion, we could get past the moon over 390,000 kilometers.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt; That's a lot but, let's get serious, Matt. This is a lot

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.060
bigger than a base pair. Isn't a base pair only about. 34 nanometers?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.830
&gt;&gt; This is true. . 34 nanometers is actually very small, much smaller than a

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.071
lightbulb. But at three billion base pairs, three billion times 0.34 nanometers

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:55.048
is a billion nanometers and a billion nanometers

00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:58.180
is exactly one meter long. Look at that.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.100
&gt;&gt; Well, that's really long in the actual length. That's more than half of me.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.790
&gt;&gt; I know, and actual length this is what actually what has

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.150
to fit inside your cell, but not just this. You have one copy

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.700
from Mom and you have another copy from Dad. You have two

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.330
copies of the human genome in every cell in your body. This together

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.360
is over two meters of DNA. That's taller than I am.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.630
&gt;&gt; Wow.
