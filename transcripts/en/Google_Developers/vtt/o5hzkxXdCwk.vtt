Compressor Head - The Trailer, Season 2

00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.950
COLT MCANLIS: "Compressor
Head" is a movement.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.040
BRIAN GRADY: It's a
show about the movement.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.800
COLT MCANLIS: Well, no, it's
a data compression revolution.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.383
BRIAN GRADY: The
magic of compression.

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:12.710
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.480
COLT MCANLIS: Ow!

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.064
[BLEEP], dude.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:15.480
You know, people
are writing apps.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.430
Everyone's so busy to
write the next big thing

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.020
that they forget about this
very simple concept of data

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.540
compression.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.510
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, man!

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.480
Let's do it!

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.450
COLT MCANLIS: Go!

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.470
And how important
it is to get data

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.029
to people as fast as possible.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.695
SPEAKER 1: Yeah!

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.712
Finish strong, finish strong.

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.170
COLT MCANLIS: It's
something that I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.870
wanted to rekindle-- a love
for this sort of lost computer

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.520
science art.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.080
SPEAKER 2: There's a
funny story about that.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.106
SPEAKER 3: You
need to tell them.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:38.482
Tell them.

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:38.860
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.280
BRIAN GRADY: Next 5
billion users in the world

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.907
are going to have
limited bandwidth.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.740
COLT MCANLIS: People
need to be aware of how

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.600
they're using their data.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.230
BRIAN GRADY: You can't get
this information anywhere else.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.313
COLT MCANLIS: We try to
make it super fun to learn

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:50.380
something super boring.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.370
And we tackle some
pretty complex topics.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.429
Take entropy for example.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.512
And, you know what?
"Compressor Head" is just fun.

00:00:56.512 --> 00:00:57.780
[LAUGHING]

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.280
Every talk I give publicly,
every conference I

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.900
go to, I've had someone stop me.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.356
And they've said, thank you
for making "Compressor Head."

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.230
Something about the way
you described it-- it

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.390
just picked up with me.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.280
Thank you for "Compressor Head."

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.140
Like, that's humbling.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.880
I mean, it's just humbling.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.200
We just had to do it again.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.230
I mean, that's why
we do these things is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.330
for developers out there.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.830
You're looking at
the inner workings

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.670
of science here, folks.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.170
BRIAN GRADY: There's
other surprises

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.060
that we can't
necessarily go into here

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.557
because it's a family show.

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:27.140
COLT MCANLIS: My
name is Colt McAnlis,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.540
and this is "Compressor Head."

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:41.076
The End
