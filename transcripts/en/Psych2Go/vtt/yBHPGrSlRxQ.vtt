00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.149
Five signs an ambivert likes you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.010
With approximately two-thirds of the population being ambivert, chances are you've crossed path with your fair share throughout your life

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.559
maybe you even fit this category

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.250
an ambivert represents traits of both introversion and extraversion

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.049
meaning that while they enjoy social interactions and partying they also appreciate their time alone every once in a while

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.820
and Hey, maybe you don't fit this group, but you found yourself attracted to an ambivert and want to know if they return the feelings

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.759
Here are five signs an ambivert likes you

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.259
One, they single you out at large gatherings

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.069
Well ambiverts can find enjoyment from being around other people

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.349
They usually felt more at ease among smaller groups or having one-on-one conversations

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.379
If they've ever singled you out at a party

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.970
Chances are they are interested in interacting with you in a setting where they were most comfortable

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.009
Two

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.009
spontaneously asking you to hang out

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.209
Averts attitudes can change depending on whether they're on a work or school setting as opposed to a more social one

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.109
Because of this you might at first think them to be very introverted only to be surprised later when they ask you to come along

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.630
Maybe even with a few of your friends

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.529
This is because why ambiverts need their alone time

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.559
They might also find comfort in small groups in order to rest from their more solitary work environment

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.290
And because of the sudden bursts of extraversion. They might just work up the courage and ask you out

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.809
Three, they seem to be hesitating around you if an ambivert ever seems to be fluctuating in the attitude with which approach you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.849
This might be why think of the introverted and extroverted sides of ambivert arguing over what's best for their social life

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.739
While one side might shy away from the social interaction their extroverted side really wants to stay and talk to you

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.359
It's not at all that they've changed their minds about you all of a sudden in fact

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.229
It's such an important decision for them. They can't let themselves take it lightly

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.770
This translates into their online interactions as well

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.930
for

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.930
inconsistent interactions online

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.819
An ambivert might stay up to talk to you until 5:00 a.m.. One day and then proceed to completely disappear from social media the next

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.009
Remember an ambivert needs their alone time as much as their social time

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.939
This behavior doesn't mean they've lost interest all of a sudden

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.660
Simply that they must recharge on their own with some alone time

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.330
If you can wait this out, they'll appreciate your patience as well as continue interacting with you once they're fully ready to be social again

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.910
five, they show you your playful side and their serious side

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.910
As your relationship with an ambivert deepens you start to discover more and more layers to their personality

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.149
This means the letting you into their own little world

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.979
Which can be a side completely different from the one you saw when you first met them perhaps?

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.828
They weren't very talkative before but as you got to know them they began to shoulder playful side

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.670
Aside of them that in the end is all part of the same person in the letting you in on all of this

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.950
Because they're comfortable around you

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.059
These are some signs and ambivert might like you have you met someone who has shown one or more signs around you

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.729
Maybe this list has helped clear some things up
