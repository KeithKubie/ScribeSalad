[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:05.930
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi,
I'm Wayne Piekarkski

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.380
and I'm here today at
the assistant sandbox

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.545
area of Google I/O 2019.

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:11.920
And we're in the
smart home area.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.260
And I have Carl Vogel here
from the product team.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.177
And what we're going to
be talking about today

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.130
is smart home and
what it means and what

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.140
it means for developers.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.682
So Carl, what is
the developer story?

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:22.375
And what is smart
home all about?

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:24.820
CARL VOGEL: Smart home
is a way for users

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.250
to control all the connected
devices in their house.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.800
Everything from smart
lights and smart thermostats

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.970
to even smart plugs.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.390
And even vacuum cleaners now.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.473
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: OK, cool.

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:35.050
So what does it
mean for developers?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.180
Like, can anyone build
for this smart home?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.177
CARL VOGEL: Exactly, so we
have over a 3,500 brands that

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:42.010
go ahead and integrate
with Google Assistant

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.270
and are growing rapidly.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.550
Anyone can go into the
Actions on Google Console

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.520
and integrate their smart
devices into Google Assistant.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.030
Such that users can control
them with just the Assistant

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.710
and their voice.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.793
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: OK, cool.

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.738
So this year at
Google I/O 2019, I'm

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:56.780
understanding we've
announced the local home SDK.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.280
CARL VOGEL: Yeah.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.330
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So
what's that about?

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.873
And what's new for
developers and why

00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:01.040
are they interested in this?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.340
CARL VOGEL: It's great.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.239
So developers today integrate
with the Google Assistant

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.270
via the smart home API, which
is a cloud-to-cloud integration.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.220
And cloud-to-cloud
integrations naturally

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.660
have some amount of
latency and reliability.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.870
So we wanted to provide
a method for developers

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.810
to process those smart
home intents locally

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.120
on Google Home speakers and
Google [? NS ?] displays.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200
Such that we can turn on and
off the lights and other things

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.910
much faster and with
higher reliable.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.410
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: We do it
directly by skipping the cloud,

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.910
basically.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.020
CARL VOGEL: Yeah, we skip
that developers cloud

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.960
and they can replicate their
business logic there and run it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.620
on our devices.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.960
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: OK, well,
what excites me the most

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.940
is that here at I/O
we have this fantastic

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.020
demo that we've built.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.270
CARL VOGEL: It's a great demo.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.478
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So we have
this great train set here

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:44.230
that's designed to demonstrate
local versus cloud execution.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.790
So I guess there's
this button here

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.957
that I really want to press.

00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:48.970
CARL VOGEL: Give me one
second if I can, Wayne.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.365
So what we're looking at is
this is the local network.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:52.990
And this is the
internet once the query

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.370
leaves the user's home.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.990
We have the life
of a local query

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.670
and the life of a cloud query.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.660
So with that, go ahead
and push the button.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.610
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So we're
going to race some trains here

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.840
that are going to go around.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.810
And then these light
bulbs are going

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.018
to come on when they're done.

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:04.735
OK, here we go.

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.730
CARL VOGEL: Here we
have the user saying,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.640
turn on the lights.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.468
And we see these two queries
going to the Assistant server.

00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:12.760
And they're both going to be
processed in the same way.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.950
And being the smart home API,
they go ahead in [? event ?]

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.490
and we send that to the partner
cloud or the developer cloud

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.600
where they go ahead and
process that intent,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.010
and ultimately then fulfill it.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.967
If we know the device
is locally controllable,

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:24.550
then we'll send that
command back down

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.810
to the Google Home device,
where we'll then pull up

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.427
the developers' JavaScript
to process that intent where

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:31.010
they can communicate
with their light.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.050
And look, turn it on.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.420
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
That one's done.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.960
This one's still
coming by the cloud.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.270
CARL VOGEL: Yeah,
it's still coming in,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.830
it's going to get there.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.950
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
And there we go.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.800
CARL VOGEL: Yeah.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.240
So what this does, again,
highlights the reduce latency

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.165
that we can get with the local
home SDK and local operations.

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:44.540
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
This is awesome.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.340
I really love this train set.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.132
I've always loved trains
since I was a kid.

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.383
So this is a really fun demo.

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:50.050
So where can developers
go to learn more

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.092
about the local home SDK?

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:54.430
CARL VOGEL: Yeah,
g.co/localhomeSDK is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.300
our landing page.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.310
We also are giving
a talk Wednesday

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.820
at 5:30 PM called Local
Technologies for the Smart

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.320
Home.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.380
So if you're interested,
check it out and learn more.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.520
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: And it's
also on YouTube as well.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.570
So people can check
that out, too, later on.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.480
CARL VOGEL: Exactly,
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.742
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Awesome.

00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:06.850
Well, thanks for
your time, Carl.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.330
CARL VOGEL: Yeah, thanks, Wayne.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.810
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: And thanks
for watching the video.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.670
This was the Assistant
sandbox area.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.250
So we'll see you next time.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.000
