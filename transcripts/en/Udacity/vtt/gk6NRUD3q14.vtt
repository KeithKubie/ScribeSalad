[Narrator] Now that you survived the bunny uprising,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we're ready to get to the main goal of this class as far as building the search engine.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Our goal is to improve the results by finding the best webpage,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
instead of just returning a list of all the webpages that match a query.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
As the web has grown, it's become more and more important for search engines to do this ranking well,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that what really distinguished Google from previous search engines

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was they had a much smarter way of ranking pages that produced more useful results

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where the first 1 or 2 results in response to a search query were often the very thing that the user was searching for.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now we're ready to start thinking about the problem of how to rank webpages.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's start by recapping how our search engine works.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We started by building a crawler, and what the crawler did,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and this was what we did in units 1, 2, and 3;

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
what the crawler did was follow all the links in the webpages,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
following those links, building up an index, and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the end result of the crawler, after units 4 and 5, was we had an index.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
By the end of unit 5, it was a hash table where we could look up a key word,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we would find entry where that key word might appear,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and we would follow that, and we could look through each of those entries

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to find the one that matched and that would match the key word we were looking for,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and as its value it would have a list of all the URLs where that key word appears,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the order of those URLs in that list was determined just by how we added to them to the crawl.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Every time we encountered a new page,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we indexed that page and we added a URL for that key word.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The one that's first in this list is just the one that we happen to find first.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Say it's the C page, the one that's second would be the one that we find next,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and it's this page.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This doesn't tell us anything about which page is best.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The order of the URLs in the list and what we were getting as your output

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just depends on the order that things happen to go in the crawl.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
When the web was really small, which was quite awhile ago now,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
this was sort of okay that there were only a few pages that might match a given key word,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and you could look through them all and decide what one you wanted.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
With the web today, this doesn't work at all.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There are thousands of pages that match any interesting key word, maybe millions,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
certainly many more than you want to look through by hand.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The most important thing that a good search engine does is figure out how to rank these pages,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
so the one that the user gets is to figure out how to rank these pages

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
so the one that's at the front of the list is the one the user wants.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
That's our goal for the rest of this unit to figure out how to rank pages.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Before we do this for web pages, we're going to do something very similar but perhaps easier to relate to.

00:02:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're going to talk about how we decide whose popular.
