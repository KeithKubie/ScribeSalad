00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:02.877
- [Instructor] You might already
have some type of a notion

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.400
of a what a cell is.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.691
You might already realize
that it is most basic unit

00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:10.096
of life.

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:12.204
Some would argue that maybe viruses

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:14.275
are even a more basic unit of life,

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:17.360
but the organisms that we
consider living, like ourselves,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.209
are made up of cells
and all living organisms

00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:22.838
that we for sure consider
living are made up of at least

00:00:22.838 --> 00:00:26.255
one cell, so the most basic unit of life.

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.279
For example, me, this thing
that's making a video right now,

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.025
I'm made up of tens of
trillions of these cells.

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.971
Now a common misconception is

00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:38.993
well these things must be small

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:41.798
and they indeed are
very, very, very small.

00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:45.965
Some cells are on the order
of one micrometer long

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.744
and a micrometer is
one-millionth of a meter,

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.627
or you could just say
one-thousandth of a millimeter,

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:54.637
and so when you think
of something that small,

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:58.225
sometimes there's an assumption
that it must be simple,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.108
but you could not be
more wrong if you assume

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:02.941
that a cell is simple.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:07.791
This right over here is a
picture of a budding yeast cell.

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.187
You can see that it's
budding off right over here,

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:13.744
but this just begins to show
you some of the complexity

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:16.943
of the cell itself or of any cell,

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.137
and whereas in other videos,
we're gonna talk about

00:01:19.137 --> 00:01:21.431
different types of cells,
different types of structures

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:23.499
you'll see in some cells versus others,

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:25.693
this right here is eukaryotic cell

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:28.073
which we will talk more
about in other videos.

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:31.793
Now all cells have a
membrane that separate it

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:33.303
from the outside world.

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:34.753
You see the membrane right over here.

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:35.976
This is just a cross section.

00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:38.138
You could imagine a
three-dimensional version of this.

00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:41.055
So this is the cell, cell membrane.

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:46.176
It kind of defines the cell in some way,

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:49.480
and in general, the things
inside the cell membrane

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.730
is considered the cytoplasm, cytoplasm.

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.201
Sometimes you'll hear the term cytosol.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.757
The cytoplasm includes not just the fluid

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:03.192
but also all of the stuff in the fluid

00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:07.829
while the cytosol is
referring to the fluid alone

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.634
and then depending on
the complexity of a cell,

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:12.181
so this is right here,
this is a yeast cell,

00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.847
this is a eukaryotic cell
which we cover in more depth

00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:18.065
in other videos but one of the
features of a eukaryotic cell

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:21.115
is that you'll have a
membrane-bound nucleus.

00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:23.145
Now you see it in this
diagram right over here.

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:25.850
This is not a common feature to all cells

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.115
but the only reason why I'm
mentioning it in this video is

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:32.708
officially, the cytoplasm does
not include the stuff inside

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.294
the nucleus.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:37.086
In a eukaryotic cell, that
is called the nucleoplasm

00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:39.566
but we'll talk more about
that in other videos.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.532
Now another feature that
is common to all cells

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:44.865
is the notion of a ribosome,

00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:49.892
and this picture is full of ribosomes.

00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:52.171
All of these little dots right
here, these little red dots,

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.713
let me change my pen color,

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.889
all of these little red dots
here, these are ribosomes,

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.547
and you might assume,
"Wow. These are so small

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:02.851
"compared to this already
small thing, this cell.

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:04.374
"Surely they are simple,"

00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:07.659
but they're actually fairly complex RNA

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.171
and protein structures, that
are, their main function is

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:15.254
producing protein, producing protein.

00:03:16.552 --> 00:03:18.784
You can view these as
almost the protein factories

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:19.841
of living organisms.

00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:23.133
They can take genetic
information in the form of RNA

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:26.117
and produce proteins out
of them, and you can see

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:28.712
this cell is full of ribosomes
and we're going to talk about

00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:32.352
the different types of
ribosomes in a future video.

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:35.208
Now another thing that
is typical in most cells

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:38.128
is genetic information, and typically,

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:41.628
that genetic information is stored as DNA.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.193
Now I say in most cells
because it turns out

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:48.722
that even in our bodies,
mature red blood cells

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:51.323
don't have any DNA anymore
and there's other cells

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:53.468
that do the same thing, but in general,

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:56.117
in order for a cell to
function and replicate,

00:03:56.117 --> 00:03:59.432
it needs some genetic information
and that is stored in DNA,

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.514
and that's true in both prokaryotic cells

00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:02.788
and eukaryotic cells.

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:06.017
Prokaryotes are ones that don't
have a well-defined nucleus

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:09.002
and membrane-bound what
we call organelles,

00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:10.733
which are these substructures in cells

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.992
which we will talk more
about in other videos.

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:15.761
In a prokaryotic cell, the
DNA is just floating around

00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.961
in the cytoplasm, while in
a eukaryotic cell, the DNA,

00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.601
for the most part, is
inside of your nucleus

00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.653
and it is part of the nucleoplasm.

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:27.744
So I'll leave you there for now.

00:04:27.744 --> 00:04:30.694
The last thing I want you to
appreciate is just the scale.

00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:32.955
As I mentioned, cells are small.

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:34.604
This picture of a yeast
cell right over here,

00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:39.030
this is a micrometer, on this
scale, it would be about,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.367
it would be about that.

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:44.585
That would be one micrometer,
and to put that in context,

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.146
the width of a human hair,

00:04:46.146 --> 00:04:49.186
and it actually depends on
your hair, whether it's soft

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:51.619
or it's more like my hair
and it kind of sticks up

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:53.176
and it's, you have thicker hair,

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:55.441
but if this is a human
hair right over here,

00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:58.693
this is the width of a
human hair, this thing,

00:04:58.693 --> 00:05:02.776
its width is anywhere from
20 to 180 micrometers.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:09.100
My thick hair is probably
closer to 180 micrometers.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.478
So one way to think about
it, you could probably take

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:14.811
20 or so of these yeast cells end to end

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.849
and these yeast cells, these
aren't even the smallest cells

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.886
by any stretch of the imagination,
and put them end to end,

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:23.835
20 or 30 of these across one human hair

00:05:23.835 --> 00:05:26.350
and that's what's mind-blowing
because even at that scale,

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.361
you have this complexity,

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.943
and even this picture
doesn't do proper justice

00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:32.015
to the complexity.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.209
There's all sorts of
structures inside of this

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.742
that you can't even see
that help transport things

00:05:36.742 --> 00:05:40.661
and move things around and
give the structure of the cell.

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:42.106
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:44.199
In future videos, we'll
dig a little bit more into

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.375
what eukaryotic cells are,
what prokaryotic cells are.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.146
How do cells move around?

00:05:49.146 --> 00:05:51.244
How do they work together?
