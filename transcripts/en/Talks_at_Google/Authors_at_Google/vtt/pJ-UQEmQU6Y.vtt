YASMIN GREEN: Hello,
welcome today.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.230
My name is Yasmin Green.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.690
I am the Head of
Research and Development

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.100
for Jigsaw, which is
Alphabet's think tank

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.020
and incubator looking at
global security challenges.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.650
I am very excited to introduce
as our guest speaker today

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.220
a longtime friend of Jigsaw,
formerly Google Ideas.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.260
I wanted to actually
share a personal tidbit.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.310
The day before yesterday I
was talking to my husband

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.870
about our shared beliefs.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.530
You know, other people describe
their religion as Christianity,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.260
or Judaism, or Hinduism,
or Scientology, or Orthodox

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.390
Freudian, or whatever.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.220
And I was like, how would I
describe what our shared belief

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.400
system is, what kind of shapes
our behaviors and our values?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.295
And we decided that
we're going to write out

00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.750
kind of our version of
the Ten Commandments, so

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.850
the imperatives that
govern us, not just

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.020
spiritually and morally but
also political, societal,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.980
technological.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.190
And I realized that there
was so much there that

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.300
is broader than what we
necessarily think or, you know,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.520
what we conventionally think
of as to do with religion.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.030
I think that's a good segue to
introduce Parag Khanna today

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.020
because he is bringing
together those factors,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.440
these multi-dimensional factors
and reimagining things that,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.870
really around our world order
and our governance system.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.150
And he's kind of
reimagining our future

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.550
with a much more nuanced
and complex framing

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.750
than we're used to.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.020
So I will introduce him.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.900
I'll give you a little
bit about his bio.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.070
Parag is a international
relations expert, intellectual,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.070
bestselling author.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.110
He has just written a book
called "Connectography--

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.310
Mapping the Future of
Global Civilizations,"

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.720
and we are very
fortunate to have

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.820
some copies here at the
back so go and collect yours

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.460
on your way out.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.220
Parag is CNN's Global
Contributor, a Senior Research

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.390
Fellow at the Center on Asian
Globalization at the Lee Kuan

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.320
Yew School of Public
Policy at the National

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.230
University of Singapore,
co-founder and CEO

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.470
of Hybrid Reality, which
is an advisory firm looking

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.960
at the policy
implications of the policy

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.780
and economic consequences
of emerging technology

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.470
and the co-founder and CEO of
Factotum, a boutique content

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.060
strategy agency.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.410
Many of you may have
seen a Ted talk by Parag

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.730
or read one of his numerous
op-eds in "The New York Times."

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.120
You are unlikely to have read
his book already because it

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.930
just came out this morning.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.410
So I thought we'd
structure today

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.720
with Parag giving us a
short presentation on some

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.910
of the key themes of
his book and then we

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.590
will sit down and
have a conversation

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.750
and have some Q&amp;A. So
without further ado, Parag.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.160
PARAG KHANNA: Thank you.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.920
All right, good afternoon,
everyone here in New York

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.820
and at the Googleplex out there.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.237
I'm told I should look at the
camera a little bit as well.

00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:19.944
Thanks to all the
friends for being here.

00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:21.830
Thank you, Yasmin-- a
dear old friend indeed.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.700
And it's nice to see just
how enormously, exponentially

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.040
this office has grown and
congratulations, of course,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.040
on becoming Jigsaw and all the
great things that you're doing.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.140
So we were having
little conversation

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.960
earlier about how
to structure this

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.880
because even if you
haven't read the book yet,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.338
you've probably
seen it over there.

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:45.120
And you see that it's
about 500 pages long.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.540
So I have a presentation
lined up here,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.520
which is so heavy in
megabytes, it almost

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.870
toppled the computer over.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.720
So you get to vote.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.070
Do you want lots of
text and notes and data

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.830
or do you want lots
of pretty pictures?

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.460
AUDIENCE: Pictures.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.680
PARAG KHANNA: Pretty
pictures, right?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.600
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.350
OK, pretty pictures.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.766
I think that'll be good for
the audience on the West Coast

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:07.390
as well.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.820
So I'm going to speed through
the thesis of the book

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.960
and just give you a flavor of
things by way of talking you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.360
through some of the maps
because the maps are really

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.230
the crown jewels of this book.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.660
What you'll find is that
we have two map inserts

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.080
in the book, and
almost as much effort

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.240
went into producing those
as into the 120 something

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.730
thousand words of
the book itself.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.290
Perhaps it was so
long because it's

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.272
the completion of a trilogy.

00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:35.730
The first couple
books, actually, I

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.277
presented at the other
of Google office--

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:40.360
at the Googleplex-- doing
Authors at Google there.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.740
So here I am fittingly
on the East Coast

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.540
to launch the completion
of the trilogy.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.450
So we had to pack a lot
into this final book

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.330
because there won't
be anymore after this.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.870
So get this one now.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.100
I'm done.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.890
I've got nothing left to say.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.240
But there are lots and lots
of maps that really help

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.450
you explain the 21st century.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.867
And I want to just emphasize
that all the maps in the book

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.366
and that I'm going
to show you today

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:07.940
are completely
bespoke and unique.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.550
You've never seen
them anywhere else,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.030
and they are from an
objective standpoint--

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.390
because I didn't make them.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.750
I helped to design
and strategize them.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.640
But they are,
objectively speaking,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.350
having now looked at the whole
survey of global cartography,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.830
they're the best
maps you will ever

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.720
see ever about the geographic
and infrastructural world.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.449
So I consider them, as I
said, the crown jewels.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.240
I'm going to talk you
through some of them.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.364
So the first is this.

00:05:36.364 --> 00:05:37.780
This actually isn't
from the book.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.360
This is a screen shot from my
TED talk from a few weeks ago

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.000
in which I really talked
about the global connectivity

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.340
revolution, which is also
the thesis of the book.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.490
It's effectively saying
that all of the maps that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.100
hang on your walls
and our walls,

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.030
I accuse them all
of being completely

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.070
wrong and biased and
misleading because they always

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.430
show us the political
boundaries as the primary lines.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.370
They tend to ignore completely
infrastructural lines.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.860
And yet, the irony
being that we have

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.840
150 times more mileage
of infrastructure than we

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.950
have mileage of borders.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.070
We have less than
500,000 kilometers

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.210
of borders between
countries, and we

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.880
have something on the order
of 75 million kilometers

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.850
worth of what you
see here, which

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.300
is highways and railways-- so
transportation-- oil and gas

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.240
pipelines and
electricity grids-- which

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.140
is energy-- and of
course, internet cables--

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.950
communications.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.350
And that's just the beginning.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.290
This revolution that I'm
talking about already

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.901
utterly overwhelms in terms
of how it unfolds itself

00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:45.900
on the map of the world.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.240
It actually totally overwhelms
our political divisions.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.250
And yet, we're just
in the early phases

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.900
of building out the planet
through these transportation,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.650
energy, and communications
infrastructure.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.110
So I like to cite Autodesk-- the
design engineering firm-- that

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.100
says that we'll build more
infrastructure in the next 40

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.260
years than we have in
the last 4,000 years.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.130
So this revolution
is just underway.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.150
The spending that we're
going to put into this

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.290
amounts already to $4 or
$5 trillion dollars a year,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.040
which is double what we spend
on all the military and defense

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.540
establishments in the world.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.600
So I think that this
is the beginning

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.370
of a great shift in the world.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.370
And I want to set out to map it.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.050
And I believe that it
requires, if you really

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.220
take this infrastructural
development

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.960
to its logical
conclusion, you literally

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.610
have to re-imagine how life is
organized on the planet Earth.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.880
We always think of ourselves--
we're raised and trained--

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.149
in this epoc since
the 17th century,

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:48.690
basically, to think of ourselves
as being organized according

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.590
to countries.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.910
Who you are is where you are and
where you are is in a country.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.480
And your identity, therefore,
is that national identity.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.880
And I really want to push
the envelope here and say

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.730
that, in fact, we are
organized much more according

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.780
to our infrastructure and our
supply chains and our cities.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.100
So instead of
nations and borders,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.450
we live in a world of
infrastructures, cities,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.320
and supply chains.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.470
And those matter and
shape who you are,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.920
what you are, what you do,
and your potential outcomes

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.580
in life way more than just
what your national identity is.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.040
And that contradicts
the oldest adage

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.090
that we know that all children
learn in school, which

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.340
is that geography is destiny.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.830
And I'm arguing that's not true.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.570
I'm arguing that connectivity
has now become destiny.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.400
Connectivity is a lifeline.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.780
It's an opportunity.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.210
And it also creates multiple
sources and possibilities

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.220
for your identity in
ways that we're just

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.214
starting to appreciate today.

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:45.630
And this infrastructure,
what's so

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.110
fascinating from an
engineering standpoint,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.420
there's a term that's
little used that I think

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.500
is going to become more
prominent these days,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.320
and its topographical
engineering.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.334
And so I actually open the book
with a travel around the world.

00:08:57.334 --> 00:08:59.500
Imagine that you could
travel around the whole world

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.000
without leaving the ground.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.640
You can do so through all
of the new railways and very

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.440
large floating
structures-- there's

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.580
an acronym, VLFS, in the field
of oil and gas engineering.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.030
We're building
these floating oil

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.590
rigs that are larger than
the Sydney Opera House.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.150
Even cruise ships
that size, we're

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.390
infrastructure able
to modify the earth.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.810
So you're familiar with
this term anthropocene--

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.070
this age in which mankind's
impact on the ecology

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.980
on the planet become
so systemic that it

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.387
changes the nature of
the global environment.

00:09:32.387 --> 00:09:33.470
And how have we done that?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.640
We've done it through
this incredible revolution

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.860
in our durable
engineering capability.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.680
So we're physically
constructing and reconstructing

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.310
and modifying the earth through
all this infrastructure.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.180
And all of those infrastructures
are so much more durable

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.730
than our nations and
states and boundaries.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.017
As I point out
repeatedly, we've had

00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:57.600
cities-- cities are
the infrastructure

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.280
that you can see from space.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.510
You can't see countries
and borders from space.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.480
You can see cities.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.440
You can even see railways now.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.150
You can see tall buildings.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.460
You can see all sorts
of man-made things.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.330
You can't really see borders.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.386
They're actually
much more artificial

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:16.010
than the infrastructures
that we build.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.810
And cities outlast every
empire in every country that

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.400
nominally governs them, right?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.290
We have had cities
for 5,000 years.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.110
We've had Baghdad.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.740
We've had a Constantinople--
now Istanbul.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.450
And we've had Beirut and
Alexandria and so forth.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.110
The countries that
seem like they

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.650
are the bedrock of our
international system,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.150
legally, are actually fairly
insignificant in comparison

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.326
to the long histories
of our cities have.

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:42.200
And now the connectivity
between those cities

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.460
is becoming so robust
that we are becoming

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.140
what I call "a global network
civilization"-- not a world

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.530
in which states and the
relations among them

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.251
actually operate the system.

00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.750
It may seem like that if you
look at an organizational chart

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.344
of the UN.

00:10:56.344 --> 00:10:59.010
But because you're looking at an
organizational chart of the UN,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.801
you think that that is
how the world works.

00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:04.990
If you look at the world
itself, from the outside,

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.200
you would be seeing this.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.710
This is the real world.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.730
This is how the
world actually works,

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.440
not the way institutions
are structured.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.830
And this is truly global.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.410
We've never lived in a
world where world trade is

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.740
so all-encompassing and
where all the continents are

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.230
included in that system
on relatively equal terms.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.680
You could have, obviously--
in the colonial era,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.030
you had the dominance
over the developing

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.530
countries in the
southern hemisphere

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.756
by a few European empires.

00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:37.880
Today, you don't have that.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.200
Today, you have these growing,
dense continental economic

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.230
systems that are
increasingly tied

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.020
to each other by infrastructure
and by supply chains.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.200
The same thing is happening
in capital markets.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.640
So what it means is that this
world of nations and borders

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.487
is much more one that I
call a supply chain world.

00:11:56.487 --> 00:11:58.070
And it's a world
that some described--

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.780
the physicist, Michio Kaku,
calls it perfect capitalism.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.130
In a world where everything
is totally connected,

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.160
you unite all of these
historical forces

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.450
that economists and
sociologists have been talking

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.730
about for hundreds of years.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.800
You bring together Adam Smith's
free markets, David Ricardo's

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.090
comparative advantage, and
Emile Durkheim's division

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.060
of labor-- Durkheim
is my favorite.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.580
Ricardo Haussmann
from Harvard who

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.350
talks about a complexity
of production.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.610
And you can achieve what
economics is really all about,

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.306
which is the optimization
of land, labor, capital,

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:29.930
and production.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.630
And of course, you
do so in a way that

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.100
isn't organized according to
territorial political units,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.730
but anywhere where you
want to produce something,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.720
you can do so.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.174
So like I said, I want to get
more into some of the maps,

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:46.090
and I want to talk about
what the supply chain

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.862
world of total
connectivity looks like.

00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:49.320
Well, it's a world
in fact where we

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.990
have very substantial
mobility of people.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.040
Globalization-- and this is
a book about globalization--

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.640
is ultimately all about people.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.310
The history of
globalization begins

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.970
with mankind's wanderings out
of the African continent 60,000

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.540
some years ago, and it
hasn't stopped, obviously.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.030
It continues unabated.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.750
So today's headlines
are dominated

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.590
by Donald Trump
wanting to put up

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.800
a wall or European
populist politicians

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.020
talking about wanting
to close borders.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.870
But the fact is that
that is a reaction

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.080
to the enormous amounts of
migration that have taken place

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.350
and continue to take place.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.429
That is not the reality
of closing borders

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:30.470
or of pushing migrants
back because that actually

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.510
hasn't happened.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.370
Europe let in one million
migrants in the year 2015,

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.830
more than ever before.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.380
So that's talk.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.210
The reality is this enormous
expansion of migration,

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.610
such that there
are 230, 250, some

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.680
say 300 million people
today living outside

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.550
of their country of origin.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.290
They might be even
permanent expats.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.750
And little do many
people in America

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.200
realize that there are more
American expats than ever

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.000
before.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.360
Nine million Americans who
live outside the United States.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.100
That's more than double what
the normal, standard amount

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.960
has been over the
last 10, 15 years.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.870
So it's all shot up.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.770
So we've become a
world, if you will,

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.359
of global economic migrants.

00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:12.400
Everyone is wondering
either from the countryside

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.000
in the cities, across
borders, from one city

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.720
to another city in
search of a better life,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.300
in search of
economic opportunity.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.710
But it continues unabated.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.800
And I will put my money
on this continuing.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.400
Because in a supply and demand
world, rather than a nations

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.510
and borders world,
countries actually

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.860
wind up thinking
pragmatically about what

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.560
their needs are for
their economies-- what

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.830
their demographic needs are.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.069
And the same places that
are talking about putting up

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:40.610
walls and borders
are the places that

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.210
actually most need immigrants.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.980
Countries with aging populations
like in Europe and the United

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.860
States.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.720
So I think that we
need to differentiate

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.970
between the short term
populism of politicians

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.310
and the long term
realities of a world

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.850
in which connectivity
facilitates migration.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.780
More passports have visa
free access around the world.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.740
Again, there are going
to be more frictions.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.620
We can see that happening
right now with legislation

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.300
that Congress has passed.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.790
There are more frictions,
yes, for security reasons.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.290
Smart sensible frictions
are not a bad thing.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.060
They help to prevent everything
from pandemics to terrorists

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.350
from entering a country.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.770
But by and large,
those frictions

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.960
don't slow the overall
pattern of migration flows.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.760
So this is another way of
rendering it and showing

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.550
just how many people are
moving around the world

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.280
within and across and
amongst the continents.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.090
And it shows you not
only how important it is,

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.690
how systematic it
is demographically,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.000
but how important
it is economically

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.460
in terms of the values
of the remittance flows.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.970
And so there's an enormous
two-way benefit, of course,

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.350
to global migration.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.330
Some economists
argue that you could

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.040
double world GDP by listing
migration restrictions.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.786
I think that may
not be too far off.

00:15:56.786 --> 00:15:59.160
I'm going to jump ahead a
little bit because I don't want

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.535
to take too long, but I want
to show you some of the maps

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:05.580
that I think are more accurate
representations of how humanity

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.630
is organized.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.730
And this is one of them.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.920
What's captured on this
map and not captured

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.350
on any conventional map
that hangs on your walls

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.490
is quite a few things.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.280
First of all, you can
actually see people.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.290
You don't just see artificial
states and boundaries.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.590
What you see is every single
human being on the world

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.720
is on this map.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.800
And yellow being the
most dense geographies.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.960
Then, most importantly,
you see the dotted ovals,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.480
which show you the largest
or most economically

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.010
significant urban clusters.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.730
So you see Silicon Valley there.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.720
And of course this
northeastern megalopolis,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.410
where we're the
midway point here

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.070
in New York between
Boston and Washington.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.050
You can see clusters like
Sao Paulo or Johannesburg,

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.680
South Africa, Lagos,
Nigeria, and so on and so on.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.600
And you can also see just
how they are not only

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.840
the most important anchors
of their national economies,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.640
but even entire regional
economies depend

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.460
on just a couple of cities.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.280
So shown a different way,
this is the projection

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.660
until the year 2030.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.990
I looked at the data of
projections by the World Bank,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.619
by the United Nations-- all
sorts of organizations--

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:18.530
about what are the
main mega cities that

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.720
are emerging either today or
in the next 10 to 15 years?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.849
If you want to be
megacity in the year 2030,

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.160
you would actually already
have to be well on your way

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:26.819
today, right?

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.980
So we can say with
some certainty

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.230
that this is not only
the map of today,

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.030
this is also the map of 2030.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.590
I don't think in the
year 2030 I would

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.710
need a different
PowerPoint slide than this.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.660
Because this is
already the areas

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.069
with the most dense
concentrations of populations

00:17:46.069 --> 00:17:46.610
in the world.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.760
And these cities are
so significant, again,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.980
economically that
I think if you want

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.122
to understand the map of the
world in the 21st century,

00:17:55.122 --> 00:17:56.580
you're much better
off just looking

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.270
at these cities and the
connections between them

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.430
to understand how the
world really operates.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.860
So I coin this term
connectography.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.210
By the way, no one says this
with more beautiful accent

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.630
than you, Yasmin.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.730
But the other term
that I come up

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.820
with in this book
is diplomacity--

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.310
the diplomacy among
cities is ultimately

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.570
more revealing about
how the world operates.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.980
Think about mergers
between stock exchanges,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.790
think about nonstop
flights connecting

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.230
any two cities in the world.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.750
It seems like Emirates
Airlines wants

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.860
you to be able to fly
around the world nonstop.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.560
They're flying now
to Panama City,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.660
to Auckland, New Zealand,
pretty soon the Sydney.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.300
So this point-to-point travel.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.880
Obviously, the data networks and
internet cables linking cities

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.910
and so on and so on, you
find that the relationships

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.580
among cities tell you
almost most of what

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.450
you need to know, in a way,
about the day-to-day reality

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.960
certainly of the world
economy and world society.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.600
So how did places get there?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.540
We often think of economic
growth as just an accident

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.117
or a byproduct of demographic
expansion, but in fact,

00:19:06.117 --> 00:19:07.700
over the last 50
years, what countries

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.500
have started to do is to
strategically urbanize,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.380
not just accidentally urbanize.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.080
And they do so by creating
these special economic zones.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.580
So what I've been tracking
is how in the last 50 years

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.930
we've grown from a world
of the three or four

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.630
or five experimental special
economic zones like Mauritius

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.270
or the Dominican
Republic or factory

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.640
towns and industrial
parks and clusters

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.560
within them-- and of course
Shenzhen in southern China.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.030
Now you have 4,000 of them.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.290
So how did Vietnam
get to be Vietnam?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.950
How did Vietnam go from
being a country that

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:46.590
was so heavily bombarded and
fought against the United

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.230
States in the Vietnam War
to what it is today, which

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.770
is considered the next China
industrial powerhouse--

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.670
the Germany of East Asia?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.510
How did that happen?

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.860
Well, it happened because
they copied the China model.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.534
They designated
dozens or hundreds

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:02.700
of these industrial parks
in special economic zones.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.180
They started attracting
investment and supply chains

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.360
and technology.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.580
They started moving workers
there and training them

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.280
and ramping up their exports.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.870
That's how they
did it, and that's

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.100
what country after country is
doing around the world today.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.000
And I like I said,
there are 4,000

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.649
such special economic zones.

00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:21.940
So they're not on our maps,
which is another reason why

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.119
our maps suck.

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:24.577
So I have a line
in this book where

00:20:24.577 --> 00:20:27.180
I say I've spent the last five
years going to places that

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.910
apparently don't exist because
I don't know why they're not

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.800
on our maps, but the
locus of economic activity

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.020
in most of the world's
emerging economies

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.480
are these cities and special
economic zones that don't even

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.500
make it onto the maps.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.970
And yet, they really should.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.210
So what I've done
is to insert them

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.550
visually in a number
of maps in the book.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.320
Entire countries are
reorganizing themselves

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.730
around urban clusters, and even
the most ancient civilizations

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.220
in the world, such
as China, that

00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.140
have millennia of unique
cultural and provincial and

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.480
linguistic histories are
saying, wait a minute.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.070
In order to be viable and
competitive economically,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.480
we have to not
just have this kind

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.440
of historical,
cultural geography.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.340
But instead, we need to have
a strategic urban geography

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.540
of highly populous, dense,
economically-productive,

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.120
and connected urban zones.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.860
So in the New York
Times this weekend,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.350
there was a two page map
that I worked with them

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.770
to produce that talked about
how America should do this.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.200
The United States should
literally reorganize itself

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.310
around seven or eight
mega-regions that

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.450
have similar economic profiles
around the white zones, which

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.940
are the urban hubs
that either are

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.440
between or in the heart
of those regions that

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.080
are their financial
and demographic

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.940
and infrastructural centers.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.910
And then, the lighter lines are
the high-speed railway networks

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.990
that would connect
those cities together.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.790
So you would move from the
United States of America

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.650
towards the United
city-states of America.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.940
Now, let's bear in
mind that I actually

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.130
softened the argument for fear
of the backlash against it,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.750
but the feedback on this has
been so positive that I wish

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.170
I'd gone back and doubled down
on the argument in the op ed

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.630
and said, actually,
the 50 states

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.713
are literally pretty useless
other than for what's

00:22:21.713 --> 00:22:24.290
happening right now, which is
collecting electoral votes.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.730
But after that, after you've
won this primary or that primary

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.619
and made it into
the White House,

00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:31.410
what does that mean
for the competitiveness

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.040
of the entire country
that you have to govern?

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.080
And it turns out the 50 states
mean absolutely nothing.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.990
They certainly cause
a lot of friction.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.530
I've gotten so many emails from
people in the last 48 hours

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.470
saying damn right.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.370
I live in the tiny
state of Rhode Island,

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.470
where we have 30, 40
counties and we duplicate

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.630
our education and our
sanitation and all

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.180
these layers of bureaucracy.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.790
And all that does is waste
money on politics rather than

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.060
on productive,
commercial activity.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.860
So I feel even more
strongly about this

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.030
than I did four days ago
before this was published.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.210
There's a lot more to say
about this, not only here

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.510
but also in the book.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.270
So more of the re-mapping.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.420
I want to point out the entire
world is remapping itself.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.650
Region after region is building
infrastructure across borders

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.060
such that if you
were to map that, you

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.120
would get a totally different
appreciation for how

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.640
entire continents operate.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.850
This is my map of the
North American Union

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.050
in which you can see that the
United States gets electricity

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.710
from Canada.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.610
There's all of these railways
and energy and pipelines

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.580
and freight railways between
Canada and the United States.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.680
The US is investing heavily
in the Mexican energy system.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.330
It's doing joint production
of automobiles in Mexico.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.199
San Diego and Tijuana now
share an airport terminal.

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:50.740
All of these things--
and eventually,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.156
the United States
is going to need

00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:53.630
more and more Canadian water.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.790
The Canadians don't really
love this idea-- there's one.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.750
The token Canadian.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.982
Oh, two.

00:24:03.982 --> 00:24:05.690
I'd say, statistically,
it's about right.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.580
The point is that in
a world-- actually,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.060
let me fast toward a little
bit and get right to it.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.820
But some of these maps show you.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.070
So Southeast Asia
is graduating from

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.751
this post-colonial geography
of 10 different countries

00:24:24.751 --> 00:24:27.250
into one that, again, is densely
infrastructurally connected

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.230
the way that Europe is.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.110
Africa, in the pathway out
of that scarred colonial map

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.920
of Africa with borders
organized according to latitude

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.550
and longitude, is in fact
building more connectivity

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:43.490
so that African
countries can more

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.650
seamlessly export their
goods together and scale

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.970
their economies.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.880
That, I think, is a
very important pathway

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.450
out of thinking about the
future of the Middle East.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.770
You have the
spectacular collapse

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.410
of the modern Arab state.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.190
It didn't last very long.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.820
And the post-colonial
decay of countries

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.850
that were born out of the French
and British empire in the 1940s

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.320
has been an obsession
of mine for a long time.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.400
It traces its way
through all of my books.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.060
And this is finally a time where
I say, OK, so what comes next?

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.570
What do you do in
the post-Arab Spring?

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.746
You can't really pretend that
Iraq exist or will exist again.

00:25:18.746 --> 00:25:20.120
You can't really
pretend the same

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.820
for Syria or for any
number of other countries.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.540
But let's go back to
the fact that the cities

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.540
of the Mesopotamian
region in the Middle East

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.890
are the oldest cities
that we have in the world.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.720
And they're continuously
functioning,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.960
and they have that relative
degree of stability

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.280
that states don't have.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.050
So I see the Middle East is
capable of-- it certainly

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.410
has the money to do so--
capable of building itself

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:46.110
into an connected,
inter-urban sort of system.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.100
And I hope that that's where
the investment from the outside

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.190
and from within the
Arab world can go.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.780
So the geopolitics we can
talk about with Yasmin

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.424
because that's a
specialty of hers as well.

00:25:57.424 --> 00:25:58.590
This is one of my favorites.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.173
I'm going to show
you one or two more.

00:26:00.173 --> 00:26:05.210
This is five billion people or
so, give or take, on this map.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.630
Most of the world's
population is in Eurasia.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.270
Just India and
China alone, to say

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.730
nothing of Southeast
Asia and the Middle East

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.280
and so forth--
you've got literally

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.570
almost five billion people.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:21.130
So eastern Eurasia is
a world unto itself.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:25.480
And you certainly heard in 2015
about the Asia Infrastructure

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.800
and Investment Bank, which
is going to be putting up

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.000
$150 billion and more with
many countries participating

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.320
to build infrastructure
across Eurasia.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.570
And in fact, that process
already began 25 years ago.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.715
The Soviet Union collapsed
in the early 1990s,

00:26:42.715 --> 00:26:46.200
and ever since then, China has
begun this process of building

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.670
railways, highways,
pipelines, electricity

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.420
grids, water canals, and so
forth to link up Eurasia.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.970
Now, why is it doing that?

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.170
Well, China has more neighbors
than any country in the world.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.920
China has 14 neighbors.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.220
It doesn't want to fight
a war with any of them.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.110
In fact, every
neighbor of China is

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.970
suspicious of China
for good reason.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.920
So what China
does-- I like to use

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.650
this analogy from the
construction industry--

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.970
it's going to build, own,
and operate its neighbors.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.882
What do contractors do?

00:27:17.882 --> 00:27:19.340
They build, they
own, they operate.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.214
So China isn't going to
invade its neighbors,

00:27:21.214 --> 00:27:23.979
because that will obviously
heighten tensions even further.

00:27:23.979 --> 00:27:26.020
But it's just going to
build its way across them.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.200
And it's going to do so to
achieve the supply chain world.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.830
It's going to smooth the
inflow of commodities

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.580
and raw materials that
it needs, and it's

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.845
going to smooth the outflow--
the export-- of the electronics

00:27:36.845 --> 00:27:38.970
and other goods that
it manufactures.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.870
And to do so, its
infrastructurally

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.880
reorganizing all of Eurasia.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.830
So the lives of
five billion people

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.950
are being touched by this
Chinese activity that

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.390
began 25 years ago and is
accelerating every single year.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.455
So I think of AIIB-- the Asian
Infrastructure and Investment

00:27:57.455 --> 00:28:00.360
Bank-- I think of it as the
NATO of the 21st century.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.980
And that's
instructive because we

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.040
think of security as being the
world's paramount public good.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.190
The United States is the
foremost provider of it,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.800
especially since World War II.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.810
But along comes China
and says, well, there's

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.630
another global public good
as important as security.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.505
It is infrastructure.

00:28:15.505 --> 00:28:17.580
It is connectivity.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.000
Every country seems to want
it because 60 or 70 countries

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.777
lined up to join this bank as
soon as it was established.

00:28:24.777 --> 00:28:26.610
And China is going to
be the world's largest

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.930
provider of this.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.025
So the NATO of the 21st
century is the AIIB,

00:28:31.025 --> 00:28:34.530
and it's a world in which
people crave and need

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.490
that connectivity and
infrastructure as much

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.480
as they want security.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.360
So another couple of maps.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.469
Aha, this one.

00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:44.760
This is another one that
Canadians may not like so much

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.620
or they may find interesting.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.230
If our climate change
projections are correct--

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.870
and this is a map that was
made by the British journal

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.650
the New Scientist-- they said
if the world temperatures rise

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.970
four degrees Celsius
above the 1990 baseline

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.990
that the IPCC uses, where will
the world's food production be?

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:10.090
And so what you find if their
extrapolation is correct

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:12.130
and the impact that
this temperature rise

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.990
is going to have in terms
of wiping out the food

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.770
production in what our today
some of the world's most

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.240
significant bread baskets--
the world's largest food

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.160
producers are the United
States, Brazil, India, China,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.660
Australia, and a
couple other countries.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.160
So notice those countries
are all now pasty brown.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.660
They've all been
desertified, if you will.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.450
And a food production
will happen

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.780
in areas that have traditionally
been tundra and Arctic, which

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.357
is to say Canada and Russia.

00:29:40.357 --> 00:29:41.940
But what are the two
largest countries

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.349
in the world and two of the
most depopulated countries

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:44.890
in the world?

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.200
Russia and Canada.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.080
So here you have
a situation where

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.170
the geography of the world's
population today, which

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.990
is almost everyone south
of the Arctic Circle--

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.545
66 degrees north latitude.

00:29:56.545 --> 00:30:01.060
Do you know how many people live
north of the Arctic Circle ring

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.440
today?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.590
It's less than the
population of Manhattan.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.230
It's less than
four million people

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.270
who live in the
entire Arctic Circle.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:12.530
And yet, we're heading to a
world where most of the food

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.430
is supposedly going to
be coming from there.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.060
That requires us to think pretty
differently about the world

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.610
than just nations and borders.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.540
We have to think
about food supply

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.000
chains and mass migrations
and new kinds of settlements.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.910
And this is just the final nail
in the coffin in the argument.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.980
As if the internet and
connectivity and infrastructure

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.840
and economies and
migration weren't enough

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.610
cause to believe that the
world is reorganizing itself,

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.810
here's the icing on the cake.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:39.940
We will just have to.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.390
And this is even absent
rising sea levels

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.680
and coastal inundations and
potential tsunamis having

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.600
a devastating impact on the
world's coastal megacities,

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.530
particularly in Asia.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.881
So we could be in for, obviously
a stormy and turbulent time--

00:30:55.881 --> 00:30:57.130
people always talk about that.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:59.520
But think about the
consequences for what

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.790
we do the next day and the
next day and the next day.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.540
And it's going to
require rethinking

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.930
how we organize ourselves.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.580
And that's what
this is all about.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.684
So I'm probably going
to stop right there.

00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:12.100
I'm just wondering if there's
one pretty map I can end on.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.930
Oh, of course, it's this one.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.450
We might toggle between
this and the next one a lot

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:21.010
since we're here at Google--
a foremost technology company.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.330
What I got TeleGeography
to do for me

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:28.210
here is to map out
bandwidth speeds

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.290
within and across the continents
and to update their data.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:36.060
So you can get a sense of where
global connectivity is going.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.180
Because, of course, the value of
the services trade in the world

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.580
system is now greater than
the value of goods trade.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.480
And Google is, of
course, part of making

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.980
that happen with things
like the fiber one cable

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.430
and even the cables
that are being laid down

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.010
across the continental
United States

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.940
and providing faster bandwidth
to American communities.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.950
This gives you a sense of
how much more we have to go.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.800
Because you can see that even
though the populations that

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.990
are online in Asia are so
significant and even Africa,

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.880
the percentage of the
populations that are online

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.610
is still not where it could be.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:17.100
So in India and China, it's
hovering around 40 to 50

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.950
to 60 percent.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.320
So not at the
level where you see

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.820
Western Europe and
the United States

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.300
and Japan and South Korea
where it's 100% or more.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.310
So this is, I know, a mission
that a lot of key technology

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.650
companies play.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.290
And having traveled
around and looked so much

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.860
at the catalytic impact
that connectivity has,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.660
whether it's energy,
transportation,

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.040
or communications,
I strongly believe

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.450
in that connectivity mission.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.970
There's all this good
stuff about genetics too

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.920
which is in the
book, but we'll just

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.140
leave up this peaceful map of
the world's intercity networks.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.470
And we'll invite
Yasmin back up and we

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.120
can talk about maybe some
of the other maps as well.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.350
Thank you so much,
it's really a pleasure

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.900
to be here, especially today.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.550
YASMIN: That was a
fascinating presentation.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.214
I didn't want it to end.

00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:14.005
And I think you went
in the right direction

00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:16.120
with pretty pictures--
we like maps.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.580
We like data at Google.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.730
So we have 20 minutes.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.430
I thought maybe I
could steal 10 minutes

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.010
to ask you a few questions
that are burning on my mind,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.210
and then we can have 10
minutes of Q&amp;A with the people

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:27.900
who are with us.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.130
I thought I'd start with cities.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.670
You've been thinking
about cities for longer

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.667
than most other people I know.

00:33:35.667 --> 00:33:37.750
You've been talking about
cities for a long time--

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.420
before it was cool.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.345
PARAG KHANNA: Now it's
not even cool anymore.

00:33:41.345 --> 00:33:42.470
YASMIN: It's very cool.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.250
It's very hot.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:48.990
Megacities and megalopises--
would that be the plural?

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.700
Megalopoli.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.147
PARAG KHANNA:
Let's go with that.

00:33:51.147 --> 00:33:53.730
YASMIN: I was wondering if you
could tell us a little bit more

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.760
about how you
think about cities.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.370
And we do, being part of Google
and part of the tech sector,

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:03.880
we do think a lot
about China and the US.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.600
We compare China's approach
and the US's approach

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.719
to governance and to
structure and to strategy.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.010
So I wonder if you could
tell us a bit more about how

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.360
you think the Chinese
and the Americans are

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.469
thinking about cities?

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:18.260
PARAG KHANNA: Sure.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.820
And we shouldn't
forget the Europeans.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.489
Because Europe has
centuries of history

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:28.340
and is pedestrian,
walkable, dense,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.639
and mid-size urban
environments that

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.290
are actually more sustainable.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.880
So China has obviously
vastly overshot

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.527
that given its huge population.

00:34:36.527 --> 00:34:38.360
It's gone out of its
way to build these more

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.909
gigantic industrial sites.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:42.570
But then again, it's still an
industrial society or economy,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.889
whereas the Western world
is more post-industrial.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.280
So China takes a lot of its
inspiration, I would say,

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.800
or its efforts
today from Europe,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.120
which is to say how to implement
more sustainable technologies

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.010
in these urban environments
that they realize

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:01.030
have become horribly congested
and polluted and so forth.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.100
What you find in
these Chinese clusters

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.400
is that you'll have one or
two or three core cities,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.790
and then each of those will
have little satellite towns

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:13.980
and then each of them will be
connected by high-speed railway

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.906
networks and highways.

00:35:14.906 --> 00:35:16.780
And then each of those
clusters, like I said,

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.330
is connected to
the other clusters.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.040
So you get really this
crystalline kind of structure.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.890
And that is how it's emerging.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.204
Now, in the US, there's
no such strategy behind--

00:35:28.204 --> 00:35:30.120
YASMIN: Because there's
a strategy with China.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.411
That's the point you're making?

00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:33.350
PARAG KHANNA: It is a strategy.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.260
So urbanization is an organic
phenomenon around the world.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.970
It's one of these
irrevocable megatrends

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.340
in the same connectivity is.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.690
The way I put it, there's
two irrevocable megatrends

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.200
across time and history today.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.077
One is this connectivity, and
the other is urbanization.

00:35:51.077 --> 00:35:52.660
You bring the two
together, and you've

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.160
get this map of the world.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.500
So around the world, people
organically, voluntarily

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.840
are flooding into cities.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.900
China is the only place where
it's happening both voluntarily

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.140
and involuntarily because
they're dictating and directing

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.640
and steering people
into new cities

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.310
that they've built
that are empty.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.170
There've been a lot
of media reports that

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.466
call them ghost towns.

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.340
But then you go back
after four or five years

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.756
and they're starting to fill
up because people are looking

00:36:18.756 --> 00:36:21.120
to move out of places
that have been wiped out

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.366
as the manufacturing sector has
collapsed, wages have risen.

00:36:24.366 --> 00:36:25.990
So they're moving
into these new towns.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.460
And a city, to remain
economically viable in terms

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.670
of its services sector or
having a resilient services

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:37.590
economy, versus being dependent
on manufacturing exports that

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.560
are highly volatile, you need
to have at least three to four

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.990
million people various
research suggests.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:45.990
So the problem with
many American cities

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.270
is that their populations
are below a million people.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.190
So you take Detroit.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:52.420
Detroit's population fell
to below a million people,

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.900
and it lacked that internally
resilient services economy

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.730
that would allow it to sustain
itself beyond export oriented

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:03.610
automobile industry.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:07.450
So we need to re-aggregate
our cities in a way

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:12.440
that they can be
internally viable.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.742
And so the way I
describe Detroit's future

00:37:14.742 --> 00:37:16.700
in this New York Time's
piece is that it should

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.650
be seen as the midway point
on a Chicago-Toronto corridor

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.900
within this broader
North American Union.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.560
That's just not the way
Congresspeople think.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.177
I mean, we are a long, long
way from our Congress, which

00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:31.760
of course everything
is about fighting

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.970
for fiscal and budgetary
scraps to go into your state,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.230
not caring about whether
or not that infrastructure

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.830
or connectivity stretches across
one state boundary to another

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.650
so that you can
mutually benefit.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.160
We are down here when it
comes to the sophistication

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.460
of our political
logic and stretching

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.850
beyond our state boundaries.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.830
Meanwhile, what I'm proposing
is it makes total sense.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.010
Just look at a map.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:56.430
Chicago, Toronto,
Detroit in the middle,

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:58.900
you should be having a
trade and industry corridor.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.650
That's an export
powerhouse taking

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.390
advantage of Arctic shipping
routes through Hudson Bay.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.340
In Washington, they can't
even find Hudson Bay on a map

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.140
and I wish I weren't
exaggerating,

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.950
but that's where we need to be.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.360
An even second tier Chinese
cities you can go to,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.900
they've all got their
own economic master

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.770
plans and strategies--
what industries

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.880
they want to attract, what
companies are they targeting,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.930
what supply chains do
they want to be part of.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.646
All of these things they're
thinking way, way, way ahead.

00:38:28.646 --> 00:38:30.020
Now, there are a
number of cities

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.880
that are starting to do
this like Columbus, Ohio,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.490
and Salt Lake City and
the Brookings Institution

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.120
as a whole department
that consults on this.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.740
It's starting, but that doesn't
mean it's going to succeed.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.800
Just like in China or
other places in the world,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.580
cities get wiped out.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.970
Industries rise and fall.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.250
People have to move.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.950
The beautiful thing I would
say about America-- the virtue,

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.990
the luck, the manifest destiny,
whatever you want to call it--

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:59.120
is that America is so large,
so devolved, so federalized, so

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.200
distributed, has so many
large population centers

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.752
that people can re-sort when you
have these economic convulsions

00:39:07.752 --> 00:39:08.710
like we've been having.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.380
And it's one of the
things that people

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.530
have to take advantage of.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.080
The history of
American migration

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.720
is searching for opportunity
in new geographies,

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.900
and so I think that great
re-sorting as some economists

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.560
and sociologists
call it is actually

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.980
underway today in America.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.889
It may seem tragic and painful
to see the lack of opportunity

00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:30.680
in many areas and the
fact that people just

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.960
have to just get up and go.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.030
But that's actually part
of American history,

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:36.690
and think about
all the countries

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.680
where you don't have
that possibility, where

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.260
the entire economy centers
around one city and nothing

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:41.760
else.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.302
And if that city fails,
if that economy fails,

00:39:44.302 --> 00:39:46.010
if the one industry
that drives it fails,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.219
the whole country is screwed.

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:48.885
That's never going
to happen to America.

00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:50.840
And America is lucky,
but it should actually

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.260
build the infrastructure to
make it more possible for people

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.670
to make those moves today that
are necessary to revitalize

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.040
society and the economy.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.375
YASMIN: You spoke about
cities being the only thing

00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:05.440
that you can see from
space and the thing

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.090
that we've had for 5,000
years as well-- the nation

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:12.950
states in the Westphalian
system are 200 years old.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:17.310
Let's imagine that the
megacity model in China

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:20.300
and exporting it and
say that Congress

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.650
adopts your prescriptions in
your New York Times op ed,

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:28.410
what does this mean
for the nation state

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.620
and also for national identity?

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.160
Many Americans,
Europeans, Canadians

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.010
enjoy their sense of
national identity.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.430
What happens when
the city takes over

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.180
as the atom and
the building block?

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.050
PARAG KHANNA: So
history is cumulative,

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.700
it's not substitutive.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.050
Nothing that I've
said at any point

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.890
should suggest that nations
and states and boundaries

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.440
and national
governments disappear.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.773
We're always going to live
in some country or the other.

00:41:01.773 --> 00:41:04.320
The entire world's
physical geography

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.274
is claimed by sovereign states.

00:41:06.274 --> 00:41:07.940
In fact, there are
many geographies that

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.390
are claimed by multiple states.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.790
You will always be standing
on the territory that

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.630
belongs to or is claimed
by a sovereign government.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.320
I've got no problem with that.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.690
But history is additive.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.510
It's the cities from
5,000 years ago,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.380
it's the empires
that have existed

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.370
for thousands of years--
America is an empire.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.887
Europe has empires.

00:41:24.887 --> 00:41:26.220
The European Union is an empire.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.480
China is an empire.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.840
India is an empire.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.050
And then you have the
states that are now

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.790
another layer on top of that.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.050
So you have sovereignty,
you have enlightenment,

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.030
you have technology,
you have capitalism,

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.040
you have infrastructure--
all these things just

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.700
keep on and on layering.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.290
So the city doesn't
replace the country anymore

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.680
than the country ever
replaced the city.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.330
These things just make the
world more complicated.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.790
And that complexity applies
to all of us in our identity

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.590
as well.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.596
If you were never able
to connect to anyone

00:41:56.596 --> 00:41:57.970
outside your
national boundaries,

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.660
if you had no access to
information, if you couldn't

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.790
leave the country in
which you were born,

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.980
you would have a relatively
limited selection

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.520
of identities to choose from--
that which is prescribed

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.290
by the king, that
which is prescribed

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.460
by the pope, whatever
the case may be.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.260
That's not the case anymore.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.740
And so what I find,
especially in a world that

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.200
is very young-- I mean 40%,
50% of the world's population

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.862
is young and youthful, and
a large share of the world's

00:42:24.862 --> 00:42:25.820
population is also old.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.730
But when I travel around and
I talk to young people, what

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.220
I find is not a sense
that national identity

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.150
is the only identity
that matters to them.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.480
It's not something you
have to reject in order

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.440
to appreciate and
absorb and embrace

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.700
the multitude of identities.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.880
So I talk in this
book about civicism,

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.225
which is a new-ish term
coined by a friend of mine,

00:42:48.225 --> 00:42:51.250
in which he says the pride
and loyalty in a city.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.050
Of course, if you're
New Yorker like I am,

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.224
you're a New Yorker first.

00:42:56.224 --> 00:42:58.390
YASMIN: How old were you
when you moved to New York?

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.429
PARAG KHANNA: I was six.

00:43:00.429 --> 00:43:02.345
YASMIN: So you get to
say you're a New Yorker?

00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:02.600
PARAG KHANNA: Yeah.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.010
YASMIN: No one disputes
that your a New Yorker.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.660
PARAG KHANNA: They dare not.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.409
YASMIN: Because I
wonder how long it would

00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:10.360
take me to be a New Yorker.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.600
PARAG KHANNA: Let me just
say something about this.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.740
This a city-- right now in
Albany and elsewhere, they're

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.730
actually discussing
whether or not

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.460
to give migrants and
non-citizens voting

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.590
rights in municipal elections.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.450
So vote for mayor of New
York or in city council

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.770
ballots and referendum.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.190
I think that's awesome.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:33.009
Obviously, you're a New
Yorker if you're able to vote.

00:43:33.009 --> 00:43:35.050
You could be someone who
is not even naturalized.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.690
You could be an illegal
alien who is just

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.101
in some way given
some identity card

00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.600
and you might be
able to participate

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.900
in the politics of the state.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:47.165
You will not be voting for
president for a very long time,

00:43:47.165 --> 00:43:49.540
but the politics of the city,
you're going to be part of.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.623
I think that's incredible.

00:43:50.623 --> 00:43:54.600
Only cities like
Rotterdam and Toronto

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.062
and Hamburg and New
York and other places

00:43:57.062 --> 00:43:59.020
are actually starting to
do that kind of thing,

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.200
because they say--
like ancient Athens,

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.430
by the way, just going back
to the history of cities,

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.550
where there any
resident of Athens

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.650
was part of the
polity of Athens.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:16.060
And there's nothing so radical
of that coming back today.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.430
One of the biggest
sections in the book

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:19.660
is actually about devolution.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:24.040
It's about cities and provinces
reclaiming their right

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.990
to govern themselves.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.980
Because that's where
the decisions are made,

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.063
that's where lives are
affected, that's why mayors

00:44:29.063 --> 00:44:30.260
are becoming so powerful.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.310
That's why when
someone like Bloomberg

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.030
entertains running
for president,

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.860
so many people
take it seriously.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.160
That's why there are more
president's today-- active,

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.310
sitting, serving
presidents today--

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.440
whose last job was
mayor of a big city

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.770
than ever before in history.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.830
Because that's the stepping
stone of proving you actually

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:47.913
know how to run something.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.565
So civicism is one new kind of
identity beyond your national

00:44:53.565 --> 00:44:55.440
or government identity
or religious identity.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.898
And then there's
all the identities

00:44:56.898 --> 00:44:58.870
that you acquire
through technology.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:04.040
The whole field of social
physics, as it's called,

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.020
is about understanding
how people now

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.880
form these cloud communities.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.730
What is your identity
in the cloud?

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.880
Not just what's
your avatar's name,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.790
but how do you feel
about the communities

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.070
that you're part of online.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.860
People who have a certain cause.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.290
Arab democracy,
environmentalism, you name it.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.100
That identity can
be very strong, too.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.560
And so I don't think that one
has to substitute the other.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.260
We have to embrace
this complexity.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.130
Each of us has many
identities that overlap.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.760
YASMIN: Yeah, that's
a really nice point.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.140
We have less than 10 minutes,
so I will allow anyone here

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.880
to ask a question now.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.580
Go ahead.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.960
I have a question-- kind
of a counter-view on this.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:54.970
I was thinking that you've
mentioned the maps in terms

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:57.770
of the city and linking
the cities and the cities

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:03.550
growing and encompassing
the core of connectivity.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.950
People and pipelines and
infrastructure and electricity.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.680
I have a counter-view.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.350
I was thinking in terms of
things are dilluting away

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:20.790
from cities in the sense that
given that connectivity has

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.850
reached every part, everyone
has a phone now, even

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.800
in India near my small
city where I was born.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.460
And now even
[INAUDIBLE] has a phone.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.580
He doesn't earn enough,
but he has phone.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:38.470
So that means that everyone, if
they wish, can learn and become

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.501
of service-- can
trade their services.

00:46:41.501 --> 00:46:44.000
So that means we don't really
need them to come to services.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.600
So people should
go away from cities

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.380
and start-- I should see
a more uniform lighted

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.150
map, which I was kind of
hoping to see in the book.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.430
Maybe all the bulbs
should light up everywhere

00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:59.865
and then it would
be homogenized.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:08.660
The other one I was thinking was
that the four degree centigrade

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.510
increase where most of
South America and India

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.150
was flooded and gone,
that seems to me

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.240
that don't they have
mud in the Himalayas?

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.800
Can't they carry and
put them on the sides

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.630
and then they stop the water
from [INAUDIBLE] New York City?

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:28.950
Keep dumping mud
from Central America

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:31.300
on the sides of New York City.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.435
They built Dubai just by
shoving mud into water.

00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:37.810
PARAG KHANNA: It was a little
more complicated than that,

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.279
but that said, land
reclamation is actually

00:47:41.279 --> 00:47:42.570
one of the themes in this book.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.760
I talk about sand--
the role of sand.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.700
There's this global
market for sand

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.070
that gets shipped and
towed all over the world

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.540
to build up artificial islands.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.040
So obviously, you
see this happening

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.060
in the South China Sea.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.240
And I actually say,
think about how much

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.200
the United States spends
on missiles and submarines

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:06.330
and aircraft carriers and
fighter jets and so forth

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:09.430
and China is using
sand-- silica--

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.630
the most abundant element
in the earth's crust.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.520
It's free.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.810
It's now the most powerful
geopolitical weapon.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.290
China just takes this
sand, dumps it onto rocks,

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.830
and is able to claim new
political sovereignty

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.630
in very sensitive environments.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.640
So it's a lesson lesson.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.650
But let me take
your first question.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.650
I've heard this many times.

00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:35.590
If all it took to convince
people not to move to cities

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.660
is to give them even a
solar-power-charged mobile

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:42.250
phone, then I don't know why
they would move to cities.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.170
And the truth is you
don't just move to a city

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.950
because you really want
to get a Nokia phone.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.410
You go there for health
care, you go there for jobs,

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.370
you go there for education, you
go there for basic services,

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:55.290
for income, to send
remittances back,

00:48:55.290 --> 00:49:00.622
to experience modern
life, which are things

00:49:00.622 --> 00:49:01.830
that you're not going to get.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.160
You're talking
about connectivity

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.970
as if it's just
digital connectivity,

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.370
but the fact is that
the incidence of malaria

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:15.140
falls drastically if you
have a hardwood or concrete

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.840
floor in your home, which many
billions of people do not have.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.500
A mobile phone is not the same.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.680
A mobile phone does
not cure malaria.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.220
So you will, as I say,
never ever stop people

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.091
from moving to cities.

00:49:28.091 --> 00:49:28.590
Ever.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:29.790
There's nothing you can say.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.480
There's no amount of fiber
cable Google or anyone else

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.520
can lay down to the remote
villages, where of course

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.070
it makes no economic
sense to lay down cables

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.500
to because there's no one there.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.240
You will never
stop urbanization.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.440
Only massive, massive
tsunamis drowning the billions

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:53.370
of people urbanizing
on the Pacific Rim

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:56.060
is going to stop urbanization.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.170
So you can't convince people
that just because they

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.170
have a bunch of phones
in rural environments

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:02.740
that life is better
where they are.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.140
Because if that were true,
they wouldn't be coming.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.340
Again, this is a
voluntary process,

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.590
and it is as much or more
so in India than anywhere

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.434
else in the world.

00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:13.350
Of course, the most
rapidly urbanizing country

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:18.760
on the planet is India, even
though they have exponentially

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.326
accelerating mobile
phone penetration.

00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:23.700
AUDIENCE: My
question is slightly

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:27.010
different from this one.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:33.070
Is it right to say that we are
just becoming one civilization?

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:37.210
If yes, then historically,
civilizations,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.360
they end up collapsing,
and most of the time,

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.960
in a spectacular fashion.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.664
What makes us different?

00:50:44.664 --> 00:50:46.580
PARAG KHANNA: On the
question of civilization,

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.480
I think it is the
first time when

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.800
you can speak of something
like this global network

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.520
civilization.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:57.070
It's not a terminology that
we could've used before.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:51:01.530
But civilization in the sense
of those that rise and decline

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:04.370
as you say in these
spectacular moments

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:10.610
of collapse, that tends to be
an anthropological, ecological,

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.470
and political
pattern with respect

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:17.780
to specific geographic
cultural civilizations.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:20.320
I'm using civilization
in a much looser

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.630
sense of the ability
for mankind to have

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:29.040
a certain minimal degree of
connectivity amongst its parts

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.359
so that you can think of it as
having some kind of a cohesion.

00:51:32.359 --> 00:51:33.900
You never would have
been able to say

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.940
that many generations ago
or certainly centuries

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.810
ago-- the notion that
we are all in this boat

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.150
together, so to speak.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.660
You didn't hear people exactly
talking like that in the 19th

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.229
and even in the 20th centuries.

00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:49.270
So that's the sense in
which I mean civilization.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:50.820
And of course,
again, a lot of it

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.240
rests on this physical
connectedness.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.360
You can't influence and
you have much less sympathy

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.300
for that which you
can't touch and feel,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.320
that which you're
not connected to.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.080
One of the examples
I give in the book

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.160
is the collapse of that
garment factory in Bangladesh

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:12.940
in the year 2013 where there was
an uproar for months and months

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.160
and years because there
was a Bangladeshi garment

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.700
factory making clothing
for Western retailers.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.780
There was this uproar
saying H&amp;M and Zara

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.190
and these other companies,
what are you doing about this?

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.356
What are you doing about
the plight of those people?

00:52:26.356 --> 00:52:29.310
I mean, can you imagine that
happening even 10 years ago,

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:29.860
15 years ago?

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:30.620
No way.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.460
It's because the supply
chain connects us here

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.120
in rich New York to the
poorest people in the world.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:41.200
And so we're able to have some
degree of sympathy or empathy

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:41.700
with them.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.230
That never, ever, ever
could have been the case.

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:46.310
And previously, if
it were the case--

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.700
the anti-slavery
movement, for example--

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.770
it was obviously more emotive
and more geographically

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:52.350
specific.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:54.760
But now, you can find
these connections

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.520
through the supply chain
between almost any two people

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.190
in the world.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:03.530
And again, that process is
just now getting underway.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:04.950
YASMIN: Final closing note.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.340
I wonder if you could say
something that speaks maybe

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.500
to-- you are here at
Google-- maybe to those of us

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.210
in the tech sector who think
about connectivity probably

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.260
in only one aspect of the
way that you tackle it

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.010
in this book.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.420
But the tech sector is
thinking about driver-less cars

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:26.630
and aerial delivery systems and
AI and automated assistance.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:27.910
We're laying down cables.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.760
We're big on connectivity.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.710
What would you leave us with as
the promise or the opportunity

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.190
for technology's role
in connectography?

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:40.140
PARAG KHANNA: So I
point out in the book

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.000
that telecom companies,
technology companies,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.100
are infrastructure companies.

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.170
And obviously, Google
is foremost among them

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.740
in terms of literally
contributing

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.310
to this physical, built
infrastructural environment,

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.660
to which I say amen.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.120
Because we're
desperately lagging

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.680
in that category across the
board of, again, energy,

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.830
transportation,
communications-- what's

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:06.750
called the infrastructure
stock has been so meager

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.980
for a world of nine
billion people.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.400
So Google, as well as
very large companies

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.690
like pipeline companies
and railway companies,

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:18.860
are all agents of connectivity.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.450
And so they're actually, in a
way, the heroes of this book

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:24.430
are those that facilitate,
enable, and expand connectivity

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.200
because we have been able
to demonstrate as far

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.310
back as the
Industrial Revolution

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:33.610
that it is connectivity has
lifted global living standards,

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.710
that has enhanced trade.

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:38.020
There've been enough Nobel
Prizes given out for this,

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.180
by the way, going back to
like Michael Spence, Angus

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.150
Deaton, Robert Solow-- you
can't disprove the notion

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:51.290
that connectivity is the agent
of growth in the world economy.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:52.750
And it's all forms
of connectivity.

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:55.320
So even if governments
aren't doing it,

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.052
if the private sector is, I
think that's a fantastic thing.

00:54:58.052 --> 00:55:00.260
And that's not just for
countries, that's for people.

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:02.930
We can measure now
everything from how

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.210
your labor productivity improves
by being digitally connected.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:09.780
We know that in terms of the
workforce around the world.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:12.630
So in every way,
connectivity is not

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.610
only something that has this
empirical role in strengthening

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.620
our capacity and
our productivity,

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.750
but it really should
be a human right.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.357
In this book, connectivity
is presented as a human right

00:55:25.357 --> 00:55:26.190
as much as anything.

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.650
Connectivity and
mobility should really

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:32.300
be considered two of the
absolute foremost human rights

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.230
in the world.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.760
And I can't think of any
instance in which it is not

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.680
a good thing for a human
being to have an option

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.640
to be more connected
and more mobile.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.520
And so if you want to talk
about improving mankind's fate,

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:47.500
you definitely want to extend
that connectivity to everyone

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.450
you can.

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:50.860
So congrats for doing so.

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.780
YASMIN: Wonderful note
to round off the talk.

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.490
Thank you very
much, Parag Khanna.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:56.260
PARAG KHANNA: Thank you.
