00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.210
Hi, I'm Remzi Senel.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.750
I work at Gram Games.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.990
Gram Games is a global
mobile game developer,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.720
and I'm the head of
Mid-core Games [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.140
Today I'm going to talk
about how Google Play

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.150
platform enables us to react
fast, test our ideas fast,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.210
and A/B test fast.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.510
Gaming industry is
a dynamic industry

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.630
where things change fast.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.680
One day you have
[INAUDIBLE] design,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.690
and the other you have cute
bunnies jumping around.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.160
So you have to track the user
interest and act accordingly.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.990
So when we make prototypes
they are not always fun.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.780
We don't want our every user
to see the prototypes we make,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.480
so we use another developer
name to test our ideas

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.980
in Google Play platform.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
We do that prototype Wednesdays.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.400
Every Wednesday is a
prototyping day at Gram Games.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.030
We try out our
new ideas and test

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.490
if they make it-- if
we can make them fun.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.130
Once we are complete with the
prototypes on those Wednesdays,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
we pack them up and send them
over to our friends and family.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.560
Once they have the
game people tend

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.900
to sugarcoat their feedback.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.330
They don't really
say what they think.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.060
Well, it's fun, but
it's not for me.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.530
What we are looking for
is that they show up

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.400
the next day at our office
with their eyes black,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.880
having not slept last night.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.310
When they show up with
their eyes black and eager

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.710
to play more of
the game, we just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.030
take the game into our
production pipeline

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.770
and invest more in it.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.530
If the game doesn't happen to
engage our friends and family,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.370
we don't really invest.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.100
What you're seeing is 1010!

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.330
World, our latest title.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.509
It should be
launched pretty soon.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.280
And what you see here is we
are testing different ideas.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.250
For example, if the bombs-- you
see the green blogs over here--

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.930
do they make the users
get more into the game?

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.630
And what you see here is that
filling the board a little bit

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.920
more would be easier
or harder for the user.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.000
When we do A/B testing
with different ideas

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.400
we try to observe the
behavioral changes in our users.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.060
We try to figure out
which APIs went up

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.350
and which went down, and figure
out which works better for us.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.750
Another thing Google
Play platform enables us,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.900
is that we are free to iterate
it as fast as we can double up.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.060
With other platforms
we really have

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.210
to wait for the review
duration, and when

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.150
you implement
something it takes time

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.100
to see the results of the test.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.090
So with 1010!

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.680
World we soft launched
in three countries,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.170
and every week we were free
to test our ideas with an A/B

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.030
test.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.310
Every week we
implemented a new feature

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.500
and tested it out in the Google
Play platform in just a week.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.080
We have launched 1010!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.010
World to soft launch in three
countries two months ago,

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.770
and we have been A/B testing
rigorously for the better

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.620
half of the last two months.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.990
So we went over 10 iterations
with the game, four completely

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.670
different art styles, five or
six different sound styles,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.840
and thanks to Google
platform we are now

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.190
confident that our game will
perform well in app stores.
