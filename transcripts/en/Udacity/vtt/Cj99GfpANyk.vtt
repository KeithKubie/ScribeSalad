00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.460
While this entire course will cover many elements of an operating system, it

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.780
would be nice to have a simple illustration of what an operating system is like.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.590
So, to give a visual metaphor using our toy theme,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.100
we can say that an operating system is like a toy shop manager.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.030
At a high level, how is a toy shop manager like an operating system?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.880
First, a toy shop manager directs operational resources in the shop.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.490
Second, a toy shop manager enforces working policies.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.400
And finally, a toy shop manager mitigates the difficulty of complex tasks.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.110
For instance, for any toy shop manager, they must be in charge of

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.690
their employees and direct their working efforts towards completing the work.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.580
Additionally, a toy shop manager is responsible for scheduling, for allocating,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.760
for distributing the resources in the shop, the parts and the tools, and for

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.130
determining which of the employees will work on which orders and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.420
use which tools.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.130
Toy shop managers are also the ones that enforce working policies in

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.330
the toy shop.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.120
This can be policies regarding fairness, safety, clean-up.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.240
For instance, how workers working on two different orders have to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.300
share one of the shared resources, shared parts and tools for instance.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.510
Another example is policy regarding how to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.470
clean up after yourselves once a worker is done with processing a toy order.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.010
Finally, a toy shop manager helps mitigate the effects of complex tasks.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.240
It does that by trying to make the overall operation of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.930
the toy shop more optimized and more simple.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.860
Without a manger, for instance, employers may not know how to

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.990
establish order among themselves, how to decide, how to handle the workload.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.412
So the toy shop manager has to deal with this situation so

00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:50.800
as to avoid dealing with a much more complex task.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.560
So, the question then is,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.220
what parallels are there between a toy shop manager with an operating system?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.255
Operating systems do direct operating resources.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:05.182
In particular, they control the use of the hardware, CPU,

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:09.497
memory, peripheral devices such as disk, network cards, etc.

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:14.170
And they decide how these resources with be allocated to applications.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.700
Along those lines, operating systems actually enforce some policies.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.680
This can include polices regarding how these resources are used, for

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.800
instance, to control fair access to the shared resources.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.270
Or it can be even to impose certain limits to allocate maximum amount of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.360
a certain resource that a particular application or process can use.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.650
Examples of such limits are, for instance,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.970
the number of open files that can be open per process, or some thresholds

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.130
that need to be passed in order for some memory management daemons to kick in.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.620
There are numerous other examples of limiting resource usage.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.660
And finally, the operating system helps with the difficulty of complex tasks.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.090
And particularly important is that it simplifies the view of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.980
the underlying hardware that's observed by the applications that

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.290
are running on that particular platform.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.280
Instead, applications interact via system calls with the operating system, and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.090
the operating system takes care of managing those difficult tasks for them.
