00:00:00.517 --> 00:00:01.672
- [Instructor] So we've been talking about

00:00:01.672 --> 00:00:04.478
the emergence of Jacksonian democracy

00:00:04.478 --> 00:00:08.457
in the first half of the 19th
century in the United States

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:11.120
and we've been talking about
how in this time period,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.287
the vote was slowly extended
to all white male citizens

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:19.011
so that by the end of
this period there were

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.875
no more property requirements
in the United States

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.138
and any white male citizen could vote.

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.815
Now those property
requirements had allowed

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:30.273
free people of color and
women to vote in some states

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:34.719
and when voting became associated
with white male citizens,

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.364
those little loopholes
ended up getting closed,

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:40.674
but this expansion of voting rights

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:43.461
to all white male
citizens really represents

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:46.688
a shift in how the average American

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:50.387
thought about who deserved to have a voice

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:52.770
in the political process
of the United States.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.167
They stopped placing so much value

00:00:55.167 --> 00:01:00.107
on this sort of aristocratic
republican citizenship

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:02.914
of the early days of the United States

00:01:02.914 --> 00:01:04.907
where someone like George Washington

00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:06.776
would never run for office.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:08.692
He would stand for office.

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:11.222
You wouldn't promote yourself,
that would be vulgar.

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:12.884
Instead, you would have men

00:01:12.884 --> 00:01:15.701
of well-known character promote you.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.719
But by the 1820s, very few
Americans believed in the idea

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.690
that there could be such a
thing as too much democracy

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.100
that you would have to avoid the mob rule.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.129
Instead, they wanted the mob rule.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:31.329
They wanted a great expansion
of democracy and that was

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.046
to them the real character
of the United States.

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:37.857
Now I should also mention that
this expansion of democracy

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:42.566
was part of a larger international
expansion of democracy.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:47.097
Similar laws that eliminated
property restrictions

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:49.341
on voting were also being passed

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.138
in England and France at this time period.

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.948
So there's kind of an international wave

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.650
to broaden the franchise,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.609
but the extension of voting
in Europe is nothing like

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.826
the extension of voting
in the United States.

00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:05.502
There are nearly twice
as many eligible voters

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:09.527
in the United States in the
1830s as there are in Britain

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.944
with a population that's half the size.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:15.415
So while European nations
are taking small steps

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:17.231
toward expanding the franchise,

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:20.576
the United States is taking
huge steps in this time period.

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:24.601
So the first election where
we start to see the influence

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:28.768
of this new wave of voters
is in the election of 1824

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.106
and let me give us a little bit more space

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:34.561
to talk about this.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.906
So the election of 1824 was a contest

00:02:37.906 --> 00:02:40.073
between John Quincy Adams,

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:45.109
son of American founder John Adams,

00:02:47.385 --> 00:02:51.552
Andrew Jackson, famous war
hero from the War of 1812,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.436
the victor of the Battle of New Orleans,

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:56.686
and Henry Clay,

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:01.344
who will become known
as the great compromiser

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:04.382
for having pretty much spent
his entire political career

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:05.744
either running for president

00:03:05.744 --> 00:03:08.013
or putting together
some kind of compromise.

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:12.166
Now, John Quincy Adams I
think kind of epitomized

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.918
the older school of American democracy.

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:19.923
He was reticent to
campaign on his own behalf.

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:23.328
He was very interested in academics

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.530
and internal improvements.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.653
He didn't really see himself as being

00:03:27.653 --> 00:03:30.750
part of a particular political party.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.940
In fact, all three of these men

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.570
were actually running as republicans

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.448
'cause in the era of good feelings

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:40.677
there's only the Republican Party.

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:44.796
So you can see how confusing
this might as been as a voter

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:47.713
to have three different
candidates from the same party

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.536
and they're supposed to be
different than each other.

00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:53.703
So in this election, Andrew
Jackson wins the popular vote

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.896
and John Quincy Adams
wins the electoral vote

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:02.232
and Henry Clay wins neither.

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:04.835
Now in a situation like
this, who got to be president

00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:07.486
was decided by the House
of Representatives.

00:04:07.486 --> 00:04:09.702
Well guess who was speaker of the house.

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:10.619
Henry Clay.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:14.168
So he's out of the running himself,

00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:18.641
but he is in a position
to make quite an impact

00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:21.284
on who wins the presidency.

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:22.800
Well John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.175
didn't have a whole lot of common,

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:26.104
but they sure both hated Andrew Jackson.

00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:30.336
So Clay and Adams meet and
Henry Clay says, "Yeah John Q.,

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.127
"I'll see if I can get the
House to vote for you,"

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.522
and that's what happens.

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:38.439
So the House elects John
Quincy Adams president

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:42.246
and then just a couple days later,

00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:46.098
John Quincy Adams says that Henry Clay

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:49.265
will get to be his Secretary of State,

00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:54.175
which was quite a plum
of a political position

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:58.888
and Andrew Jackson and his
supporters go ballistic.

00:04:58.888 --> 00:05:02.221
They say that this was a corrupt bargain

00:05:03.194 --> 00:05:04.777
behind closed doors

00:05:05.798 --> 00:05:09.465
in which John Quincy
Adams bribed Henry Clay

00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:12.120
to give him the presidency

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.030
in exchange for this political position.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.960
Now, there's no evidence that

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.017
this actual corrupt
bargain really happened,

00:05:20.017 --> 00:05:23.221
but even if it did, it was totally in line

00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:26.446
with the earlier playbook
of American democracy,

00:05:26.446 --> 00:05:30.398
a you scratch my back, I'll
scratch yours kind of situation

00:05:30.398 --> 00:05:33.836
where the better sort of men,
the higher men of character

00:05:33.836 --> 00:05:37.741
made a deal between themselves
of who would lead this nation

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.326
and the outrage over
this possible collusion

00:05:41.326 --> 00:05:44.978
between Adams and Clay
really signaled that

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:48.536
the old days of a couple
of people making decisions

00:05:48.536 --> 00:05:50.679
about American politics were over,

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:53.149
that this kind of deal between statesmen

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:56.073
was now seen as undemocratic or crooked

00:05:56.073 --> 00:05:59.437
or something that was
done behind closed doors

00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:02.301
and that was against
the American character

00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:04.757
and Andrew Jackson is really going to

00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:08.035
ride his wave of popular discontent

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:10.178
over someone winning the popular vote,

00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:12.388
but losing the electoral vote

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:15.038
due to in his mind a corrupt bargain

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:19.097
right into the presidency
in the election of 1828

00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:20.757
and we'll get to that in the next video.
