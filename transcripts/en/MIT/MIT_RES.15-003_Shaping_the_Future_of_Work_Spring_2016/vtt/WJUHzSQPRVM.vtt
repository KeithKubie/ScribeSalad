00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.110
We all know that we
are in a global world.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.730
Companies have operations
all over the planet.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.010
And a big question
we have to face

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.590
is how do we keep these
global corporations

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.230
accountable for providing good
jobs and decent work in far

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.700
flung places?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.070
Let's do it through a company
we all know and love--

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.020
Nike.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.860
Nike was a pioneer in this area.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.440
In the 1960s, Nike was one of
the first companies that said

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.210
we will design our work here.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.000
We will market and sell our
products around the world,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.840
particularly in
the United States,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.250
but we can find cheaper
places to manufacture them.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.160
First, they started
in Japan, and Korea,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.250
and then Indonesia, and Vietnam,
and China, and Bangladesh.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.660
As they did so, a number
of problems became known.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.400
The Nike products more marketed
well with Michael Jordan

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.780
and so on, but Labor
Standards became a problem.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.050
They were famously found
having child labor,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.130
to having unsafe
working conditions,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.020
to having long hours of unpaid
overtime in their factories

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.640
abroad.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.530
And what was Nike's response?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.530
Well, wait a minute.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.010
These aren't our problems,
these are our contractors.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.560
These are not our employees.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440
We don't treat our
employees that way.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.150
Somebody else's problem.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.280
And that lasted for awhile,
but by the middle of the 1990s,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.190
Nike watched its stock
price begin to fall.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.940
It saw the publicity
begin to grow and grow.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.700
And finally, Phil
Knight, the CEO of Nike,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.330
made this famous statement.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.230
He said, Nike's
products have become

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.730
synonymous with slave
wages, forced overtime,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.270
and arbitrary abuse, and we
need to do something about it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.030
to change that image, or we're
going to suffer as a company.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.720
So what did Nike do?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.940
Well, to its credit, it
took a whole set of actions.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.340
First, it created a
social responsibility unit

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880
within its organization
and assigned people

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.870
the responsibility to
say, fix this problem.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.870
That was a good
start, but not enough.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.560
Second, they created what
are called codes of conduct.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.850
They established
minimum wages, and rules

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.590
against sexual
harassment, and rules

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.290
for maximum hours and overtime,
and freedom of association.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.740
And they started to apply
that code of conduct

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.790
to all factories
that they contracted

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.140
with throughout their
global supply chain.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
They sent auditors out
there to measure compliance

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.180
with its code of conduct.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.190
They took some of their
expert operations managers

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.460
and manufacturing experts, sent
them to some of these plants

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.460
to help consult, to
help people both build

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.320
safe working conditions,
but also efficient ways

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.460
of manufacturing products
to improve safety,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.060
improve quality,
improve productivity.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.110
They went on and
worked with a variety

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.050
of non-governmental
organizations,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.250
or NGOs in these countries
who are advocating

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.430
for improved employment
conditions, safety standards,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.160
and in some cases, environmental
standards in these factories.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560
They shared this audit data
with academic researchers,

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.800
including a team of
researchers here at MIT,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.700
where they started to analyze
the data and learn what works

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.810
and what didn't.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.650
They also created a website,
and to their credit,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.560
you can go on this
website and you can find

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.360
all their factories listed.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.600
You can find the
audit scores, and you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.810
can find an analysis
of what is working

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.020
and a very frank analysis
of what isn't working.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.930
They met here at MIT,
and later, at Stanford

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.860
with multiple stakeholders,
NGOs, academics, competitors,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.190
suppliers, in forming what
they call a just supply chain

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.560
project and set of practices.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.570
The research findings
from our MIT project,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.800
led by my colleague
Richard Locke,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.500
reached a number of conclusions.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.590
First, they found
that NGO pressure

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.010
was really important to
get this thing going.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.800
Nike and other companies
like Hewlett Packard,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.260
and other electronics firms,
and other consumer companies

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.130
that followed in
Nike's footsteps

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.420
did it because there was
transparency and pressure that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.570
was being brought to bear
to get them to do so.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.120
The codes of conduct were
successful and the audits

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.360
we're successful,
but only partially.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.460
They seem to bring the
practices up to about 50% to 60%

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.830
of the overall goals
that were established

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.380
in the standards that were set.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.820
So there's lots of
room for improvement.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.270
The standard that was
most frequently violated

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.560
was around working hours
and overtime hours.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.810
Why is that?

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.860
It's important for us
to know, because we

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.060
are part of the problem.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.860
As we are fickle consumers,
and all of a sudden

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.240
we want the latest logo,
or the latest scarf,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.300
or the latest shirt,
and so the company

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.220
puts pressure on
the supply chain

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.170
to get those
products in a hurry.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.860
And the contractor there out
in Asia or somewhere else

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.430
says to employees, I need those,
I need them today and get them

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.080
done no matter what, or we're
going to lose this contract.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.310
And so they work long hours, and
they're forced to work overtime

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.950
and all kinds of bad
things happen after that.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.340
But the scores of
suppliers that got better

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.690
had three key ingredients.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.360
First, they got management help
from Nike and other companies.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.200
Secondly, they were
in countries that

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.700
had stronger rules of law,
less corrupt governments,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.380
and they had stronger rules
governing human rights

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.160
and commercial practices.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.890
And so the environment
of the country matters.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.650
So this is all great progress.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.860
Companies have learned
how to do this.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.510
But what about us?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.890
If we're part of the
problem, we ought

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.600
to be part of the solution.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.300
There are a number of things
that have been very positive.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.540
There's an organization
on college campuses

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.140
around the country called United
Students Against Sweatshops,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.500
and they have put pressure
on their universities--

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.600
universities like
Cornell and Brown

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.020
and Wisconsin and
others to make sure

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.820
that they're only buying
their university logo apparel

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.340
and athletic wear
from companies that

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.110
have these kinds of just supply
chain practices in place.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.150
So we can do this, but
it takes a lot of energy,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.940
and a lot of collective effort.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.160
And it has to be done by all
the parties working together.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.810
Companies can't do it alone.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.960
NGOs can't do it alone.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.460
Local governments
can't do it alone.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.190
But if they all work together,
and build a sustained effort

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.520
to improve the
conditions, and then

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.750
produce the data that
makes it all transparent

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.760
for us as consumers, we
can make a difference

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.360
in improving the conditions
of very low wage workers

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.040
in many developing countries.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.390
So I'd like to ask
you two questions.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.940
Apple, our computer
friends, and iPhone friends,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.600
and iPod friends are about
two decades behind Nike.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.960
They have experienced terrible
problems with their contractors

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.490
in China and elsewhere.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.690
You may have heard about
Foxconn with suicides

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.880
of workers frustrated with
terrible working conditions.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.960
If you were to write
to the CEO of Apple,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.550
what should Apple learn
from Nike's experiences?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.230
And then, more
broadly, what can you

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.360
do to hold companies accountable
for their global operations?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.510
How can we take
responsibility for making sure

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.110
that every shirt, every tie,
every sweatshirt that we buy

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.050
is made in a just supply
chain, and keep asking,

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.670
and be willing to pay for
products that are made

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.410
under fair working conditions?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.810
We can do that
individually as consumers,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.130
and we can collectively set
the norms that essentially

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.050
say, to any company, if
you want our business,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.360
then you've got to demonstrate
that you are providing

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.500
safe and healthy working
conditions, and fair wages

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.300
for people wherever they
make these products.
