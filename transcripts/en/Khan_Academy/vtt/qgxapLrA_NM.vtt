00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] What we see here

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.930
is an economy with an output gap.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.320
As you can see, the short
run equilibrium output

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.820
is below our full employment output.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.500
This is sometimes referred to
as a recessionary output gap.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.730
And in other videos, we talk
about how there could be

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.230
a self-adjustment
mechanism in the long run,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.820
that because we are below full employment,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.270
folks who maybe, especially
folks who wanna get a job,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.640
might say, "Hey, I'm willing
to work for less and less."

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.010
And maybe our short run
aggregate supply curve

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.460
shifts down over time

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.560
and we get to a state,
something like this,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.270
and in that case, so this would be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.030
our short run aggregate supply curve two,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.580
and in that case, all of a sudden,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.217
we would be in a long run equilibrium

00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:41.660
where our equilibrium output

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.530
is equal to our full employment output.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.650
But let's say that does not happen.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.300
Let's say we are in a world
where, for some reason,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.790
we stay sticky with
this negative output gap

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.120
and you are the government

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.820
and you wanna do something about it.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.060
You wanna get back to
full employment output.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.130
Well, there's a couple of levers.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.210
You have fiscal policy,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.860
fiscal policy, which is all about changing

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.370
how much you spend, so this
would be government spending.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.340
Let me make it clear.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.160
This is government spending.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.440
Or changing the amount of taxation.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.220
So, the theory is if the
government spends more,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
that would increase total output

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.358
and then the other theory is
if the government taxes less,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.850
there's more money out in the economy

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.170
and that could also increase total output.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.860
And there's also monetary policy,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.040
which we're not gonna go
into detail in this video,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520
but monetary policy is
messing with the money supply.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.200
If maybe there's more money out there,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.690
lower interest rates, it
might increase output,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.800
and then the opposite could
be true the other way.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.680
But we are going to, so
let me just write this.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.040
This is the money supply.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040
Money supply/interest rates.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.320
Interest rates.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.220
And this would be the
business of a central bank.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.970
But we are going to
focus on fiscal policy.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.300
So as a government, what
we want to see happen

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.640
is this aggregate demand
curve shift to the right,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.900
so we want it to get to a place like this.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.820
We want our aggregate demand curve

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.010
to shift to the right just like this,

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.220
so this would be aggregate demand two.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.050
And how do we do that?

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.240
How do we get this shift right over here

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.250
so that we get to our
full employment output?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.240
Well, there's two levers
that we can think about.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.530
As we just said, government
spending and taxation.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.460
Now, a big misconception
is a lot of folks say,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.840
"Well, if I increase spending
by a hundred billion dollars,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.530
"that's equivalent of reducing taxes

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.640
"by a hundred billion dollars

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.210
"because there would be a
hundred billion more dollars

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.750
"out there in the economy
to increase output."

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.270
But you have to be very careful.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.900
Remember what we learned
about multipliers,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.030
and remember, these are
all very simple models,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.400
but a regular multiplier,
let me write it over here,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.600
a regular multiplier,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.420
a regular multiplier is one

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.130
over one minus the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.380
while our tax multiplier,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.340
tax multiplier

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.820
is equal to, so if you
have an increase in taxes,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.420
that would be the negative

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.300
of the marginal propensity to consume

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.100
over one minus the marginal
propensity to consume.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.570
The negative would be
if you increase taxes

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.280
that is going to have a negative
total effect on spending.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.113
And the reason why you have

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:34.170
this marginal propensity
to consume in the numerator

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.360
is if I were to have my taxes reduced

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.870
by, say, a hundred dollars,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.750
depending on my marginal
propensity to consume,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.130
if my marginal propensity to consume

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.350
is less than one, which it typically is,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.390
I'm not gonna spend all
that hundred dollars.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.640
I am going to spend some fraction of it,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.280
really the marginal propensity to consume

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.720
times a hundred dollars.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.970
While if the government
just goes out there

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.058
and spends a hundred dollars,

00:03:54.058 --> 00:03:56.220
well, that hundred dollars got spent.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.583
And to see the impact,
the difference in impact,

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:01.150
let's go through it a little
bit, let's do an example.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.050
Let's say a situation
where the government,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.920
the government just spends $100 billion.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.930
So, the government wants
to spend $100 billion.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.667
What is going to be the impact?

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.090
And let's say we're in a world

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.530
where our marginal propensity
to consume is equal to 0.8.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.150
What is going to be the effect

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.140
on the economy in this
situation right over here?

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.108
Well, in this situation,
you're going to have

00:04:25.108 --> 00:04:27.810
a hundred billion dollars of spending

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.900
times, you're gonna multiply
it times the multiplier,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.220
one over one minus our marginal
propensity to consume, 0.8,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.480
and so this is going to
be equal to $100 billion,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.870
$100 billion

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.790
divided by 0.2.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.320
Well, 0.2 is 1/5, so this is
going to be the same thing

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.020
as dividing by 1/5 or multiplying by five,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.758
so you're going to have
an increase in output

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:58.440
based on this very simple
model of $500 billion.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.500
So, our multiplier here was five.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.730
But let's say we go the other way,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.930
let's say instead, the government decides

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.960
to decrease taxes by a
hundred billion dollars.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.140
So, decrease taxes

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.133
by $100 billion, and we're gonna assume

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:20.090
the exact same marginal
propensity to consume.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.340
Well, in that situation,
what's our tax multiplier?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.830
And we're decreasing taxes,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.392
so that will offset this negative.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:28.840
So, the increase in the economy

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.730
is going to be our hundred billion dollars

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.890
times our marginal
propensity to consume, 0.8,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.170
divided by one minus the
marginal propensity to consume.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.400
Well, this part right over here

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.180
was exactly the same as
what we had over there,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.680
so that's going to be
equal to $500 billion,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.770
this part, times 0.8.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.800
And so, what is that going to be?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.460
Well, that is going to
be equal to $400 billion.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.200
And once again, intuitively,
where did this come from?

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, if the government spends
that hundred billion dollars,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.010
that hundred billion dollars gets spent

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.110
and then you have the marginal
propensity to consume,

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.580
the person or the people who get it

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.370
will then spend 80 billion of that,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.320
and then the people who'd get that

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.260
would spend 64 billion, on and on and on,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.580
so it eventually ends
up being $500 billion.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.100
But with the decrease in
taxes of a hundred billion,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.408
that first hundred billion
doesn't necessarily get spent.

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:27.170
If I get my taxes reduced,
let's say they're all on me,

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.470
by a hundred billion,
I might save some of it

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.280
based on this marginal
propensity to consume.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.290
I might save 20 billion of it

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.890
and spend the other 80 billion,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.790
and so that's why based
on this simplified model,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.826
you might have a lower total
impact right over here.

00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:43.991
So, that's a very important takeaway.

00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:47.700
Fiscal policy, government
spending or taxation,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.210
but based on these models,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.120
you would use a different multiplier,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.790
and so they are not going to
be necessarily equivalent.
