00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's make ourselves a little scratch room and work it out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There are only 1, 2, 3 letters, a, b, and c involved,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so let's take a look at each one by one, see if it fits.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Suppose I was in state 2456 and I saw an a.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I'm in 2 and I see an a I die, 4 and I see an a I die,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
5 and I see an a I die, 6 and I see an a I die.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That's not good.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
2456 on a goes to failure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It does not go to 23.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All right, well, what if I see a b?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If I'm in 2 and I see a b, I go to 3. That looks pretty good.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
4 and I see a b I die.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
5 and I see a b I go to 2.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
6 and I see a b I die.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, b took us to exactly 2 and 3.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
2456 on b went to 2 and 3.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But let's just finish checking up on c just in case we missed something.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm in 2456.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
2 on a c goes nowhere.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
4 on a c goes nowhere.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
5 on a c goes to 6,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and 6 on a c goes nowhere, so 2456

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on a c goes to 6.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Actually, we already have that edge, 2456 on a c goes to 6,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and since this machine is deterministic, we only want 1

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
outgoing edge here labeled c.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It looks like b was our winner.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The label for this edge is b.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, this is not a proof,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but it just so happens that any non-deterministic machine

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
can be converted to a deterministic machine

00:01:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
using exactly the same steps.
