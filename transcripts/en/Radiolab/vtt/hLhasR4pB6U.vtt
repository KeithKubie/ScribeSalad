00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.250
Hey, this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.010
Oh yes. Would you like to say our topic? Robert? Our topic today is goodness,

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.150
niceness, altruism in there. Bigger, fatter word. Yup.

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.370
Thus far we've met a couple of folks,

5
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.790
individuals who have struggled with altruism in some way. No,

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.820
we're going to sort of pull back and go from specifics to grand global

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.730
<v 1>strategy. Yes. Hello. Hello, hello.</v>

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.270
And we're going to tell you a really cool story we think that begins with this

9
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.010
guy. My name is Robert Rod.

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.130
I'm the Walgreen professor for the study of human understanding and the

11
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.330
Department of Political Science and the Ford School of public policy of the

12
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:44.470
University of Michigan.

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.130
I know that's a mouth that was like your dean was like looking over years as

14
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.071
well. You know,

15
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.940
you could just say I'm a professor of public policy and political science or

16
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:55.550
something.

17
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.120
<v 0>Well, but before he was all of that extra rod when he was in high school,</v>

18
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.730
he was one of those guys who just loved computers.

19
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.990
<v 1>Well, yes,</v>

20
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.790
in 59 1960 I hung around the Northwestern university computer center.

21
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.970
59 60 so what were those large pieces of furniture in the building?

22
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.970
They were, in fact, the hall campus had one computer and they,

23
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:19.670
let me use it for 15 minutes here in 15 minutes there.

24
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.140
And what would you do with the, with the computer?

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.970
What I did was I did a very simple computer simulation of hypothetical lifeforms

26
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.850
and environments for a science project. Really? Yeah.

27
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.120
You're a pre geek is what you are. Before the word had been invented,

28
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.100
I can't think you could say that,

29
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.210
but then in 1962 when Axelrod was down on computer baseball,

30
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.330
you got somewhere all over the world.

31
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.090
Everybody else was watching one of the great dramas in modern times.

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.420
<v 2>Good evening, Mike [inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.900
<v 1>unfolding the Cuban missile crisis</v>

34
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.973
<v 2>past week.</v>

35
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.670
Unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.770
missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island

37
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.700
<v 1>and Axelrod. Rod started thinking about the dilemma we were in. Well,</v>

38
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.480
each side wants to spend more money buying missiles and things.

39
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.440
<v 0>You know, we could build more bombs, but then they could build more bombs.</v>

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.190
It would be better if they would both stop. But if we stop and they don't,

41
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.580
that'd be bad. Very bad.

42
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.620
<v 1>Yeah. And so I was interested in what's, uh,</v>

43
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.160
what were the conditions that would allow people to get out of this problem?

44
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.900
And then he starts thinking, well wait,

45
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.430
maybe I could use my computer to help me figure out what's a good strategy for

46
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.710
this, for something like the Cuban missile crisis. Well, yes. Right.

47
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.520
And what made you think that computers could help with that? Well,

48
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.360
I came across a simple game called the prisoners to run the

49
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.360
noise from the window. Okay. So the business

50
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.570
<v 0>dilemma is a very famous thought experiment. It's a little tricky to describe,</v>

51
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.880
but I got a friend of mine, Andrew Zali,

52
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.240
who's written about the prisoner's dilemma and an upcoming book resilience,

53
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:55.020
the Science of why things bounce back. I got him to lay it out for me.

54
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.430
What is the prisoner's dilemma?

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
So imagine that two bank robbers are hanging out across the street from the

56
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.300
first national bank and uh, the police pick them up.

57
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.470
They've received a tip that these two guys are about to rob the bank. Get it.

58
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.710
Yep. So the cops take these two guys back to the station,

59
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.110
do the whole law and order thing, put them in different rooms.

60
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.340
They walk into each one,

61
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.600
let's call them lucky and Joe and they say to lucky,

62
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.720
we have enough to make sure that you go away for a six month sentence.

63
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.150
But this is not really what the cops want.

64
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.520
They want a longer sentence for one of these guys.

65
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.410
And so they make lucky an offer.

66
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.440
If you lucky rat out Joe and Joe doesn't say anything,

67
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.130
you will go free and Joe will go to jail for 10 years.

68
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.670
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.210
<v 0>if the reverse happens, meaning if you say nothing and Joe Rats you out,</v>

70
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.450
you're going to jail for 10 years and he's going to walk free.

71
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.000
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

72
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.140
<v 0>both ended up ratting on each other. You both get five, five years.</v>

73
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240
Whereas if you both keep your mouth shut,

74
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.370
you're each going to jail for six months for loitering.

75
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.310
Just somehow if lucky and Joe could talk to each other,

76
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.470
they both say don't speak. Absolutely.

77
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:12.880
But the big problem that lucky and Joe have is they can't talk to each other.

78
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.720
All right, so you're lucky. Okay. Okay. What do you do?

79
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:20.500
Do you rat Joe out or no. Do I know this guy

80
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.150
at all? I mean you met for this one job,

81
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:29.020
but tomorrow you'll never see him again. Ever. Ever. Well, okay. If I,

82
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.890
if I knew him and I could trust him, then I think I know what I would do.

83
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:34.000
But keep the mouth shut.

84
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.130
I wouldn't get six months cause he'd keep his mouth shut.

85
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.600
It would be a sweet thing indeed. But see, since I don't know. No matter. Well,

86
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.940
what would it happen to? He rats me out. You'd go to jail for 10 years.

87
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.210
He'd go fried bastard. 10 years. Yeah.

88
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.270
But if I read him out in the worst I get is five years or you know,

89
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.840
I go wait free. I'm totally free. Do it. I guess. Say what's in your heart?

90
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:58.030
I'm going to, I'm throwing him under the bus. Yes.

91
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.660
[inaudible] what's his name again? Joe. Joe [inaudible]. He's already gone.

92
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.230
[inaudible] you're dead to me, Joe.

93
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.750
<v 1>So you see in this type of scenario where you don't know the guy,</v>

94
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.410
you have a very strong incentive to wrap the other guy out.

95
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.890
Or as the social scientists would say to defect. That's right.

96
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.680
If you play it only once, if you only meet somebody once,

97
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.940
whatever the other guy does,

98
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:23.640
you're better off defecting against them just to your on out.

99
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.670
Whenever you hear the word defect, no, that it means screw the other guy over.

100
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.420
But the really interesting stuff happens if you play over and over again.

101
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.270
If you get to meet the same people again because now you're thinking,

102
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.840
should I help this guy out the next time? If he screwed me, should I screw him?

103
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.310
<v 2>But the secret swept extraordinary build up of communist missiles.</v>

104
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.310
<v 0>What do you do? You want to cooperate, but you don't want to get screwed,</v>

105
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.470
<v 2>which cannot be accepted by this country. Right, right.</v>

106
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.691
<v 0>You know,</v>

107
00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:51.710
these kinds of thoughts were paramount in those days because the prisoner's

108
00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:54.410
dilemma was being played between the two superpowers.

109
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.040
This is our friend Steve Strogatz, the Cornell mathematician who says at that

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 4>time, well kinds of folks,</v>

111
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.630
political scientists and economists and psychologists,

112
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.140
mathematicians were writing papers about the prisoner's dilemma.

113
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.460
We have to really in thinking, come on,

114
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.490
we've got to be able to win this game if we're going to play against the

115
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.400
Russians and we have to do it. Right. Exactly.

116
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.920
But there was no consensus on the best way to do it.

117
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.820
And so I was interested in what's, uh, what's a good strategy for this?

118
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.660
And that's when Robert Axelrod's sitting down there in the basement somewhere in

119
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.080
the Midwest with the big computer, that's when he had his idea.

120
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.820
His approach, which was really novel at the time,

121
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:36.380
was to conduct a computer tournament. The computer terminal.

122
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.370
Yeah.

123
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.910
Invite the people that had come up with these different ideas to play with each

124
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:44.900
other. In other words, what he said is, uh, all right, Mr DWIs guy. You know,

125
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:47.990
you've written so and so many articles on the prisoner's dilemma.

126
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.220
You think you understand it.

127
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.140
How about joining this tournament where you have to submit a program that will

128
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:58.460
play prisoner's dilemma against program's submitted by the other experts.

129
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.910
And we'll have a round Robin, try these different programs against each other.

130
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:06.550
So all these computer guys are brought to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas and we

131
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.010
had Tuxedos and they all sat down at the table. No, it's a nice image.

132
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:14.270
But what really happened was everyone submitted their programs to axle Rod.

133
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.360
They would mail their entries to leave, but there was a trophy,

134
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.680
there wasn't trophy. So I wrote to people and I said, if you went,

135
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.310
I'll send you a trophy. You know,

136
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.840
little plaque that says you won the computer tournament. Yeah. Okay.

137
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:27.740
So here's the deal.

138
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.690
Every program will play every other program 200 times.

139
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.220
There will be points in each round.

140
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.510
And then actual rod will total the scores and see what actually works by which

141
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:41.480
he means in the long run. Even if you lose some rounds here and there,

142
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.300
one of these strategies is going to beat all the others.

143
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:48.800
Meaning it'll let you survive, maybe even prosper.

144
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.510
That's the game. That's right. And, uh,

145
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.470
can you introduce us to some of the contestants? Yeah.

146
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
So there was one program called massive retaliatory strike and the first move it

147
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:03.710
just cooperates. But then as soon as the other program doesn't cooperate,

148
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.570
it would then retaliate for the rest of the [inaudible].

149
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.593
<v 5>Yes.</v>

150
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.460
<v 4>Sorry man, you blew it and never trust you again. Yeah, that's it for you.</v>

151
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.610
This is like the way my wife is.

152
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.070
Whenever a guy in her earlier life stood her up, that was it. Game over.

153
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.910
But there were also some trickier program.

154
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.210
I mean some crafty ones try to make a model of the opponent,

155
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.120
like you mentioned one that was called Tester. So tester would,

156
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.210
would see what you were like. It would start by being mean.

157
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.400
<v 5>And then</v>

158
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.100
<v 4>if you start retaliating, it backs off and says, you know, Ho chill.</v>

159
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.080
It's okay man. And you know,

160
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:46.630
and then starts cooperating for awhile until it throws in another [inaudible]

161
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.560
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

162
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.580
<v 4>the other guy goes after all it called Tester. Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.960
So test your guys kind of designed to see how much it could get away with.

164
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.010
I mean, it sounds kind sensible in a way.

165
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.750
<v 1>I mean mean, but if you see,</v>

166
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.540
if you think about what happens if these two players play each other,

167
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.500
if tester plays massive retaliation 200 times,

168
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:09.490
pretty soon the tester will defect and then massive retaliation.

169
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.690
<v 6>Yeah. Never cooperate again to you.</v>

170
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.550
Let's go back.

171
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.870
<v 1>Typically I do very badly both of them. When you're sitting there,</v>

172
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.620
did you have a hunch as to which would be the most successful program or I

173
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.770
didn't know and which is why I wanted to do it. Uh, but I did have a, uh,

174
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.100
a hunch that, you know,

175
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.960
thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code would be needed to have a pretty

176
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.250
competent program.

177
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:43.370
So when the mailman delivers the fattest envelope to your house,

178
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.990
do you like this could be the one they have? Well, yes. Right. Um,

179
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.370
now it didn't turn out that way

180
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.930
<v 4>when it was all said and done.</v>

181
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.560
When he loaded all the programs into the computer when they'd all played each

182
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.650
other 200 times the program, that one

183
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.300
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

184
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.410
<v 1>it's really two lines of code. Two lines of code. Yeah. It's got a simple name.</v>

185
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.080
It's called tit for tat first line of code.

186
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.550
<v 4>Be Nice. Nice. Yeah. Nice. Nice.</v>

187
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:13.200
As a technical word in this game,

188
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.580
nice means I never am nasty first.

189
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.790
<v 1>And after that second line of code,</v>

190
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.910
it just does what the other player did on the previous move.

191
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.790
So if the other player has just cooperated, it'll cooperate.

192
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.200
And if the other player has just affected, it'll defect.

193
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.940
<v 4>It retaliates on the next move. Couldn't be clearer. On the other hand,</v>

194
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.170
it only retaliates that one time. I mean, unless provoked further, it does.

195
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:41.890
It's retaliation and now bygones be bygones. And that's it. So, wait,

196
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.900
how exactly did it win? I mean, can you give us a sense of, of why it one? Okay,

197
00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:51.720
so let's suppose I'm here. Let's take an extreme case of, um,

198
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.310
some very simple programs. One of them, I'll call Jesus

199
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.810
for the sake of the name,

200
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.810
the Jesus Program cooperates on every turn that is, it's always, it's always,

201
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.070
you know, good. Yes. So the Jesus program is a simple algorithm that says,

202
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.980
always be good. Good, good, good, good, good. That's right.

203
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:19.270
And let's say the other program is the Lucifer program, which um,

204
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.340
no matter what, always [inaudible] is bad. Okay? These are your two extremes.

205
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.091
CST from, of course,

206
00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:27.550
most programs and those people fall somewhere in the middle,

207
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.480
right there in tit for tat. You've got a strategy that can swing both ways.

208
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.480
For instance, with Jesus, tit for tat starts by cooperating,

209
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.723
asked us Jesus,

210
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.270
<v 7>oh,</v>

211
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.830
<v 4>and then they're going to keep cooperating</v>

212
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.600
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

213
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.660
<v 4>for the whole 200 round, which is, you know, good.</v>

214
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.230
But now let's suppose it plays Lucifer where there's no chance to cooperate.

215
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.140
Then says Steve Tit for tat just plays good defense.

216
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:54.160
So when Lucifer does his thing, TIF

217
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.263
<v 1>atop retaliate,</v>

218
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.490
pretty much keep doing that and stay even. So in other words,

219
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.820
<v 4>it's, it's, it's a very robust program. It elicits cooperation.</v>

220
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.940
If the opponent has any inclination to cooperate,

221
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.020
but it doesn't take any guff and it wins. So you might say,

222
00:12:14.021 --> 00:12:17.890
in evolutionary terms, this program is the fittest.

223
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.390
So actually axle rod played an evolutionary version of his tournament. That is,

224
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:25.000
he had these programs after they played their tournament,

225
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.350
get a chance to reproduce copies of themselves according to how well they did.

226
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.660
You mean the winners who get to have more babies? Yeah.

227
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.360
And then with the babies play each other. Yeah, he ran them again.

228
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.040
I mean he ran them for many generations.

229
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:41.041
And so like suppose you have a world of Lucifer's and there are a few tit for

230
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:44.470
tat players out there. Can they thrive?

231
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:47.410
Can cooperation emerge in this horribly hostile world?

232
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.460
I would an interesting question.

233
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:51.820
So he looked at that and the answer was if you have enough of them so that they

234
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:55.570
have enough chance of meeting each other and they can actually invade and take

235
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.910
over the world, even if the world starts horribly mean.

236
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.160
<v 0>I mean, what would I take to be the big message though?</v>

237
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.620
I mean what always sent chills down my spine

238
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.460
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

239
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.220
<v 0>which is that we see this version of morality around the world.</v>

240
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.300
Yeah. Be Upright. Forgiving but retaliatory.

241
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.880
I mean that sounds to me like the Old Testament. No,

242
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.100
it's not turn the other cheek. It's an eye for an eye.

243
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:30.260
But not 10 eyes for an eye and to think that it's not something that's handed

244
00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:34.490
down by our teachers or by God, but that it's something that came from biology.

245
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.420
<v 5>I liked that</v>

246
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.380
<v 4>argument personally.</v>

247
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:43.900
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

248
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.320
<v 1>oh, from biology. Now,</v>

249
00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:51.321
do we know whether the math has anything to do with real people in real life

250
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:56.070
situations or are we just abstracting behavior?

251
00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.290
Is this wise or is this just math?

252
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.840
<v 4>This, this is what's so impressive to me about Axel Rod's work.</v>

253
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:05.530
So he's not just playing math games. He,

254
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.740
he tries to tie this to history and politics as scene.

255
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.390
<v 1>I like to scan journals. What am I happy to say? It's past Angus.</v>

256
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.510
It's part of my profession.

257
00:14:14.511 --> 00:14:19.511
But I came across a book called the live and let live system in world war one.

258
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.390
So here's where we jump away from the math and the computer tournaments and into

259
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:25.160
something very real.

260
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.880
The word began late in July,

261
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.600
1914 that stand the only wine trail expert in world war one. Evan Pugh,

262
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:36.500
professor emeritus at Penn state mystery. That stands going to help us tell.

263
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.900
It takes place on what was called the western front,

264
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.040
which was basically these two lines of trenches, very close to each other,

265
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.170
a few hundred yards apart,

266
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.380
and they stretch for hundreds of miles and that fall in November,

267
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.130
the weather turned bad, heavy rains.

268
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.050
<v 0>Then it became IC</v>

269
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.830
<v 8>and then slush and then snow.</v>

270
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.470
It became disgusting because the trenches also were filled with rats,

271
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.600
rats, the rats when after not only the food but after corpses,

272
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.650
<v 9>and it was oddly in this miserable,</v>

273
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:14.920
disgusting hell hole that something quite amazing happened.

274
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.910
No one quite knows how it started, but one day, maybe you're on daybreak,

275
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.330
let's say while the two sides were fighting some of the [inaudible],

276
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.350
<v 0>British soldiers stopped firing long enough to have breakfast</v>

277
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.400
<v 9>and as they're eating they noticed, hm, the German stuff too,</v>

278
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.280
to have their breakfast. When they're both done,

279
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.120
they'd begin firing again next morning. Same thing.

280
00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:40.490
British take their breakfast break at about the same time.

281
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.280
The Germans do the same thing morning after that,

282
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:46.220
the same thing and then the next and after a while

283
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.910
<v 1>both sides caught on. Now, if they didn't interrupt the other one,</v>

284
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.260
then they wouldn't be interrupted.

285
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.120
<v 9>On the whole, there is silence.</v>

286
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.280
This is from a letter. British soldiers sent home to his wife at the time.

287
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.640
After all, if you prevent your enemy from drawing his rations,

288
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.300
his remedy is simple. He will prevent you from drawing yours.

289
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.130
When Axlerod read this,

290
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.840
<v 1>I thought, gee, this sounds very familiar.</v>

291
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.290
<v 9>Line one, if tit for tat be nice first.</v>

292
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.260
Now the Brits probably didn't mean to be nice first when they started the

293
00:16:20.261 --> 00:16:23.740
breakfast truce, but it happened and then the Germans reciprocated,

294
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:24.663
which is line two.

295
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.680
Now keep in mind these two sides are at war and implicit in line two is a

296
00:16:29.681 --> 00:16:32.500
threat. You mess with me, I'm going to mess with you.

297
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.620
<v 1>Well, think about snipers for example.</v>

298
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.950
So there's letters where they a explained where the snipers would shoot at a

299
00:16:37.951 --> 00:16:41.700
tree over and over and over again showing that in fact they were really

300
00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:44.880
accurate. Meaning that if they wanted to kill you, they'd get you.

301
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.700
<v 9>And this was going on during the breakfast truce and these little agreements,</v>

302
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.460
you know, like, I'm going to be nice to you, but I could kick your ass.

303
00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:52.300
Don't forget. Well,

304
00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:57.010
these little truces spread all up and down the western front until things really

305
00:16:57.011 --> 00:16:59.740
changed. Fast forward to December,

306
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.380
<v 0>Christmas Eve, the climate was just about freezing on Christmas Eve.</v>

307
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.420
And the Germans had a tradition of a tabletop, Christmas trees,

308
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.460
small trees for weeks.

309
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:13.970
He said the German government had been shipping small trees literally to the

310
00:17:13.971 --> 00:17:16.250
trenches, hundreds and hundreds of trees.

311
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.320
And that night on Christmas Eve at dusk,

312
00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:20.270
the Germans began putting up their trees,

313
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.350
mounted them on the rim in their trench and lit candles on them singing

314
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.263
Christmas carols.

315
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.083
<v 5>Uh,</v>

316
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.580
<v 0>the British who might've been no more than 50 or 70 yards away,</v>

317
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.290
crawled forward and to no man's land to see better. And then they responded.

318
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.070
Here's a letter from a German soldier sent home to his family,

319
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.600
which describes what happened next.

320
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.870
I shouted to our enemies that we didn't wish to shoot.

321
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.980
I said we could speak

322
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.760
<v 1>to each other. At first there was silence.</v>

323
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.380
And then very slowly out of the darkness the British guys approached and so we

324
00:17:58.381 --> 00:18:02.250
came together and shook hands. This is, see,

325
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:05.070
this is where I start to think, uh, are you making this up?

326
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:08.040
Because this is where it starts to sound sort of crazy to me.

327
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.780
That's a pat Walters, our producer.

328
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.430
It sounds as if this was being made up and the result was for many decades,

329
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.850
people assumed that this was just myth that couldn't possibly have happened,

330
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.400
but we know it had happened because we have the letters that the British and the

331
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.780
German sent back home. We know that they met in darkness and decided,

332
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.120
why don't we have a truth? In the morning,

333
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.280
<v 9>next morning, thousands of soldiers put down their rifles,</v>

334
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:38.540
climbed out of their trenches into no man's land and started hanging out with

335
00:18:38.541 --> 00:18:39.020
each other.

336
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.680
A lot of us went over and talked to them and this lasted the whole morning.

337
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.580
I [inaudible]

338
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.310
<v 0>to several of them and I must say they seemed extraordinarily fine.</v>

339
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:51.110
Men soldiers got together, started fires, Cook Christmas dinners,

340
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.390
swapped precedence, and drank.

341
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.840
The Germans hauled out these enormous IROs and beer. They traded stuff,

342
00:18:56.841 --> 00:18:59.360
cigars and trinkets even help one another.

343
00:18:59.361 --> 00:19:02.990
Very the dead and in some places on the western front.

344
00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:06.950
This period of goodwill lasted a whole week,

345
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.650
<v 9>but then the general's found out, yeah,</v>

346
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.440
<v 1>they were very angry about this and he said,</v>

347
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.440
if we didn't send you to the front to to be nice to the other guys,

348
00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:19.270
we sent him to kill him. If the general says, Hey,

349
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.770
I want you to shoot those Germans, that's an order,

350
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.680
well then they wouldn't that, oh gee, sorry. Generally I missed,

351
00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:29.620
but I'll try again better next time. I see the way the general is fine.

352
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:33.310
They figured out how to disrupt this whole thing as they would said, okay,

353
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.170
you guys go out on a raid and I want you to bring back a prisoner or a corpse.

354
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.190
In other words,

355
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.450
show me a scalp that's in order and that messed things up or royally

356
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.620
[inaudible].

357
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.340
<v 9>Here's a letter from a British soldier whose unit contained a band which was</v>

358
00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:49.210
apparently pretty common.

359
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.800
He writes this letter about one of the moments when the truce vanished.

360
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:57.760
At six minutes to midnight, the band open with the voc Tom Ryan,

361
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.800
which is a German patriotic anthem. So some of the Germans,

362
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.551
according to this letter,

363
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:09.480
climbed up onto the rim of their trench to listen to this English band playing

364
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.373
their song.

365
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:14.990
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

366
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.240
<v 9>then there's the last note sound. Yeah.</v>

367
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.580
Every grenade firing rifle,

368
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.610
trench mortar and bomb throwing machine let fly simultaneously into the German

369
00:20:26.921 --> 00:20:27.754
trench.

370
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.210
So you can imagine the Germans that weren't killed would have felt betrayed.

371
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.140
They had just been hanging out with these guys and the next night they would

372
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:40.350
have attacked back and the British would have attacked them back and then the

373
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:43.880
Germans would have retaliated against them and on and on and on,

374
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.820
<v 1>and it would kind of echo back and forth forever. And that's what happened.</v>

375
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.430
There were immense casualties,

376
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.360
<v 4>uh, uh, as many as 50,000 casualties in a day.</v>

377
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.830
<v 1>And this says Axelrod is where you see sort of the dark side of different tech.</v>

378
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.110
What are the weaknesses of the tit for tat strategy?

379
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:01.720
Or one of the problems with it is these echoes,

380
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.800
not just that goes of good obviously, but echoes of violence could get bad.

381
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:10.801
So what I found though was that instead of playing pure tit for tat where you

382
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:14.290
always defect if the other guy defects, there are certain circumstances,

383
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:18.220
he says this I find completely fascinating where you want to modify that second

384
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:20.890
line of code so that you're not always retaliating,

385
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.890
you're nearly always retaliated, right?

386
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.470
If you were a little bit generous,

387
00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.590
which by which I mean say 10% of the time you don't effect,

388
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.870
then what happens is that these echoes will stop and I would call that generous

389
00:21:34.871 --> 00:21:35.704
tit for tat.

390
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.010
<v 4>So this is kind of interesting like we started with Moses, you know,</v>

391
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:43.500
eye for an eye, but you were saying maybe for every nine parts Moses,

392
00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:47.400
you need one part. Jesus meaning like turning the other turn the other cheek.

393
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.480
It sounds like you've described like a cooking recipe or something like nine

394
00:21:51.481 --> 00:21:54.720
parts. Once you have attracted it, it's kind of a recipe.

395
00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:58.530
It's a recipe for life, but it isn't a recipe that ignores the deep fact of it.

396
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:02.370
Look, if I were punching you in the face right now, what are you going to do?

397
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.150
I'm gonna Punch you back. Yeah, and I'm going to punch you back.

398
00:22:05.151 --> 00:22:06.410
You Punch me back on where you back.

399
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.560
Then we're in pain and somehow in the middle of being blasted by my powerful

400
00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:15.320
fist, you have to come up with the moral courage to say,

401
00:22:15.321 --> 00:22:19.010
I think I'm going to kiss this guy now, and that is not he as you well know.

402
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.940
That is not an easy thing to do. All right, but you, you making it all personal.

403
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:25.460
My point is if you zoom out,

404
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.360
this is a strategies that just seems to be woven into the fabric of the cosmos.

405
00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.220
It works for computers, it works for people. It probably works for Amoeba. Okay.

406
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.480
It just works. And you think that exists on some higher plane? I do. I do.

407
00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.470
I don't. I think this is still, as you just called it, very personal.

408
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:47.150
I think a person has to choose to be kind and make that choice.

409
00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:49.370
Right now and then, okay. You don't know. You're irritating me.

410
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.770
I'm going to say to you, Robert, you look very nice today.

411
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.820
You know what I'm going to do to you?

412
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.790
<v 0>All right. Well, enough of this radiolab.org is our online home.</v>

413
00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:03.410
You can read lots of stuff there and you can subscribe to our podcast. It's ww.

414
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.500
It's implied. Yeah.
