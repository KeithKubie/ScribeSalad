JANET CONRAD: I would love
to try to teach physics

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.610
to first- to third-graders
using no equations,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.560
only using examples and only
using little experiments

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.240
because there is just
an enormous amount

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.089
that you can learn by
looking at what is happening.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.630
And one of the big concerns that
I have about the way physics

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.340
is taught is that we love to
go into all of the mathematics.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400
And I actually think
that people end up

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.962
divorced from what's going
on in the real world.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:39.170
They start to understand
the mathematics really well,

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.586
but they actually
don't understand

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:42.170
the physical phenomena.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.540
And physics is a contact sport.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.690
You have to play with it, right?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.730
You will not understand
angular momentum

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.280
until you have been spinning
around and pull your arms in

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.181
and suddenly you
go out of control.

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:54.680
You know?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.920
It's those things that
you have to try in order

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.630
to really understand it.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.069
And I believe that we can start
doing that at a very young age.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.610
And the problem, of
course, is resources.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.090
You need real resources
to be able to teach kids

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.650
things like that.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.220
But right now, I can
teach a very small child

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.930
one of Maxwell's equations.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.460
I can show you how we do it.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.250
This is the one which says that
a moving magnetic field induces

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.360
current and also, currents
induce magnetic fields.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.140
OK?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.530
So what I have here is a
very heavy piece of copper.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.450
It's actually a beam
pipe from ferry lab.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.340
It's a pretty
thick piece, right?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.630
And so it's copper, so
current can flow through it.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.580
And I have here a magnet.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.150
And I can drop my magnet in
and it takes a really long time

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.340
for the magnet to fall out.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.390
And you can show this
to a two-year-old

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.730
and they will just
watch that forever.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.370
They are so excited to see that
because they know something

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.620
is very seriously wrong here.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.050
And what's happening is the
magnet is inducing a current,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.710
and a current is inducing
a magnetic force opposite

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.860
of that magnetic field.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.280
And it's preventing this
thing from falling as fast

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.420
as it would.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.609
And, you know,
second-graders will get this.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.400
And then when they
finally get to the point

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.520
where we do it with the math,
then they'll really get it.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.666
So that's what I
think we need to do.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.940
That's for my long-term goal.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.135
