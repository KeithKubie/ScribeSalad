which will be enforced so that it can
 

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:56.140
which will be enforced so that it can
withstand shakes and it's very easy to

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.150
withstand shakes and it's very easy to
 

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.070
withstand shakes and it's very easy to
say that the code has to be designed and

then you know the system of inspection

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:03.620
then you know the system of inspection
 

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.140
then you know the system of inspection
and enforcement has to work and that

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.150
and enforcement has to work and that
 

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.310
and enforcement has to work and that
that's not going to be easy but it's

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:06.320
that's not going to be easy but it's
 

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.840
that's not going to be easy but it's
pretty basic there's no point building

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:07.850

back what was there that's not at the
 

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:10.990
back what was there that's not at the
essence of building back better so

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000
essence of building back better so
 

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.100

sector role is very important going

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.470
sector role is very important going
 

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.170

forward I mean clearly there's going to

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:41.180
forward I mean clearly there's going to
 

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.140
forward I mean clearly there's going to
be a lot of a lot of work for private

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:44.150
be a lot of a lot of work for private

all those three points that you access

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800
all those three points that you access
 

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.980
all those three points that you access
to education financial resources and

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:42.990

government but probably they can should

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500
government but probably they can should
 

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.750
government but probably they can should
be given access to understanding why

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760
be given access to understanding why
 

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.060

involving women and giving that access

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:53.070
involving women and giving that access
 

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:58.310
involving women and giving that access
to women would be more beautiful for

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:58.320
to women would be more beautiful for
 

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.210
to women would be more beautiful for
everybody and in that case probably we

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220
everybody and in that case probably we
 

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.480
everybody and in that case probably we
can avoid this notion of the guy who is

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:05.490
can avoid this notion of the guy who is
 

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.430

he probably start to understand it's not

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:12.450
he probably start to understand it's not
 

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:16.910
he probably start to understand it's not
part of life and my so the question is

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920
part of life and my so the question is
 

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:22.270
part of life and my so the question is
should we also involve men in all this

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280
 
 

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.400
 
adventure or or not I mean how we should

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:25.410
adventure or or not I mean how we should
 

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.860
adventure or or not I mean how we should
deal with that and the second equation

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:27.870
deal with that and the second equation
 

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:31.090
deal with that and the second equation
is on Heidi Heidi has proved that

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:31.100

this notion of international aid and
still Heidi IIT is one of the most

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:49.830
still Heidi IIT is one of the most
 

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.320
still Heidi IIT is one of the most
poorest countries in the world it's

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:51.330
poorest countries in the world it's
 

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:55.610

maternal mortality hasn't been improved
 

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.320
maternal mortality hasn't been improved
very much I mean it's almost the same

very much I mean it's almost the same
 

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:05.330
very much I mean it's almost the same
thing and it should we start thinking to

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:05.340
thing and it should we start thinking to
 

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.650
thing and it should we start thinking to
work some in different ways so that

00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:08.660
work some in different ways so that
 

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.570
work some in different ways so that
after this that the IET can be improved

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:11.580
after this that the IET can be improved

I mean this fragility of the state which

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.090
I mean this fragility of the state which

I mean this fragility of the state which
was always there and we were always

them thank you well look on the to the

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180
them thank you well look on the to the
 

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.550
them thank you well look on the to the
two questions yes of course the support

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:31.560
two questions yes of course the support
 

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.530
two questions yes of course the support
of men and boys is absolutely critical

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540
of men and boys is absolutely critical
 

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:36.200
of men and boys is absolutely critical
to getting the changes for women if you

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:36.210
to getting the changes for women if you
 

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.240
to getting the changes for women if you
don't have that support you're not going

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:38.250
don't have that support you're not going
 

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.850
don't have that support you're not going
to be able to make the changes so men

00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:40.860
to be able to make the changes so men
 

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.950
to be able to make the changes so men
men have to be involved and hopefully in

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960
men have to be involved and hopefully in
 

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:49.340
men have to be involved and hopefully in
a positive way secondly on doing things

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:49.350
a positive way secondly on doing things
 

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:53.600
a positive way secondly on doing things
differently within and with Haiti I

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:53.610
differently within and with Haiti I
 

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:59.420
differently within and with Haiti I
think inherent in this approach after

00:59:59.420 --> 00:59:59.430
think inherent in this approach after
 

00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:02.750
think inherent in this approach after
this disaster there's a recognition that

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760
this disaster there's a recognition that
 

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.990
this disaster there's a recognition that
there needs to be support for more

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000
there needs to be support for more
 

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.150
there needs to be support for more
decentralized government that para needs

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160
decentralized government that para needs
 

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.560
decentralized government that para needs
to be pushed out from port-au-prince

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:09.570
to be pushed out from port-au-prince
 

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.350
to be pushed out from port-au-prince
that the economy needs to be more

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:12.360
that the economy needs to be more
 

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.970
that the economy needs to be more
decentralized I think you'll find that

01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980
decentralized I think you'll find that
 

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.370
decentralized I think you'll find that
coming through is quite a strong theme

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:16.380
coming through is quite a strong theme
 

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.620
coming through is quite a strong theme

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:19.640
my understanding as it's been a country
where the capital has been pretty

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:19.650
where the capital has been pretty
 

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.250
where the capital has been pretty
dominant the government's be weak but

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.260
dominant the government's be weak but
 

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.440
dominant the government's be weak but
the Capitals been dominant and sucked in

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:24.450
the Capitals been dominant and sucked in
 

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:27.140
the Capitals been dominant and sucked in
people and and to resources resources to

the extent there's been resources so I

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:28.860
the extent there's been resources so I
 

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.830
the extent there's been resources so I
think you see a more more decentralized

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:30.840
think you see a more more decentralized
 

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.770
think you see a more more decentralized
approach but it is going to be very

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780
approach but it is going to be very
 

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.860
approach but it is going to be very
important to support government having

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:36.870
important to support government having
 

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:40.610

in a sense that's a comparative
 

01:17:08.869 --> 01:17:10.839
in a sense that's a comparative
advantage in itself because we have a

01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:10.849
advantage in itself because we have a
 

01:17:10.849 --> 01:17:13.060

leadership role from being the big
 

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:27.310
leadership role from being the big
agency but more than that undp formally

wondering if you could expand a wee bit

01:26:37.170 --> 01:26:37.180
wondering if you could expand a wee bit
 

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.630

on the role of decentralization that you

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:39.640
on the role of decentralization that you
 

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:42.240
on the role of decentralization that you
mentioned earlier in bringing decision

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:42.250

making to the localized level and

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:43.810
making to the localized level and
 

01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:45.900
making to the localized level and
hopefully incorporating more women in

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:45.910
hopefully incorporating more women in
 

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:47.850
hopefully incorporating more women in
that process and then like you you know

01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:47.860
that process and then like you you know
 

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.710
that process and then like you you know
ideally an outcome being that you would

01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:49.720
ideally an outcome being that you would
 

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:54.450
ideally an outcome being that you would
have improved the situation across any

have improved the situation across any
 

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.060
have improved the situation across any
any social policy area for example so I

think you make a very important point

01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:09.340
think you make a very important point
 

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:11.820
think you make a very important point
that often the entry point for women and

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:11.830
that often the entry point for women and
 

01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:13.980
that often the entry point for women and
decision making is precisely at the

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:13.990
decision making is precisely at the
 

01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:16.080
decision making is precisely at the
local level and of a look at my own

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:16.090
local level and of a look at my own
 

01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:19.890
local level and of a look at my own
country's experience women were starting

01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:19.900
country's experience women were starting
 

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:22.470
country's experience women were starting
to enter local government in significant

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480
to enter local government in significant
 

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.000
to enter local government in significant
numbers long before they got into the

numbers long before they got into the
 

01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:27.300
numbers long before they got into the
Parliament and significant numbers so it

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:27.310
Parliament and significant numbers so it
 

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:30.060
Parliament and significant numbers so it
it was a training ground for some woman

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:30.070
it was a training ground for some woman
 

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:32.340
it was a training ground for some woman
who went on but it was also I suppose

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:32.350
who went on but it was also I suppose
 

01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:34.560

the fact that women were in local

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:34.570

government mainstream women's
 

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.190
government mainstream women's
participation so then there are

01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:38.200
participation so then there are
 

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.930
participation so then there are
expectations that women can do it at

01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:39.940
expectations that women can do it at
 

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:44.160
expectations that women can do it at
other at other levels as as well and so

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:44.170
other at other levels as as well and so
 

01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:46.680
other at other levels as as well and so
I think in principle the process of

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:46.690
I think in principle the process of
 

01:27:46.690 --> 01:27:50.580
I think in principle the process of
decentralization of you know greater

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:50.590
