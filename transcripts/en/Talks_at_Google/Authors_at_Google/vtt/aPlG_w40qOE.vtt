MATT: Hello, everybody, and
welcome to this talk at Google

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.260
sponsored by [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.850
I'm delighted and very grateful
to have Dr. Ronald Siegel here

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.340
to talk to us today
about mindfulneess

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.370
and how mindfulness
practice can help

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.480
us cope with everyday problems.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.180
So before he gets up here,
let me give you a little bit

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.960
of background on him.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
He is an assistant
professor of psychology

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.470
part-time at Harvard
Medical School,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.960
where he's taught
for over 30 years.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.220
He is a longtime student
of mindfulness meditation

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.650
and serves on the board
of directors and faculty

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.470
of the Institute for
Meditation and Psychotherapy.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.960
He teaches internationally
about the application

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.990
of mindfulness practice in
psychotherapy and other fields

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.430
and maintains a private
clinical practice

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580
in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.720
He is the co-editor of the
critically acclaimed text,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.980
"Mindfulness and
Psychotherapy, Second Edition,"

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.500
the co-editor of "Wisdom and
Compassion in Psychotherapy--

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.330
Deepening Mindfulness
in Clinical Practice,"

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.420
which contains a foreword by
His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.790
He is the author of a book
for a more general audience,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.120
"The Mindfulness Solution--
Everyday Practice for Everyday

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.010
Problems," which I believe
will be on sale in here

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.480
at a discounted
rate to Googlers.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.380
He recently created a
comprehensive new course

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.450
for the general public, which
is part of the Great Courses

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.675
series named The
Science of Mindfulness--

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.130
A Research-Based
Path to Well-Being,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.120
which gets my personal
recommendation.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.550
I've recently completed
that, and it's fantastic.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.640
And he is also a
regular contributor

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.990
to other professional
publications

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.950
and is the co-director of the
Annual Harvard Medical School

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.390
Conference on meditation
and psychotherapy.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.290
So without further
ado, please join me

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.838
in welcoming Dr. Siegel on set.

00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:08.121
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.870
RON SIEGEL: Welcome, everybody.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.067
Thank you, Matt, for inviting
me and for everybody else

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.150
at Google for inviting me.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.730
Thank you for coming
here in person and those

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.200
of you who have come virtually.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.880
Usually, we don't choose
to attend a talk like this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.780
when we've just fallen
in love, won the lottery,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.560
and gotten a promotion.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.430
Rather, we get interested
in these topics

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.440
either when we've had some kind
of a downturn in our lives,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.040
or maybe our lights are
going OK on the outside,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.920
but for whatever
reason, we're feeling

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.670
some degree of emotional
distress or difficulty.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.920
And it turns out
that in recent years,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.240
neurobiologists, clinical
researchers, and mental health

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.350
professionals have
discovered that a number

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.850
of ancient practices,
mindfulness practice that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.860
have been refined over the
last 2,500 years or so,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.980
turned out to be extremely
useful for helping us to work

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.680
with all sorts of everyday
emotional difficulties,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.030
everything from
anxiety and depression

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.440
to serious difficulties
like chronic pain

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.499
or, perhaps,
relational conflict.

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.790
And in a few minutes, I'm
going to teach you about some

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.900
of those practices
and show you how you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.540
can use them in your own life.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.010
But in order to use
those effectively,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.700
it's very, very helpful
to have a sense of,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.650
how come life is so
difficult for all of us

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.920
in the first place?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.240
Well, it turns out
that we didn't actually

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.950
evolve to be happy.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.490
Our brains developed
primarily as organs

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.530
of survival, the same
way the other organs

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.630
in the body developed.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.710
And to understand this,
it's helpful to look back

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.259
at our past, and let's
start by looking at Lucy.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.800
This is an artist's conception
of our great great great great

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.750
great great great great great
great et cetera grandmother.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.127
And she was hanging around
on the African Savannah

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:56.710
somewhere between three and 1/2
and four and 1/2 million years

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.209
ago.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.040
There may be an earlier
common ancestor.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.540
We're not sure.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.450
And we know that she survived,
because we've got her DNA.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.310
But how did she possibly
survive out there competing

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.920
with the other wildlife?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.321
Imagine here coming face
to face with a lion?

00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:12.070
What could she do?

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.280
Well, she could grit her
teeth and bear her claws,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.240
[GROWLING NOISE]
but that probably

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.790
wouldn't be too effective.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.079
She might try to rely on
her hide for protection,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.940
but that's pretty limited.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.330
Her fur was sillier still.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.265
She wasn't very fast.

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:28.890
One of the first
things that you learn,

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.080
if you ever go on a
walking safari in Africa,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.730
and there's a couple
of guides usually,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.900
and they've got big guns.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.950
And they say to the tourists,
please, please, please,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.310
no matter what happens,
just don't run.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.830
Why?

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.770
Because everything scary out
there is faster than you are.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.170
You see that half
blind hippopotamus--

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.470
I mean that half blind
rhinoceros behind those trees?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.380
38 miles an hour.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.450
That big lumbering
hippopotamus in the mud

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.460
puddle-- 42 miles an hour.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.790
And furthermore, if you run,
everything that's a predator

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.310
is going to think you're prey,
and it'll make matters worse.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.320
So she couldn't escape.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.980
She had reasonable
sight-- not as

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.820
good as an eagle or a giraffe,
but better than the rhino.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.330
Reasonable hearing.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.520
A lousy sense of smell.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.970
Just ask your dog.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.130
How does she possibly make it?

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.150
Well, she basically had a
few things going for her.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.040
She had a fight or
flight system that

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.390
was capable of
emergency response,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.070
and this was inherited
first from reptiles

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.610
and refined more by mammals.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.460
And she also had, on top of
that, a prehensile thumb,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.810
an opposable thumb
that could pick up

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.216
objects, which was really,
really good for using tools.

00:05:36.216 --> 00:05:38.340
And if you've ever seen
your dog try to use a tool,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.930
you understand how useful
it is to have a thumb.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.660
And the other thing
that she had was she

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.600
had a capacity for thinking--
for thinking about the past,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.900
analyzing what had happened, and
projecting it into the future.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.580
And it's this third capacity
that helped her enormously

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.340
and also gets us into
a lot of trouble,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.360
because it turns out
with this ability

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.600
to analyze the past
for pleasure and pain,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.790
and try to maximize
future pleasure,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.450
and avoid future pain, isn't
some kind of neutral computing

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.700
apparatus.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.320
It's actually
subject to something

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.620
called the negativity bias.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.146
This is how cognitive
scientists refer to it.

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.020
If you think of Lucy's
predicament out there,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.100
she could've made one
of two kinds of errors,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.000
and we could think
of these as a type 1

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.600
and a type 2 error, kind of
analogous to the same kind

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.160
of errors that we use
in scientific research.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.870
She could've looked at a bush
with a beige shape behind it,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.830
and think, oh, my god, it's
a lion, when it was really

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.284
just a beige rock.

00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:37.950
Or she could've looked
at the same shape

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.510
and said, eh, it's a beige
rock, when it was really a lion.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.970
Now Lucy could have made
thousands of type 1 errors

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.010
and still lived to
propagate her DNA,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.730
but if she made just
one type 2 error, that's

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.110
the end of her DNA line.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.650
So we developed minds and
brains that are really, really

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.600
good at these type 1 errors.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.780
Our minds, as my friend
Rick Hansen puts it,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.880
are like Velcro
for bad experiences

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.830
and Teflon for good ones.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.440
Anything bad that happens
in our life sticks.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.140
The good ones slide
right off the pan.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.730
If you meet with your
boss for a review,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.590
and you hear about nine things
that you're doing great,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.616
and your boss tells you about
one area of insufficiency,

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:19.990
what are you going to think
about at 3:00 in the morning?

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.252
It's not the nine things
that you're doing so well.

00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:23.960
And there are countless
examples of this.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.910
Even other animals do it.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.000
If you run a rat through a
maze, and at the end of a given

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.110
pathway, give it some food, it's
got to go through that trial

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.310
several times to
learn the pathway.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.970
If at the end, you give it
an electric shock, one trial

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.100
learning, that's all it
needs, and it remembers this.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.920
Even in couples,
there are people--

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.570
there's a couple
of psychologists

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.600
by the last name of Gottman
in the Seattle area,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.070
and they study couples.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.220
And they find that
on average, we

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.560
need five warm and fuzzy
interactions with a partner

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.230
to undo the loss of trust
that comes from one fight.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.550
So the mind has this very
strong negativity bias.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.536
We can try a little experiment
here just to test this out.

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:08.160
It may-- we'll see
how this works given

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.860
the current political climate.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.280
But I'm going to
say two words, and I

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.470
want you to notice the
very first words that

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.970
come to your mind after
I say those two words.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:17.920
Ready?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.204
Here are the two
words-- Bill Clinton.

00:08:21.204 --> 00:08:21.870
What do you get?

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.030
What came to mind?

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.280
Don't be shy.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.420
What?

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.190
AUDIENCE: Scandal.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.023
RON SIEGEL: Scandal.

00:08:31.023 --> 00:08:33.150
Anybody get Monica, for example?

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.650
Yes.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.360
Blue dress.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.860
Scandal.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:35.794
Something like that.

00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:37.669
That's still what comes
to many of our minds,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.690
even though, obviously,
his wife is running

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.490
for office at the moment.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.551
Now whatever you think of
his presidency or politics,

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.050
I mean, he helped resolve the
conflicts in Northern Ireland.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.460
It was a period of prosperity.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.530
The fact that what we remember
from this is Monica Lewinsky

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.490
shows you how easy it is
for the negativity bias

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.880
to grab hold of something.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.970
Scandals stick.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.680
Loss of trust sticks.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.870
Bad experiences stick.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.800
It gets worse.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.590
It turns out that life is
difficult for everybody,

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.250
in part, because we have
trouble with change.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.214
This starts very, very early.

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:17.630
I don't want to
give up my diapers

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.860
and start to use the potty.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.264
The current arrangement
suits me just fine.

00:09:22.264 --> 00:09:22.930
Are you kidding?

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.810
School with all those strange
people and that weird person

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.602
called the teacher?

00:09:26.602 --> 00:09:27.435
I'm not going there.

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:28.980
I want to stay home
with mom and dad.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.188
Now maybe there's some
excitement about these things,

00:09:31.188 --> 00:09:32.994
but there's often a
lot of reluctance.

00:09:32.994 --> 00:09:34.410
I remember, I have
twin daughters.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.800
They're actually my strongest
meditation teachers.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.424
And I remember when
they were born,

00:09:41.424 --> 00:09:43.840
and we thought, well, we've
got to do something practical.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.411
I'd better give up my Toyota
Corolla and get a minivan.

00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:47.660
I didn't think it was so cool.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.590
I wasn't embracing the change.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.020
18 years later, they're
ready to go off to college,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.430
and I went into mourning.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.590
I thought, now after
18 years of trying

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.200
to form a good
relationship with them

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.870
and be a caring,
loving dad, they're

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.630
going to abandon me like
other girls did when I was 18?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.354
Who wrote this script?

00:10:03.354 --> 00:10:05.270
My wife, luckily, has a
little bit more wisdom

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.494
about these matters than
I did, and she points out,

00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:09.660
had they been so impaired
that they couldn't go off,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.040
I'd even more upset.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.080
But change is hard.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.210
And as I projected forward, I'm
getting to be an old guy now,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.634
and imagined entering
assisted living,

00:10:18.634 --> 00:10:20.050
even if they're
playing the Stones

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.980
for my entire
generation, I don't

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.267
think I'm going to
embrace the change.

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:24.850
How about you?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.950
Has anybody noticed any
changes in their body

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.140
since you were 20?

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.710
Have you welcomed and
embraced them all?

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.510
This is a hard road.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700
There's another problem.

00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:45.510
One of the other things we see
when we go to an African game

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.600
park, and it actually gets
a little bit repetitive,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.560
because in species after
species, the story is the same.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.980
There's the dominant
male hanging around

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.326
with the reproductively
promising females,

00:10:56.326 --> 00:10:57.950
and then there's
another group of males

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.810
who are younger doing the
species equivalent of playing

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.040
basketball, honing
their skills and tools,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.720
getting ready to be able to try
to topple the dominant male.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.950
And we see this in species
after species after species.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:16.030
In humans, this concern
for position in the tribe

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.640
or in the pack is expressed
as a concern for self-esteem.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.050
If you examine
your minds, and we

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.110
get to do this with
mindfulness practices,

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.140
we start to see that
our minds are constantly

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.190
comparing ourselves to others.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.690
And we choose many,
many different domains

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.970
and dimensions for this.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.980
For one person, it's
who's wealthier.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.080
For someone else,
it's who's smarter.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.914
For another person, who's
got the higher rank position.

00:11:38.914 --> 00:11:41.080
For someone else, it's who's
got the better physique

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.630
or is better athletically.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.620
Who's thinner?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.920
Who's more attractive?

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.130
Who's more creative?

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.660
Who has more friends?

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.750
Who is more loved?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.995
The list goes on and on and on.

00:11:50.995 --> 00:11:52.620
If you hang out with
meditators the way

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.910
I do, it gets really funny.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.810
Who makes fewer comparisons?

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.850
Who's less self-focused?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.360
Who sees the bigger
picture better?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.430
But it's all the
same kind of thing.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.500
Now assuming you
guys are like me,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.520
and your minds make these kinds
of comparisons, any of you

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.452
always win?

00:12:10.452 --> 00:12:11.910
I once asked a
group that question,

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.540
and a guy raised his hand, and
I thought, avoid him at lunch.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.971
Bad sign, right?

00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:16.470
Of course.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.640
We win some and we lose some.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.130
And the problem is unless
we live in Lake Wobegon,

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.040
where all the women are strong,
the men are good-looking,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.390
and every child
is above average,

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.810
we're always going to be
going up and then with this.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.050
We're constantly, constantly
faced with disappointment

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.270
and sense of failure
and sense of inadequacy,

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.020
because it's
absolutely impossible

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.670
to stay on top all the time.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.880
Even if you're a gold
medalist in the Olympics,

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.120
four years later, you're
probably dethroned,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.560
and if not then, eight
years later for sure.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:52.740
Now to make matters even worse,
who here is going to die?

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.360
That's about 20% of
the hands went up.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.330
That's a pretty
aware group, right?

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.500
So we have this really
bad predicament.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.900
We're very, very focused
on who we are, how we seem,

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.810
how we're doing.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.210
There's all this change
going on, and in the end,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.850
we fall apart and die.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.810
It's no wonder that we have a
lot of psychological distress.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.680
So what I'd like to
do is focus in on some

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.870
of these particular
psychological disorders

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.710
and the most common
ones, and I want

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.200
to do this by discussing a
little bit of a battle that

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.200
went on in the American
Psychiatric Association

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.760
when they were
formulating the DSM-5.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.830
The DSM is the Diagnostic
and Statistical

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.000
Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.400
It's basically the code
book for classifying

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.340
different kinds of psychological
and psychiatric problems.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.040
And there was this battle when
they were designing the newest

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.560
copy between what we might call
the lumpers and the splitters.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.430
The splitters said, what was
wrong with the old system was

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.460
we just didn't yet have
a sufficient number

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.970
of diagnostic categories.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.890
We were still inadvertently
combining apples and oranges.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.290
The lumpers said, you
know, that's crazy.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.170
It doesn't really
fit my experience.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.870
In fact, as a clinician,
for example, I rarely

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.012
see a person with
a single diagnosis.

00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:09.470
Almost everybody's
got a little bit

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.390
of this, a little bit of that,
something of a third diagnosis,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.840
and in fact, it changes
from week to week.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.350
They said, you know, I think
if you create more categories,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.830
you're going to miss the
forest for the trees.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.170
The splitters, at this point,
naturally said, what forest?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.690
The lumper said,
well, for example,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.100
you're not going to see
any of the universals

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.120
in human psychological
difficulties.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.920
You'll not see the
kinds of problems

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.290
that cut across these
different categories.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.230
They said universals?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.396
These are separate diseases.

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:38.160
They're like syphilis
and a broken bone.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.980
What's the universals there?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.480
Well, the lumpers say, for
example, one really powerful

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.450
universal is what we might
call emotional or experiential

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:48.705
avoidance.

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:52.290
And let me give you an
idea of how this works.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.040
Have any of you
ever drunk alcohol?

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.240
Come on.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.510
20% again?

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.480
Thank you.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.270
That's a little
bit more realistic.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.232
Now I know I'm in
California, so some of you

00:15:03.232 --> 00:15:04.930
are going to claim
this, but who does it

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.370
exclusively for the taste?

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:08.870
Nobody.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.670
Very honest group.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.310
Most of us, when
we drink alcohol,

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.990
we do it because we'd like
to change one state of mind

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.950
into a somewhat different state.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.620
Let's say we've had
a hard day at work,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.994
and we're feeling
a little tense,

00:15:19.994 --> 00:15:22.530
and muscularly we're
kind of like this.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.400
And we think, you know, a
beer or a glass of wine--

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.230
that would help.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.920
I'd feel a little
bit more mellow.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.704
Or we're going to go
to a party, and there

00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:32.120
are going to be some people
there we don't know, or worse,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.411
there are going to be some
people there who we do know.

00:15:34.411 --> 00:15:36.530
And we think, you know,
a drink would just

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.266
make this go a little
bit more smoothly.

00:15:40.266 --> 00:15:41.640
So generally, we
drink because we

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.890
want to change one state
into a different state,

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.030
a tense or anxious or unpleasant
state into a more pleasant one.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.180
And of course, if we do that
from time to time, no problem.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.140
But if we do that compulsively
and a lot, and in fact,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.570
can't face life situations
without doing it,

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.400
well, then we have a
substance abuse problem.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.430
Let's take another
common problem.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.820
Let's take anxiety.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.440
If I get nervous before
speaking at Google,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.880
or I get nervous before
flying in airplanes,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.620
but I fly in airplanes,
and I speak at Google,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.010
I don't have an
anxiety disorder.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.120
I'm just a kind of nervous guy.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.800
If however, I avoid
public speaking,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.250
or I won't fly in
a plane, because I

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.030
want to not feel anxious,
that's the pathway

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.290
to an anxiety disorder.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.180
And that can spread
to all sorts of things

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.850
that we wind up
avoiding, because we're

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.270
trying not to feel the anxiety.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.750
There was an astronaut, one
of the early space-goers

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.626
who was being
interviewed by an actor,

00:16:38.626 --> 00:16:40.750
because the actor was going
to play him in a movie,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.220
and he wanted to do a
faithful job of this.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.090
And the actor said,
I don't get it.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.050
How do you possibly
have the courage

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.130
to go up in those
untested rockets?

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.310
I would've been terrified.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.700
And the actor said, I think
you're misunderstanding.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.770
Courage isn't about
not being terrified.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.660
We were terrified.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.035
We had no idea if the things
were going to hold together.

00:17:03.035 --> 00:17:05.599
Courage is about doing
what it makes sense to do,

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.060
even as you feel the fear.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.099
So we see that emotional
or experiential avoidance,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.630
trying not to feel
anxious is actually

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.947
at the heart of
anxiety disorders.

00:17:15.947 --> 00:17:16.780
Let's take one more.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.410
Let's look at
depression a little bit.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.251
Now all of us, even
if you've never

00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:23.000
been to a therapist
or anything like that,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.869
have sometimes been sad, and
sometimes we felt depressed.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:28.650
What in your experience
is the difference?

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.410
How does it feel
differently, qualitatively

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.760
to be sad or depressed?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.260
Don't be shy about this.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.970
Everybody knows we've all
experienced these things.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.274
Anybody want to offer a
difference between sadness

00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:42.690
and how that feels
and depression?

00:17:46.634 --> 00:17:48.610
AUDIENCE: Depression
has more hopelessness.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.010
RON SIEGEL: Depression
has more hopelessness.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.509
Absolutely.

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:52.880
It's got this thought that
it's never going to end.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.410
Absolutely.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.700
AUDIENCE: Unenthusiastic.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.908
RON SIEGEL: Unenthusiastic
in depression, and there's

00:17:57.908 --> 00:18:01.490
a kind of we're cut off
from life engagement,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.210
from interests, right?

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:04.745
What else?

00:18:04.745 --> 00:18:06.370
AUDIENCE: Maybe like
a localized to one

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.670
experience versus
pervading the rest of--

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.530
RON SIEGEL: Yeah, often
sadness is poignant.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.488
It's kind of localized.

00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:13.590
We're sad about something,
and often depression

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.500
is much broader than that.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.890
And it's kind of our whole life
feels sort of empty or dead.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.250
Anybody, one more?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.310
So one way you could think of
this, and one of the features

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.450
that to my mind cuts to the
chase of it, is in depression,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.550
we feel kind of dead
and kind of shut down,

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.970
whereas in sadness, it's
about a given object.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:35.875
We're kind of alive.

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:38.380
We're kind of still
engaged in life.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.670
When Shakespeare wrote,
parting is such sweet sorrow,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.670
we get it.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.350
Had he written, parting is such
sweet depression, we'd think,

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.560
this guy doesn't
know how to write.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.250
That wouldn't speak to us.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.730
So we can see that even in
something like depression,

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.360
there's a kind of shutting
down of the organism.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.340
There's a kind of closing
down and avoiding experience,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.690
which is part of this.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:05.010
So there's a very nice little
video that is, to my mind,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.020
a wonderful visual
metaphor for this,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.910
which I'd like to show to you.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.910
It's very brief,
but it gives you

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:16.990
a sense of how this
plays out and, frankly,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:22.610
how experiential avoidance
winds up multiplying our misery.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.380
RON SIEGEL: The way in which
mindfulness practices are going

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.900
to help us with this wide
variety of different kinds

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.400
of psychological
difficulties is pretty much

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.600
the way the samurai warrior
learned to deal with his fly.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.540
Mindfulness practices
develop cross-culturally

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.380
in order to deal with everyday
psychological distress.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.390
They've been refined
probably most intensively

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.920
in Buddhist cultures,
where we have

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.750
about 2,500 years of a written
record of monks and nuns

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.330
doing these
practices intensively

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.380
and talking about various
variations of them.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.380
But they exist in
one form or another

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.590
in virtually every culture.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.410
So let's talk about
what mindfulness is,

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.660
and then we'll talk
about how we can use it

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.860
for these different kinds
of everyday psychological

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.360
problems.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.330
As we're using it in Western
psychotherapies these days,

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.260
mindfulness is a
translation of a Pali term,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.130
and Pali was the
vernacular language

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.170
in which the teachings
of the historical Buddha

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.220
were first written down.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.520
And the word in Pali is sati.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.550
And it connotes awareness,
attention, and remembering.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.050
And the awareness
and attention part

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.008
is pretty much the way
we use them in English--

00:23:22.008 --> 00:23:23.430
to be aware, to pay attention.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.852
But the remembering
is different.

00:23:24.852 --> 00:23:26.310
It's not about
remembering what you

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.210
had for breakfast
or, for that matter,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.190
even remembering
childhood trauma.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.930
It's about remembering to
be aware and pay attention

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.930
at each moment of our day.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.840
Now there's a scholar of
the ancient text named

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.990
John Dunne at Emory
University, and he

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.490
raised the following criticism.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.544
He said, if you could
imagine a sniper poised

00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:49.460
on top of a building
getting ready to take out

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.690
an innocent victim,
that sniper would

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.000
be very aware, very
attentive, and every time

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.180
his mind wandered
from the task at hand,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.189
he'd be zeroing right in on it.

00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:00.980
And John said, I don't
think that's exactly

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.790
the attitude you're trying
to develop in yourselves

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.850
as psychotherapists,
nor the attitude you're

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.040
trying to cultivate in
your patients or clients.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.250
Something's missing here.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.790
And what's missing is a sense
of non-judgment, acceptance,

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.230
kindness, and friendliness.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.030
Now there's some scholars who
say that's included in sati,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.030
but the important point is that
this non-judgment or acceptance

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.180
is a scale unto itself, which
takes some work to cultivate.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.730
Let me show you what I mean.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.480
Join me in looking
at this fellow.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.690
And just take in
the picture of him,

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.730
and see what emotion
arises as you look at him.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.400
And raise your hand
if what you feel

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.140
is a sense of harsh
and critical judgment.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.020
We can talk afterwards, if so.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:50.860
But most of us look at him
and feel something like, aw.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.580
Now even if he pees and
poops at the wrong time

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.240
in the wrong place, even if he
doesn't listen to instructions,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.040
we can understand.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.670
He's young.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.320
He's a puppy.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.110
He needs training.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.600
Now when you take up mindfulness
practices, most of us,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.010
one of the first things we see
is that our mind does actually

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.430
pee and poop at the wrong
time in the wrong place,

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.160
and it doesn't listen
to instructions at all,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.040
that it's quite, quite unruly.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.000
And the same kind
of loving attitude

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.150
that we would cultivate
toward that puppy, that's

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.410
what we're going to try to
cultivate toward whatever

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.030
arises in our
consciousness, including

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.880
depressive feelings, anxious
feelings, physical pain,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.724
and the like.

00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:30.140
So putting this
together, we might

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.140
say that therapeutic mindfulness
has three components.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.949
It's awareness of present
experience with acceptance.

00:25:36.949 --> 00:25:39.240
And nowadays, mindfulness is
very hot in psychotherapy,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.370
and it's very hot in the
most scientifically-oriented

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.360
psychotherapies.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.642
So people are interested
in measuring mindfulness,

00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:47.600
and they've developed
about half a dozen scales

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.540
to do this, because if they set
up a treatment, and it works,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.140
they want to know whether people
actually became more mindful

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.010
and whether that was
the active ingredient,

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.426
or whether there were other
elements in the treatment that

00:25:57.426 --> 00:26:02.120
had made them feel better.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.940
And an interesting
thing about measuring

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.190
mindfulness is
mindfulness is highly

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.110
subject to what's called
the Dunning Kruger effect.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.590
Now Dunning and Kruger were a
pair of social psychologists

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.080
at Cornell University,
and they observed

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.190
that across all sorts
of human activities,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.460
actual competence is inversely
proportional to perceived

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.870
competence.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:22.500
Get that?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.330
Actual competence is inversely
proportional to perceived

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.250
competence.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.660
You can think of this as
the Homer Simpson effect.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.110
Homer is supremely
confident when he goes out

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.610
on one of his misadventures.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.940
It's just us in the audience
thinking, I don't know.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.514
Looks pretty bad, right?

00:26:36.514 --> 00:26:38.680
Well, people who really
think they know what they're

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.167
doing often don't, and
this is no more clear

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:42.000
than in mindfulness.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.450
What happens is if you give
one of these mindfulness

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.560
scales to somebody who's been,
oh, practicing meditation

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.420
for 20 or 30 years,
they'll say, oh, yeah,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.480
I was aware of my
present experience once.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.850
It was on top of a mountain
for about five minutes

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.857
about eight years ago.

00:26:55.857 --> 00:26:58.190
When you tell people who
haven't done the practice much,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:01.090
they say, oh, sure, I'm living
in the present all the time.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.670
And kind of the
take-home point here

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.060
is don't be surprised when can
take up mindfulness practice

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.580
if you find a lot of
moments of mindlessness,

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.820
if you find a lot of
moments of mind wandering,

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.310
of operating on automatic,
of being lost in the thought

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.110
stream and the
constant narrative that

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.080
goes through our minds.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.380
And mindfulness is a lot
swimming, eating a gourmet

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.720
meal, or making love.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.050
Talking about it isn't the
same as experiencing it,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.676
so let's, even though I'm
mostly giving this as a talk,

00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:32.050
let's spend a few minutes
doing some mindfulness practice

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:32.870
together.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.320
And I invite you to put down
whatever is in your hands,

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.830
and find a comfortable posture.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.190
I'm not sitting in those
chairs, but look for a posture,

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.960
and we'll do this
with the eyes closed.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.610
And please do this,
those of you who

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.460
are listening to this on
YouTube or are streaming it

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.830
through the Google system.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.960
Just allow your eyes to close,
and find a comfortable posture

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.090
in which your spine
is more or less erect.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.410
And one way to find that
posture is to imagine a string

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:03.110
tied to the top of the head,
pulling toward the sky,

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.440
gently elongating the spine.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.250
And in almost all
mindfulness practices,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.620
what we do is we begin with a
sensory object of awareness,

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.710
some sensation that we
can pay attention to.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.550
And arbitrarily, we're going
to choose the breath right now,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:24.930
so just begin to notice the
sensations of your breath.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:29.730
And notice all the feelings that
are happening as you breathe in

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:30.700
and as you breathe out.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.850
And see for a few
moments, if it's possible,

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.022
to follow the breath
through its full cycles

00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:42.522
from the beginning
of the inhalation

00:28:42.522 --> 00:28:44.860
to the end of an exhalation
and onto the next.

00:28:53.179 --> 00:28:54.720
So we're just going
to practice being

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.830
aware of present
experience with acceptance,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.900
focusing on the breath as
an object of awareness.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.320
Now it would not be unusual
for thoughts to enter the mind.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.907
That's OK.

00:29:06.907 --> 00:29:07.740
They're our friends.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.431
We're not trying
to chase them away.

00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:12.180
But instead of following
a thought the way

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.090
we normally would,
we're just going

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.890
to let it arise and pass,
kind of like a cloud showing

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.080
up and leaving the sky.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.840
Gently, returning our
attention to the breath.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.130
This is a lot like
puppy training.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.700
The mind scampers off.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.920
We gently bring it
back to the breath.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.150
It's scampers again.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.980
We gently bring it back again.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.790
And all of the other judgments--
I like this, I don't like this,

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.180
I can concentrate, I can't,
I'm a good meditator,

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.890
I'm a bad meditator-- those
are just other thoughts that we

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.270
allow to arise and pass.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.850
Just gently training the
mind for a few moments

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.260
to step out of the thought
stream and come to our senses.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.050
Gently bring the attention from
the thoughts to the sensations

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.100
here and now.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.380
And to bring this little
period of practice to a close,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.900
I'm going to ring
a bell, and just

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.310
listen to the bell from
the beginning of the ring

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.976
until it trails off, and
you can no longer hear it.

00:30:36.976 --> 00:30:40.462
[RINGS BELL]

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.940
And you can open your eyes
again, and check out the room,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.790
and maybe stretch a tiny
bit to feel your body.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.025
And perhaps, you'll notice
that just a very few minutes

00:31:26.025 --> 00:31:30.710
of beginning to train the mind
and train the brain to come out

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.350
of the thought stream
and into sensory reality

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.770
helps us to connect a little
bit to what's happening here

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.190
and now on a sensory level.

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.270
And you may wonder,
well, how is that-- how

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.570
is breath awareness or
doing something like that,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.350
how is that possibly going
to help us to deal with all

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.810
of life's difficulties
and to deal

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.722
with these different
emotional states?

00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:53.680
And that's what I'd like
to explain to you now,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.250
and then we'll talk
about how to use

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:58.400
these practices to work with
some of the difficult states

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.370
that arise.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.830
And to understand this,
I'd like you to imagine

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.400
two very different days.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.080
On the first day, you
haven't been sleeping well,

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.250
because you've had a bad cold.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:14.710
And to try to take
care of yourself,

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.750
you've been eating a lot of junk
food and other comfort food,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.055
so you're not feeling
terribly healthy.

00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:21.920
You haven't really
been working out.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.010
You certainly haven't
been meditating.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.770
You've been staying up kind
of too late watching TV, just

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.110
trying to feel a
little bit better.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.200
You wake up in the morning
after another fitful night,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.890
and you look out the window, and
well, if you lived where I do,

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.850
it's 33 degrees and raining.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.477
And you feel kind of crummy,
and if you live with somebody,

00:32:41.477 --> 00:32:44.060
you go into the kitchen, and you
have one of those five minute

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.601
interactions with
another person that

00:32:45.601 --> 00:32:47.142
can just ruin your whole day.

00:32:47.142 --> 00:32:48.350
You know what these are like.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.699
They just start off bad
and quickly escalate.

00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:53.490
And then you look at
your appointment book,

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.920
and you're meeting with
many, many too many people,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.830
and a lot of them
aren't your favorites.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.750
And it's with this as a backdrop
that you get into your car,

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.480
and you start driving to
work, and at first, it's

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.440
barely perceptible,
but you think you maybe

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.220
hear, thump, thump, thump.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.890
But as the miles go
by, it gets louder,

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.860
and now it's definitely
thump, thump,

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.670
and then you feel it in the
body, and it's thump, thump,

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.410
and you've got a flat tire.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.630
And you've just had the
sense of, oh, no, not today.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:24.630
I can't possibly bear this.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.750
Now imagine a wholly
different day.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.760
You haven't had a
cold or a virus.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.950
You've been sleeping well.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.080
You've been working out.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.702
Heck, you've been doing
mindfulness meditation.

00:33:35.702 --> 00:33:37.410
You decide to take
good care of yourself,

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.380
so you go to bed nice and early.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.001
You wake up naturally
without the alarm clock.

00:33:42.001 --> 00:33:43.000
You look out the window.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.180
It's 68 degrees, and
the sun is shining.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.680
And you go into the
kitchen, and you

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.590
have one of those
five-minute interactions

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.048
with another human
being that makes

00:33:50.048 --> 00:33:52.320
you so glad to live in the
world of fellow humans,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.790
to be with other people, to have
relationship and connection.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.966
And you look at your
appointment book,

00:33:57.966 --> 00:33:59.340
and it's a kind
of Goldilocks day

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.960
for whatever your profession is.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.180
Not so much work that you're
going to be burnt out.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.649
Not so little that you
going to starve or be fired.

00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:07.940
And you look at some of the
people you're meeting with,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.539
and you realize, if I weren't
working with these folks

00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:12.080
professionally, I'd
like to have them

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.280
as my close personal friends.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.989
And it's with that as a backdrop
that you get into your car,

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:20.489
you're driving to work,
you're seeing the sky,

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:24.020
you're noticing the trees,
and you're at a red light,

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.810
and suddenly bam.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.566
You get hit from behind.

00:34:27.566 --> 00:34:30.760
And you're startled, of course,
but you realize, well, I'm OK.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.929
And you pull your car over.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:35.100
The other car, the other
driver pulls their car over.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.330
And by some miracle,
the other driver

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:38.679
doesn't have character problems.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.428
They're like a reasonable
balanced person,

00:34:40.428 --> 00:34:41.999
and they say, oh, I'm sorry.

00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:43.540
And you exchange
papers, and you just

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.889
have this feeling that, oh, it
could've been so much worse.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:51.810
I'm glad it's just going to
be some money and some hassle.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:55.920
Now on the first day, the
intensity of the experience

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.630
was a moderate challenge.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.500
It was a flat tire
on a rainy day.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.990
But your capacity to bear
it was way lower than that,

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.580
so you really felt
quite overwhelmed.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.930
On the second day, the
intensity of the challenge

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.030
was considerably greater.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.630
You got in an
automobile accident.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.950
But your capacity
to bear adversity,

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.650
your sense of resilience
was much higher than that,

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.650
so you took it in stride.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.630
Many of the things we do
to try to feel happier,

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.310
and in fact, many
psychiatric interventions

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.050
are designed to
decrease the intensity

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.540
of painful or
uncomfortable experience.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.200
Mindfulness practices,
the way they're

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.530
going to help us with these
things is quite different.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:36.020
They're going to help us
by increasing our capacity

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.470
to bear or be with discomfort.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.880
They're going to help us to
be more like that samurai guy

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.250
with the fly who
instead of fighting

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.470
the discomfort of the fly,
found a way to accept and be

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.030
with the discomfort of the fly.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.750
And mindfulness practices
can be very, very powerful

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.590
in the way they do this.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.340
There's a well-known
zen teaching

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:03.680
story about a horrible, sadistic
general, who had come to town.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.650
This was in medieval Japan.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:09.950
And they were burning
crops and burning buildings

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.230
and killing the
able-bodied boys and men,

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.820
and they were raping women.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.050
It was horrible.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.660
And this general really want
to vanquish the townsfolk,

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.940
and he caught wind that they
respected their zen master.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.700
So he took his horse, and
he rode up the hillside

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.630
into the main hall
of the zen temple,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.660
and there sitting on
the meditation cushion

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.950
is this little old
man, the zen master.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.700
And the general takes
his bloody sword,

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.970
and he holds it
over the zen master.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.636
He says, don't you realize I can
run you through with this sword

00:36:35.636 --> 00:36:37.304
without blinking an eye?

00:36:37.304 --> 00:36:39.220
And the little man looks
up, and he says, yes,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.700
and I, sir, can be run
through with a sword

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.564
without blinking an eye.

00:36:43.564 --> 00:36:44.980
And it's said that
at that moment,

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.435
the general becomes
disoriented and leaves town.

00:36:48.435 --> 00:36:49.810
Now it's not always
going to work

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.790
as a military
intervention, but it

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.960
speaks to how these practices
develop our capacity

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:01.127
to be with discomfort and
not to have to escape it.

00:37:01.127 --> 00:37:03.460
And the way they help us be
with the marginal discomfort

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.290
is particularly interesting,
because let's say

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.700
I'm not a mindfulness
guy, and something

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.004
happens with a friend of mine.

00:37:13.004 --> 00:37:14.545
And he's a good
friend, and I've done

00:37:14.545 --> 00:37:15.890
all sorts of things for him.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.569
And he does something
selfish, treats me dirty.

00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:21.110
And I start to think,
I can't believe

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.287
you did that to me after all the
good stuff I've done for you.

00:37:24.287 --> 00:37:26.120
And every time I have
one of those thoughts,

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.357
my body gets all tense,
and I get all upset,

00:37:28.357 --> 00:37:30.190
and then that brings
more of those thoughts.

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:32.260
And we just get
stuck in this loop.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.700
Once we've practice
mindfulness for awhile,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.760
we start to experience
emotions differently.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.440
We start to experience them
the way cognitive scientists

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.230
actually describe emotions.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.900
A continent of
scientists would tell us

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.660
an emotion consists of
a few simple things.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.260
Take a moment to feel,
for example, a little bit

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.956
of sadness yourself.

00:37:50.956 --> 00:37:53.330
Just imagine something maybe
that makes you a little sad.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.600
You notice that that starts
off with a body sensation.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.660
Maybe it's a pressure here
or here or in the eyes,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.300
so an emotion starts
with a body sensation,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.260
and it includes a thought,
the sad thought or the memory

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.890
or something, and it also
includes a visual image.

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.140
And that's all there is to it.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.020
Once we've practiced
mindfulness for awhile

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.160
and spent time dropping
out of the thought stream

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.740
and staying at
the sensory level,

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.505
let's say the anger
comes up, and all

00:38:21.505 --> 00:38:23.910
I experience is the
body tensing up,

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.849
heart rate increasing,
respiration increasing,

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:27.390
blood pressure--
well, you don't feel

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.185
blood pressure-- but body
temperature increasing.

00:38:30.185 --> 00:38:35.130
And perhaps the thought coming
and passing like a cloud

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.890
in the sky, perhaps the image
of decapitating my former friend

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.790
dancing through the
mind's eye, but it's all

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.890
seen as a kind of impersonal
process of mental contents

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.130
arising and passing.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.970
And when we can
experience it that way,

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.670
we get much less caught in
it, and it's much easier

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.310
to let it come and go.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.710
So putting this together,
mindfulness practice,

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.950
the way it's going to
work for us is it's

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.140
going to support
experiential approach instead

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.230
of experiential
avoidance, because when

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.800
something uncomfortable comes
up in mindfulness practice,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.920
instead of quick, how do I
change it, how do I fix it,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.710
how do I make myself
more comfortable,

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.190
we learn to be with it.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.040
This starts at the
very sensory level

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.760
of simply when an
ache or an itch

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.100
arises, when we're doing
meditation practice,

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.090
you simply sit with
the ache or the itch,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.380
and maybe turn your attention
to the ache or the itch

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.630
instead of to the breath.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.030
And that develops this
muscle, if you will,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.560
of being able to stay with
or be with discomfort.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.860
It helps us to step out
of the thought stream.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.090
Instead of believing in
our thoughts so much,

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.590
we start to see them
as mental contents,

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.120
as thoughts coming and going.

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.240
So we don't get so
trapped in them.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.400
In the process,
interestingly, we

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.520
become much less self-focused.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.666
So all of the nightmares
about falling behind and not

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:50.040
being good enough and not
getting the best review at work

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.664
and all of that--
not that I don't want

00:39:51.664 --> 00:39:54.190
you to try hard in your
work at Google-- but all

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.680
of the self-esteem
concerns start

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.200
to settle down, because we're
not always comparing ourselves

00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.700
with others.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.960
We're not so centered
on ourselves anymore.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.970
By watching things
change constantly

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.390
in mindfulness
practice, we start

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.330
to get it that everything
is in constant flux.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:09.840
Everything's
constantly changing.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.600
So we're not as freaked
out by our kids going off

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.770
to college or some health
problem or some other change.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:21.800
And finally, these help us to
live in the present moment.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.420
And living in the present
moment is enormously useful.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.480
One of my favorite
studies in this area

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.840
was done by a guy named
Matthew Killingsworth,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.390
and he was a grad
student at Harvard.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:34.280
He was in the lab
of Dan Gilbert.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.769
Dan Gilbert wrote a book called
"Stumbling on Happiness."

00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:38.310
He's guy who's done
a lot of research

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.830
in basically the
things we do to try

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.460
to be happy that don't work.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.070
So here was Gilbert's study.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.070
He developed a smartphone
app, and this app

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.860
would randomly page
people throughout the day.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.190
And it would ask
them three things.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.590
What are you doing?

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.960
What are you feeling?

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.080
And where was your
tension at the moment

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.440
that the phone paged you?

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.640
And what he found
was it didn't really

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.100
matter what people were doing
in terms of what they were doing

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.330
did not predict how they'd feel.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.790
What predicted how
they would feel

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.200
was where their attention was
at the moment the phone rang.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.470
So to use a rather
stark example,

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.130
if somebody were
washing the dishes

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.240
and were attending to
the experience of washing

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.940
the dishes, they reported
more enhanced well-being

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.510
than somebody who's eating the
gourmet meal or making love

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.680
but thinking about other things.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.340
So simply training the attention
to be in the present moment

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:39.120
starts to increase our
level of well-being.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.890
Another very
interesting study was

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.100
done in the early days of
the neurobiological research

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.420
on this by Richard Davidson at
the Laboratory for Affective

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:53.540
Neurobiology at the University
of Wisconsin in Madison.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:58.010
And he had studied
ordinary people

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.800
and had found that when people
are experiencing states that

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.230
are either happy, enthusiastic,
energized, engaged,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.520
there's a lot of left
prefrontal cortical activity

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.070
in the brain, a lot of
activity behind this area.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.170
And when people
are hypervigilant,

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.910
meaning scanning the
environment for danger,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.010
doing Lucy's type 1 error,
or they're depressed

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.400
or they're anxious,
there's a lot

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.410
of right prefrontal activation.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:25.270
And this had been studied in
ordinary individuals, otherwise

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:26.750
known as college sophomores.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.930
But they actually studied
it in grownups also,

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.670
and it held true.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:35.520
Then Richie invited a Tibetan
monk who had tens of thousands

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.360
of hours of meditation practice
under his belt into the lab.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.704
And this guy was
simply off the charts

00:42:41.704 --> 00:42:43.120
in terms of the
degree to which he

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.630
had left prefrontal activity but
not right prefrontal activity.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.040
He was lateralized
in a way that would

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.650
make him unbelievably happy.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.180
Rich is a good scientist,
so he has to question, well,

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.877
maybe people who become monks in
Tibet are predisposed this way.

00:42:56.877 --> 00:42:59.210
Maybe it had nothing to do
with the meditation practice.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.380
Maybe that's just kind of
how he grew up or who he was.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.030
So he and Jon
Kabat-Zinn got together,

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.290
and they did a
wonderful little study.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.070
They took a bunch of
stressed out biotech workers,

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.620
and they randomly assigned
them to two groups.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.180
And one group they put through
an eight-week mindfulness

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.820
training course,
and the other group

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.150
was just doing
business as usual.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.712
And everybody before the
study was leaning right.

00:43:21.712 --> 00:43:23.670
There was a lot of right
prefrontal activation,

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.340
because it was a stressed
out group of biotech workers.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.970
Not like a Google, where
they take good care of you.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:31.720
After the eight
weeks, the group who'd

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.510
been through the
mindfulness training,

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.920
they had shifted much more
toward left prefrontal activity

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.040
compared to their peers.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.471
They also gave everybody
a flu shot at that point,

00:43:40.471 --> 00:43:42.720
and it turned out that the
people who had been through

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.430
the mindfulness training had a
more robust response to the flu

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.924
vaccine than the
people who hadn't.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:49.090
And then the second group
was put though the course,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.530
and they caught up to
the first, and they

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:51.488
were leaning left also.

00:43:51.488 --> 00:43:53.760
So it was pretty clear
that it's actually

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.490
the practice that does
this is, not simply being

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.160
born as somebody who
becomes a monk in Tibet.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:04.550
Now since these practices are
going to help us emotionally

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.660
by helping us to be with
emotional discomfort,

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.250
rather than trying to
escape it, the studies

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.580
on pain and mindfulness become
very, very relevant here.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.540
And there have been
a number of studies

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.007
on experimentally induced
pain, and these are studies

00:44:19.007 --> 00:44:20.090
in which they take people.

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.900
They put them in
functional MRI machines,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.342
which are like video
machines taking an MRI.

00:44:25.342 --> 00:44:27.800
And their feet are sticking
out, so they do terrible things

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.730
to their feet.

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.400
They shock them, or they
shoot a laser at them.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.090
Nothing damaging, but
things that are painful.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:39.240
And what they found doing that
was that compared to novices,

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.980
experienced meditators
found the same stimulus

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.870
to be much less unpleasant.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:47.137
They could observe their
pain much less reactively.

00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:48.720
They found that open
monitoring, which

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.219
is kind of mindfulness practice
in which instead of focusing

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.450
on one object like the
breath, once you develop

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.300
a certain level
of concentration,

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.760
you open up to
whatever predominates

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:01.010
in the field of awareness--
that open monitoring made people

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:03.450
feel that the pain
was less unpleasant,

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.931
and they also had a lot less
anticipatory pain anxiety.

00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:08.680
One of the things you
see in these studies

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.940
is that just waiting
for the next shock

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.480
causes a great
deal of discomfort.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.239
Not so much in the meditators.

00:45:14.239 --> 00:45:15.780
And then they went
in to look, what's

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.737
going on neurobiologically?

00:45:17.737 --> 00:45:19.320
And to understand
this, I need to just

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.260
describe a couple of
brain structures to you.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.750
The first structure
is the insula,

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.560
and that's where
it is on the brain.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.950
And that's associated
with interoception,

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.760
with noticing
sensations in the body.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.810
It's about visceral
and gut feelings,

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.830
and it processes transient
sensory perceptions,

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.060
things that are coming
and going in the body.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.200
And it's very activated
during meditation practice,

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.290
and in fact, it
grows in meditators.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.236
It gets bigger in
meditators over time,

00:45:45.236 --> 00:45:46.610
which is no
surprise, because you

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.950
can imagine that tuning into
what's going on in the body

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.000
would sensitize
you to this, and we

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.760
know that neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.920
So any part of the
brain that you activate

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.940
will get bigger in this way.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.630
The other area we
want to discuss here

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.080
is the prefrontal
cortex, and that

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.910
evaluates our
emotional responses

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.452
and regulates emotion.

00:46:08.452 --> 00:46:09.910
That's the part of
the brain that's

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.243
involved-- to go back to
Lucy's experience-- and saying,

00:46:12.243 --> 00:46:15.740
yes, it looks like a lion, but
lions aren't generally found

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.260
in this part of the savanna,
so it's probably a beige rock.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.550
It's basically our
thinking capacity that

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:24.160
helps to modulate our emotions.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.160
So what do we find
neurobiologically?

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.390
So meditators practicing
open monitoring,

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.840
this kind of mindfulness in
which you take in whatever

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.030
arises, when they're
exposed to pain,

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.799
they had decreased activity in
the lateral prefrontal cortex,

00:46:37.799 --> 00:46:39.840
so the part of the brain
that's thinking about it

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.910
and evaluating it
was relatively quiet.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.810
But they had
increased activation

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.710
in a part in the
posterior insula,

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:49.690
so they're actually
feeling it more vividly.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.229
So what we've seen
neurobiologically

00:46:51.229 --> 00:46:53.270
is exactly the same thing
the monks have reported

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:56.147
for 2,500 years and anybody who
takes up these practices can

00:46:56.147 --> 00:46:58.330
see for themselves.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.140
You feel pleasure and
pain more vividly,

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.920
but you get less upset by it
and less freaked out about it,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.400
and the reason you become
less upset and less freaked

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.900
out about it is because
you're no longer resisting it.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.810
You make the transition
that the samurai warrior

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:20.300
made from hating the fly
to being with the fly.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.850
So in our last
little while, I want

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.490
to give you an
idea of how you can

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:28.790
use these skills to work with
everyday kinds of problems.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:31.770
Anybody here ever feel anxious?

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:32.630
Yeah.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.840
We all do, and it
happens quite a bit.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.890
So when cognitive scientists
and clinical scientists

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.050
study anxiety, they say it
has three components to it.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:46.820
And anxiety disorders have three
components to them as well.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.550
The first is
physiological arousal.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:52.710
That's the activation of
the sympathetic branch

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:54.940
of the autonomic nervous
system and of what's

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.490
called the hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis, which

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.280
is basically a hormonal
system that dovetails

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.660
with the sympathetic
nervous system

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.100
to secrete adrenaline
and create that wound up,

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.110
roused up feeling that
we're all too familiar with.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.930
There's a cognitive
part of it, and that's

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.840
all the negative fantasies
about the future.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:15.800
This is imagining
terrible things

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.390
happening, which we all
do quite readily when

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.390
we're feeling anxious.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.410
And then there's a
behavioral part of it,

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.740
and these are typically
our avoidance strategies,

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.370
and these are what are
most critical in developing

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:30.280
an actual anxiety
disorder, because it's,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.860
as I mentioned before,
it's not feeling nervous

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.720
that's the problem.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.260
It's avoiding things in order
to try to not feel nervous

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.570
that becomes our problem.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.390
To tell you the truth,
even when I'm in the water,

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.450
I don't feel that comfortable.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.380
One of the things we notice when
we take up mindfulness practice

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.580
is just how often we're anxious.

00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.110
And it takes a lot of forms.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.620
Who among you
practices mindfulness

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.495
with some regularity?

00:48:55.495 --> 00:48:56.300
I'm just curious.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.980
I know Google's got all these
wonderful supports for it.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.020
You ever feel restless?

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.760
You ever feel like, I kind
of want to get up now?

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.580
You ever feel
tension in your body?

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.980
These are all signs of anxiety.

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.310
It's very, very pervasive,
and when we first

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.290
start taking up these
mindfulness practices,

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.330
we start to notice
it quite a bit.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.300
Now take a moment to
think about something

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.320
that makes you anxious.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.600
Just think of something.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.390
This shouldn't take long.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.910
You got it?

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:28.630
OK.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:35.050
Is that thing in the past, in
the future, or in the present?

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:35.550
What is it?

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.290
What?

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:41.360
RON SIEGEL: All in the future.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:41.950
Right, indeed.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.300
We find it's in the future.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.790
Sometimes people
will say, well, no,

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:49.740
I'm really anxious about this
thing that I did this morning.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.715
But on closer
analysis, we realized,

00:49:51.715 --> 00:49:53.090
I'm really anxious
that I'm going

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.442
to be incarcerated this evening
for what I did this morning.

00:49:56.442 --> 00:49:58.150
The fact that it
happened in the problem,

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.220
it's anticipating what
the result is going to be.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.570
So it turns out that all
anxiety is anticipatory,

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.330
and even people that are in
terrible present situations

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.630
worry about the future.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.870
When EMTs extract people from
like an automobile crash,

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.375
people say, will
I be able to walk?

00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:14.000
Will I survive?

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.110
Will my loved ones be OK?

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:19.240
When we're frightened, we're
frightened of the future.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.576
Now this will give
you one hint about one

00:50:21.576 --> 00:50:23.450
of the ways in which
mindfulness practice can

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:25.880
help us work with this,
because mindfulness practice is

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.660
training the mind to come
back into the present, back

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.320
into the present,
back in the present.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.080
And it's also training
us to step out

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.070
of the thought stream,
because I mean,

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.680
yes, occasionally we
step out into the street,

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.350
and a bus is
barreling down on us,

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.070
and we're frightened of
some physical reality.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:44.200
And Lucy certainly had
lions to worry about.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.050
But for most of us, what makes
us anxious is our thoughts,

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:47.760
isn't it?

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.026
It's some imagined future
going through our minds,

00:50:51.026 --> 00:50:52.400
going through the
thought stream.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.575
So you can see how by
bringing the attention out

00:50:54.575 --> 00:50:57.805
of the thought stream, and
in addition to that, bringing

00:50:57.805 --> 00:51:00.780
the attention to the present
moment, that in itself

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.356
would help us to work with this.

00:51:03.356 --> 00:51:04.980
Interestingly, the
Buddha had something

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.870
to say about this
2,500 years ago

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.460
when he was teaching monks
mindfulness practice.

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:15.290
He said, "Why do I dwell always
expecting fear and dread?

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.130
What if I subdue that fear and
dread keeping the same posture

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.760
that I'm in when
it comes upon me?

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.710
While I walked, the fear
and dread came upon me.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.850
I neither stood nor
sat nor laid down

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:28.920
until I had subdued
that fear and dread."

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.920
Now these mindfulness
practices are classically

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.280
practiced in four
different postures--

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.560
sitting, lying down,
walking, and standing.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.710
So what he's saying is, I just
stayed with the experience

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.350
rather than fleeing,
rather than doing something

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:45.676
to try to escape it.

00:51:45.676 --> 00:51:48.050
And when he says subdued, what
we're really talking about

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:51.630
is riding it out, just trusting
that all phenomena are going

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:54.290
to change, including this, and
I don't have to do something

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.799
compulsively to fix it.

00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:58.590
This is a modern example
of the same thing.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:01.440
This is Professor Gallagher
and his controversial technique

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.990
of simultaneously confronting
the fear of heights, snakes,

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:07.040
and the dark.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.560
You don't need a crane to do it.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.610
All you need is a
meditation cushion.

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:14.880
All you've got to do is it's
necessary to be with fear

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.130
and not escape it.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.270
All we need to do to do
this in mindfulness practice

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:22.700
is to simply stay with
it, stay with the breath,

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.710
and start to see
the goal not as how

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.810
do I get the anxiety to
stop, but how do I increase

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.550
my capacity to be with it.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.750
And as we do that over
time, anxiety disorders

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.860
tend to lessen in
their intensity.

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.520
Now there's a lot of
neurobiological evidence

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.117
that there are
changes that happen

00:52:44.117 --> 00:52:45.700
in the brain with
mindfulness practice

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.952
that are associated with
getting better at this.

00:52:48.952 --> 00:52:50.980
The amygdala is
another structure.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:53.230
It's a little almond-shaped
part of the limbic system,

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.650
and this helps us to
evaluate threats, to decide,

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.620
is it a lion, or
is it a beige rock?

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.220
It turns out that among
meditators, the amygdala

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.320
tends to shrink.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.040
We know from
neurobiological research

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.560
that in rats, if you place
them in a stressful environment

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.750
in some form of rat hell,
their amygdala will grow.

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.417
Well, it turns out if you place
humans in a meditation course

00:53:15.417 --> 00:53:17.000
where they learn
mindfulness practice,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.130
their amygdala actually shrinks,
because it becomes less active,

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.292
and it atrophies a little bit.

00:53:23.292 --> 00:53:25.500
And there have been a number
of studies showing this.

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.270
In one of them, there is an
eight-week mindfulness training

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.390
for anxious patients, and
in the mindfulness group,

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:33.910
the amygdala activation
decreased more.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:35.880
They reported more of
a decrease of anxiety

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.630
than the other people who were
in a general stress reduction

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:39.500
group.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.680
They had more activation
of the prefrontal cortex.

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:45.020
This was being able to evaluate
whether the thing is actually

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.280
dangerous or not, and
come to the conclusion

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.550
that it isn't, and
more connections

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:53.220
between the prefrontal
cortex and the amygdala.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.560
Now finally, if you're
feeling particularly anxious,

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.510
it can be difficult
to sit and do

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.820
meditation and
follow the breath,

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.050
because we're just too antsy.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:07.890
We're too restless.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.970
But there are many
other different kinds

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.060
of meditation practices.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.620
There's walking meditation,
eating meditation, nature

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.380
meditation.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.925
The sensory object
we attend to doesn't

00:54:16.925 --> 00:54:19.050
have to be sitting still
and being with the breath.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:20.730
And I'll mention a
resource at the end,

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.080
but I'll mention it now as well.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.913
They have a website.

00:54:22.913 --> 00:54:26.039
It's mindfulness-solution.com,
and they have a lot

00:54:26.039 --> 00:54:27.080
of different medications.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.940
They're there just
to download for free

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.050
that you can use to try
different modalities to find

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:36.270
one that's relatively
easy to work with.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.730
So let's talk about another
very common problem, which

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.750
is depression.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.250
And now I'm not
talking necessarily

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:43.830
about a serious clinical
depression, but all of us

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:46.030
get depressed from time to time.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:48.050
In fact, a lot of times
when we get depressed,

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.650
it's because our rank in the
primate troop has fallen.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.140
There's some way we've had
some disappointment, some sense

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.660
of failure-- either
somebody's rejected us,

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.950
or we didn't get the job or
the promotion or something

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.440
like this-- and we start
to kind of give up and feel

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.970
despondent about that.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:08.670
Who here's an engineer?

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:10.130
How'd I guess, right?

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.310
Now when you look
at a sine wave,

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.430
if you alter this so that the
bottom half of the sine wave

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:20.196
doesn't dip as low, what's
going to happen to the top half?

00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:21.820
It's not going to go
to as high, right?

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:23.319
The whole thing's
going to compress,

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:26.730
because it's symmetrical
around the neutral.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:29.300
This is kind of what
happens to us in depression.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:35.600
As the mind and the brain try
to automatically-- because it

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.680
really is quite an automatic
process-- shut down

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.660
on painful
experience, we wind up

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.090
compressing the entire
range of emotion

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.680
so that we don't
feel joy, we don't

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.370
feel engagement is what we
were talking about earlier.

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:51.780
So we could think of depression,
and here, by the way,

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.810
just to make this clear-- I
should've said this earlier--

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:55.184
I'm not saying
that, for example,

00:55:55.184 --> 00:55:57.340
the propensity for
anxiety or depression

00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.530
doesn't have genetic
roots, that there aren't

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:03.340
all sorts of causes for this
as serious pathology in terms

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.730
of childhood abuse,
problems growing

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.740
up, genetic
predispositions, all of what

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.880
we know in psychology
and psychiatry as true.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.820
I'm just discussing
the mechanisms

00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.080
by which the actual
feeling of these things

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.570
and the experience
of these things

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:18.720
and the behavioral
components of this play out

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.339
and how mindfulness
can help us with this.

00:56:21.339 --> 00:56:23.880
So depression involves-- well,
there's all this genetic stuff

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:24.421
and all that.

00:56:24.421 --> 00:56:27.150
It also involves a turning
away from experience,

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.440
turning away from pain.

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.770
And because mindfulness turns
toward the experience at hand,

00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:35.630
it winds up challenging
the depressive stance.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.350
This is what Bhante
Guanarantana--

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.710
he's a Buddhist monk--
wrote a nice book called

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:41.520
"Mindfulness" in plain English.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.010
He says, "You become sensitive
to the actual experience

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.290
of living to how
things actually feel.

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.450
You do not sit around developing
sublime thoughts about living.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:51.290
You live."

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.910
And this comes from
simply connecting

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.090
to sensory experience
over and over,

00:56:56.090 --> 00:57:01.144
and not fearing painful
emotions brings us back alive.

00:57:01.144 --> 00:57:02.810
So when we're using
mindfulness practice

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.740
to work with depression,
we're actually

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.010
interested in what painful
thing the depression

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.350
may be masking, covering
up, or blocking out.

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:14.160
And we discovered this by seeing
what's going on in the body

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:14.900
right now.

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.040
If I'm feeling
depressed, what exactly

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.190
is happening in the body?

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:21.050
What emotions may be
manifesting there?

00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:23.510
We also look at our
relationship to the pain.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:24.330
Am I fighting it?

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:25.120
Am I resisting it?

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.090
Am I being like the
samurai guy with the sword?

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:29.860
Or am I to able to
simply hang out with it?

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.820
And then to see if we can be
compassionate toward ourselves,

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.690
if we can stay with it.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:37.320
And as one of you
mentioned, there's

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.020
a lot of hopelessness
involved in depression,

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.305
and there's an interesting
cognitive model

00:57:43.305 --> 00:57:45.930
for that developed by the people
who developed something called

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:48.690
mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy, in which they

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:53.550
said that when we just
get sad, we just feel sad.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.140
But when we get
depressed, there's

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.210
a whole matrix of thoughts
that go around that.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:58.900
It's hopeless.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.790
I'm a failure.

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:00.830
I'm worthless.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:02.080
I'm unloved.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.880
All these kinds of
thoughts happen.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.240
And if we have a propensity
toward depression,

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.670
then every time that we get
discouraged in some way,

00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:12.610
this whole collection
of thoughts

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.760
comes and visits us again
and causes us grief again.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:19.730
So if we can begin to see these
thoughts as coming and going

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.130
like an itch or an ache,
or like the clouds passing

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.600
through the sky, we're going
to have a much easier time

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.220
with the depression.

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:27.845
So what we do with
mindfulness practice

00:58:27.845 --> 00:58:29.470
is see the thoughts
aren't facts.

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:31.350
I'm not my thoughts.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:32.860
Refuting them often falls flat.

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.956
If you try to talk your way
out of the depressive stance--

00:58:35.956 --> 00:58:37.080
you've done that, I'm sure.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:38.210
It doesn't tend to work.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:40.250
But if you change your
relationship to thinking,

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:44.810
and you start to see all thought
as changing and unreliable,

00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:46.749
it becomes much easier.

00:58:46.749 --> 00:58:48.290
There have been
studies of this using

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:50.140
mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy,

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:55.330
and just to say briefly, what
they found was after a year,

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.250
this was treating people who
had had serious depressive

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.980
episodes, and they put them
through this mindfulness

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.950
program when they
weren't depressed

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:04.490
to see who would relapse.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.437
And they found that
after a year, 66% or 2/3

00:59:07.437 --> 00:59:09.520
of the people that had
mindfulness-based cognitive

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.600
therapy, MBCT, had managed
not to relapse, while only 1/3

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.800
with TAU, which is
Treatment as Usual,

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.292
had managed not to relapse.

00:59:17.292 --> 00:59:18.750
So it cut the
relapse rate in half.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:21.830
It cut in half the rate
by which people fell back

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:23.200
into serious depression.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.420
And this-- by the way,
this was back in 2000--

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.810
was the first big study
that really got mindfulness

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:31.540
on the map in terms of funding
to do research in this,

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.670
because that was a very,
very powerful outcome.

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.510
One other thing you
can do is to practice

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:40.310
what we might call affective
or emotional meteorology, which

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.820
is simply to notice that
emotions and thoughts change.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:47.700
And when feeling depressed, to
simply ask the question, when

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.000
in the past did you
not feel depressed,

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.520
and how were your thought
patterns different?

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.550
And usually what we
notice is that, oh,

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:57.630
yeah, well, back then, I
actually had some hope.

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.030
I thought I was OK.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.332
I felt good about myself.

01:00:00.332 --> 01:00:01.790
But when we're
depressed, we think,

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.690
I was just fooling myself.

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.470
That was an illusion.

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.290
Now I know that I'm doomed.

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:10.290
The opposite's true too.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:11.812
When we pull out
of the depression,

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:13.270
we remember the
depressed thoughts,

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.340
and we think, oh, yeah, well,
that was just the depression

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:15.974
talking.

01:00:15.974 --> 01:00:18.140
What we start to notice
through mindfulness practice

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.860
is these thought patterns
change like the weather,

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:25.920
and they're all really,
really, very, very unreliable.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.466
So to summarize the
kind of attitude

01:00:27.466 --> 01:00:29.590
that we might take toward
our experience of mindful

01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:31.131
attitude toward
experience in dealing

01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:33.670
with depression, anxiety,
and other things,

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:34.610
I want to quote Rumi.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:38.800
He's a 13th century
Islamic mystical poet

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.900
and there's a very
well-known poem

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.420
he wrote called "The Guest
House," and here's how it goes.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.050
"This being human
is a guest house.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:53.250
Every morning a new arrival, a
joy, a depression, a meanness.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.210
Some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

01:00:57.210 --> 01:01:00.250
Welcome and entertain
them all, even if they're

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:02.680
proud of sorrows who
violently sweep your house

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.460
empty of its furniture, still
treat each guest honorably.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.430
He may be clearing you
out for some new delight.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.270
The dark thought, the
shame, the malice--

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.290
meet them at the door
laughing, and invite them in.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:19.050
Be grateful for whoever
comes, because each has been

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.956
sent as a guide from beyond."

01:01:21.956 --> 01:01:24.210
So I think that's
about it for our time.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.530
In terms of resources, this
was the website I mentioned,

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:31.740
mindfulness-solution.com, and
there's a Download Meditation

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.430
section to that.

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:34.430
And you can download--
there's probably about 20

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.850
of them-- different
meditations that you can use.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:38.820
Also within the
Google system, there's

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.160
a whole list of references
from the various studies

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.940
that I alluded to today.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.770
You can check that out.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.300
If you're interested in
learning more about this,

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.800
there's a book that goes
with the website called

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.180
"The Mindfulness
Solution," which

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.170
I wrote for general audiences,
which talks about how

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.770
to develop a mindfulness
practice in a step-by-step way

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.261
in the course of a busy
life, and then how to use it.

01:02:01.261 --> 01:02:02.760
There are separate
chapters on using

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.300
it to work with anxiety,
with depression,

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:08.740
with interpersonal
challenges, with chronic pain,

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.230
difficulties with aging,
with really a wide variety

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:14.010
of everyday practice,
everyday problems,

01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:17.030
and you're welcome to
check that out as well.

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.190
So thank you for coming.

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:19.430
Thank you for your attention.

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:22.250
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.600
AUDIENCE: I'll ask,
how long do you

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.520
think the average Googler
would need to start practicing

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.380
mindfulness before they start to
see a difference in themselves?

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.838
RON SIEGEL: Well,
it's interesting.

01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:38.430
When Jon Kabat-Zinn
set up a program

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:40.430
called mindfulness-based
stress reduction, which

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:47.880
was one of the first programs
to package mindfulness practice

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.420
and disseminate it
to secular audiences

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.430
and to use it in
the medical world,

01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:54.260
he, in that eight-week
training program,

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.810
asked people to do
about 45 minutes a day.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:00.510
So fairly intense
commitment, and if you

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.719
do that over the
course of eight weeks,

01:03:02.719 --> 01:03:05.010
you get these profound changes
in brain function, brain

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.600
structure, you really feel it.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.850
Now some people aren't going
to be willing to do that.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.780
I find that,
personally, I notice

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.600
I'm doing better if I can
devote 20 minutes a day

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.532
compared to not
doing the practice.

01:03:15.532 --> 01:03:17.490
And there have been a
number of studies showing

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:20.550
that relatively small doses
over relatively short periods

01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.830
of time still have
effects, but this stuff

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.050
does tend to be dose-related,
and the more time, the more

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:28.120
profound the effects tend to be.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.240
AUDIENCE: So I've done a little
bit of this sort of meditation

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.990
and kind of trying to be with
the thoughts but not interact,

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:38.630
and what I find is that either
I'm completely carried away

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.280
with it, or I go
back to this reflex

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.925
where I just disengage
and disconnect.

01:03:42.925 --> 01:03:45.570
And I'm interested
in if you have advice

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:49.310
on how to sort of be with
it, but not get carried in

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.492
and not run.

01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:51.200
RON SIEGEL: Yeah.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:56.080
Well, you know, in
the various systems

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.620
of mindfulness
meditation, there are

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.050
different objects of
meditation that are suggested.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:05.430
Most of the systems start
with just sensory experiences

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:09.910
like the breath, like sounds,
like the sights of nature,

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:14.560
like the sensation of the
body sitting in the chair,

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.650
but one can also then
expand out to mindfulness

01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:21.530
of feeling and mindfulness
of thought, even.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:23.800
But it's much harder
to do those until you

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.780
have a pretty strong
base in concentration,

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.900
exactly what you're describing,
because unless the mind

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.890
is accustomed to staying with
a given mental object, as soon

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:38.810
as it moves into the realm of
thought, it tends to take off.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:40.940
So we feel like we've
got two options.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.960
One is to sort of
ignore thought, or just

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.120
get into thinking.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.610
So for me, personally,
it's really only

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:50.740
when I've been
meditating more, and I've

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.630
got a fair bit of
momentum of concentration

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.350
that I pay much attention to
the mindfulness of thought.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.770
Most the time I stay
at the sensory level,

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.700
but the sensory level
includes emotions

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.000
in the sense that
at the sensory level

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.490
comes fear or anger or joy or
sexual interest or sadness,

01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:10.990
because all of these things
begin as bodily events.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.110
So I can stay at
the sensory level

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:15.130
and still explore a
lot of experience,

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.320
but I usually choose when
I'm doing the practice

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.680
to not try mindfulness
of thought,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.442
unless I'm in a retreat setting
where I'm really developing

01:05:22.442 --> 01:05:23.900
a lot of concentration,
because I'm

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.510
sort of meditating for hours at
a time in one form or another.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:32.100
And then there's sufficient
awareness and attention

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.584
to be able to see a thought
without getting caught in it.

01:05:34.584 --> 01:05:36.000
But exactly what
you're describing

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.180
is what's described
historically over thousands

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.010
of years of people
experimenting with this.

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:41.510
OK.

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.840
So thank you so much
for coming, everybody.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.890
[APPLAUSE]
