00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.980
 Death is something we all deal with in our lives 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.259
 Whether it is a family member, a pet, or your last end. In fact. About one hundred people 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.759
 They die every minute in the world. But what happens when you die? 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.289
 In the first moments after death, the last breath of oxygen in your body is depleted 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.269
 And the activity of your brain stops. While the neurons stop working. Your brain stops 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.060
 Hormone secretion that regulates the functions of the body. During this time some body functions may remain functioning 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.410
 For a few seconds, because of the use of the ATP power reserve - which is the primary power source 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.610
 In your body - the muscles relax including the sphincter muscles, which means the possibility of urination 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.590
 Or defecation "Akramkm God". 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.960
 About 15-25 minutes after death the lack of blood flow across the capillaries leads to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
 The pallor of death that he sees on the skin of the dead. And because the heart no longer works 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.730
 There is no blood drive through your body causing gravity to pull 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 Blood in the lower part of the body. 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.040
 After several hours of blood withdrawal, the color of the skin changes to red on the Benghazi 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.860
 Skin color changes up to 12 hours. This is one of the ways that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.490
 Investigators have obtained forensic evidence and forensic doctors to determine the time of death and the location of the body 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.430
 dead. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.120
 Within 3-6 hours the phenomenon of dead stiffness occurs, "gnawing", your body will not only lose its energy sources 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 But the cells of the degraded organs will also leak calcium into the muscle cells, which in turn 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 Will bind to the proteins that are responsible for muscle contraction. Causing 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.909
 Involuntary tension and muscle stiffness, which in any case lasts for a duration of 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.990
 Ranging from 24-48 hours. 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 Until this moment, unless your body is chemically mummified or saved in some way, the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.300
 Your body will slowly start to rot as well. Without adequate blood flow 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.950
 Dead cells accumulate with carbon dioxide and cause acidity. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 All of this weakens the cell membrane and eventually makes it explode and release its cellular nerve 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 Which contain activated protein and enzymes that further work to break down surrounding tissues. 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.460
 There are also about 100 trillion bacteria that thrive on your body. 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.780
 Bacteriological bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract begin to eat underground organs (inside the abdominal cavity). This process 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.459
 Known as the process of decay or rot, a situation where things become foul smell. The breakdown of amino acids 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.400
 By bacteria produces a very lukewarm gas, which attracts certain insects such as licorice 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.189
 And the big blue flies that lay their eggs in rotting tissues. Eggs hatch during day, 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.700
 The larvae or ring tones eat tissues to survive their lives until they become full-grown. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.319
 After several weeks, these tones (larvae) can consume 60% of the tissues of the body causing the drilling 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.249
 Which allow rotting liquids and gases to escape. Between 20-50 days begins fermentation fermentation 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.919
 By attacking the larvae of the beetle, protozoa and fungi. This process is known as dry tooth decay, and can last for a year, 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.079
 But they occur faster in high temperatures. 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.359
 Over the years, plants and animals eat the remains of body parts, including 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.669
 Remains of bone. In the end, if you leave these elements completely to each piece of the body 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.689
 It will break and its basic molecules will be recycled. 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.389

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.519
 Most likely 5 people are remorse before death. It's amazing to see what people think about their last moments.
