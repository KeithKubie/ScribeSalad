00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's say that this
triangle right over here

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.850
is equilateral, which
means all of its sides

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.730
have the same length.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.040
And let's say that
that length is s.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.790
What I want to do in
this video is come up

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.270
with a way of
figuring out the area

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.896
of this equilateral
triangle, as a function of s.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.520
And to do that, I'm
just going to split

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.980
this equilateral in two.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.340
I'm just going to drop an
altitude from this top vertex

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.590
right over here.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.490
This is going to be
perpendicular to the base.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.160
And it's also going to
bisect this top angle.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.497
So this angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:35.080
And we showed all
of this in the video

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.190
where we proved
the relationships

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.730
between the sides of
a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.410
Well, in a regular equilateral
triangle, all of the angles

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.640
are 60 degrees.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.960
So this one right over here
is going to be 60 degrees,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.160
let me do that in
a different color.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.120
This one down here is
going to be 60 degrees.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.520
This one down here is
going to be 60 degrees.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.390
And then this one up
here is 60 degrees,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.610
but we just split it in two.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.270
So this angle is going
to be 30 degrees.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.489
And then this angle is
going to be 30 degrees.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.030
And then the other
thing that we know

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.820
is that this altitude
right over here

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.240
also will bisect
this side down here.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.340
So that this length is
equal to that length.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.590
And we showed all of this a
little bit more rigorously

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.290
on that 30-60-90 triangle video.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.480
But what this tells us is well,
if this entire length was s,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.230
because all three sides
are going to be s,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.940
it's an equilateral
triangle, then

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.320
each of these, so this
part right over here,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.610
is going to be s/2.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.970
And if this length
is s/2, we can

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.750
use what we know about
30-60-90 triangles

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.840
to figure out this
side right over here.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.807
So to figure out what
the actual altitude is.

00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:42.640
And the reason why I
care about the altitude

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.870
is because the
area of a triangle

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.280
is 1/2 times the base times the
height, or times the altitude.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.400
So this is s/2,
the shortest side.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
The side opposite the
30 degree angle is s/2.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.180
Then the side opposite
the 60 degree angle

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.010
is going to be square
root of 3 times that.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.660
So it's going to be
square root of 3 s over 2.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.270
And we know that
because the ratio

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.450
of the sides of a 30-60-90
triangle, if the side

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.250
opposite the 30
degree side is 1,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.970
then the side opposite
the 60 degree side

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.060
is going to be square
root of 3 times that.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.380
And the side opposite the 90
degree side, or the hypotenuse,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.350
is going to be 2 times that.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.390
So it's 1 to square
root of 3 to 2.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.610
So this is the shortest
side right over here.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.570
That's the side opposite
the 30 degree side.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.240
The side opposite
the 60 degree side

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.310
is going to be square
root of 3 times this.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.780
So square root of 3 s over 2.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.710
So now we just
need to figure out

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.290
what the area of this triangle
is, using area of our triangle

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.190
is equal to 1/2 times the
base, times the height

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.390
of the triangle.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.180
Well, what is the
base of the triangle?

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.600
Well, the entire base of the
triangle right over here is s.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.130
So that is going to be s.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.059
And what is the height
of the triangle?

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.350
Well, we just figured that out.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.200
It is the square root
of 3 times s over 2.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.971
And we just multiply
that out, and we get,

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:13.470
let's see, in the numerator you
get a square root of 3 times

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.830
1 times s times s.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.580
That is the square root
of 3 times s squared.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.800
And the denominator,
we have a 2 times a 2.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.570
All of that over 4.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.090
So for example, if you have
an equilateral triangle where

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.546
each of the sides
was 1, then its area

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:28.920
would be square
root of 3 over 4.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.250
If you had an equilateral
triangle where

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.030
each of the sides
were 2, then this

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.939
would be 2 squared over
4, which is just 1.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.480
So it would just be
square root of 3.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.790
So we just found out
a generalizable way

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.190
to figure out the area of
an equilateral triangle.
