00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.880
NARRATOR: Emory
University, Atlanta,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.790
Georgia, December 2012.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.540
After years of work,
mathematician Ken Ono

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.210
and two of his former students
come up with a groundbreaking

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.710
mathematical formula
that will allow

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.750
scientists to study black
holes in an entirely new way.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.380
Incredibly, they
achieved this feat

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.170
by studying a single
paragraph written

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.580
by an Indian mathematician
over nine decades earlier,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.540
Srinivasan Ramanujan.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.330
DAVID WILCOCK:
Srinivasan Ramanujan

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.250
was an Indian mathematician
who is unlike any other genius

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.750
in world history.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.710
Ramanujan's work has
now formed the basis

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.000
for superstring theory and
multidimensional physics.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.920
Some of the most
advanced math that all

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.750
the high-end scientists
are still using today

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.040
is called modular functions,
which could lead to time

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.710
travel, antigravity,
limitless free energy, all

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.790
of this futuristic technology.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.790
He was able to
take a little that he

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.880
knew farther than
most mathematicians

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.920
would be able to take them.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.960
He had the vision to
see what was important.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.960
There are just so many
beautiful ideas that he had,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.120
some of which are just
waiting to be developed.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.920
NARRATOR: Ramanujan
made breakthroughs

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.460
in integral calculus which can
be used to determine the drag

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120
force buffeting a
wing as it slides

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.670
through the air or the
gravitational effects of the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.750
Earth on a man-made satellite.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.830
But perhaps what
is most noteworthy

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.920
is that Ramanujan
insisted these baffling

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.250
theorems were not simply the
product of his own genius.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.920
He claimed they were
communicated to him

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.500
by an other-worldly being.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.830
Srinivasan Ramanujan
was born in Erode, India

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.920
on December 22, 1887 and was
considered a miracle child

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.290
because he was the only one
of his mother's four children

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.250
to survive infancy.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.620
Even as a young boy, he
was obsessed with numbers.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.210
From a very early
age, just instinctively

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.170
he was thinking about numbers.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.670
He was calculating.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.210
He was fascinated by numbers.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.710
Numbers, he said, had
personalities for him,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.710
that they had a kind
of life for him.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.040
There are a lot of stories
about how he was so focused

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.790
on mathematics that
he would ignore

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.170
a lot of his other subjects.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.670
NARRATOR: Ramanujan grew up
in the town of Kumbakonam

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.540
in a house within view of the
impressive Sarangapani Temple.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.040
The mathematical prodigy
spent much of his childhood

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
at the temple among thousands
of carvings of Hindu gods.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.250
According to Ramanujan's
childhood friend,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.920
he would often go to the
temple and work on mathematics.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.670
His friend had a memory
of coming into the temple

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.080
and finding Ramanujan with
all these inexplicable figures

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.670
surrounding him.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.330
NARRATOR: The figures that
surrounded Ramanujan were,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.080
in fact, complex
mathematical equations

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.080
that he had written
in chalk on the stone

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.580
slabs of the temple floor.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.500
He would often
say that they were

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.080
communicated to
him in his dreams

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.880
by the Hindu goddess
Namagiri Thayar.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.790
He always insisted-- and he
was very adamant about this--

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.290
that the mathematical
discoveries he made

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.210
came to him in
dreams and visions

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.290
provided by the
goddess Namagiri.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.210
In these visions, he would
see these fantastic, beautiful

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.290
mathematical formulae
unscrolling before him.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.080
NARRATOR: Numerous times
throughout Ramanujan's youth

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.380
he would abruptly vanish
for days at a time,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.250
then return home
without explanation.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.460
His neighbors considered
him to be psychic,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.790
and he suggested that
numbers connect us to higher

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.460
powers in the universe.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.250
Could it be that
Ramanujan really

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.250
was receiving information
from an other-worldly being?
