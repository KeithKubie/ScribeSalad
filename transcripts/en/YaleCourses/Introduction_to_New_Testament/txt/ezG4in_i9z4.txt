Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. The Gospel of Matthew from the second century on has been pretty much the most popular famous of the Gospels. That's probably why it's first in our Bible simply because it was the most popular, the most popular. It certainly the gospel that's most familiar to people nowadays. And uh, pretty much throughout history of people were familiar with the text at all, both Christians and non Christians often. So for example, you have the familiar birth story. Joseph has a dream. He's warned, uh, the star appears in the east, the mad jai, the wise men come and they go to Herod first. This is not, yes, this is Herod the Great. So they're going to Herod the Great's palace in Jerusalem and they say, where do we find this new king that's been born because we want to go and worship him and bring him gifts. Inherited gets all worried because he doesn't want to lose his own throne.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So I remember this story. He tells the Weizmann, well, I think you have to go to Bethlehem. He gets his, his uh, Wiseman who's own Wiseman, they look it up in the scriptures. They say go to Bethlehem, but he's come back and tell me once you visited, because I want to go worship him too. And the wicked evil king does not want to go worship Jesus, the baby Jesus. He wants to go kill the baby. Jesus. The wise men are warned in a dream not to go back. Do you know the story? Right? The whole thing about that. The Egyptian sojourn, the holy family goes to Egypt to escape the wicked king. The slaughter of the innocence, uh, the beatitudes blessing are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth.

Speaker 1:          01:35          All these blessings, there are some in Luke, but if you, if you start saying them and somebody starts picking it up after you and repeats it and they shows that they at least know it enough to, they can kind of finish one every now and then, they almost always finish it in the Matthew form, not the Luke form. The be attitudes are slightly different in Matthew and Luke and people are, they're famous in their methy inform, uh, turn the other cheek. That's also in Luke six 29, but most people know it from Matthew Five 39 in Matthew, the Pharisees are called over and over again, hypocrites. And in fact, if you look up the word Pharisee in a dictionary in English dictionary, hypocrite will be one of the definitions you, you'll find for it. Now, this is all part of this is long, long tradition of Christian antisemitism.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Because of course the word Pharisee doesn't mean hypocrite to most Jews, the WHO trace back rabbinic Judaism to the priest, 70 pharisees themselves. Gamaliel in book of acts is considered a pharisee and he's a famous rabbi in rabbinic materials. So Jews don't think of the word Pharisee as being a bad term, but in a lot of English and a lot of languages, it is because Christians used it. They took it straight out of Matthew where the Pharisees are called hypocrites over and over again, and they just take that into their own language. And then you have the Great Commission that ends the Gospel of Matthew that people might recognize. Matthew 28 18 Jesus meets the disciples in Galilee after his, after his resurrection, and he says, all authority in Heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the Holy Spirit and teaching them to obey everything that I've commanded you.

Speaker 1:          03:21          And remember, I am with you always to the end of the ages. So that's a very famous verse that is called the Great Commission because this is Jesus telling his disciples after his resurrection, go out and proclaim the gospel throughout the earth, not just to the Jews. So all these things make Matthew look very familiar even to people who may not know much about Christianity because this stuff that you see in our culture over again, Matthew, therefore is in at the same time a unfamiliar to people. If they start reading it carefully because it's the most Jewish of the Christian Gospels and the Gospel and that are in the Canon. That is, there are some other gospels from the ancient period that are even more Jewish than Matthew. Uh, but they didn't make it into the new testament. It's the most Jewish, and yet it's also at the same time, one of the most universals of the gospels because you've precisely have an ending with Jesus commanded the apostles to make disciples of all nations. That is all the gentiles too. So Jesus, in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus limits his ministry during his lifetime, pretty much to Israel. He's going to Jews and he makes this a point of this and the gospel of Matthew. But after his resurrection, then the message is supposed to go out.

Speaker 2:          04:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:35          So look also at the way that Matthew begins, I talked about this, the very first lecture of class. Matthew begins with the book of the Genesis of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham. So notice he calls him son of David as a descendant of the great king of Israel. Son of Abraham is the father of the Jews. And even the word, the Greek word there, the book of the Genesis, the genesis means the beginning. And of course it's the Greek term that was given for the first book of the Hebrew Bible when the, when they translated the Hebrew Bible in degree, genesis just means the beginning, of course in the Hebrew Bible is the beginning of the world, beginning of earth, the beginning of history. Matthew appropriates that term and he begins his own text with that same word, probably meaningful his readers to recall the book of Genesis in a way. And then you have what you, what we call an Aga da on Moses. The Term Aga is used in rabbinic scholarship.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Rabbinics, uh, work often divides up a lot of event materials into Halakha. And Aga Halaqah refers to the teachings that are about how you should live. A Aga though are stories that are about the patriarchy and great figures and they're meant to, to make a moral lesson or something like, but uh, they, they don't give straightforward teachings. They tell stories. And that's how Matthew starts out. All that stuff about the bay evil king wanting to kill the baby Jesus because he's afraid that it'll be a threat to him. Uh, people think of who does that remind you of? Who does that sound like? Uh, the, the, the child that comes out of Egypt, who does that sound like? These are all meant to remind you of Moses. And so Moses, Jesus is portrayed over and over again like Moses are like Joseph also from the Hebrew Bible.

Speaker 1:          06:28          And then again, you have the fulfillment of scripture motif. Now notice that in spite of the fact though that Mo Matthew has throughout Christianity been interpreted as actually a rejection of the law, the Jewish law, or it presents Jesus as a new Moses, but Christians so often taken that to say that Jesus is not only the new Moses who can fulfill his Moses, he displaces the old Moses. So Matthew's may have been put first in the, uh, Canon because it was read by Christians as being sort of almost like the new law, the new Torah. And so you have Jesus talking about the law, the Jewish law Torah, and also giving New Commandments. Christian Christians have taken that to mean the displacement of the Jewish Torah with now a new Christian Torah. And that's, and that that actually then puts Matthew in a very odd position. It's the of the different gospels in our Canon.

Speaker 1:          07:25          It's the most Jewish looking and sounding, and I'll emphasize that later in the lecture today, but Matthew has also been the source of some of the worst Christian antisemitism precisely by portraying Jesus as rejecting the law of Moses in much of Christian interpretation and substituting his own law. That's a Christian antisemitism. A notice it's from, as I said, is from Matthew that you get the idea that hip, the Pharisees are all hypocrites. And then that gets transferred to being that all Jews are hypocrites. You get the idea in Christianity traditionally that Jesus rejected the law because that's legalism. The Jews are all legalistic and we Christians are awful of grace and truth. So this idea that, uh, that the old testament represents a god of anger and a god of strictness and a God of judgment and the New Testament represents a god who's a father and loving and full of grace.

Speaker 1:          08:18          So this dualism that so much part of European history, even common sense, even people who are not religious will often come up with this caricature that the Old Testament God is the god of anger and judgment. The New Testament God is the god of grace and forgiveness. Well, that's just not true if you read either testament with any care at all. But Matt, the Gospel of Matthew has been one of the texts. It's been used in this way. And Remember it's in the gospel of Matthew the that you get the most anti Jewish and antisemitic line that's been used throughout western. His history when the Jews, when pilot wants to release Jesus from being crucified, the people, the Jews say his blood be upon us and our children, that became the Christian charge of Dia side. The Jews were then accused of killing God and especially in medieval Europe. So that Matthew's in this very peculiar place when it comes to the history of the interpretation of the New Testament, it is at the same time the most Jewish of our canonical gospels in many ways. And yet it's been used in Christian antisemitism more than any other gospel, possibly maybe with the gospel of John being arrival for that.

Speaker 1:          09:30          So look at the structure of Matthew though some people have even suggested that Matthew is an intentionally structuring his gospel to make it look like the Torah, the Jewish law, because there are five speeches by Jesus in Matthew. These, these same sayings you learned about the synoptic problem last week. Uh, if you take a synoptic problem kind of analysis of a lot of this stuff that are in some of these speeches and Matthew, they will, a lot of these sayings, my occurred in another context and Luke are in Mark Mathieu seems to have taken tradition mitten materials that were traditional Tim, that he found either in written sources or an oral, uh, literally, uh, oral sources. And he combines them into five separate speeches and some people say, maybe he meant he meant to reflect the five books of Torah. The PINTA Tuque is the, is the, uh, genesis, exodus, Leviticus, numbers.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Deuteronomy Pinot took is just the Greek word, meaning the five. So the first five books of Jewish scripture or called the pentitude, and maybe Matthew was imitating that in making five separate speeches for Matthew, for Jesus and his Gospel. First chapters five through seven, you have Jesus giving with the famous sermon on the mount. Then chapter 10, you haven't given a speech to his disciples about the mission to Israel. So all chapter fraternity is, here's how you're supposed to do your mission. When you go out to preach Israel, you'll be persecuted. This will happen. Do this, do that. Chapter 13 and Matthew is all parables, the parables that would, you'd find in different places. In Marker, Luke, Matthew kind of groups them into one chapter and had, and has Jesus kind of give it as one sort of speech. He likes neatness like this. If you look at chapter 18, it's another speech by Jesus again to his disciples.

Speaker 1:          11:12          And this one is mainly about church rules. Jesus talks about when your neighbor does something that you don't like, you go to their neighbor first, try to settle it peaceably. If you're neighbor won't receive you or won't settle, take it to the church and let the church handled it, you know, that sort of thing. So Jesus is giving instructions about how the church should be, should behave itself, and what the Church would be like. And then vert chapters 23 through 25, you get a very long speech by Jesus, which includes a big synoptic sermon. Remember last time I talked about mark 13 and about Jesus's prophecies of, of all this happening, uh, when the end of time would come in, the Messiah would swoop down in the clouds. Matthew takes over that speech from mark where he finds it. He adds a lot of materials on his own.

Speaker 1:          11:57          He also brings it up to date. Cause remember I talked about last time, mark didn't explicitly tell us about the destruction of Jerusalem and his gospel. You'll find that when we get to Matthew and Luke, they they put more stuff in there that shows they were writing after the time of mark and using mark as a source. So that's all in that chapter. But then there's all these long woes to the scribes and Pharisees, woe to the blah, blah, blah, woe to you do this. There's a whole section of that speech, so five different speeches that some scholars who even suggested may be designed to imitate the five books of the Pentateuch. But as I said, the ending of Matthew is universalizing. It takes this Israelite vision that you've seen all the way through the book and then university realizes it to the whole world. So it's a universalism to all that is firmly anchored in Judaism and the Torah. But what does the Torah, the law mean in Matthew? Look at five 17 I hope you did bring your bibles member. We're all bringing our bibles to class all the time because you have to check me out.

Speaker 1:          13:03          Most Christians are taught and most people just under the influence of Christianity have the idea that what Christianity is is the super session of Judaism. The thing that makes Jews and Christians alike, they both worship the same God. One of the things that makes them different is not only the the worship by Christians of Jesus, but also the neglect by Christians of the Jewish law. So Christians can eat shellfish. Bacon, pork, don't have to keep the sabbath. Is that the view of the law we find in Matthew five 17 do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have come not to abolish, but to fulfill. For truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of the letter will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Now, in a lot of Christian doctrine, what you're taught is that Jesus did fulfill the law in his own person, but that's not what he says here.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Notice until heaven and earth pass away. That's what he's talking about, the fulfillment of it. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the Kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of heaven. So Jesus is not saying, okay, I've come now you don't have to keep the Jewish law. He's actually teaching his own disciples and member. If Matthew didn't want this as a message to the members of his church, he wouldn't put it in his gospel. One of the things that I'm trying to teach you in my lectures is what does it mean to do an exegesis of this text? Because you're going to have to write x Jesus of your own and there's Friday your sexually is, we'll walk you through how to write an x Jesus paper.

Speaker 1:          14:47          But there are a couple of things that is not extra Jesus. It is not exit to try to figure out what actually happened. Did Jesus actually say this? Uh, Digi is actually believe that that's part of the historical Jesus quest, which we'll talk about later on in the semester too. ButX , Jesus doesn't do that. Extra juice doesn't assume you're trying to read the text to get behind the text for something that happened in history, nor does x, x, Jesus tried to figure out, is this true or not? It's we don't care if it's true or not. In an next Jesus class, what we want to do is what did the writer, what was the writer trying to do with this text? We have to imagine yourself in an ancient context. What would he have been saying to members of his own Christian community in the first century?

Speaker 1:          15:26          So this obviously means that we read this text is not Jesus necessarily teaching this. We don't know yet where the judge has actually taught this. Matthew could have gotten it from some written source from some oral sores. I could've just made it up. We'll talk about that problem later when we talk about the historical Jesus right now, we're not going to concern ourselves. We're just gonna say, Matthew could have written this, but we're trying to figure out what did Matthew you want to do with it? Woke this text, admit to them, and obviously it means this rider believes that the proper Gospel and the proper church should be a law abiding church. He acts, he's expecting people in his church not to do away with the Jewish law. Look, um, at the, uh, antitheses we call these the Mathian antitheses five 21. You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, you shall not murder and murder and whoever murdered shall be liable to judgment. But I tell you that the time of the law is over and it's okay to murder. That's not what it says, right? What does it say? Just shout it out.

Speaker 2:          16:35          What?

Speaker 1:          16:38          Don't even be angry. If you are angry with a brother or sister, you will be liable to judgment. And if you insult a brother, sister, do, it'd be a lab to the council. If you say, you fool, you'll be liable to hell. Fire. A lot of us are in trouble. A lot of us are in trouble. He's not saying I'm not. I'm getting rid of the law murders. Okay, now keep going. Uh, to the next, where am I? Five 27. You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery. But I say, that's okay. Adultery just fine. No, he says, but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in its heart. Wait, what?

Speaker 2:          17:23          MMM,

Speaker 1:          17:25          well, I'm gay, so I'm okay about that. But a lot of guys are in a lot of trouble. He's basically saying, no, not only is adultery not okay, even desiring her if she belongs to the man is not okay. That's not getting rid of the law. Look at five 38. You have heard it was said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say do not resist an evil doer. If anyone's strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other. Also, if anyone wants to sue you, take your coat. Give your cloak as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go the second mile. Give it to everyone who begs from you and you're not refuse anyone who wants to borrow anything from you. These antitheses had been read throughout Christian history by many people as as implying that Jesus is doing a way with this bad strict legalism of the Jewish law and he's teaching you a law of grace instead and forgiveness.

Speaker 1:          18:19          But that's not what's going in here going on here, right? What Jesus has done, he's not doing away with the law here. He's intensifying it. If it's hard not to commit adultery, and believe me, for a lot of people, it is hard not to commit adultery. It's even harder not to lust if it's hard not to murder someone. And if you knew some of the people who I have to work with around here, you'd know that it is hard not to murder someone. It's even harder not to be angry with them. And if it's hard not to retaliate, when someone knocks you down, it's even harder to let them knock you down again. Jesus has intensifying the Jewish Torah and it making it almost impossible to keep, but he's still expecting his disciples to keep it. So what Matthew presents Jesus is doing is not getting rid at all of uh, uh, the Torah, the Jewish law. He's intensifying it. Now there is one place, there are a couple of places where it sounds like Jesus is going again. So when the, you have a hand washing incident. Okay, let's look at that. And that's in 15 chapter 15, verse 17.

Speaker 2:          19:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          19:36          well, I think I have to start getting a bit. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          19:41          yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:42          yeah. We start being a little bit earlier.

Speaker 1:          19:53          Where is it? Yeah. The very first part of the chapter, the Pharisees scribes come to Jesus in Jerusalem and said, why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders for they do not wash their hands before they eat? He answered them, but why do you break the commandment? And he goes on to this sort of thing. And he basically says that they're not keeping the law perfectly themselves. That they should keep it a better. Verse 10, he said to the crowd, uh, he called the crowd to him and said to them, listen, understand it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person. It is what comes out of the mouth that defiles the person. Now in Mark's version of this story right around here, mark adds a little sentence. I remember when I talked about Marquis, he gives you little clues that you're really supposed to pay attention and hear mark is a little parents setical comment.

Speaker 1:          20:37          He says, by saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean. In other words, mark does a good little gentile Christianity move. He takes this saying of Jesus and he says, Jesus was declared all foods clean, so we don't have to keep kosher. Matthew doesn't do that. He saw that sentence in mark, but you eat this whole chapter, that sentence, which Matthew News and mark is not in Matthew. Matthew took that out. Why? Because he didn't want Matt, uh, Jesus to declare all foods clean because in his gospel, Jesus teaches that Christians have to continue keeping the law. So he does. Matthew has Jesus disagree with the scribes? And Pharisees, but what he says here is that it's much more important. Sure. Keeping Kosher may be important, but it's much more important what's going on in your heart and your mind. It's much more important what you say. So Jesus spiritualizes in a way or, or he, he again, he intensifies the law and he's saying, yeah, it's important to wash your hands.

Speaker 1:          21:32          Perhaps that, but that's not a big deal. It's important to pay attention to kosher, but that's not a big deal. He makes it a moral lesson that's not anti Jewish. That's not at all. You kind of, you have all kinds of Hebrew prophets in the old testament doing that kind of stuff all over the place saying things like, God doesn't want just your sacrifice. He wants your heart. This is the way Jesus is it preventative Matthew is just like a Jewish prophet and Israel like Prophet whose intensifying the law, who giving it a moral teaching, but he never teaches anything about giving it up. Then also,

Speaker 2:          22:07          mmm,

Speaker 1:          22:08          Jesus. Though also, besides being the one who teaches about Torah and he's being presented as Moses, a Matthew presents Jesus more than any other gospels as the founder of the church. In fact, if you, you'd look for the word Church and some of the gospels is very hard to find it because it's anachronistic. Jesus didn't go around his own life talking about the church the church developed after his death, but Matthew Retro rejects that conversation about the church and even the foundation of the church and sort of laws about the church into the mouth of Jesus. Look at chapter 16 verse 17 and this is one we already read very carefully in mark the same story.

Speaker 2:          22:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:47          Remember in Mark Jesus says to the disciples, who do people say that I am? And Peter says, well, so they pitch to some of them, say the Lij or some of them say one of the profits or something, say John the Baptist and just said, but who do you say that I am? And Peter says, you're the Messiah. And Jesus tells him, be quiet. And then Jesus rebukes him. When Peter tells him that he's not supposed to be crucified. Matthew takes that story again from mark, but notice how Matthew changes it. Uh, verse 13, when Jesus came up in the district sensory of Philippi, he asked his disciples, who do you say that I am? You get the story again and Jesus. But when Simon Peter says, you're the Messiah, the son of the living God, look what Jesus says in verse 17. Now in Matthew's version, remember in March version, Jesus said, okay, don't tell anybody.

Speaker 1:          23:32          Jesus said to him, blessed are you Simon, son of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father in heaven and I tell you, you are Peter. And on this rock, I will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail. It, I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Then he started to, uh, ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah. So between the, the, the command to silence, which came right after the confession in Mark Jesus. Matthew puts all this foundation of the church stuff. Now this is a very famous text that has caused all kinds of disagreement between Roman Catholics and Protestants. Roman Catholics take this text as teaching that Jesus particularly selected Peter as the first pope.

Speaker 1:          24:18          And when he says, I'm giving you the keys of the kingdom, it means the pope or the Bishop of Rome is the one who has the right to bind or loose like that Jesus is talking about here. Protestants rejected that interpretation and they said, well, no, he's talking, he's sure he's talking to Peter wants, but you're really talking to all the apostles. And in fact the, the issue of binding and Loosing is not, is given to the apostles, not just Peter. So there's a debate among prop between Protestants, Roman Catholics traditionally over this, oh, this passage, I think the debate kind of misses the point because I think Matthew's point is basically just to have Jesus be the one who found the church and puts it into the hands of his disciples. But that's, that's definitely one of the thing that Jesus does. And then in chapter 18 is I've already pointed out, you have a whole chapter where Jesus gives rules to the disciples for how the church should be run, how it should be organized.

Speaker 1:          25:11          But the church is also this mixed group over and over again. Matthew, you'll have, uh, you'll see a phrase that's only in Matthew where Jesus talks about little ones. And they also talked about people have little faith, but when Matthew also has a parable about the man goes out and he strose a field with seed and during the night his enemy comes and so's brambles and weeds, seeds in. And when it all comes up, the wheat comes up. But it's all mixed in with brambles and thorns and weeds. And so the, the servants, the slaves of the man come to the master and they say, what should we do? Should we try to weed out all the weeds stuff? Uh, and so we can gather the wheat into, try to trim it all out now. And Master says, no, don't worry about it now. Because if you try to pull up all the thorns and the brambles, you're bound to pull up some of the wheat too.

Speaker 1:          26:00          We'll just wait until the end until it's all ready. And then we'll harvest the whole thing and then we'll separate it out. And the wheat, we will keep it in store houses and the brambles on Darren's will burn in hell. So you're getting to the last little hellfire and brimstone sermon at the end. But the main part of the parable is that Matthew is saying is that the world and possibly even the church is a mixed bag. In other words, we're not. Everybody you see around you is truly who you think they are. So there are good and there's evil mixed together, but the, and you just got to live with that. So the church is a, is an organization that has uh, uh, both people have little faith and people of greater faith. It has maybe even weeds and wheat in it. So these are all concerns of what kind of, there's a whole group of parables in chapter 13, uh, that would call the mixed group parables of Matthew.

Speaker 1:          26:50          I know their particular to Matthew because Matthew seems to be making the point with these mixed group parables that the church itself is sort of a mixed group. Another important theme of Matthew, and I'm giving you several different major things in Matthew cause I'm going to ask in a moment, why are these things here? What does Matthew tried to do with these different things all together? So for example, why is is Jesus the law giver and still Jewish and teaches the tea, the tea, the acceptance of the Jewish law and yet this universalistic message at the end of the gospel of going to all nations. Another thing that exit Jesus is, is finding problems in the text and then using the text itself to try to find answers to those problems. That's what exit Jesus does. So why I'm setting up some of these themes of Matthew because these are going to be the problems that then I as the wonderful scholar and Xeg that I am, I'm going to swoop in with my angels on the clouds of Heaven at the end of the lecture and give you the answers to all the problems with Matthew and then you'll do that with your exit use papers later.

Speaker 1:          27:51          So one of the things that Jesus says, and also Matthew is a teacher. Mark had told us in his gospel that Jesus was a great teacher and people said, wow, he's a great teacher. He teaches not like the scribes and Pharisees. He teaches as one with authority, but mark didn't really tell us much of what Jesus taught. There are a few parables, a few controversies, but mark tells you that Jesus is a great teacher without presenting Jesus' teaching a lot. Matthew not only tells you Jesus is a good teacher, he presents a lot of teaching of Jesus. And so you, you get out a lot of that and then you get this interesting passage in chapter 13 verse 51 turn in your hymnals to 1351

Speaker 2:          28:34          yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:36          Have you understood all this? And this is toward the end of this big long parable chapter member. I told you that chapter 13 Matthew is where Matthew puts a ton of parables. So toward the end of this parable chapter, Jesus asked them, have you understood all this? They answered yes and he said to them, therefore, every scribe who has been trained for the Kingdom of Heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what does old. When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place. This is a parable that Matthew is putting in there, I think to give a hint to his readers. This is what Jesus was. Jesus was a good scribe. That's why Jesus talks about things like you have heard it said, but I say to you, Jesus is taking out of the Jewish scripture and taking out of the Jewish law the most important parts of it and emphasizing those and then adding some move his own teacher. So he's taking some of the old and some of the new, and that's what a good scribe is like, but Matthew also believes that he and his fellow disciples in his church should be that way too. He writes his Gospel to help people figure out how to imitate Jesus and being a good scribe, how to discern what of the old you should use and what are the new you should use.

Speaker 2:          29:53          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          29:53          but then there's this really the one of the last problem is I want to give is this really big problem in Matthew because Jesus is also something, well, just read on the surface. Jesus comes across as a bit like a coward in the gospel of Matthew.

Speaker 2:          30:09          Look at

Speaker 1:          30:11          Chapter Four Verse 12 in Matthew Chapter Four verse 12

Speaker 2:          30:22          yeah,

Speaker 1:          30:22          first in the first part of this chapter for you get Jesus going around preaching the Gospel. Come in doing some miracles in that sort of thing. He becomes very famous so that people hear about them. But then you get to 12 now, when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he got on his white charger and he rode to the prison and he sprang his friend John the Baptist out of prison, Indiana. Jesus. No, that's not what it says, right? He withdrew to Galilee and the word withdraw here is the Greek word for retreat. He retreated to Galilee because he heard that John had gotten arrested. He left Nazareth, made his home in Capernaum by the sea in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali. So that what had been spoken through the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled. And any quotes that first, uh, 17 from that time, Jesus began to proclaim repent for the Kingdom of Heaven has come near. In other words, Jesus retreats in the face of danger. He doesn't go toward it, but instead of retreating in hiding, he goes to another place and then he starts giving the message out. This is when he really first started his own preaching ministry. After John the Baptist is arrested. So notice what that happens there. Look again at now look at 1215 Matthew 1215

Speaker 1:          31:47          reading just a little bit above that. Um,

Speaker 2:          31:50          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:52          Jesus is disputing with the Pharisees and verse 14 says, but the pharisees went out and conspired against him. How to destroy him. Another threat this time from the farracies against Jesus. Verse 15 when Jesus became aware of this, he departed again. He withdrew. There's that word again. Many crowds followed him and he cured all of them and he ordered them not to make him known. This was to fulfill. Notice again, Jesus withdraws in the face of danger, but they're withdrawing in a sense, increases the ministry and an and an odd paradoxical way. And then look at 1413

Speaker 1:          32:32          well, I won't read that one. 1413 if you can look it up, that's another case of danger and Jesus withdrawing. But now let's do spend a little more time looking at chapter 12 because have you noticed that the gospel of Matthew likes to foreshadow things and fulfill things? The Gospel of Matthew likes to have Jesus do something and then he'll tell you something that was not in mark. He'll say this was to fulfill the scripture that said, for example, when Jesus and the holy family run off to Egypt, he then quotes to the fact that, and they come back, he says, out of Egypt, I will call my son a prophecy. So Matthew takes an old testament reference, a a Jewish scripture reference cause members, not the old testament yet is just Jewish scripture and he takes a quotation on that and saying, is fulfilled by Jesus?

Speaker 1:          33:16          So in the same way, um, in Matthew two 13 and 14, after they had left, this is after the Weizmann left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, get up. Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about, so the fleet, there's that word again, withdrawal. Even Joseph with Jesus retreats in the face of danger to Galilee. And then when he hears they'd come back, um, uh, in, uh, verse 22 of the same chapter. Now why is all this Jesus retreating? The other thing is if you look at 10, 23 g, we again get this same word when you're doing an exit. Jesus, you might want to use a concordance. You'll learn on, on Thursday or Friday in your sections what a concordance is and you're learning how to use it.

Speaker 1:          34:02          But basically you can, a concordance is a word is a book that takes all the words of the Bible of the Bible and shows you where they occur. And if you looked up withdraw and an English concordance, it would tell you every time in a certain English translation that the word withdraw occurred in Matthew, mark, Luke, and you can test them out. You'll also learn how to use an analytical concordance even if you don't know Greek, which will kind of give you an idea once you learn how to use it. What's the Greek word lying behind these English words? And if you did that, you could find out that these different English words that I've been reading from translate the same Greek word withdrawal on a [inaudible] on a car races. And so this, this word is here too. And in 10 23, you have Jesus in his instructions to disciples telling them that they also should retreat in the face of danger.

Speaker 2:          34:52          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:52          so what is all this going on? How do we take these different issues? Jesus has a, is almost a new Moses. Jesus teaching the disciples should keep the Torah, the law. Uh, but then Jesus, when he faces trouble, he was, he withdraws from trouble and he goes off someplace. But when he withdraws, he ends up preaching more and the Gospel is expanding. And then to disciples, Matthew believes will be the next version of Jesus. They also will be threatened. They also will be taught to retreat. They also will then go preach and they'll eventually go preach to the entire world in the form of the gentiles. So all of this is Jesus' first functions as a model for the disciples. The apostles and the apostles function as a model for Matthew and the members of his church. So what is all this doing here and why is it, what's the context in which this kind of picture of Jesus would make sense and we're going to spend a bit more time on one important passage. Matthew 1422

Speaker 2:          35:49          okay,

Speaker 1:          35:55          this is the famous story called the stilling of the storm. Now you will have, if you remember this, you can look at mark six 45 and it has the same story and if you took your parallel caught your parallel columns, one from mark and one from Matthew and you dig your little colored Pencil exercises you had last week for your section. It's very interesting to see what does Matthew add to mark story. And if you figure out what Marc Matthew added to mark story, you can really get an idea about what was Matthew's own editorial interests. Why did he take something out of mark? Tell it differently, add new stuff to it that gives you a great clue for what Matt do you want to say? Because remember, each of these riders is not just telling you stuff that happened because it happened. They each are writing a book intending to put across a theological message. And if you compare what Matthew says to what he gets from mark and see what he adds, and when he takes out, you have a really good idea of what his editorial messages, what his editorial concerns are. And we call this redaction criticism.

Speaker 1:          36:56          Redaction is just a fancy word for editing.

Speaker 2:          37:01          And why did,

Speaker 1:          37:03          why did scholars not call it editing criticism? Because we like two bit words when one bit words would work just as well. So it's redaction. Criticism is Rod, you'll sit in the scholarship. It just means paying attention to how the gospel writers edited their sources to get up their own message. So look at 14, 22 how many end? If you want, you can flip over to Matt. Mark six 45 and see that change. Or if you have Throckmorton, uh, you can look it up and Throckmorton some time, but here's, I'll, I'll indicate some of it immediately. He made the disciples get into the boat. This is after one of the feedings of a bunch of people and go ahead to the other side. While he dismissed the crowds, after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up to the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.

Speaker 1:          37:48          But by this time, the boat battered by the waves was far from the land for the wind was against them. Notice for the wind was against them. The boat is battered, the wind is against them. Some of these details won't be in mark. The basic story will be there, but this is this thing about the bolt being battered by the wind. The wind is against them. I don't think that's in mark, if I'm remember right and early in the morning he came walking toward them out on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified saying it is a ghost and they cried out in fear immediately. Jesus spoke to them and said, take heart. It is, I do not be afraid. And Mark Jesus and gets in the boat, stills the storm. And there they all say that Markin's it with his own a clue that they didn't understand.

Speaker 1:          38:30          They still didn't understand. So that's part of Mark's theme about misunderstanding. That's not the way Matthew isn't here. Notice what he says. Peter answered him. Lord, if it is you command me to come to you on the water. He said, come. So Peter got out of the boat, started walking on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he noticed the strong, when he became frightened and beginning to sink, he cried out. Lord, save me. Lord saved me. Hmm. Now the Greek word for saved me can mean just rescue me, save me from illness. But it also can mean save me like I need salvation. Same Greek word means both. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him saying to you, you a little faith. Ah, that methy include. So He, Matthew likes this little faith thing. So that's one of the things you see.

Speaker 1:          39:14          He's added here. Why did you doubt when they got into the boat, the wind ceased and those in the boat worshiped him and sa saying, truly you are the son of God. Now if you compare this, what you've got is some important different changes. First for example, I said the boat is beaten by the waves. That's not in mark. Why did Matthew add that? And then you have this whole verses 28 through 31 the whole thing with Peter and all that sort of thing that's not in Marc Mathieu added that whole little chunk and then in verse 33 it says they worshiped him and they had this confession truly are the son of God, which is a Christian confession, a famous German scholar, Gunther born calm. You don't need to remember, and one of his students wrote a very famous article published in the fifties in which they analyze this story and they said, if you read this carefully, this story is not about Jesus walking on the water and stilling the storm and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          40:09          This is a story Matthew intends for you to see the boat. It's almost a, it's a, it's like an allegory. It's almost like an allegory. The boat represents the church and Matthew sees the church as being persecuted. We've seen that theme throughout Matthew seven Jesus prophesized, the disciples will be persecuted. So the boat is persecuted and that's represented by the storm and the winds and the waves buffeting him and they're afraid. And Peter, who represents every Christian says, I want to be like you, Jesus, and I want to walk on water. I want to overcome all these problems. He gets out of the boat, but he doesn't have enough faith. He has a little faith and his doubt causes him to start sinking. When he does that, what should he do? He should cry out to Jesus and Jesus will save him. And then Jesus gets in a boat, calms the storm, and they worship him and confess him.

Speaker 1:          40:59          So born calm, used this redaction criticism. He was one of the first pioneers of using this method and calling it by this term to say, compare Matthew with what he gets from mark. And what you do is you see that what was just a miracle story? Just basic story about the power of Jesus has now become a moral story about the church and it's now become something that Matthew is writing to encourage his, his own church. They are small, lonely people have little faith. There are mixed group. Remember just some people in the church seem to have a lot more faith in other people in the church. Some people in the church may not even be true disciples after all. They're not yet perfect. One of the ways that Matthew Chain Matthew has, uh, uh, um, uh, saying that, uh, is different from Luke. They seem to both get it from queue.

Speaker 1:          41:52          Luke's version says, you should be merciful as your Father in Heaven is merciful. Does anybody happen to know what that comes out in Matthew in the sermon on the mount? You should be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect. Matthew has perfect and Luke has merciful. Again, we see bitty little bitty clues of how they write this. But Matt, that's Matthew telling his church, I know you're not perfect now, but God, Jesus calls you to perfection. They need more faith and according to Matthew's story, they do it by focusing on Jesus and worshiping him as the son of God as they should.

Speaker 1:          42:34          What I've done is walk through several different passages. In Matthew, an exit. Jesus wouldn't ask you to do all of those things together. You could write an extra Jesus paper on just one section of any of those things that I talked about, but notice what I've had to do. I've had to compare Matthew with mark and Luke. I've tried to figure out why. Why did Matthew include what he included and what did he, why did any of that stuff, why did he change things from mark? I've also said he, he probably used Q, this a hypothetical document because we find that we find that by comparing Luke and Matthew and I might guess at how whether Matthew has the more raw, original version of Q or where there Luca does, and I might try to imagine what was in queue and how Matthew May have changed that, edited that.

Speaker 1:          43:20          That's all of course pure speculation because we don't have cue as a physical document to actually compare it with like we've got mark as a physical document, but scholars still do that. But the purpose is to all the way through to figure out what does this author want to do. It's not concerned with whether he's telling us that correct history. We'll leave that for another day. And it's not to say whether it's true or not. And notice this, it's also not to come up with sappy Sunday school kinds of readings. This is the worst, the hardest thing for people to, to learn. And it notice it doesn't matter whether people have grown up in churches are not modern. People have just come to think that when you read this book, you're supposed to get Sunday school type sappy answers out of it. What does the meaning of this story while Jesus is teaching us to be to love one another?

Speaker 1:          44:06          Well, okay, yeah, maybe so, but dig deeper. Try to figure out, try to imagine a historical context in which a human author is writing the story this way. In order to do something socially in his own early community, we imagine an early Christian community and we imagine what problems they had by reading the text and then we see the text as being written consciously by an author to address those problems. And with Matthew, what you get is this. Matthew teaches that a Torah observant form of discipleship to Jesus. Now this will be very important because one of the themes of this whole course is that is that dye the dye who had the diversity of different early Christianity's. It's all, it's anachronistic in the first century to even talk about Christianity as one thing because as we'll show, there were different views of Jesus. There were different views of the Jewish law.

Speaker 1:          45:03          And what you'll see very quickly in this course is Matthew has one, has a very different view of what Christians should do with the Jewish law then does Paul or Luke or mark or John or several of the other writers? So one of the things that makes Matthew present a peculiar kind of Christianity when judged by the standards of Paul's kind of Christianity, is that Matthew teaches Jesus as teaching and a Christianity that observes Jewish Torah, even in, even if gentiles come in, which the gentiles do come in, gentiles must be expected to keep the law also. So we're, whereas Paul spent his whole career trying to get gentiles to say, to understand, no, you don't. You're not supposed to keep the Jewish law if you're a gentile. Jesus absolves you from keeping the Jewish law. Matthew is not that way. He sees gentiles coming into the church, but still being Torah observant.

Speaker 1:          45:55          So he has a Torah observant form of Christianity with Jesus as the recognized Messiah. Gentiles are included in Israel. They're not included as a separate church. Gentiles are brought into Israel. Uh, it looks like for Matthew and Matthew presents a church that is in conflict with other forms of Judaism, whoever the, I think Matthew was written after step near 70, certainly after the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. That seems pretty clear. Most of the scholars data to somewhere in the 80s, maybe not earlier than the year 80, maybe not let in the your 90 we're guessing on this, but the, it seems to be it has to be after 70, but he's in conflict with whoever is there still pharisees around. They're still scribes. There are other people who are offering a slightly different version of what it means to be Jewish. And that's the last thing that I'll say about this is that Matthew is not presenting a new religion.

Speaker 1:          46:46          He thinks what, what we would call Christianity is simply the right way to be a Jew. So what Matthew's presenting is a different sect within Judaism from the form of Judaism that's represented by the Pharisees or the Sadducees, perhaps some. A lot of people think that this addressees may have become extinct after the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem because the Sadducees were very, their power base was the temple. But if the Sadducees are still around, Matthew's presenting a different form of Judaism than they ex followed. He's preventing presenting a different form of Judaism represented by the Jewish writer Josephus or Phylo. But he is presenting a form of Judaism. In fact, scholars nowadays say Matthew not represent a new religion with his gospel. He actually represents a different Jewish sect.

Speaker 1:          47:37          Any questions? Yes sir. Does Matthew believe that gentiles should be circumcised? I think so because I can't imagine him teaching, um, uh, completely law observant. You know, when he says not one. Dot or tittle or jot of the law will pass away until I have an earth passes away. Well, any Jew at the time pretty much would have thought that circumcision was a very important part of Jewish law, not just a dot or a Tidel. So I think so you'll find lots of scholars who disagree with me, but of course they're all wrong. Any other questions? Okay. See you on Wednesday.
