00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.760
DR. DARLENE LIM: OK.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.000
All right.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.210
Well, thanks so
much to everybody

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.770
in the room who came
out and everybody

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.728
who's online virtually.

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:08.580
I really appreciate
your time in being here.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.980
So I am from NASA,
but my background

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.720
is actually as a
field scientist.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.280
And so I've been going
out to really interesting,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.475
kind of weird places
around the world basically

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.440
since I was a kid-- since
I was about 17 years old.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.530
And then luckily for me,
managed to kind of dovetail that

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.540
into a real adult
job, so to speak.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.240
But I still get to go out into
some really interesting places

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.240
that I'm going to be
talking to you about today.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.080
I primarily work
underwater, but I also

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.920
have now kind of
expanded my horizons.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.740
I work in deserts.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.780
I work in cold polar regions
on the surface as well.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.210
And we sort of, at NASA, have
used this opportunity where

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.210
we are out in these
field environments

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.050
doing research as a
mechanism by which

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.740
to learn how to do science
in extreme environments.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.490
And the idea is to
take the learning

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.160
that we gather from
these environments

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.710
and export them in terms
of how we set ourselves up

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.880
for success scientifically,
and also in terms of protecting

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.380
the people that are out there,
for when we actually go off

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.990
Earth into places like the
moon, to asteroids, and to Mars.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.270
So that's going to be sort of
the focus of my talk today.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.040
And one of the main
things that we contend

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.840
with when we move beyond
the earth are time delays.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.570
So, you know, I
remember using, whenever

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.290
I used to call my grandma,
or even when my boyfriend who

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.820
became my husband--
he went to Japan

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.080
and taught English in 1995
or something like that--

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.310
and speaking to him on
the phone there was always

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.140
that hiccup-- that
kind of time delay.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.184
So irritating.

00:01:35.184 --> 00:01:37.100
And that's just having
a regular conversation.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.740
When you start to inject
in a known time delay,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.340
moving from let's say lunar
circumstances where you have

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.590
a second delay one way,
which is, you know,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.220
two plus seconds return, or if
you're moving to an asteroid

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.200
where it's 50 seconds
one way delay,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.600
and then outwards to Mars, where
it could be 10, 15, 20 minutes,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.210
it gets problematic,
especially if you

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.350
have humans at the other end who
need to respond to others that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.110
are sitting on Earth and
dealing with information

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.770
and trying to get
information back.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.562
So what we do out in
the field is basically

00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.645
what I'm going to talk to
you about today in terms

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.669
of learning how to
contend with those issues

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.734
when you have lots of scientists
who are very demanding,

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.900
real engineering issues,
and people at the other end

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.233
who have to stay alive, and
how do we deal with all that

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.530
when we're in the field.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.050
Let me expand this so we
can see the big slides.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.440
So as I mentioned very
quickly in my intro,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.630
the three places
that have come up,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.650
which depending on the
flavor of the month

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.990
we are or are not allowed
to speak about in terms

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.700
of a destination, but you
will hear in the corridors,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.790
tends to be the moon, Mars,
and the moon of Mars even,

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.840
or an asteroid.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.530
These are all the long-term
human exploration targets

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.720
that we're interested in.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.470
There are various
reasons why we might

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.386
want to go to each of
these different targets.

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:53.340
The moon is close
by, so to speak.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830
It is somewhere
that we can get to

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.246
within a reasonable
amount of time

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:58.190
and come back if there's
some safety issues.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.990
Asteroids have been
a number of reasons

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.740
that are listed, whether it's
from the planetary sciences

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.180
to maybe economic
reasons that we

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.734
may want to go to an asteroid.

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.900
One mission that you may
or may not have heard about

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.580
is called the Asteroid
Retrieval Mission or ARM,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.790
which is actually capturing
a near-Earth asteroid

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.933
and bringing that back
nearby to the moon in one

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.080
of the what's called
the Lagrange points.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.070
And then Mars.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.730
Mars has always been on our
kind of, I guess, vision path.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.229
And even outside of NASA.

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.270
I mean, you may have read
lots of different books

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.545
and have thought
about it yourself

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:32.420
in terms of an interesting
destination to go.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.130
Whether or not it's just to
get there or for the science,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.840
it may be a very
interesting place

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.020
to investigate for signs
of past life or present day

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.010
life within our solar system.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.390
So those are some of the
regions that we want to get to.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.060
But in all cases-- well, I
can actually click, I think.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.230
In all cases, we are
going to be dealing,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.280
as I mentioned, with varying
degrees of communication

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.000
latencies, whether it's
ranging from a lunar surface,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.850
as I mentioned 1.2
seconds is the closest

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.660
kind of one-way light time
delay that you would experience,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.270
all the way to if
you were operating

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.200
say on the moons of Mars where
you'd get up to 186 seconds

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.230
or at an asteroid where it's
50 second one-way delay.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.839
So you multiply that by two,
and you've got difficulties.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.800
And times two that is
just the bare minimum

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.240
of what you're dealing
with in terms of the delay

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.530
that one would have in making
a decision that's a group team

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.770
decision between those
that are out in the field

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.590
and those that are actually
sitting back home ensconced

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.190
in the safety of Earth.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.330
So what we're doing within
our field programs--

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.900
and I'm going to show you
in a couple of slides--

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.890
is actually focusing
on understanding

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.640
the operational
concepts that we need

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.880
to support humans and
robots working in tandem

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.550
or working in sort
of a phase way

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.210
out in extreme environments.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.080
And so there's a
couple of terms that'll

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.630
keep coming up that I wanted
to define early on in the talk.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.890
One of them is Concepts of
Operations or ConOps, which

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.405
are defined as these
operational design elements--

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:08.530
how you organize people,
how you actually flow them

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.660
through different pathways
when you are doing

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.840
different tasks-- as well
as the term capabilities.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.080
So this can be defined as any
functional aspect of a mission,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.020
ranging from
hardware to software.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.650
So we will look at what
are the capabilities that

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.510
are required to support
humans and robots working

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.317
in these extreme
environments as well as

00:05:27.317 --> 00:05:29.400
what are the concepts of
operations-- the ConOps--

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.470
that are needed as well.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.780
So there are a
variety of different

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.560
what are called analogs
within the NASA family.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.800
They do different things.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.920
They serve different purposes.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.930
And some of them have
really nifty acronyms

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.550
such as NEEMO as
Chris mentioned.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.140
But they all kind of
join up to one big loop

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.150
of transfer of knowledge.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.740
So NEEMO is actually
conducted-- these

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.990
are some images from
the NEEMO test site

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.740
out in the Florida Keys.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.494
And this test or this analog
makes use of the Aquarius base.

00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:06.910
I don't know if you guys have
heard about this Aquarius is

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.150
actually a submerged base.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.576
It's about 60 feet underwater,
and it's out in Florida Keys,

00:06:11.576 --> 00:06:12.200
as I mentioned.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.620
And people have used
this over the years

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.510
to basically learn about
these aquatic-- the marina

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.711
environment by actually being
ensconced in it through the day

00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:23.210
and night.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.710
And they will
actually live in there

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.400
for like 7, 14 days at a time.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.910
So everyone from offspring
of Jacques Cousteau

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.589
to James Cameron to like
real scientists and so forth

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.130
have used this
environment over time.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.180
And so NASA uses
it as well in order

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.820
to send out their aquanauts into
this micro-gravity environment

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.707
so that they can learn about
different sort of hardware

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:48.290
support elements that one would
need when you're out operating

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.100
on say the moon or an asteroid.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.130
So that is one really
interesting analog

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.480
that I've had the pleasure
of being involved with.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.060
And then another is actually
this thing called Desert Rats.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.290
So this is based in and
around the Flagstaff region

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.450
in Arizona.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.310
And the intent here is
to actually sort of use

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.820
these larger hardware that
are being built-- things

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.640
like this what's called a
Space Exploration Vehicle.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.292
It's an analog to a
pressurized vehicle

00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:18.750
that we may want to drive around
on the surface of the moon

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.480
or Mars or actually use as a
free flyer into an asteroid.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.050
It will keep your astronauts
nice and safe and cozy

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.530
within this pressurized
environment.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.840
And you can drive around
for quite a distance

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.199
and then actually have
people exit that vehicle

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.240
and go on what's called
extravehicular activities

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.490
or EVAs.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.780
So these two test
environments are actually

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.400
used as field tests
for the engineers.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.880
And they also do, at the
Johnson Space Center,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.520
a lot of lab experiments--
simulations on whether

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.890
that's-- I'll show you a couple
of pictures in a moment--

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.230
tying people up and actually
having them on a tether

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.132
and mimicking, once again,
this micro-gravity environment

00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:00.840
and trying to use
different tools to say,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.190
sample an asteroid.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.520
So all of these are very
engineering focused.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.940
And where we come in with
the Pavilion Lake Research

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.139
Project, which is the
topic or the project

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:11.180
that I'm going to be
spending most time on today,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.580
is that we offer a
basis of real science.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.250
And so what that does is
there are different tests that

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.000
go on at these three
fields sites that

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.970
lead to learning in terms
of what are the best ConOps

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.550
and capabilities that the
engineers have identified

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.260
to support different
EVA capabilities?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.289
And then they come to
us and they say, OK.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.600
So what happens if
we're doing science?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.990
Do these learnings
actually still hold?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.330
Are they still worth what
we think they're worth?

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.190
And so we will go underwater
into Pavilion Lake

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.990
and conduct our science and
actually absorb their learning

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.110
and test it there.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.220
So that's this kind of nice
little family of NASA analogs

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.570
that are still in operation
and working together.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.900
So some of the concepts
that are being tested

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.610
at NEEMO, at Desert
Rats previously, as well

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.260
as in the lab, are, for example,
this is an asteroid mission

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.070
where you have an
asteroid that's actually

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.260
in anchored into the asteroid
itself, working along a grid

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.130
and examining it, and figuring
out which samples to collect.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.390
Another possible scenario
for going to an asteroid

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.590
is where you have this
pressurized vehicle

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.290
with an arm at the end.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.490
And this arm is actually
supporting ask an astronaut,

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.120
and then free-flying
the astronaut

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.420
into a specific site
of interest and then

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.650
having them kind of
examine it based on that.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.180
So they will go through, in
these NEEMO and Desert Rats

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.540
environments, and test
these different scenarios.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.380
They have like seven,
10 different conditions

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.730
that they'll look at at
any one point in time.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.420
They deal with everything
from one person

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.900
at a base that's kind
of orbiting or nearby

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.740
to an asteroid,
and then two people

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.060
going on EVA to, for
example, two SEVs coming

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.040
in-- free flyers-- and actually
supporting the EVA that way.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.814
So what's used are metrics.

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:05.980
This is a bit of an eyesore.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.674
I apologize.

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:08.840
These are slides that have
been absorbed for my NASA

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.485
presentations where we
love tiny, tiny text.

00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:14.660
It's like if you
squint you can see it.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.320
Apparently it's not valid
unless it's tiny and prolific

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.660
in terms of text.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.350
But anyways, we will
look at everything

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.730
from the simulation
itself and what kind

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.700
of quality of simulation
did we actually conduct.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.680
So for example, if we're
connecting a simulation

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.230
and, let's say, the
network is down, well

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.330
that's a poor simulation.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.470
I mean, we didn't
simulate anything

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:36.720
because everything was broken.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.422
So that's a very
simple anecdote,

00:10:38.422 --> 00:10:40.630
but those are the types of
things that will make sure

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.894
that we score before we
move on to the other ratings

00:10:43.894 --> 00:10:44.560
that we collect.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.910
We look at the acceptability
of the simulation as well

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.900
as the capabilities themselves,
and we assess those.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.740
And as we use
those metrics we'll

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.060
actually use them
in very set moments

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.270
in time during our
simulations themselves.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.140
So we move from the lab, as I
mentioned, out into the field.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.450
You see here there's actually
the free flyer testing

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.805
one of those conditions.

00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.600
And, of course,
this free flyer is

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.470
roving with wheels on
the surface of the desert

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.330
and connected to an
astronaut right here who's

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.580
working under different
types of time constraints.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.600
So they may only have 20 minutes
to be out there or two hours

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.830
to be out there depending on the
condition that they're testing.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.030
These are some more images, once
again taking the lessons that

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.420
are learned from
Desert Rats where

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.060
one great thing about that
environment is that, of course,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.881
if anything goes wrong they're
above-- they're on the land,

00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.380
you can breathe the air, there's
nothing dangerous about it.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.000
But they will take the
lessons from Desert Rats

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.030
and test it
underwater, where you

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.910
are dealing with some
real, intrinsic dangers.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.410
And so the kind of fidelity or
the realness of the simulation

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.320
increases just that much
more and is that much more

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.390
similar to operating in space.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.000
And so in this case, this
is called a Deep Workers

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.080
Single Person
Submersible, and there's

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.830
a boom off the front
here with an astronaut,

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.100
or an aquanaut-- pardon
me-- connected at the end.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.170
And so we'll test
different ConOps once again

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.390
under these more
real conditions.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.020
This is an image here
of a lab-based test

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.350
that post-NEEMO was
used to actually examine

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.840
some of these
collection mechanisms

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.790
as well as the idea of being
tethered on an astronaut--

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.710
pardon me-- an asteroid.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.840
So what has been found
that we have since

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.450
absorbed within the science
program is the following-- that

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.410
to summarize really, astronauts
like to be independent.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.540
And so what we've found
is that these types

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.570
of modes where you have
people that are actually

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:45.730
on the end of a boom, while
the rate is acceptable--

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.570
let me show you what happens
a little later on here--

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.790
is that the crew
actually ends up

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.000
preferring you know
these types of scenarios

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.480
where you have a
couple of people

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.660
back in this SEV supporting
a crew member at the end,

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.540
whether they're
untethered or tethered.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.560
Folks just-- this
seems to be the most

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.830
proficient and
efficient way to work

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.736
in terms of
surveying an asteroid

00:13:09.736 --> 00:13:11.110
and then actually
having somebody

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.380
back within this deep space
kind of connection point

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.880
serving as a relay
back to Earth.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.659
And so they went
through and tested

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:21.950
these different scenarios
and then came to us and said,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.700
OK, well, we want to test out
this particular scenario here,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.380
but we want to do it within
a real science environment.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.580
So this is where the Pavilion
Lake Research Project comes in.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.640
So PLRP, as I
mentioned early on,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.500
is a project that's
based in science.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.060
We have been there for 10 years.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.060
We've been really lucky.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.460
We've cycled through
different modes of funding

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.570
and managed to create
a long-term program.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.500
And the essence of
it was to examine

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.160
something called microbialites.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.580
Microbialites are-- the first
part of the word, microbe,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.730
and then the second part
of the word-- pardon

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.310
me-- part of the word,
-ite, infers rock.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.900
So they're rocks that
are built by microbes.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.850
And we have been examining these
rocks-- these microbialites--

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.350
within Pavilion Lake because
they are within our Earth's

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.420
rock record the earliest
and longest lasting

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.982
kind of macro
indications of life.

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:19.440
So you may have heard about
Shark Bay and the stromatolites

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.460
there and some of the old
fossilized stromatolites

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.920
within, let's say, the Mojave
Desert or in Australia.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.230
So those are rocks
that have been built up

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.004
over time by microbes
and show us really strong

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.420
evidence that life
has been around

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.160
on our planet for over
2.5 billion years, three

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.000
billion years, that
sort of time frame.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.019
So when we think about going
to somewhere like Mars,

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:41.560
those are the types
of things that we

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.090
may want to look for if we're
looking for past signs of life

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.800
are these rock records.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.770
So the cool thing about Pavilion
Lake is that in a modern sense,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.060
microbialites have been found
in very extreme environments,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.260
typically high salinity,
high alkalinity.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.670
But this lake in Canada
is 4 and 1/2 hours

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.340
eastbound of Vancouver.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.250
People live by the lake.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.290
It's pH of about 8.3.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.330
People will drink in it.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:06.871
They'll swim.

00:15:06.871 --> 00:15:07.960
They'll water ski in it.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.980
And yet, if you put
your heads under water,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.970
it's like you're going
back through time millions,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:13.750
billions of years.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.090
You have very, very large
microbialites there.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.080
So that was why we initially
went to Pavilion Lake.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.530
But I've been part of this
project since its inception,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.560
and I have a very
kind of a longstanding

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.520
since I was a kid
interest in exploration,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.740
and that's why I went to NASA.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.000
And so we found that, while
we were there operating

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.410
underwater, that this was a
fantastic environment by which

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.670
to offer that sort of
testing environment

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.880
to the other operational
groups at NASA.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.344
And so that's how we've become
part of the analog community.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.760
So this is a lot
of text that I'll

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.301
skip through that
basically says what

00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:50.150
I've said-- that
we're science driven.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.483
But just to give you a bit
more of an overview for those

00:15:52.483 --> 00:15:55.240
who are interested in the
science, this is Pavilion Lake.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.610
It's a lake that's almost
six kilometers long,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.830
and it drops down at its
deepest point to over 200 feet.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.340
It's not a terribly deep
lake, but it's deep enough

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.250
that it's challenging for us.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.420
So we've moved through a
bunch of different assets

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.240
as was quickly shown
to you in that video

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.221
to explore the lake for
the purposes of science.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.470
These are the microbialites
and were pictures of them.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.053
And they range in
size from, you know,

00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:18.560
these are maybe the size
of a football all the way

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720
to the deeper sections
of the lake where

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.160
we're getting to
30 or 35 meters,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.320
and these are nearly six
feet across and just over

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.470
six feet high.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.750
So these have been
growing in this lake

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.120
for almost 12,000 years or so.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.580
And nobody really
knows why it is

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.769
that this lake is
supporting these structures,

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:40.560
and that's what we've
been there over time.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.560
We certainly know a lot
more about the chemistry

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.560
and so forth that
is supporting it.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.641
So we're working
at different levels

00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:48.140
in the lake in terms
of the science.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.030
And this is going
to be important

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.530
as we go through the talk, so
it's why I wanted to show you

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.022
that we're not only working
at these kind of macro scales

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:56.230
where we're trying to
understand the different shapes

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.266
and sizes of the
microbialites in the lake

00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.640
and what they're
associated with,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.150
whether it's weird chemistry
in different parts of the lake,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.899
different types of
topography in the lake,

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:06.240
or what's called
bathymetry, or if there

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.180
are different organisms
that are associated

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.740
with the surface
of these structures

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.369
themselves that are causing
these different shapes

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:13.890
and sizes.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.950
So some of our scientists are
looking at the different layers

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.359
down to millimeter,
sub-millimeter scale,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.380
and trying to understand
the carbonate that's

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.950
being generated
by these microbes

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.450
and whether or not there's
a signature of life that's

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.640
being left behind and
whether we can associate

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.460
that with different organisms.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.379
So all of that plays
back into astrobiology,

00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:33.920
but it's challenging,
as I mentioned,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.820
the lake drops down
to over 200 feet.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.950
It's pretty long.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.030
And when we first got there
in '04, we only thought that

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.320
the microbialites were in one
very small section of the lake.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.050
So we started just kind of
investigating a little bit

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.800
around where we were
initially working in,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.200
discovered that, in fact,
although there was a paper that

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.230
first came out in 2000
that described that very

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.862
small swath, we discovered that
there were microbialites all

00:17:55.862 --> 00:17:57.570
the way down to the
200 foot depth, which

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.710
is just as the light
starts to peter out.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.310
And that was important
to us because we

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.830
figured that the
microbialites petered out

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.690
further up around 80 to
90 feet, because that's

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.770
where the incoming light
really started to diminish.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.160
But in fact, there are
microbialites that are actively

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.660
growing even at the kind of
deepest depths of the lake.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.520
So suddenly what that
did for a science is it

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.080
made it very interesting
but very difficult

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.110
for us to really get
at the knowledge who

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.460
wanted to get at just using
divers or just using robots.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.292
So we managed to kind of work
with three different assets--

00:18:31.292 --> 00:18:32.750
the autonomous
underwater vehicles,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.280
these deep workers,
and then scuba divers.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.960
And we move through
different phases

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.130
of the program with
these different assets.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.360
So the submersibles allowed
us to put scientists-- yes.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.860
Go ahead.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.110
Sorry.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.110
AUDIENCE: You had
intellectual resolution.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.570
DR. DARLENE LIM: Yes.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.380
AUDIENCE: What is?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.260
DR. DARLENE LIM: Thanks
for asking the question.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.634
So the question
for those who are

00:18:52.634 --> 00:18:54.870
out there is what
on this slide does

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.910
real time intellectual
resolution mean?

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.410
It's totally made
up, but what it is

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.820
is something that we were
interested in examining

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.810
in terms of the
return to our science.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.114
So when you look at
a diver, the diver

00:19:07.114 --> 00:19:08.905
can only stay under
water at-- the altitude

00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:10.925
of this lake is at 2,800 feet.

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:13.100
It's very cold-- four
degrees Celsius-- for maybe

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.300
like 20 to 40 minutes at best.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.510
But they can get in real nice
and close with their subject.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.370
And they are usually very highly
trained in terms of the science

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.990
and so forth.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.160
So there are
intellectual resolution

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.750
in terms of their ability to
think about what they're seeing

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.960
and absorb it and consider
maybe new hypotheses or test

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.060
hypotheses in real time
was medium to high.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.620
Now when we think about getting
down to depths of 200 feet,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.734
we can't actually put
divers breathing air down

00:19:41.734 --> 00:19:43.150
at that level
without putting them

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.330
through decompression dives.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.660
And so what we decided to do
is move into this deep worker

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.390
phase of the
program where we put

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.140
the scientists into
this environment here.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.360
So it's actually, in terms of
the work that we were doing,

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.170
which was mapping,
and our ability

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.110
to interact with our
environment very intimately,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.120
once again this, in
a real time basis,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.900
it was sort of a medium
to high rating as well.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.090
The AUV, which was--
you know, it's a robot.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.590
You just program
it, and it goes out

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.590
and it collects data for
you in terms of imaging

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.170
or [INAUDIBLE] sonar,
whatever you want.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.090
We were actually expecting
it to be exactly the tool

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.840
that we needed and
that we didn't actually

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.510
have to put people underwater.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.417
But we found it very limited
in terms of what it returned.

00:20:25.417 --> 00:20:27.500
This doesn't show up very
well on the screen here,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.410
but we got black and
white images back

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.740
of high definition
black and white images.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.540
But it still didn't
give us the opportunity

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.830
to understand the morphology
or the shapes and sizes

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.440
as they pertained to
different regions in the lake

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.310
and get to the
science we wanted to.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.180
So this was part of our
justification, part of our real

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.090
thought process, to really take
ourselves to whether or not

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.050
we should be actually
putting these types of assets

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.130
under water and so forth.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.840
We wanted to be diligent
and methodical about it.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.780
Let me turn the page here.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.440
The phase that
we're in right now

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.480
is we've gone through
the initial exploration,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.900
we've put our submersibles--
our AUVs-- in the water,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.860
and now we've actually
had a whole slew

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.090
of papers come out
examining the microbialites

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.170
at different stages.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.430
And we have moved
into a phase now where

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.086
we're using the deep worker
mapping data and honing in

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:16.960
on different regions of
the lake that we want

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.270
to visit and collect samples
from in a similar way that we

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.274
did when we first started
exploring the lake where we're

00:21:23.274 --> 00:21:25.690
actually sampling down to the
millimeter or sub-millimeter

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.620
scale.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.220
But what's cool,
as I mentioned, is

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.826
that the physical, as it
says up here, are the mental

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:33.200
and the operational rigors
that are associated with scuba

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.550
diving are very, very similar
to operating in space.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.600
This is why NASA actually
puts all of their astronauts

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.060
through a lot of rigorous
underwater testing.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.460
And before you can even go
out of the International Space

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.740
Station to do a space walk,
you will spend hours-- hundreds

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.050
of hours underwater at
the Neutral Buoyancy Lab

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.000
at the Johnson Space Center
operating and kind of fixing

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.200
or doing whatever it is
you have to do on that EVA

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.510
but in this underwater
environment.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.370
So what we have done
previously prior to the phase

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.560
that we're in right
now in terms of looking

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.540
at remote operations
between a science

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.440
team and those
operating under water

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.980
and the latency effects
that we talked about

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.190
that we have been
simulating is as follows.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.326
So we've had the
submersibles underwater,

00:22:17.326 --> 00:22:18.950
and we have a chase
boat on the surface

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.820
so we always know where
this submersible is.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.040
And we also have information
passing through a tether that

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.950
includes high definition
video, as well

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.870
as the voice of the
submersible pilot.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.540
And on board of this chase
boat here, we actually

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.240
have what's called an
inter-vehicular CAPCOM.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.900
And so what that person does
is they are meant to mimic,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.240
as I showed you earlier on, the
role of the astronaut sitting

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.350
within that pressurized or
free flyer kind of vehicle.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.820
And that person is the
direct connection or voice

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.590
to this pilot who's
within the sub itself.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.710
And the IV CAPCOM
role is extremely

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.230
important, as it is currently
during regular NASA missions,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.590
is that they have to have
sort of a couple of rules.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.590
They have to be empathetic.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.400
So typically they're
also an astronaut.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.659
They've also been underwater.

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:12.200
But they also have to have the
kind of intellectual knowledge

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.860
of the environment that they
can help this person in a very

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.230
rapid fire way so that
the science that we need

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.480
is retrieved.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.210
The information is then
actually sent by Wi-Fi

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.550
back to this 56-foot
trailer that's

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.380
sitting on shore
at Pavilion Lake.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.180
And there are a
bunch of scientists.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.420
So we've had 20 to 30 scientists
sitting, examining the data

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.720
as it comes back.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.780
But this link here
is actually delayed.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:41.140
So we've delayed that during the
sub ops by 50 seconds one way.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.850
And that actually sounds
like nothing, but what it did

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.250
is created a whole lot
of mess when we initially

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.250
started testing
this configuration.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.274
People were stepping
on each other.

00:23:50.274 --> 00:23:52.190
You would wait for the
response and you'd say,

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.260
did you copy that?

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.760
Wait.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.680
Wait.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.510
Did you copy that?

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.384
And then you'd be
responding, and it was just

00:23:57.384 --> 00:23:58.290
a complete mess.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.960
So what we ended
up having to do is

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.170
institute a lot of different
operational, I guess,

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.550
kind of constraints into
how we spoke to each other

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.800
during these latencies.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.960
So we would do things like
actually say 30 second morning.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.080
There's going to be a
transmission coming through.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.050
And then the person
in the submersible

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.860
would stow their equipment.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.680
They would put
themselves into a hover.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.520
They would put their
muffin to one side.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.910
And then they could wait
for that incoming ding,

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.924
and then the
conversation would start.

00:24:28.924 --> 00:24:30.590
And once that starts
then you're kind of

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.999
locked into a conversation.

00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:33.290
And then when it ends, it ends.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.610
But at least there's
no misunderstanding

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.110
or miscommunication
in terms of when

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.670
something starts and stops.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.494
This is all common sense, and
it sounds a bit ridiculous.

00:24:41.494 --> 00:24:42.660
At least we're figuring out.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.743
We're like, well, come on.

00:24:43.743 --> 00:24:45.370
But the thing is,
nobody had actually

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.710
ever done delayed
communication of this sort

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.330
before-- underwater, under
these types of circumstances.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.230
There had been
other tests, but not

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.170
under this type of real
scientific return environment

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.970
where there were graduate
students sitting back here that

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.090
required the data to come back,
required certain information

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.940
to come back to them, otherwise,
they wouldn't graduate.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.180
So it's a real
additional pressure

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.820
aside from the pressure
of being underwater.

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:20.290
We also figured out during this
first test, which was in 2011,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.730
that the second point here that
I'm going to talk to you about

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.450
is that depending on the
operation at hand-- so

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.400
whether it was doing sort
of long range mapping

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.720
and that communication
between the sub pilot

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.110
and the scientists
above on the surface,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.060
or if it was actually going
in to sample something--

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.660
we would actually hand
off operational control

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.210
between the IV CAPCOM that was
on the surface or those people

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.539
that were sitting on shore.

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:47.830
And when there's something
that's much more high tempo,

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.690
we really had to
hand off to those

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.180
that were all on the lake.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.050
So everything ended
up getting controlled

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.150
by this group of
individuals here

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.750
who are in real time non-delayed
communication with each other.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.370
Once again, sounds
very common sense,

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.960
but nobody had actually done
that experiment in the past.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.190
And so all of this information
has since been carried forward

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.880
to all of the NEEMO tests
and other simulations that

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.680
have been done at
JSC, and are now

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.340
getting incorporated
into the general kind

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.090
of operational planning for
deep space missions for humans.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.020
So where we are
right now is we just

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.280
got back in June of this year.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.550
We went back to Pavilion Lake,
this time solely operating

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.844
with scuba divers and
remotely operated vehicles.

00:26:29.844 --> 00:26:31.510
And so what we did
here, as I mentioned,

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.750
is we've gone back and
actually identified regions

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.800
of the lake that are of
interest to us to sample

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.646
at high resolution.

00:26:37.646 --> 00:26:39.020
And we have a
couple of questions

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.350
that we're now trying to
ask that are still related

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.280
to whether or not our
communications protocols,

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.980
our operational
protocols, and so forth,

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.790
are still relevant when you
go from dealing with people

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:55.396
in these free flyers to now
a situation where it's really

00:26:55.396 --> 00:26:57.270
make it or break it when
you have people that

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.940
are outside of the submersibles.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:03.000
When they are diving we
cannot move beyond the, say,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.980
20 minutes that they
have underwater.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.650
That will push the
limits of the dive,

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.990
take them into
decompression mode.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.390
It creates a whole lot of
difficulties the same way

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.650
that it does if you're
out as an astronaut on EVA

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:16.520
and you only have nine hours.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.000
The fundamental
difference for us

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.250
operationally is that in the
sub, if something goes wrong,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.040
you actually can be in there
very happily for six hours.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.620
If you have to,
in emergency mode,

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.110
you can be in
there for 72 hours.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.640
As a diver, that's it.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.880
You only have that 20 to 40
minutes, depending on the dive,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.520
and then you really
have to surface

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.990
or all hell breaks loose.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.790
So the tempo very
much changed for us,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.740
and the kind of
complexity of what

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.154
we were trying to do
actually increased,

00:27:45.154 --> 00:27:47.570
despite the fact that we weren't
putting these large scale

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.747
assets underwater.

00:27:48.747 --> 00:27:50.455
So the set up that we
have-- actually I'm

00:27:50.455 --> 00:27:51.830
going to go forward
to this slide

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:58.290
first-- was to test this
operational or this ConOp that

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.880
has been designed through
NEEMO and Desert Rat's work

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.325
to mimic a trip to an asteroid
or to the moons of Mars.

00:28:06.325 --> 00:28:08.450
And so in this case, you
have a science team that's

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.824
sitting on the
earth, and there's

00:28:09.824 --> 00:28:12.420
a latency or delay
between the science team

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.260
and those that are actually
out, let's say, on the asteroid.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.462
And you would have a
couple of people sitting

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.170
in this deep space
station here, and they

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.530
would be acting as
your IV communication

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.644
with the extra vehicular
crew and communication

00:28:23.644 --> 00:28:24.560
with the science team.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.420
So they would split duties.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.410
And then you'd actually have
potentially two divers out,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.630
maybe one in a free
flyer, or both on EVA.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.950
And so they wanted us to
test this configuration,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.580
and that's exactly what we did
in that we had, once again,

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.210
a chase both with
these two IV people

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.850
sitting here on
the boat, and then

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.280
two divers underwater
supported by other divers.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.120
And then all of the science
team was actually back onshore

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.960
receiving the data.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.510
So what we ended up
doing is actually

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.700
going through a variety
of different tests.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.080
I'll show you this video which
shows you the Neutral Buoyancy

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.130
Lab that I spoke about
earlier on in order

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:04.190
to prep ourselves to get
to the field the summer.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.818
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:06.818 --> 00:29:09.000
So a lot of work went
into actually designing

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.230
the operations, the
communication structure, and so

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.739
forth.

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:17.030
And then we took ourselves
to the Neutral Buoyancy Lab,

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.565
which is a pool which
is over 60 feet deep.

00:29:19.565 --> 00:29:22.340
It has a full-scale mock up
of the International Space

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.960
Station within it.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.150
And we use this as a test
bed for our planning.

00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:32.330
So this is our science team, and
I'll tell you a bit about them

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.400
in a moment.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.150
This is-- pardon me
here-- is a board that

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.910
was put in by the NBL
crew at a 45 degree angle

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.730
to mimic the lake basin.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.810
And it's actually a series
of old shuttle tiles,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.080
but it worked marvelously
for our purposes.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.640
As you saw in that, there
were six different divers

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.580
that we had.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.220
All of them were
trained up to operate

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.316
under a couple of
different circumstances.

00:29:59.316 --> 00:30:01.690
They were all tethered so that
we could hear their voice.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.060
We could see the video
coming from them.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.870
We have GoPros attached
to them, as well as

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.100
some of them have
handheld cameras.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.611
All of that data was then
streamed to our remote science

00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:11.610
team, which in this case
was sitting by the pool

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.640
but away from the folks that
are operating under water.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.640
And then we instituted a delay
in this very safe environment.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.420
So we did this first before
we moved out into the field.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.200
One of the things that you
saw was some multiple screens

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.760
of video that was coming in
from the different divers

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.949
from different angles.

00:30:26.949 --> 00:30:28.490
One of the research
questions that we

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.200
have going in to this
phase of our program

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.897
here is which cameras provide
the best view and perspective

00:30:36.897 --> 00:30:38.980
depending on which task
that you're interested in?

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.690
So if you're interested
in the science,

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.310
are you most
interested in the view

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.101
that's coming back from
the handheld camera

00:30:44.101 --> 00:30:46.670
or from the shoulder cam?

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.350
Or if you're interested
in understanding

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.145
the lay of the
operations, perhaps it's

00:30:50.145 --> 00:30:51.960
the shoulder cam
that's more important.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.130
One of the reasons why
we're asking these questions

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.920
and testing for which ones
are the most valid depending

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.260
on the task-- and we're
doing that quantitatively--

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.490
is because if you ask a
scientist how many cameras

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.000
do need on a free flyer when you
go to the moon or an asteroid

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.969
to do your science, they will
say as many as you can give me.

00:31:07.969 --> 00:31:09.260
How much bandwidth do you need?

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.997
As much as you can give me,
which isn't very helpful.

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:14.330
And we've seen this at Desert
Rats where we've mocked up

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.040
the science, and
the scientists have

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.420
all sorts of cameras of
various degrees of definition,

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.320
streaming videos, taking
stills, and what it does

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.470
is just shuts down
the whole system.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.090
So we wanted to look at, in
this real science environment,

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.400
and provide learning
the ops group, what

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.210
are the types of
cameras that you need?

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.960
And so this is some
of the work that we've

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.910
been doing as well
as integrating

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.920
this robot within our lives.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.690
And so there's another
question that we've

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:46.660
been asking, in terms of what is
the role of a robotic assistant

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.190
when you're conducting these
types of extravehicular

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.980
activities?

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.750
A lot of people see a
robot as the best way

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.620
to use it as kind of
like a tool caddy,

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.960
like it just kind of sits
there and you put stuff on it.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.334
But we've always
felt that that's

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.640
sort of under-utilizing
the capability of a robot.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.330
And so we've been using
it as different camera

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.770
view as a scout,
as well as a tool

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.880
caddy, and other
different mechanisms.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.720
So let me see what
time we have here.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.820
We've got a bit more time.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.320
But what I want to
talk to you about

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.670
is what we did this summer.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:20.850
So as I mentioned, we had ROV
and diver operations together.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.620
And in the back
room, once again,

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.330
we had a whole
science team that was

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.950
viewing the data coming back.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:29.469
And also, we were
collecting metrics on

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:31.760
which of the camera point of
views were the most useful

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.472
to them and when.

00:32:33.472 --> 00:32:35.180
One of the cool things
we had this summer

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.290
is the involvement
of Steve Squires.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.650
He is the principle investigator
of the Mars Exploration Rovers

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:45.330
and the head of the
NASA Advisory Council.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.240
And so he's been
running robots on Mars

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.340
for a very, very long time.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.799
But if you asked
the dude would you

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:54.256
want to send another robot to
Mars or would you want to go,

00:32:54.256 --> 00:32:55.270
he would say, I'll go.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.700
And that was sort of
validated a million times

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.820
over when he was there
with us this summer,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.665
because he-- what we
did, and I'm not showing.

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:05.290
That's like three or
four other talks--

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.650
is that prior to getting to
this stage when we went in fully

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:11.890
with our divers and our
science team and our robots,

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.280
we actually broke things down
into different engineering

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.440
runs and operational runs.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.290
And he went out and drove
the ROV around for us

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.679
so we could test the COMS
all throughout the lake.

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:22.470
And he said to me, you
know, the first time

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:25.011
he did a dive-- it was just the
checkout dive within Pavilion

00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:27.040
Lake-- it was a
total game changer.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.720
Suddenly, he moved
from somebody who

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.310
he felt that he had a
very cursory understanding

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.360
of the microbialites and
what he was looking at

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360
and what their relationship
with the environment

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.404
was, to suddenly, when
he was there, you know,

00:33:38.404 --> 00:33:40.070
coming back to your
question earlier on,

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.450
he had this real time
intellectual resolution,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.770
which was very rich
and very intimate.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.270
And so he said,
imagine like when

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.300
he thinks about that in
terms of extrapolating

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.990
that knowledge, that feeling,
to what he's been doing

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.880
for the past decade on
Mars, he just feels cheated.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.970
He's like, come on, after 10
years of driving these Rovers,

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:03.200
I could have walked around
and made massive discoveries.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.107
So that's where
we're at right now,

00:34:05.107 --> 00:34:07.440
and it's been great to get
his involvement and his point

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.270
of view on this whole program.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.340
And so one of the things that we
do in terms of our capabilities

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.090
is designed for a mechanism
so that the scientists can

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.219
see the data that's
coming in rapidly,

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:23.330
synthesize it, and
make it useful to them

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.690
so they can make decisions,
changes in the dive plans,

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.750
the traverse plans of the
subs, whatever it may be.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:32.360
When we first went in with
the submersibles in 2008,

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.929
it was really like
caveman style.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.409
Like we had two
subs in there, we

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.719
were recording the data on
board of the submersible,

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.880
and then all of that
was actually tape.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.489
It had to be brought
up to the surface

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.600
and then transferred so
that we could archive it.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.857
And none of us actually
got to see the data

00:34:49.857 --> 00:34:50.940
when we were in the field.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.370
And so what ensued was this.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.900
We had a couple of scientists
come up from 200 feet

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.900
and say, holy cow, I saw--
well, they swore, but anyways,

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.420
they'd say, no, I
saw microbialites

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.079
were red at 200 feet.

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.870
And the other one was
like, no, you didn't.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:05.520
They're black.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.410
And then the other said, no,
you guys are totally wrong.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.450
And it was just because
the lights were on.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.116
And this went on, and
it was ridiculous.

00:35:10.116 --> 00:35:13.910
It was a completely
ridiculous banal conversation.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.957
And all we had to do was
actually view the tape,

00:35:15.957 --> 00:35:18.040
see where we were so we
could either go back to it

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.720
or solve the color issue.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.300
So in the subsequent
year we actually went in

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.350
with this ground
data system that

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.350
was a piece of software
that's designed and aims

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.145
and built upon--
you know, predicated

00:35:29.145 --> 00:35:33.360
upon Google Earth-- that
allowed us to synthesize

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.410
the telemetry so we
knew where we were,

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.937
the video, the still
data, and the notes,

00:35:38.937 --> 00:35:41.270
which is very important to a
field scientist-- we write,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.750
scribble every last thing
into our field notebook.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.950
Suddenly, that's all here and
all coupled and synthesized

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.500
in one repository.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.240
So now we could actually scroll
back in time very rapidly.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.770
The science team could hear
this argument between divers

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.780
and say, I just viewed the tape.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.790
It's clearly red and
then it's solved.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.410
And then that
ridiculous conversation

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.340
that went on for
two hours is done.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.250
And then you can
say, well, it is red.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:07.680
That's very interesting.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.431
Please sample that for me and
collect the tips, the middle,

00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:14.430
and the subsurface, and
that will be interesting

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:17.270
because it will help
solve my hypotheses.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.860
So XGDS was in its
sort of nascency

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.270
when I met the engineers at
Ames and talked with them

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.870
about some of our issues.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.385
And they said,
well hey, look, we

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.760
have this Rover that we've
been working on-- this robot--

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.468
and we've been designing
this ground data

00:36:31.468 --> 00:36:33.000
system that basically,
at that time,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.260
kind of synthesized
the telemetry

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.880
and some of the other kind
of engineering components

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.380
into this software.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.680
And so they said, we really
want a real science question

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.220
to work on.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.170
So they started designing
this XGDS system.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.840
I think there's
actually a talk online

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.540
by Matt Deans that explains
this in more detail.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.270
But what has happened is
this XGDS program has since

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.460
been absorbed by
NEEMO, by Desert Rats,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.370
and now is being used by
something called the Mojave

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.940
Volatiles Prospector, which is
a precursor robotic mission we

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.070
just did in the Mojave Desert
to a mission that hopefully will

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.630
fly in the next five
years to the moon, which

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.370
is called Resource Prospector.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:13.080
And that mission is to go
to the far side of the moon

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.410
and look for water.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.147
But it's got a very
short time frame.

00:37:16.147 --> 00:37:17.730
It's not like what's
happened on Mars.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.400
It's only going to
operate for 10 to 14 days.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.570
It's got to look for water.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.990
It's going to be
deking in and out

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.790
of permanently shadowed regions.

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:29.809
And so operationally the
tempo is much more akin

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:31.850
to what we've been dealing
with at Pavilion Lake.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.390
And this XGDS system
has since sort of

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.960
grown into that environment too.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.760
So it's one of the
really great capabilities

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.310
that has been designed
at Ames and that we've

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:47.240
had a lot of interesting
development success with.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.720
This summer we had a new
challenge for the engineers.

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.960
And that was that they had
to design a system which

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.600
was even faster than what
they had designed in terms

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.260
of our decision-making
capabilities for the subs.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.820
This is because now, as I
mentioned, we had divers.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.280
And the divers were
only underwater

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.850
for 20 to 40 minutes.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.100
We were also-- every
time the divers came up

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.500
they had loads of samples.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.440
We had grad students.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.620
This is Mark [? Blenn. ?]
He's actually from Canada.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.300
And they were examining the
microbialites as they came up.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.270
Another scientist
from New Zealand.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.644
And actually looking at
the surface structure,

00:38:20.644 --> 00:38:22.310
looking at the microbes
that were there,

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.380
and then feeding that
data back into XGDS,

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.690
and we had to react to
that as well as we planned

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.660
the dives and even within
the dives themselves.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:35.130
So there was a new kind of
higher level of-- or a faster

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:36.730
pace, really, to
the whole operation.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.500
Every evening we
would have discussions

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.800
that went on and on,
and heated discussions

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.810
between scientists
and engineers.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.530
And scientists almost
broke out into fistfights,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.100
but were very, very productive.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.080
And we also-- yeah.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.580
I know.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:55.330
Nobody got killed.

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.830
So that's always good.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.760
No paperwork.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.740
So we also went back to,
as I showed you earlier on,

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.904
some of these
acceptability assessments.

00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:05.570
And we're just compiling
this right now,

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.840
and we're hoping to
put a draft together

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.550
by the end of this
year for publication,

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.370
but what we were
looking at, once again,

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.610
is acceptability
ratings in terms

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.270
of the simulation
that we conducted,

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.850
as well as some of
the capabilities

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:26.080
and how well they were rated
in terms of their success

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.670
in supporting our mission.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.242
So some of the things
that we found--

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:31.700
this is kind of
high level learning

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.680
at this point in time--
is that it was a very--

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.560
we found by consensus that, as
I showed you in that earlier

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.730
diagram where we were
looking at the ConOps

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.290
where you have two people
as IV supporting the two

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:48.790
other people out on EVA-- there
has been a lot of discussion

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.610
as to whether or not you
really need two IVs supporting

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.080
or just one.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.580
That makes a huge
difference to NASA

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.170
in terms of training, how much
effort you've got to put in,

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:59.710
you've got to pay
two extra people,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.620
and all that sort of thing,
and two extra crew going out

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.440
that far.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.667
We found that we could
not have done anything

00:40:04.667 --> 00:40:06.750
under that kind of tempo,
that kind of difficulty,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.710
without those two IV.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.690
One focused actually
solely on the science,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.790
talking to the science
team in delay mode,

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:17.180
talking to the other
IV about the science

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.320
and making suggestions
to the dive team.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.280
And then the other
IV was completely

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.097
focused on their
safety, essentially,

00:40:24.097 --> 00:40:25.930
telling them where they
were within the dive

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.400
plan, how much time
they had left based

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.380
on the pressure that the
divers were reading back

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.300
to us as it decreased over time.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.670
And that subdivision was
very, very important to us

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.330
and rated as extremely important
throughout the entire program.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:44.090
We also started to examine
the camera and imagery

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.640
capabilities, as I talked to
you about, and look specifically

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.620
at the shoulder
cam, the ROV view,

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.650
as well as the
handheld camera that

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:56.970
was used by one of the divers.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.610
Now the way that that diver
used that handheld camera is

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.824
that he would, as
we found a sample

00:41:01.824 --> 00:41:03.740
we wanted or microbialite
we wanted to sample,

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.770
he would scooch in very
gently and use the camera

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:10.150
to actually image that structure
in high definition video.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.870
And that was
streaming back to us,

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.310
and we were then feeding
forward decisions as to whether

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:17.020
or not to sample
there or move on.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.900
And then there was
the shoulder cam

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.180
which gave us a view over
the shoulder as to where

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.530
their hands were and what
was going on around them.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.480
And then we had the ROV,
which was giving you

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.270
a different point of
view, kind of the lay

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.470
of the land, the
contextual shot.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:35.480
And what we found is that
the camera that was handheld

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.400
was most important
to the scientists,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.570
because that allowed us to
say, hey, go in tighter.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:44.466
Let's see if that little nodule
that's a centimeter in width

00:41:44.466 --> 00:41:45.840
is actually red
or if it's green.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.760
That helps us with our tests
or different hypotheses.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.290
But what we did
find which was brand

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.630
new to any of these analogs
is that we don't actually

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.220
need a scientist's
high definition video.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.790
You can collect that on site.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.660
But all we needed was a
high definition still.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.520
But what that means
is that if you're

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.094
going to shoot back
a still of something,

00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:06.260
it means a couple of things.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.670
First of all, the
scientists or the diver

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.710
that's underwater or the
astronaut that's on EVA

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.129
has to have quite a substantial
amount of scientific training

00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:17.170
under their belt to know
when to press the button

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.360
to send you a still.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.490
Otherwise, he or she could
be just sending you garbage.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.290
And so we had the benefit of
having one of the-- really

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.590
what's considered one of
the best cold water divers

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.820
in the world who is also an
astrobiologist in that role.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.260
So he knew exactly when
to say this looks good

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.250
or this doesn't look good.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.850
But if you didn't
have that and it

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.854
was say, somebody that didn't
come from a science background,

00:42:38.854 --> 00:42:40.270
that may have been
very different.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.320
So there are nuances
to the things

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.970
that we learned that we've
been capturing over time.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.240
These are kind of prompts to
me to talk to you about some

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.162
of the other learning.

00:42:51.162 --> 00:42:52.620
But one of the
other things that we

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.661
did, a lot of the learning
that I just showed you

00:42:54.661 --> 00:42:59.020
was done under the 50
second one-way delay.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.170
Something that had never been
done before prior to June

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.990
was actually testing in these
circumstances in a five minute

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.310
delay mode-- five
minute one way.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.260
This changes the
operation substantially,

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.110
because five minute one
way means 10 minute return.

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:17.144
And that doesn't even account
for the kind of thinking time

00:43:17.144 --> 00:43:18.810
that the science team
might need to make

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.850
a decision on whether
to sample, to move on,

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.730
or to come up and so forth.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.730
And so what we did is we
designed this circuit sampling

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.020
strategy that essentially
meant that the people on EVA,

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.357
the divers underwater, were
never without something to do.

00:43:33.357 --> 00:43:35.440
And we joke about the fact
that we should probably

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.010
institute this at work as well,
where there's always a task

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.290
that you have to be doing so
to be as efficient as possible

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:42.640
in the time you've got.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.731
So these guys only had
20 minutes underwater.

00:43:44.731 --> 00:43:45.980
We've got a five minute delay.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.813
You can do the math.

00:43:46.813 --> 00:43:49.060
It just makes it a really
difficult situation.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.790
But they had to select samples
that the grad students could

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.310
use to graduate, and
they had to do it

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.940
but still give us the option.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.480
So what we did is allowed
them to-- we preselected

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.760
a circuit based on the ROV
data and deep worker data that

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.310
had already been garnered,
and then actually allowed them

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.899
to go through and drop,
basically like breadcrumbs--

00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:12.440
here's a good one,
here's a good one,

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.180
and then image it really tight.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.870
And all that information
is coming back

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:17.250
to the science team.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.890
And as they were waiting,
they would kind of

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.420
progress along in a bit of
a circuit like a circle.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.960
And then as they were waiting
for us to make our decision

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.350
and they were able to
time that underwater too,

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.210
they were tasked with
other scientific data

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.710
that we wanted to get, such
as water samples or collection

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.190
of rocks and so forth.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.196
So we made sure that
every single task

00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:40.070
was understood in terms
of the amount of time

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.230
it would take, and ensured that
by the time the decision came

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.860
back to them, they were ready
and prepped and able to go,

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.190
and that every task that
we needed them to get done

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:52.540
was done without them
having to wait around.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.270
What the scientists did
in order to expedite

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:59.090
the decision-making process
under this time delay was this.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.050
They knew that they
were going to have

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.970
four or five different options,
and there was a leader board.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.310
So as soon as they
saw the first option

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.480
they would sort of take a
guess as to whether or not

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.051
it was going to get prioritized
as one or maybe as four.

00:45:12.051 --> 00:45:14.300
And they would kind of throw
that up on a leaderboard,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.750
and those numbers
and those projections

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.370
were getting sent
forward to the boat

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.480
and then communicated
down to the divers.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.850
And that would get updated.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.124
So, for example, if they
saw a, they would say,

00:45:23.124 --> 00:45:24.790
well, I think it's
going to number four.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.623
And then if they came
to the next sample, b,

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.050
they would say, oh,
nope, a is better than b.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:30.940
And that leaderboard
kept getting rapidly

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.220
updated and that information
communicated down the divers.

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.950
And what that did was
it prompted the divers

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.140
to already know where they might
be going to do the collections.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.230
Now, I don't know if any of
you are divers in the room.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:46.430
Actually are any of
you divers in the room?

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:47.020
OK, cool.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.280
So you know diving
is actually not easy.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.550
There's a lot going on.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.490
There's a lot coming at you.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:57.880
And in this circumstance, they
are fully suited in dry suits,

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.470
and they are at four degrees--
they're in four degrees

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.550
Celsius weather--
pardon me-- water.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.279
And they're also
wearing full face masks,

00:46:04.279 --> 00:46:05.570
which are highly uncomfortable.

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:06.920
Thank you.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.910
And so there is a
lot coming at them.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:11.740
And so, for them to be
able to prepare themselves

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.592
for something is highly
useful in terms of making sure

00:46:14.592 --> 00:46:16.800
that they're managing through
everything that they're

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.919
dealing with
including their air.

00:46:18.919 --> 00:46:21.460
I only have five minutes left,
but some of the other learning

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:25.280
that we came out with is that
actually very clear marking

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.800
of any samples is
extremely important.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.770
In the past, what's
been used in other tasks

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:34.510
is just kind of dropping little
weights with string coming off

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.350
them without any clear
markings on them.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:40.504
This is actually not-- we can't
actually do anything with that

00:46:40.504 --> 00:46:42.170
if you're dealing
with these five minute

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.294
delays and these kind of
leaderboard circumstances.

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.680
So these types of
learnings is something

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.971
we're putting together in a
paper that, as I mentioned,

00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:54.470
will be pushed forward to
the other test environments.

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:58.690
So just some kind of summary
statements about these Pavilion

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.350
Lake and other types
of tests like this

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.830
is that these non-simulated
science activities,

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.780
they act as an honest
forcing function

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.500
for us to drive out the
operational, the technical,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.120
and the mission components that
enable an enhance hypothesis

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.259
testing, and ultimately
scientific discoveries.

00:47:16.259 --> 00:47:17.800
We want to go out
and we want to test

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.250
and we want to refine all of
these operational and concepts

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.470
and capabilities,
and then test again.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:25.920
Now some of the
issues we have is

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.270
that right now, Pavilion
is really n equals 1.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:31.770
There's only really that as
it stands in the community,

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:33.500
and we need to
have more of these.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.050
And that's what we're
working on right now.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:38.609
We have an opportunity
because scientists at NASA

00:47:38.609 --> 00:47:39.900
do go out into the field a lot.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:43.410
And so this summer we're headed
back, and what we're doing

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.162
is going to make our
lives more difficult,

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:46.620
but it's still an
interesting task.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.490
We're going to take
some of our science team

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.120
and have them sit at home
and see what that does to us.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.510
So we're not exactly sure how to
enable ourselves to communicate

00:47:56.510 --> 00:48:00.810
and stay motivated as a
team in this circumstance,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.590
because when you're in the
field and it's very intense,

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.567
it changes the dynamic--
the working dynamic.

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:09.150
If you're working on a project
and you're all working together

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.945
over long hours it sort
of-- you kind of gel.

00:48:11.945 --> 00:48:13.570
So if you have people
sitting far away,

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.410
but they still have to be
part of that intensity,

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:16.868
how are we going
to deal with that?

00:48:16.868 --> 00:48:19.700
And this distributed science
backroom team scenario

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.190
is going to happen when we
have deep space missions.

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:25.610
You can't have
everybody move to,

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.110
let's say Houston or whatever.

00:48:27.110 --> 00:48:29.443
You're going to have to stay
at home with your families,

00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:33.120
but still be really locked
into these high tempo mission.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.020
Another program which
we just starting up

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.880
which is called Finesse,
as Chris mentioned earlier,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.670
is actually a
land-based program where

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.040
we are using robots
and humans out

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.440
in two different environments.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.720
One is in the East
Snake River Plain

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.740
in Idaho, which is an old
volcanic field as well

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.070
as an impact crater
in northern Quebec,

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:55.070
called the West
Clearwater Impact Crater.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.930
And so we're using
those two environments

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:59.070
as scientific
learning environments

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.996
again, and hoping to tack on a
lot of the exploration learning

00:49:01.996 --> 00:49:03.870
that we've been doing
up there Pavilion Lake.

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.440
So thank you very much to
all of you for coming out

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.740
and for those who are
attending the talk virtually.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.820
I really appreciate it.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:17.069
And I am ready take any
questions you may have.

00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:18.220
And the AV worked.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.100
Thanks so much.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.090
Yeah.

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.110
How much ex-- OK.

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.340
So the question is do I
have any metrics on how much

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.680
extra lag decreases the
efficiency of the work?

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.230
So like if we
increase the latency,

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:31.800
how does it decrease
the efficiency?

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.510
That's a great question.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.880
So we have two years worth
of testing, so n equal 2.

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.870
Hooray.

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:41.040
And what we've found is
that actually the science

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.670
that we've managed
to return has not

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.970
diminished in its productivity
nor in its output.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.300
But there have got to be
nuances in there for sure

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.160
that we're not capturing.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.140
But in terms of the
metric that we capture,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.921
which is science return, have
we tested our hypothesis?

00:49:54.921 --> 00:49:55.420
Yes.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.503
Have we published a paper?

00:49:56.503 --> 00:49:57.197
Yes.

00:49:57.197 --> 00:49:58.280
It's actually one for one.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.460
So there has been no change
between whether we're

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.420
using the submersibles, the
divers under 50 second delay,

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.400
or if we change it to a
five minute one way delay.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.060
We're still getting the
data return that we need.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.280
But what has
fundamentally changed

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.830
are the kind of support
tools that we need

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:16.290
and the camera views.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.430
And once again coming
back to the XGDS system

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:23.740
and how rapidly we're able to
extract the information we want

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.680
from that and use
that to make decisions

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.501
There has been some
big learning that's

00:50:27.501 --> 00:50:29.500
come in that we're trying
to institute this year

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:34.310
to change and update that system
so that it can support these

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:38.110
I guess like higher
tempo kind of scenarios

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:39.540
as well as the
scenarios where you

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.560
have these longer
latencies instituted.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.210
Yeah.

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:43.710
No.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.830
No.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:44.820
That's a great question.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.320
We have not.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.150
We meant to do that this year,
but it got very complicated

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.850
very fast.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:51.960
And so we ended up
focusing just simply

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.230
on the different camera angles.

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.420
But next year we hope to do.

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.710
And we hope to be able
to dial up and down

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:02.950
the different camera views
and actually, do that first.

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.179
Going in, I guess, with
a kind of a test platform

00:51:05.179 --> 00:51:06.720
where we actually
know at this moment

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.594
we're going to be dialing
back this and that,

00:51:08.594 --> 00:51:10.090
but then after
that start to react

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.970
with what the scientists
are requiring.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.130
So if we see them and their
only-- the science CAPCOM

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:16.690
is saying, actually
at this point,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.990
we only need to view
the hand held camera,

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.251
then we'll dial everything else
back and AMP up that bandwidth.

00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:22.750
But yeah.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.670
That's a great question.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.070
And once again, that's a
completely outstanding question

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.510
for us, because any scientist
will say, give me it all.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.425
Give me all she's got.

00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:33.675
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:51:33.675 --> 00:51:34.799
DR. DARLENE LIM: Thank you.

00:51:34.799 --> 00:51:36.030
Thanks.
