00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
One trait shared by programming languages and natural languages is ambiguity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Consider the sentence "I saw Jane Austen using binoculars."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's relatively clear what this means, right?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here's me. I have binoculars or perhaps pants, but let's image that they're binoculars.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm looking through them. Over here in the distance I see Jane Austen.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We can tell it's Jane Austen, because she's in a park. Mansfield Park, let's say.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I am using the binoculars to see Jane Austen.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
However, if you think about it there's an alternative implementation

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
or an alternative interpretation of this sentence--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
another way to look at it that's also perfectly valid.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here in this alternative interpretation, I see with my naked eye Jane Austen.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
She is using binoculars to look at something else.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Maybe she's spying on an Abbey over here. Let's call it Northanger Abbey.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Actually it looks a bit more like a barn that was badly painted, but let's imagine.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Both of the interpretations are correct or the sentence is ambiguous.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's not clear whether using binoculars modifies Jane Austen.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Is she the person using binoculars?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Or whether using binoculars modifies "I saw." The picture on the left that's how I'm seeing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's quiz time--a quiz on ambiguity.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Consider the expression 1 minus 2 plus 3.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Keeping ambiguity in mind, if this were a Python or JavaScript

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or even just on the whiteboard or on a piece of paper in mathematics,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
this is a mathematical expression. What might it evaluate to?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I've got four choices in this multiple multiple choice quiz.

00:01:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
