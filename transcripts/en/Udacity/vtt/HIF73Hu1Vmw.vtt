00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.740
To identify genetic factors that may be involved

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.260
in a particular trait, we conduct something called a

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.925
Genetic Association Study. Now these studies take people with

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:13.500
a trait, for example a skin condition and really

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.050
they take a whole population of people with

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.960
this trait and they compare their genetics to an

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.160
individual or really a group of individuals. Without this

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.400
particular trait. In this case without the skin condition.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.350
Now what we're going to do is look at a

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.380
genetic factor, or more. And we're going to see which

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.720
variants each population has. Now if a certain genetic

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.600
variant is observed more frequently than you would expect

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.460
by chance, in the actual cases, than the controls.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.650
Then it's good evidence that it might be involved

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.030
in the trait. Suppose that we have 1,000 people

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.550
that have a particular kind of skin rash and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.120
we compare them to 1,000 people that don't have

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.060
this particular kind of skin rash. Now let's say we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.970
analyze these two populations. For one particular genetic factor.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.540
And let's saw we determine that 50% of the population

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.210
with the skin rash has a cytosine for this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.980
genetic factor at a given position and that in the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.930
control population only 20% have a cytosine. Now at that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.870
same position, the only other option that we can have.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.606
Is an adenine. And our affected population, the

00:01:18.606 --> 00:01:21.820
othe50%, the remaining 50%, have an adenine. And in

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.380
our control population, the remaining, in this case 80%,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.290
have an adenine. Now we have a lot of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.650
people in our population, a thousand. If this letter

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.830
was insignificant to this particular trait. We would expect

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.960
that with so many people that these numbers would

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.850
be more similar. 50, 50, 50, 50, or 20,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.870
80, 20, 80 in both situations. In other words, these

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.040
differences are greater than what we would expect to see by

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.240
chance. So, based on this scenario here, I want you to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.270
tell me which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion.
