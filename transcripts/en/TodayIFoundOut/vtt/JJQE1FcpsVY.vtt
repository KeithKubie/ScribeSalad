00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:18.440
Hieroglyphics 
were elaborate, elegant symbols used prolifically

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.680
in Ancient Egypt.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480
The symbols decorated temples and tombs of
pharaohs.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.400
However, being quite ornate, other scripts
were usually used in day-to-day life, such

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.430
as demotic, a precursor to Coptic, which was
used in Egypt until the 1000s.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.190
These other scripts were sort of like different
hieroglyphic fonts—your classic Times New

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.470
Roman to Jokerman or Vivaldi.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.000
Unfortunately, hieroglyphics started to disappear.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.860
Christianity was becoming more and more popular,
and around 400 A.D. hieroglyphics were outlawed

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.340
in order to break from the tradition of Egypt’s
“pagan” past.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.940
The last dated hieroglyph was carved in a
temple on the island of Philae in 395 A.D.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.990
Coptic was then written and spoken—a combination
of twenty-four Greek characters and six demotic

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.969
characters—before the spread of Arabic meant
that Egypt was cut off from the last connection

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.899
to its linguistic past.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.490
What remained were temples and monuments covered
in hieroglyphic writing and no knowledge about

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.219
how to begin translating them.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.310
Scientists and historians who analyzed the
symbols in the next few centuries believed

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.320
that it was a form of ancient picture writing.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.380
Thus, instead of translating the symbols phonetically—that
is, representing sounds—they translated

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.060
them literally based on the image they saw.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.819
It wasn’t until July 19, 1799 when a breakthrough
in translation was discovered by French soldiers

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.600
building an extension on a fort in el-Rashid,
or Rosetta, under the orders of Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.469
While demolishing an ancient wall, they discovered
a large slab of granodiorite bearing an inscription

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.149
in three different scripts.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.310
Before the French had much of a chance to
examine it, however, the stone was handed

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.340
over to the British in 1802 following the
Treaty of Capitulation.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.810
On this stone, known as the Rosetta Stone,
the three scripts present were hieroglyphics,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.169
demotic, and Greek.

00:01:56.169 --> 00:02:00.159
Soon after arriving at the British Museum,
the Greek translation revealed that the inscription

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.389
is a decree by Ptolemy V, issued in 196 B.C.
in Memphis.

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.890
One of the most important lines of the decree
is this stipulation laid down by Ptolemy V:

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.060
“and the decree should be written on a stela
of hard stone, in sacred writing, document

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.750
writing, and Greek writing.”

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.020
The “sacred writing” was hieroglyphics
and “document writing” referred to demotic—this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.800
confirmed that the inscription was the same
message three times over, providing a way

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920
to begin translating hieroglyphics at last!

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.790
One of the big problems encountered was that
they could try to translate written text all

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.450
they wanted, but it wouldn’t give the translators
an idea of the sounds made when the text was

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.770
spoken.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.460
In 1814, Thomas Young discovered a series
of hieroglyphs surrounded by a loop, called

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.460
a cartouche.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.290
The cartouche signified something important,
which Young hypothesized could be the name

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.720
of something significant—kind of like capitalizing
a proper noun.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.600
If it was a pharoah’s name, then the sound
would be relatively similar to the way the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.190
names are commonly pronounced in numerous
other languages where we know the pronunciation.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.040
However, Young was still working under the
delusion that hieroglyphs were picture writing,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.710
which ultimately caused him to abandon his
work which he called “the amusement of a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.140
few leisure hours”, even though he had managed
to successfully correlate many hieroglyphs

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.340
with their phonetic values.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.970
A few years later, Jean-Francois Champollion
finally cracked the code in 1822.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.750
Champollion had a long-time obsession with
hieroglyphics and Egyptian culture.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.210
He’d even become fluent in Coptic, though
it had long since become a dead language.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.080
Using Young’s theory and focusing on cartouches,
he found one containing four hieroglyphs,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.450
the last two of which were known to represent
an “s” sound.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.140
The first one was a circle with a large black
dot in the centre, which he thought might

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.460
represent the sun.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.210
He dug into his knowledge of the Coptic language,
which he hadn’t previously considered to

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.600
be part of the equation, and knew that “ra”
meant “sun.”

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.760
Therefore, the word that fit was the pharaoh
Ramses and the connection between Coptic and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.590
hieroglyphics was now perfectly clear.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.550
Champollion’s research provided the momentum
to get the ball rolling on hieroglyphic translation.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.280
He now demonstrated conclusively that hieroglyphics
weren’t just picture writing, but a phonetic

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280
language.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.380
Champollion went on to translate hieroglyphic
text in the temples in Egypt, making notes

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.630
about his translations along the way.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.040
He discovered the phonetic value of most hieroglyphs.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.220
It was a good thing he kept extensive notes,
too as he suffered a stroke three years later

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.280
and died at the age of 41.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.919
Without those notes, much of the progress
made on the translations would have been lost.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.620
Bonus Facts:
• The Rosetta Stone now sits in the British

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.569
Museum, where it’s been since 1801.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.139
• The Rosetta Stone is commonly thought
to be made of black basalt due to its dark

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.139
hue.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.900
This is incorrect—the dark colour is actually
due to a layer of carnauba wax which was put

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.889
on the stone to protect it from oil on people’s
fingers as they were examining the text.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.590
• There is no single translation of the
decree inscribed upon the Rosetta Stone because

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.990
of minor differences in the text as well as
a still-developing understanding of the language,

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.110
but a version of the translation can be found
on the British Museum’s website linked in

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.110
the show notes.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.740
• Roughly 45 inches high, 28.5 inches wide,
and 11 inches thick, the Rosetta Stone weighs

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.740
over 1700 pounds.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.449
Still, the stone isn’t complete.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.360
Many of the lines of text are broken or completely
absent.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.100
Unfortunately, the rest of the stone has been
lost to time.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.740
• The stone was only moved from display
at the British Museum twice.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.719
At the end of World War I, museum workers
feared for the stone’s safety due to bombing

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:22.719
in London.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.460
It was moved to a station 50 feet below the
ground in Holborn and stayed there for two

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.460
years.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.789
In 1972, it was moved to the Lourve in Paris
to be displayed alongside Champollion’s

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:50.250
Lettre, describing the translation of hieroglyphs,
on its 150th anniversary of publication.
