Do you remember how we used the add and remove operation awhile ago to

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:09.475
rearrange images in the gallery? We removed the last element and added it

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:14.642
before the first one. Now that you know how removal and adding works in Java

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:20.576
code I'd like you to tell me Tthe cost of this operation. How any elements were

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:25.336
visited in the process? With visiting I mean, how many elements were read and

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:29.418
how many were modified. So count every read and every write and tell me the

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:31.070
total number of visits.
