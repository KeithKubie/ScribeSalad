00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.459
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP
You HEAR THAT?

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:05.150
ITS THE WORST.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.150
WAKE UP.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.680
And yet, some people just don't, do they?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.610
I had a roommate in college who was SUCH a
heavy sleeper.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.000
He would set his alarm on the loudest volume
possible, and when it went off I would JOLT

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.380
awake, but he was unphased.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.449
I didn't think I was a light sleeper, but
I guess I was?

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.600
I would snooze his alarm, but after a semester
of this, I definitely harbored some hatred

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.230
for this horrible morning ritual.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.320
Turns out, it wasn't really his fault, his
brain was just so busy!

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.490
Whether you're a heavy or light sleeper has
to do with brain activity during the second

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.490
phase of sleep.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.620
When the brain falls asleep, it rolls through
a number of stages numbered one through four.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.579
One is when you're brain is starting sleep,
two is when bursts of activity called sleep

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.920
spindles begin, three is delta or slow wave
sleep, and four is the well-known REM sleep.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.629
This cycle repeats throughout the night -- with
people experiencing different levels of wakefulness

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.190
at different times.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.100
Sleep spindles aren't widely understood, but
they emanate from the thalamus, a region in

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.380
the middle of the brain between the cerebral
cortex and midbrain.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.900
The thalamus regulates consciousness, and
alertness -- which makes sense.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.000
Sleep spindles have been connected to memory
consolidation and learning, brain development

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.459
and plasticity, and even diseases like Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's, and schizophrenia.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.850
Sleep scientists think the sleep spindles
in phase two and three are the key to heavy

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.889
versus light sleep.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.610
Spindles don't happen much during REM sleep.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.539
By playing sounds for sleepers at increasing
loudness throughout the night, they discovered

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.329
sleepers with higher rates of sleep spindles
were better at sleeping through the noises!

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.639
This is interesting because logically, we
might assume the brains of heavy sleepers

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.139
are somehow LESS active, but in fact they're
MORE active.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.259
You're not "dead to the world" as my mom used
to say, but more like, "sawing logs," cerebrally

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.259
speaking.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.249
Their paper, published in Current Biology
in 2010, says the thalamus' sleep spindles

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.259
was sort of... drowning out external stimuli
from reaching the cortex causing people to

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.799
appear to be heavier sleepers!

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.340
Studies of sleep spindles have found women
produce more than men, with men averaging

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.959
three to six per minute and women ranging
from three to more than a dozen.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.459
There IS a mild association -- in women -- between
number of spindles and learning potential

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.430
(or IQ), but it's pretty weak.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.150
And studies of sleep spindles and biphasic
sleeping -- the scientific name for nap time

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.930
-- found naps help the memory of preschoolers.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.250
OKAY FINE.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.260
I just want nap time, you guys.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.690
As we get older, the number of spindles dwindle,
and we become lighter sleepers.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.909
I'm thinking this may also explain why teenagers
can sleep through ANYTHING, but these days,

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.310
no way.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.310
What do you think?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:03:11.230
Are you a light sleeper or heavy sleeper?
