00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.120
So let's continue adding to our bag of
tricks of what we can do with lines.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.140
In the last section we talked about
what to do if we know the slope in the y

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.939
intercept.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.080
Now let's talk about what to
do if we know the slope and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.430
some random point that may not
be the y-intercept because

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.880
I want to be able to answer questions
like, for example, find the equation of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.670
a line with a slope of two-thirds
that goes through the point (9,8).

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.660
First let's think about this point.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.530
Is this point a y-intercept?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.660
Select either yes or no.
