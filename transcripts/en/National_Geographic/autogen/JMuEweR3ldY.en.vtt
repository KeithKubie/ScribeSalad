there's our sample it's the right color

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580
there's our sample it's the right color
 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.179
there's our sample it's the right color
we might have a sperm cell here but it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
we might have a sperm cell here but it

is not moving it was his first attempt

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880
is not moving it was his first attempt

is not moving it was his first attempt
to examine great white sperm under a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920
to examine great white sperm under a
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.889
to examine great white sperm under a
microscope it's not sperm swimming all

around in this sample I kind of expected

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799
around in this sample I kind of expected
 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.440
around in this sample I kind of expected
to see things wiggling around later he

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
to see things wiggling around later he
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.680
to see things wiggling around later he
recognized his mistake he needed to look

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
recognized his mistake he needed to look
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.690
recognized his mistake he needed to look
for something called a spermatophore and

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700
for something called a spermatophore and
 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.289
for something called a spermatophore and
the seminal fluid sorry reproduction is

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299
the seminal fluid sorry reproduction is
 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.550
the seminal fluid sorry reproduction is
a bit different than what you might

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
a bit different than what you might
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.090
a bit different than what you might
expect the sperm in males actually comes

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
expect the sperm in males actually comes
 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.380
expect the sperm in males actually comes
out in these little packets called

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390
out in these little packets called
 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.059
out in these little packets called
spermatophores and it look like grains

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069
spermatophores and it look like grains
 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.220
spermatophores and it look like grains
of rice so I'll be looking for those on

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
of rice so I'll be looking for those on
 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.420
of rice so I'll be looking for those on
this trip now 24 hours later he needs a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
this trip now 24 hours later he needs a
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.400
this trip now 24 hours later he needs a
new sperm sample to try and isolate

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
new sperm sample to try and isolate
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.449
new sperm sample to try and isolate
those grain like patterns it's the proof

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459
those grain like patterns it's the proof
 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.550
those grain like patterns it's the proof
he needs to finally determine if males

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560
he needs to finally determine if males
 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.640
he needs to finally determine if males
are here to mate
