00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.650
You're listening to radio,

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.790
the podcast from New York public radio and public radio.

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.180
Y. C. N. N. P. R. Hello, I'm Jad boom, rod. Hello, I'm Robert Quilt.

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.750
This is radio lab, the podcast, which means it's not the broadcast,

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.500
not the one hour show, not the one hour. Shows this a little tidbit.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.341
This is a tidbit,

7
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:29.970
but this is a tidbit with a teasing purpose because we have in the,

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
in the next few weeks we are going to do the real shows about race.

9
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.650
And there's one about choice. There's one,

10
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:39.000
however entirely devoted to the subject of sperm and sperm. You think, well,

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:43.470
why would you spend so much time talking about that? Yes, in fact is very sad,

12
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.190
sad, lonely show. Anyhow, we learned a lot of,

13
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
I mean if you open up any little basket and ask too many questions,

14
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.950
you learn all kinds of fascinating. So true, particularly with sperm. So, um,

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.050
we talked when we were preparing this hour with a woman named Joanna Ellington,

16
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.540
a fertility expert who runs a company with a very short name,

17
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.780
Kinda like spreading itself. M. I. N. G. It's a fertility firm.

18
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.400
And I asked her if you are a healthy male at the very top of your game,

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.660
so you got everything you're ever going to have and they're all frisky little

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.883
guys ready to go,

21
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.270
what proportion of your gang would be fit and ready to do the deed?

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420
<v 1>A normal ejaculate from a man is if you have 14 one four 14% or more of the</v>

23
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:36.360
sperm that are normally shaped, that's very low percent.

24
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.840
86% are abnormally shaped. Yeah.

25
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.850
How do they differ from the normal?

26
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.690
Typically you're going to have problems with the tail and then that makes it so

27
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.110
they can't swim. Right? They swim in a circle, can't swim fast.

28
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.060
Some of them swim in a circle and when they go bang and off you go.

29
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.500
They just go round and round and round and round. Right.

30
00:01:55.501 --> 00:02:00.240
And that doesn't work very well. Of course. Okay. Circles slow. Anything else?

31
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
Yeah, as the sperm get ready to be a jack elated,

32
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.970
the tail unwind from around the cell. Okay.

33
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.830
And sometimes it doesn't unwind, right?

34
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.180
It stays wound up or the very tip of the tail stays in kind of an a not,

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.080
I guess you could say basically. So you've got a knock on your tail. Yeah,

36
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.040
<v 0>we've got some stalled out. Some going in circles.</v>

37
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.570
Some going slowly I there I'm horror. Mu Mutant to sperm.

38
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.500
There's one called Globo sperm mia and that is a very large round head.

40
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.400
It's a,

41
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.270
you may be three or four times normal size and instead of having that oval,

42
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.190
it's just quite round looking like a balloon head. Big Fat balloon head. Yeah,

43
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:42.761
exactly.

44
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:47.740
You can have sperm that have vacuoles which are basically holes in the DNA.

45
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.080
You can have sperm that have two tails. Yeah. You

46
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.060
know, you don't want anything abnormal double-headed ones. Yes,

47
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.040
absolutely. Triple headed ones.

48
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.010
<v 0>Um, probably some, this is making me nervous. Anything else?</v>

49
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
<v 1>Some of them are going to be dead and not moving at all. Well that's a problem.</v>

50
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.990
Yeah. In addition to that, there's many,

51
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.980
many micro biochemical things that they have to go through.

52
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.870
So if you were to actually write down everything that could go wrong with sperm

53
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.790
as it meets, it goes to meet the eggs,

54
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.830
it would be hundreds of little enumerations that could go wrong.

55
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.160
But that's why men makes from all the time. They constantly are making it.

56
00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:35.960
They constantly have a fresh supply.

57
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.130
You've got to have something that can go through all the hurdles and all the

58
00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:44.240
barriers and make sure at the end of the day that you have the best healthiest

59
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:47.390
sperm cell that's participating in making a baby.

60
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.700
<v 0>The, when you say get that, it's lonely, sad, sad with ads like that.</v>

61
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.870
But member, this is when you're healthiest, when you're healthy.

62
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.940
If I don't get though is like how does it, how does it, well,

63
00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.550
this is what we're going to go into the show, but I'll just ask you now,

64
00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:06.551
how does it happen given all of those potential pitfalls and that every sperm is

65
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.970
re outracing the other sperm, it's all the, the, the,

66
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.260
the public image here is that every guy that you put in is in a woody Allen

67
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.100
movie sense competing against his neighbor. Right?

68
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.120
So it's Jerry versus Ted versus Andy versus mark versus Freddy versus Billy.

69
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.600
And they're all rushing to the goal. What if Jerry and Ted and mark and Farrah,

70
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.010
whoever and Billy are all double headed with with them,

71
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.870
they don't make it so it's the odds are not in our favor,

72
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.980
but there is a level of cooperation we discovered while doing this, uh,

73
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.420
that deeply surprising sperm are not always about competing against each other.

74
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.880
And this we learned from Tim Burkhead who's a biologist at the University of

75
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.750
Sheffield. Uh, he told us the story about it was a, a wood mouse,

76
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:55.751
a w o o not it could mountain or I should know this is a,

77
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:59.840
this was a wood Woodmass, which actually a gift would mouse.

78
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.040
My colleague Harry Moore, who's a a sperm biologist here in Sheffield. Um,

79
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.230
his cat brought in a wood mouse.

80
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.710
Le Laid it on the dining room floor and he looked at it and thought, gosh,

81
00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:11.270
that's got large testicles.

82
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.290
He dissects and usual reaction to a Katz gift that I've heard in lung.

83
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.130
I'll say, if you're a testicle guy, you're a testicle guy.

84
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.120
You want to take a closer look. Anyway, so he dissects the uh,

85
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.620
he dissects the vows and then carefully removed the sperm inside and then he

86
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:32.510
looked at the shape of the sperm. This was interesting. All rodents, the,

87
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.690
uh, the sperm has a slightly hooked shaped head,

88
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.020
but in the wood mouse now hook is extreme.

89
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:43.010
So much so that the hook bends right back and touches the head again.

90
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.450
What Harry notice was that looked as though the hook was a specific adaptation

91
00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:49.490
to grasp the tails of other sperm.

92
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.180
This sperm on its head was a kind of grasping hook,

93
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.140
which suggested that maybe this spring wanted to hold hands.

94
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.500
Some things you put the sperm into our kind of special sperm medium and to his

95
00:06:01.501 --> 00:06:02.334
amazement,

96
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.110
the sperm all joined up together in what he called sperm trains.

97
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.630
Barium T. R. A. I. N. S. Yes. Like in a railway train.

98
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.660
The Tales of other sperm were held by this hook and it's just head to tail,

99
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:17.560
head to tail. It looks at, it's a bit messy.

100
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:19.750
It's a bit like spaghetti moving forward. Okay.

101
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.840
The amazing thing is when he measured the speed at which the sperm trains moved,

102
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:30.430
it was about twice that of isolated sperm. But wait a second,

103
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.330
when if,

104
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.360
if me and 700 others of us or 10 of us get together at the head and,

105
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.180
and swim together, our tales all increasing our speed,

106
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.460
who gets to be the daddy's brain? Then the wood mouse,

107
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.370
some of the sperm undergo what's called the acrosome reaction,

108
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.010
releasing this hook. And when that happens,

109
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.530
those sperm can no longer fertilized,

110
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:55.531
but they free a vanguard or sperm that then can fertilize and then they give up

111
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.550
for their brethren. Yeah, that's exactly it. Wow.

112
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.680
So then it's not fair to say that in down there at the spring loads every sperm

113
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:10.900
for himself in a few cases, the springs is there for the other guy. Yeah.

114
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.960
But they're all part of the same ejaculate,

115
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.760
all got roughly the same genetic makeup. All those sperm are related.

116
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:21.220
So they all have more or less a common interest.

117
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.520
So who do we help each other out? Yeah, I mean this is a, this is different.

118
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:31.110
However it is. Um, it is at this point, it's just specific to the Woodmass.

119
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.070
So wood mouse sperm seem to have a thing going on amongst us.

120
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.020
And the idea that a sperm would sacrifice itself for a brother's sperm is a very

121
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:43.350
novel. When you think about how normal normally this is thought of as such a

122
00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:45.410
competitive event. That's right. Well,

123
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.660
any case we hope you'll tune in for that show.

124
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:51.000
It's coming up in about a month and a half. It's not really a month and a half.

125
00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:52.440
If you're listening to this late in the week,

126
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.240
it's a month and two weeks from now. Okay. That's a month. It's a month.

127
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.480
It's so short. It's really five weeks from now going on four weeks.

128
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.890
And before you know it, it'll be three weeks. Ah. Do you see what I deal with?

129
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.660
Not so can you take them down please?

130
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.270
You can't take me down to pat him down please. Hey Andy Gay.

131
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:12.660
So visit our website,

132

Radiolab that or you can find out more about anything on our website and also we

133
00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:18.270
should say a, we should give thanks.

134
00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:22.530
We are funded by the corporation for public broadcasting. Oh wait. Hey, click.

135
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:23.364
Take him down.

who this month is honoring flash of genius,

138
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:34.710
the winner of the 2008 feature feature film prize in science and technology at

139
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:36.750
the Hamptons international film festival.

140
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.270
I'm Jad Abumrad okay. You can put them back up now. Obert Krulwich

141
