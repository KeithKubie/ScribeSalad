00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.880
Write the following
numbers as complex numbers.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.750
And just as a little
bit of a review,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.690
a complex number
is a number that

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.960
has a real part or
an imaginary part.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.280
Let me make that
clear-- has a real part

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.760
and an imaginary part.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.740
I'm going to write some
variables here-- a plus bi,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.470
where a is real and b is real.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.220
This is a complex number.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.550
This part right over
here is the real part.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.350
That is the real
part of the number.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.870
And this part right
over here is imaginary.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.150
And why is it imaginary?

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.370
Because it is a
scaled-up version

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
of this special number,
the imaginary unit.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.040
It's the special number i.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.509
It's scaled up by
b in this case.

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.300
And you may or may not
already be familiar.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.190
I know it's kind
of a wacky thing.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.520
But the definition of
i says that i squared

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.517
is equal to negative 1.

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:55.350
Hey, we didn't have any
numbers before where

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.840
if we took the square,
we get negative 1.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260
Now if you take i squared,
you get negative 1.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.580
So what's neat about
imaginary numbers

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.014
is that their
squares are negative.

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:06.430
And what's useful
about them is it

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.390
allows us to solve
a bunch of equations

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.390
that we couldn't have
solved if you're only

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.100
looking for real solutions.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.860
That has all sorts of
implications in engineering,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.224
especially, and other things
like physics and all the rest.

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:20.640
So right now, you
just really have

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.430
to go with this definition.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.680
You just have to go with
this definition and this one.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.060
And as we do more
numbers, and especially

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.170
once you see a lot more
engineering applications,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.350
hopefully you'll
realize the value of i

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.504
or the value of
imaginary numbers.

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:36.920
So going back to the problem--
write the following numbers

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.916
as complex.

00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.540
So this number right
here, this is just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630
a plain, vanilla negative 21.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.470
It just looks like
a real number to me.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.345
Well, how do I write
it as a complex number?

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:46.720
Well, I write it
as a combination

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.930
of a real and an
imaginary number.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.280
So I could just write
this as negative 21--

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.515
that's the real
part-- plus 0 times i.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.060
0 times i is 0, so it's still
just going to be negative 21.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.399
We have no imaginary
part, really.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190
So this is just the
complex version of it--

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.700
very straightforward.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.140
Same thing down here.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.500
7i is an imaginary number.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.070
There's no real part to this.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.220
So we could call this-- the
real part here is just 0.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.188
So this is 0 plus 7i.
