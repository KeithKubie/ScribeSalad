the removal of Qaddafi one reason behind
this was lack of adequate understanding

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340
this was lack of adequate understanding
 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.009
this was lack of adequate understanding
on part of the international community

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019
on part of the international community
 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.759

the sonne assumption that these rebels
that had asked for international

that had asked for international
intervention would have the capacity to

intervention would have the capacity to
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.390
intervention would have the capacity to
carry the country towards

carry the country towards
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
carry the country towards
democratization but of course this

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310
democratization but of course this
 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.430
democratization but of course this
missed the huge issue of the need for

missed the huge issue of the need for
 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.010
missed the huge issue of the need for
security sector reform and a security

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
security sector reform and a security
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.220
security sector reform and a security
strategy to secure Libya before any of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
strategy to secure Libya before any of

the political transition could actually

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910
the political transition could actually
 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.160
the political transition could actually
be viable

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
be viable
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.460

so here the role of Europe has been one

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
so here the role of Europe has been one

so here the role of Europe has been one
of lack of understanding unfortunately

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
of lack of understanding unfortunately
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.130
of lack of understanding unfortunately
and perhaps being too hasty and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
and perhaps being too hasty and
 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.970
and perhaps being too hasty and
expecting transformation to happen we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
expecting transformation to happen we
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.400
expecting transformation to happen we
shouldn't expect any country really to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
shouldn't expect any country really to
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.220
shouldn't expect any country really to
have a constitution ready in six months

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
have a constitution ready in six months
 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.340
have a constitution ready in six months
after having emerged from decades of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
after having emerged from decades of
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.050
after having emerged from decades of
autocracy and I'm afraid that the same

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060
autocracy and I'm afraid that the same
 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.670
autocracy and I'm afraid that the same
formula applies to other places in the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
formula applies to other places in the
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580
formula applies to other places in the
region not just Libya and I think Egypt

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
region not just Libya and I think Egypt
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.730
region not just Libya and I think Egypt
also demonstrates another situation in

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740
also demonstrates another situation in
 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.320
also demonstrates another situation in
which we've seen this eternal optimism

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330
which we've seen this eternal optimism
 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.600
which we've seen this eternal optimism
being hit with the harsh reality that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610
being hit with the harsh reality that
 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.990
being hit with the harsh reality that
again rushing a country to write a

again rushing a country to write a
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.870
again rushing a country to write a
constitution and expecting it to just

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
constitution and expecting it to just
 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.760
constitution and expecting it to just
become democratic and a very short

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770
become democratic and a very short
 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.070
become democratic and a very short
period of time is just not realistic and

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080
period of time is just not realistic and
 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.110
period of time is just not realistic and
what we've seen in Egypt in particular

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
what we've seen in Egypt in particular
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.520
what we've seen in Egypt in particular
is a case of inattention by Europe to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530
is a case of inattention by Europe to
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.670
is a case of inattention by Europe to
the importance of good governance when

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680
the importance of good governance when
 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.290
the importance of good governance when
it comes to not just democratic

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300
it comes to not just democratic
 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.930
it comes to not just democratic
transition but in general what I'm

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940
transition but in general what I'm
 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.360
transition but in general what I'm
saying here is that the optimism that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370
saying here is that the optimism that
 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.720
saying here is that the optimism that
happened regarding Egypt after the 2011

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
happened regarding Egypt after the 2011
 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.230
happened regarding Egypt after the 2011
uprising was coupled with turning a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240
uprising was coupled with turning a
 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.540
uprising was coupled with turning a
blind eye to the transgressions of the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550
blind eye to the transgressions of the
 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.030

everybody was saying but no this was a
 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.190
everybody was saying but no this was a

you should not do that
 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.420
you should not do that
without saying to any government that

a blind eye to the transgressions

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
a blind eye to the transgressions
 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.750
a blind eye to the transgressions

cracked down on so neither Islamists nor
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.150
cracked down on so neither Islamists nor
secularists I don't think we should take

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160
secularists I don't think we should take
 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.000
secularists I don't think we should take
sides when it comes to ideology but what

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010
sides when it comes to ideology but what
 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.250

own values unfortunately we are once
again seeing this formula of thinking

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250
again seeing this formula of thinking
 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.340
again seeing this formula of thinking
that European values belong in Europe

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350
that European values belong in Europe
 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.470
that European values belong in Europe
and perhaps the rest of the world you

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480
and perhaps the rest of the world you
 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.660
and perhaps the rest of the world you
know can can kind of abide by other

know can can kind of abide by other
 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.480
know can can kind of abide by other
values and we Ally ourselves with these

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490
values and we Ally ourselves with these

suffers in the process so this has been

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140
suffers in the process so this has been
 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.220
suffers in the process so this has been
unfortunately a process that has been

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230
unfortunately a process that has been
 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.400
unfortunately a process that has been
going on since before the Arab uprisings

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410
going on since before the Arab uprisings
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.740
going on since before the Arab uprisings
and it's really unfortunate that Europe

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750
and it's really unfortunate that Europe
 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.010
and it's really unfortunate that Europe
does not seem to have learnt very much

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020
does not seem to have learnt very much
 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.630
does not seem to have learnt very much

since those days the other issue that is
 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.510
since those days the other issue that is
of crucial importance is that of the

kind of sad stories that we are seeing
 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.760
kind of sad stories that we are seeing
in the region here is one country that

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770
in the region here is one country that
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.830
in the region here is one country that
is actually on the path towards

is actually on the path towards
 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.350
is actually on the path towards
democratization and yet the

democratization and yet the
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.560
democratization and yet the
democratization process in Tunisia risks

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570
democratization process in Tunisia risks
 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.280
democratization process in Tunisia risks

Europe has been very good at voicing

Europe has been very good at voicing
 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.420
Europe has been very good at voicing
moral and rhetorical support for the

economic strategies that would help this

country kind of recover economically and
 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.360
country kind of recover economically and
this is very important because the

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370
this is very important because the
 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.520
this is very important because the
people in Tunisia have had such high

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530
people in Tunisia have had such high
 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.980
people in Tunisia have had such high
expectations after the uprising that

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990
expectations after the uprising that
 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.790
expectations after the uprising that
this new phase will bring prosperity to

this new phase will bring prosperity to
 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.659
this new phase will bring prosperity to
the country and stability etc that they

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669
the country and stability etc that they
 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.490
the country and stability etc that they
have started to become rather

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500
have started to become rather
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.830
have started to become rather
disappointed because of the economic

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840
disappointed because of the economic
 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.409
disappointed because of the economic
crisis and actually it's very normal for

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:20.419
crisis and actually it's very normal for
 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.870
crisis and actually it's very normal for
any country undergoing transition to

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880
any country undergoing transition to
 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.210
any country undergoing transition to
have economic problems and so the

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220
have economic problems and so the
 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.340
have economic problems and so the

Tunisians are looking at Europe and

again feeling a bit abandoned feeling
 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.370
again feeling a bit abandoned feeling
that they need more support that is not

that they need more support that is not
 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.750
that they need more support that is not
happening and here I'm talking about

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760
happening and here I'm talking about

period of political change than this
 

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.320
period of political change than this
risks them losing hope and democracy

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330
risks them losing hope and democracy
 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.900
risks them losing hope and democracy
altogether and unfortunately some people

very unfortunate the third issue I will

a conflict but before it became a
full-blown war there still could have

full-blown war there still could have
 

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:41.240
full-blown war there still could have
been a diplomatic way after the crisis

been a diplomatic way after the crisis

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:22.379
after the crisis started we are
 

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:24.619
after the crisis started we are
beginning to see this huge wave of

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:24.629
beginning to see this huge wave of
 

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:28.189
beginning to see this huge wave of
Syrians reach European Shores some of

them alive many of them dead
 

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:31.069
them alive many of them dead
unfortunately

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079
unfortunately
 

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:34.240
unfortunately
until now there have been 3,000 dead

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.250
until now there have been 3,000 dead

migrants in the Mediterranean 70% of
 

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:41.540
migrants in the Mediterranean 70% of
whom are Syrian and so this state of

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.550
whom are Syrian and so this state of
 

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.290

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300
affairs is a result of this conflict
 

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.929
affairs is a result of this conflict
grinding on and the reason why people

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:47.939
grinding on and the reason why people
 

00:09:47.939 --> 00:09:50.569
grinding on and the reason why people
are now starting to try to reach Europe

00:09:50.569 --> 00:09:50.579
are now starting to try to reach Europe
 

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:52.790
are now starting to try to reach Europe
and larger numbers than before it's

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800
and larger numbers than before it's
 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.699
and larger numbers than before it's
partly out of despair because the people

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:55.709
partly out of despair because the people
 

00:09:55.709 --> 00:09:57.679
partly out of despair because the people
who are coming to Europe are not just

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:57.689
who are coming to Europe are not just
 

00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:01.009
who are coming to Europe are not just
coming from Syria itself but also from

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019
coming from Syria itself but also from
 

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:03.139
coming from Syria itself but also from
Lebanon and Jordan where a lot of

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:03.149

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:07.350
Syrians have been seeking refuge over
 

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.530
Syrians have been seeking refuge over
the last four years and in these

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540
the last four years and in these
 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.290
the last four years and in these
countries these refugees have no rights

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300
countries these refugees have no rights
 

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.439
countries these refugees have no rights
their living conditions are dire they

00:10:15.439 --> 00:10:15.449
their living conditions are dire they
 

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:18.620
their living conditions are dire they
are not allowed to work and therefore

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:18.630
are not allowed to work and therefore
 

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.389
are not allowed to work and therefore
they feel that they're simply wasting

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399
they feel that they're simply wasting
 

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.790
they feel that they're simply wasting
their lives the young people who are

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800
their lives the young people who are
 

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.620
their lives the young people who are
educated who are living in these

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.630
educated who are living in these
 

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.960
educated who are living in these
countries can

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:25.970
countries can
 

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.480
countries can
do by working under the table and menial

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.490
do by working under the table and menial
 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.490
do by working under the table and menial
jobs while the people with families

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.500
jobs while the people with families
 

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.439
jobs while the people with families
don't want their children to be raised

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:32.449
don't want their children to be raised
 

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:34.470
don't want their children to be raised
in this environment and become either

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480
in this environment and become either
 

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.660
in this environment and become either
members of criminal gangs or perhaps

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:37.670
members of criminal gangs or perhaps
 

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.749
members of criminal gangs or perhaps
terrorist groups or dark starvation and

00:10:40.749 --> 00:10:40.759
terrorist groups or dark starvation and
 

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:43.449
terrorist groups or dark starvation and
so they feel that even though there's a

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:43.459
so they feel that even though there's a
 

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:45.939
so they feel that even though there's a
risk of death reaching trying to reach

00:10:45.939 --> 00:10:45.949
risk of death reaching trying to reach
 

00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:48.129
risk of death reaching trying to reach
Europe is better than staying where they

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:48.139
Europe is better than staying where they
 

00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:50.889
Europe is better than staying where they
were and so here again Europe's

00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:50.899

exchange because I must say I would take

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:25.129
exchange because I must say I would take
 

00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:28.119

issue with a couple of points that Lina

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:28.129
issue with a couple of points that Lina
 

00:11:28.129 --> 00:11:29.679
issue with a couple of points that Lina
has made it's always more interesting I

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:29.689
has made it's always more interesting I
 

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.090
has made it's always more interesting I
think for the audience when the speakers

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.100
think for the audience when the speakers
 

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.850
think for the audience when the speakers
agree on everything there's not much to

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
agree on everything there's not much to
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.840
agree on everything there's not much to
debate and I'll just mention briefly

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:36.850
debate and I'll just mention briefly
 

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.420
debate and I'll just mention briefly
what they are first of all as you'll see

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.430
what they are first of all as you'll see
 

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.220
what they are first of all as you'll see
in a few moments the European Union has

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.230
in a few moments the European Union has
 

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.069
in a few moments the European Union has
devoted many many years and I would say

00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:45.079
devoted many many years and I would say
 

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.650
devoted many many years and I would say
misguidedly to democracy promotion in

misguidedly to democracy promotion in
different forms in North Africa and in

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:50.930
different forms in North Africa and in
 

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.799
different forms in North Africa and in
the Levant I'll describe that very

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:53.809
the Levant I'll describe that very
 

00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:56.679
the Levant I'll describe that very
briefly and it's not as if the European

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:56.689
briefly and it's not as if the European
 

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:59.439
briefly and it's not as if the European
Union institutions especially have not

00:11:59.439 --> 00:11:59.449
Union institutions especially have not
 

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:01.480
Union institutions especially have not
sought to do this there's been a very

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:01.490
sought to do this there's been a very
 

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.819
sought to do this there's been a very
active policy on that for more than a

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:03.829
active policy on that for more than a
 

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:07.150
active policy on that for more than a
decade and secondly I think the implicit

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160
decade and secondly I think the implicit
 

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.019
decade and secondly I think the implicit
model behind much that Lina said was the

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:10.029
model behind much that Lina said was the
 

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:12.699
model behind much that Lina said was the
expectation that outside actors would

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:12.709
expectation that outside actors would
 

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:15.100
expectation that outside actors would
come in and would somehow transform the

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:15.110
come in and would somehow transform the
 

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.769
come in and would somehow transform the
situation within these countries whereas

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:17.779
situation within these countries whereas
 

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.269
situation within these countries whereas
in fact I think what the United States

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279
in fact I think what the United States
 

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.670
in fact I think what the United States
and the Europeans have learned over the

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680
and the Europeans have learned over the
 

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.309
and the Europeans have learned over the
last 10 or 15 years whether in Eastern

00:12:24.309 --> 00:12:24.319
last 10 or 15 years whether in Eastern
 

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:27.340
last 10 or 15 years whether in Eastern
Europe whether in Ukraine or or in Syria

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:27.350
Europe whether in Ukraine or or in Syria
 

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.740
Europe whether in Ukraine or or in Syria
or in North Africa is that an

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:29.750
or in North Africa is that an
 

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.860
or in North Africa is that an
indispensable condition for

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:31.870
indispensable condition for
 

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.569
indispensable condition for
transformation of societies is what is

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:34.579
transformation of societies is what is
 

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:36.260
transformation of societies is what is
called more and more local

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:36.270
called more and more local
 

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.660
called more and more local
ownership the political forces within

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:38.670
ownership the political forces within
 

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.630
ownership the political forces within
the countries themselves must embrace

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640
the countries themselves must embrace
 

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.960
the countries themselves must embrace
the objectives and if they don't then

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:44.970
the objectives and if they don't then
 

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.510
the objectives and if they don't then
the effort to impose change even

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:47.520
the effort to impose change even
 

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.120
the effort to impose change even
pro-democracy change from outside I

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.130
pro-democracy change from outside I
 

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.680
pro-democracy change from outside I
think is doomed to failure beginning in

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:53.690
think is doomed to failure beginning in
 

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:58.390
think is doomed to failure beginning in
2003 2004 after the successful

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:58.400
2003 2004 after the successful
 

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.340
2003 2004 after the successful
relatively successful experience with

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.350
relatively successful experience with
 

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.160
relatively successful experience with
the hungry with the the Czech Republic

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.170
the hungry with the the Czech Republic
 

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.160
the hungry with the the Czech Republic
with the estonia with poland and the

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.170
with the estonia with poland and the
 

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.960
with the estonia with poland and the
various other countries that had

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:08.970
various other countries that had
 

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.120
various other countries that had
overthrown communism the EU then in 2003

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.130
overthrown communism the EU then in 2003
 

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.430
overthrown communism the EU then in 2003
2004 for said to itself but what about

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440
2004 for said to itself but what about
 

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.980
2004 for said to itself but what about
the countries surrounding the European

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:18.990
the countries surrounding the European
 

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.130
the countries surrounding the European
Union who are not destined to become

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.140
Union who are not destined to become
 

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.560
Union who are not destined to become
members and so the EU developed a policy

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:24.570
members and so the EU developed a policy
 

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.110
members and so the EU developed a policy
for the whole of the southern and

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120
for the whole of the southern and
 

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.870
