[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.900
SPEAKER 1: Please join
me in welcoming Bassem

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.970
Youssef and Sarah Taksler.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:19.260
SARA TAKSLER: No, you go.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.485
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No,
no, you're here.

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:21.370
You're the director.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.730
OK?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.090
Hi.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.450
Hi, guys.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.755
SPEAKER 1: Hi,
welcome to Google.

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.050
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh, guys, the
voice quality here is amazing.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.410
SARA TAKSLER: It is.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.430
SPEAKER 1: I know, right?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.230
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Damn, I mean,
you do pay a lot of money

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.070
to do stuff very nicely here.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.450
SPEAKER 1: Spare no expense.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.009
Thank you.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.100
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Everything-- actually, I'm

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.440
very surprised and very
happy that many of you

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.184
left all of the temptations and
the restaurants and the food

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.350
and the ping pong tables
to come here, so thank you.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.090
SPEAKER 1: There's free food,
literally, across the hall.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.460
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I know.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.740
I have seen it.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.370
SPEAKER 1: And all these
people forewent that.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.510
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I have
eaten in like, five

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.676
different restaurants today.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:49.450
SPEAKER 1: Perfect,
perfect, perfect.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.470
SARA TAKSLER: We've
already decided

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.670
that we're going to finish this
and eat again before we leave.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.910
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.368
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely, take a
to-go bag, line your pockets,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:56.220
the whole lot.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.136
SARA TAKSLER: Exactly.

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:59.477
SPEAKER 1: Well, so thank
you for coming, first of all.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:01.060
I want to start by
just saying there's

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.760
a scene in this film where
two of your producers

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.919
are sitting on a couch.

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.460
And they say to each
other, you know,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.500
I remember when we
were afraid to talk

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.480
about politics in a taxi.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.940
We were afraid to talk
about politics in public,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.140
and then Bassem happened.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.290
So that Bassem is our
guest, of course, today.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.669
And you were trained as
a cardiothoracic surgeon,

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.710
but you're best known
throughout the Middle East,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.770
and in Egypt especially, as
the host of "Al-Bernameg."

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.510
If any of you haven't
seen the film,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.310
it's hard to
overstate exactly how

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.220
popular this series has been--

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.160
40 million weekly views?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.141
OK, so to put that
in perspective,

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:39.890
Jon Stewart's "Daily
Show," at its height,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.690
got about 2 million.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.299
And the population of
Egypt is about 90 million.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.340
BASSEM YOUSSEF: 100, now.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.800
SPEAKER 1: A now?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.424
BASSEM YOUSSEF: We
reproduce very fast.

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:48.870
SPEAKER 1: OK, very good.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.385
Good on you.

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:50.263
BASSEM YOUSSEF: He tuned--

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:51.300
SARA TAKSLER: Now
that the show's off,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.090
they have nothing to do.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.725
SPEAKER 1: That's exactly right.

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:54.503
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah, I mean,
they have nothing else to do.

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:55.580
SPEAKER 1: Now that you've
left, they've really

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.510
kicked it into high gear.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.530
BASSEM YOUSSEF: They
need to fill their time

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.660
with other
productive-- literally,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.490
productive-- activities.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.980
SPEAKER 1: So the
story of the film

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.940
is, really, it chronicles
your rise to stardom

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.590
and your first encounters
with the government.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.220
It starts as sort of
a trickle and then

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.460
it becomes more serious as the
Arab Spring, and the transition

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.090
from the Mubarak to the Morsi,
to the Sisi governments.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.100
Can you just catch
us up on all of this?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.120
What is the state of
politics in Egypt today,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.620
and where has it
come since Mubarak?

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.330
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Do
you have five hours?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.357
SPEAKER 1: You have
about 30 seconds.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.440
BASSEM YOUSSEF: All right.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.200
Very, very--

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.060
SPEAKER 1: The Arab
Spring, in a sense.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.380
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Very fast.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.420
OK, so since 1950s, Egypt and
most of the Arab countries

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.421
are under military
dictatorship, that-- we

00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:42.170
were told from a very
young age that these

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.650
were amazing revolutions, but
these were military coups that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.050
were turned into military rule.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.800
And there was always this
kind of very delicate balance

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.020
between a dictatorship and
a cartoonish or fake kind

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.700
of opposition.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.020
They were allowed to be
present, but it's not really,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.710
it's just like-- it's
event, it's an act.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.840
And when the
revolution happened,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.310
it was the first time that
authorities were afraid

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.170
of the people, not the opposite.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.045
For the first time, comedy
was directed to authority, not

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:20.670
towards people.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.420
We have a very long tradition
of comedy in the Middle East,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.500
especially in Egypt.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.260
But mostly, it was
only social comedy.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.440
We were allowed to make
fun of ourselves, but--

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.250
and kind of like, hint,
very remotely, to authority.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.000
But that was the first time
that we would go heads-on

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
against the authorities.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.430
SPEAKER 1: And the revolution
you're talking about

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.080
is the overthrow
of Hosni Mubarak.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.470
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.469
SPEAKER 1: So what were
you doing at that point?

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.480
BASSEM YOUSSEF: At that time,
I was just, like, a doctor,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.400
trying to stitch people
in Tahrir Square.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.295
Like, stitch as in
taking stitches, not

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.420
as-- is there other meanings?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.370
Anyway, so at that time,
what inspired us to start

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.260
this is that there were
two different realities.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.820
There's the reality in
Tahrir Square-- what you see,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.530
it's a revolution, people
standing up, people rising.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.820
And there's their reality--

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.230
anti-revolution, which is a
state-run, absolutely skewed

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.769
false information.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.100
So we had fake news before
you ever heard this term.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.000
And I'm glad that you
are following suit

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.620
and you're catching up with
our leadership and our--

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.100
SPEAKER 1: And
we'll get into that.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.391
BASSEM YOUSSEF: For once, we
are pioneers at something.

00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:34.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:38.000
No, seriously, all of
that stuff about Obama

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.840
being a secret Muslim
and he found ISIS?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.090
We had that way before you.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.140
So it's time for
you to catch up.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.620
We had this old, kind
of, conspiracy talk.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.480
And like, how there's not a
revolution, it's a conspiracy.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.530
So this was making me and
a lot of people very angry.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.040
And after everything
settled down,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.460
something had to be made
to remind people that this

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.230
is what they were consuming.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.060
And we made fun and
we showed what kind

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.180
of pointed, direct
propaganda that

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.359
was used in order to alienate
people against the revolution.

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.650
And this is how it all started.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.655
At that time, I didn't
expect that a lot of people

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:22.280
would watch it.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.610
I mean--

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.460
SPEAKER 1: So how did it start?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.751
How did you do your first show?

00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:26.750
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Uh,
in my laundry room,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.680
I got one table and one
camera, and a $100 banner

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.520
behind me that showed
pictures, like a collage

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.530
from the Tahrir Square scenes.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.810
And at that time, I was getting
ready to leave to the United

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.790
States, because I was accepted
in a [INAUDIBLE] surgery

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.360
fellowship in Cleveland,
out of all places.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.090
And nothing tells you how
excited I was to leave, are

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.810
or how desperate I was, to be
excited to go to Cleveland.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.295
Yeah.

00:05:57.295 --> 00:05:59.420
SPEAKER 1: And what was
your success like early on?

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.066
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Not
going to Cleveland.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:03.430
Sorry, go ahead.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.930
SPEAKER 1: No, so
you started your show

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.270
and how did people receive it?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.210
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, I
was expecting 10,000 views.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.750
And in less than--

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.809
after very few weeks,
I had 5 million.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.100
And I know that 5 million
doesn't sound like a lot now.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.540
You can get those kind of views.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.060
But at that time, 2011,
Egypt, that was a big deal.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.490
And suddenly, I had every
single TV station coming up

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.900
and trying to sign me up.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.710
And I was put in a choice--
should I go and continue

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.460
my work as a doctor and heal
hearts, or sell out and take

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.450
the money, which I did.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.497
And I did that and I
continued and stayed in Egypt.

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:48.580
And I was terrified, I
didn't know the first thing

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.800
about doing a show--

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.960
or, let alone, doing a TV show.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.590
And we started from
a small TV show.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.220
Then after one season,
I decided that I am done

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.720
with small shows on television.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.980
I want to do live audience.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.180
And again, that was a concept
that was not even [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.660
Having people coming-- real
people, not paid people.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.610
People coming in
and watch a show,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.070
and follow and react and
laugh and clap-- that

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.800
was not a concept that
was in the Arab world.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.140
And I said, I want
to go to the source.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.370
I want to know how this is done.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.720
I went to New York and I
met with Jon Stewart's team,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.370
and this is where I met Sarah.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.120
And Sarah said, for some reason,
which she will explain why,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.180
now, that she wanted to
do a documentary about me.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.955
SPEAKER 1: So Sara
knew then that--

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.020
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No, no--

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.853
she found that my story
is very interesting.

00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:40.295
She's like, would you like me--

00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:41.670
can I do a
documentary about you?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.270
I was like, yeah, sure, why not?

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.853
SARA TAKSLER: This
was the day we met.

00:07:44.853 --> 00:07:46.990
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I mean,
who would say 'no' to this?

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.855
I mean, if there is a
documentary done about you,

00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:51.730
you are either dead or
an endangered species.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.445
So for me to have a
documentary done about--

00:07:54.445 --> 00:07:56.070
SARA TAKSLER: And he
is one of the two.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.860
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes, and
almost was the other.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.720
So she said can you do that?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.582
And we thought that this would
be like, a nine month project,

00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:08.290
and it continued.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.922
SARA TAKSLER: Well, his
show wasn't on the air yet,

00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:12.130
in front of a live audience--

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.310
SPEAKER 1: Why this guy?

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.685
SARA TAKSLER: So
there was no way

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:16.590
to know that it was going
to be such a huge story.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.277
And I mean, I was
interested that they

00:08:19.277 --> 00:08:21.610
were doing the same thing
that I do at "The Daily Show,"

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.110
but with such high stakes.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.090
But also, I just couldn't
imagine Jon Stewart

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.790
being a heart surgeon during
the day, and then at night,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.500
hosting the show.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500
And that was Bassem was
still doing at the time.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.461
He was still a heart surgeon.

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:34.419
So I knew they were going
to leave the next day

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.669
and I just didn't want to
regret not having asked.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.909
And I felt like he would be
a really great character.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.408
So I asked if we
could make a movie.

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.750
But neither of us knew
that the story would

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.970
become even such higher stakes.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.490
And pretty soon after
that, he started

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.950
to get called in for questioning
by the government jokes.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.650
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yeah, but
what's the other reason

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.760
you did the movie?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.390
My crew.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.080
SARA TAKSLER: Oh, yeah.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.246
Well, another thing I thought
was really interesting

00:08:58.246 --> 00:09:01.360
was he came with maybe four
producers, and two of them

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.320
were women.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.860
And I was just very curious--

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.600
BASSEM YOUSSEF: And
they're like, oh my god,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.300
women in the Middle East
are allowed to leave home?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.542
SARA TAKSLER: And I
was-- no, not that.

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:07.720
I was just curious
what it would be

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.940
like to be my counterpart,
as like, a woman working

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.902
at a comedy show in Egypt.

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:14.110
I was very curious with that
atmosphere will be like.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.740
And then when I got there,
it was such a nonevent.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.897
Like, at least half the
office, maybe 3/4 of the office

00:09:20.897 --> 00:09:21.730
were actually women.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.460
And it didn't end
up becoming part

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.181
of the story we told, because
it was not really a big deal

00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:27.680
there.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.320
SPEAKER 1: So this was
when his fame was rising.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.180
But when did the
stakes start to rise?

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.790
When did you start to feel
a little sense of friction

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.081
between you and the government?

00:09:35.081 --> 00:09:37.330
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Right
after the second episode

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.930
of the new season
of the live show.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.360
Because at that time, the
Muslim Brotherhood kind of

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.280
took control of the presidency.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.740
And I was just
making fun of them

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.260
and everybody was starting
to watch the show,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.200
and it was increasing by the
millions like, two, three,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.020
four, five, six, 10 millions,
and it was increasing.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.720
And I became kind of
a thorn in the side

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.380
of authority and their media.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.690
There were Islamic
media that were hated me

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.650
and yet would play hours
and hours of my show.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.910
It was like as if they
were doing my second run.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.030
So half of the people
who were watching me

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.170
were hate-watching me.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.140
And they were doing very
well for the ratings,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.720
which is great.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.220
SPEAKER 1: Do you think it was
your fame or the content that

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.880
sort of caught their
attention first?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.921
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No, it's.

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:31.030
More complex than this you see
we belong to a certain culture

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.280
where making fun--

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.550
not even making fun--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:41.680
opposing or arguing, or going
against the power and authority

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.740
is something that's
not very popular.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.810
From a very young
age, we are taught

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.544
that there's the father
figure, and then the teacher,

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:50.710
who's another father figure.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.510
And then there is the
headmaster and then

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.400
your boss, and then
your leader and then

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.980
your president, and
then your sheik.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.030
All of these authorities are--

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.410
there's some kind of a taboo
to go against the authority.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.100
And there's also a tendency
in the Middle East,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.670
where someone who would attain
a certain type of authority

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.800
that he would link
himself to the ideology.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.300
So if he's an Islamic
president, you

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.560
make fun of him-- you
make fun of Islam.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.726
If he is a military president,
you make fun of him--

00:11:13.726 --> 00:11:16.230
you're making fun of
patriotism and the military.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.864
So that was the biggest thing.

00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:19.280
So you go in,
people are like, oh,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.264
how come you make fun of Islamic
[INAUDIBLE] Muslim president?

00:11:23.264 --> 00:11:25.180
And the same thing
happened when Sisi came up,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.190
it was like, oh my god, you're
making fun of our president.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.050
You're a spy, you're
a CIA operative--

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.770
which was published
in black and white,

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.110
that I was trained by the
CIA, recruited by Jon Stewart.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.110
SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.924
SARA TAKSLER: That's true.

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:37.049
BASSEM YOUSSEF: It's true,
I'm not making this up--

00:11:37.049 --> 00:11:39.347
SPEAKER 1: "Zionist Operative
Jon Stewart Trains CIA

00:11:39.347 --> 00:11:40.430
Operative, Bassem Youssef.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.750
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes, yeah.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.370
SPEAKER 1: We'll get to that.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.480
SARA TAKSLER: That's
why Jon didn't have time

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.480
to be a heart surgeon, because
he had to work at the CIA--

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.510
SPEAKER 1: That's right, all
the training, the recruiting--

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.202
BASSEM YOUSSEF: That's why the
CIA are l actually going down,

00:11:49.202 --> 00:11:50.660
because if they
can only find Jon--

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.243
SPEAKER 1: I mean,
40 million a week--

00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:54.550
that's pretty good
for government work.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.259
So why were you arrested?

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:58.300
BASSEM YOUSSEF: There was
a warrant for my arrest

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.966
and I went to questioning
for six hours.

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:03.820
And I ended up paying
bail, and I went out.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.550
So I was released on bail.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:15.160
And there was accusations
that I insulted Islam,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.130
that I have insulted the
president, of spreading rumors,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.350
disturbing the peace-- which is
a very vague accusation-- it's

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.910
very easy to get you in jail.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.080
Yeah, and it was funny,
because for six hours,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.100
I was being asked about,
why are these jokes funny?

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.680
Which is the worst thing that
you can do to any comedian.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.230
And I think they didn't care
about actually arresting me,

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.155
they wanted to demoralize,
they want to destroy my morals.

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:41.530
SPEAKER 1: So I think this is
a really interesting point,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.540
because for those of
us who pay attention

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.120
to of the struggle for human
rights around the world,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.450
there's a tendency
to sort of glaze over

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.060
the mechanics of censorship,
and to present it as very

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.904
much like, there are heroes in
a struggle against bad people.

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.820
But one thing that this
film does really well,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.861
and I'd love it if you
could talk about it, Sara,

00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:04.330
is it explores the day-to
day life of somebody

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.085
making controversial content.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:09.640
The sort of, like, quotidian
experiences of somebody

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.740
yelling at you on the
street, or of your parents

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.100
saying maybe you shouldn't do
this, or of a studio executive

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.410
applying subtle pressure
before the government

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.260
actually comes and censors.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.000
What is it like in the
journey of working your way up

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.220
to having the
government arrest you?

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.080
SARA TAKSLER:
Well, in terms of--

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.830
SPEAKER 1: And
what was that like,

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:27.890
capturing that experience?

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.473
SARA TAKSLER: The
story-telling of it?

00:13:29.473 --> 00:13:33.770
Yeah, I mean, for me, "Tickling
Giants" is about Bassem,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.542
but it happens to
be about Bassem,

00:13:35.542 --> 00:13:37.250
and it's about Egypt
and the Arab Spring,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.958
but that just happens
to be the backdrop.

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.480
To The story, for
me, was that's so

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.360
cool, this guy, who's
a very ordinary guy,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.520
sees his country going
through a hard time

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.189
and decides to do
something about it.

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:49.230
That's what the story is.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.020
And most people are not
going to have their country

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.940
fall into revolution and then
decide to start a comedy show

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.350
and have it be the most
popular comedy show in history.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.501
That's not going to be a
very common experience.

00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:02.000
But--

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.410
SPEAKER 1: And you didn't
know any of that when

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.090
you started filming, right?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.370
SARA TAKSLER: No, I didn't.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.010
I just knew that I found him
to be an interesting character.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.275
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Not even funny--
she doesn't think I'm funny.

00:14:08.275 --> 00:14:10.210
SARA TAKSLER: I don't find
him funny, personally.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.840
SPEAKER 1: An excuse to
travel to Egypt, yeah.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.320
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I don't find--

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.580
SARA TAKSLER: It's
not my taste, but--

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.080
no, I--

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.830
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I
don't blame you.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.470
SARA TAKSLER: I
like the idea of--

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.910
"Tickling Giants" is like
finding a creative nonviolent

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:21.410
way to express yourself.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.350
And less than a mile away
from Bassem's office,

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.200
people were killing each other
in Tahrir Square to be heard.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.680
And his team was finding a
creative way to be heard.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.840
And because they were
choosing nonviolence,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.710
their voices were
so much louder,

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.429
and that really intrigued me.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:38.720
SPEAKER 1: What is it like
when you have a conversation

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.220
with your studio exec?

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.160
Are they saying, can
you tone it down?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.460
Look, if you-- look, let's be
real, if you keep up with this,

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.960
they're going to
throw you in jail.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.335
BASSEM YOUSSEF: There were
hardly any conversation there,

00:14:50.335 --> 00:14:51.430
because once--

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.320
so during the Muslim
Brotherhood, I was like,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.160
the darling of the
studio, because they

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.660
were against the
Muslim Brotherhood,

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.670
so they kind of like let
me do whatever I want.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:07.370
And then once the revolution
or slash coup happened,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.310
after the Muslim
Brotherhood, they

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.874
were pretty much pro-military.

00:15:11.874 --> 00:15:13.540
And the military, you
would understand--

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.710
if you live in the Middle
East, and especially Egypt,

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.168
long enough, you
understand and you

00:15:17.168 --> 00:15:20.660
realize that the military is
even more sacred than religion.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.600
People revere
military above all.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.310
The army is just untouchable.

00:15:31.882 --> 00:15:34.340
And the dynamics were different,
because under Morsi, there

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.437
were like pro-Islamic
and anti-Islamic media.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.770
So it was equal, people are
just clashing at each other.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.820
SPEAKER 1: And they
sort of made gestures

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.770
that they were going to
expand freedom of expression

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.580
under Morsi, right?

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.375
BASSEM YOUSSEF: To what?

00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:46.820
SPEAKER 1: To expand freedom
of speech under Morsi, right?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.140
Where that was--

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.010
BASSEM YOUSSEF: To expand?

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.718
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:15:48.718 --> 00:15:51.290
I thought I read that when
Morsi became president,

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.720
that he made gestures that he
was actually willing to have

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.280
more free speech--

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.340
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Yeah, he was willing.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.110
But what was happening
was more pressure

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.410
on freedom of expression.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:02.480
But at least there
was, like, a conflict.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.880
But with the military,
there's no conflict,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.395
because all of the pro-Islamic
channels were closed down.

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:09.860
And I was happy
at the beginning,

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.000
because there were channels that
were spreading hate and racism.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.100
But then the pro-military
channel did the same thing.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.130
And under the military, we were
the only dissenting voice--

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:22.970
there was no other.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.590
Everybody was
praising the military.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.720
And then it took them one show,
one episode, to close me down.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.190
Just to suggest some satirical
jokes about what happened,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.190
and I found myself
unemployed for four months.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.790
I found another channel
and then 11 weeks

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.940
into, that I got
shot down again.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.650
And people were either
apathetic or welcoming, or just,

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.630
like, very angry, but
couldn't do anything.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.340
Under the military,
it's just, like,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.920
this is the one force that
you cannot really go against.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.810
SPEAKER 1: So you just get
an email one day that says,

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.310
you're done.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.050
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Not an e-mail--

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:07.026
no, we they actually broke
up with me on national TV.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:08.599
SARA TAKSLER: Post-it note.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:11.869
BASSEM YOUSSEF: We
didn't know-- we used

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.810
to air at 10:00 PM, Fridays.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:21.470
So 10:05, Friday, the
show was not aired.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.690
And then they came up
with a statement, like,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.220
we regret that we
cannot continue.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.339
And we had shot the episode
and waiting for it--

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.187
we didn't know we.

00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:31.520
Were watching it, and I'm
having calls of what happened?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.930
I don't know.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:33.620
So that was--

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:33.910
SPEAKER 1: That's
one way to do it.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.240
SARA TAKSLER: We thought there
were technical difficulties,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.010
because there were watch
parties where people would just

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.910
gather in the streets
to watch the episode--

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.490
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yeah, they
were kind of like Super Bowl--

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.240
people watching and waiting.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.690
And then they said, well,
the show is canceled.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.450
And everyone-- there
was like, whole anger.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.100
So it's kind of like two
levels of being someone

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.570
breaking up with
you on WhatsApp.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.236
SPEAKER 1: But--

00:17:54.236 --> 00:17:55.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.780
--throughout this process--
or Google Hangouts--

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.011
throughout this process your--

00:18:00.011 --> 00:18:01.136
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh, sorry--

00:18:01.136 --> 00:18:01.820
oh, sorry.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.111
SPEAKER 1: We're on brand here.

00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:03.734
Yeah, come on.

00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:04.650
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Sorry.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.316
SPEAKER 1: They're
just going to yank me

00:18:06.316 --> 00:18:07.670
off stage if I don't do that.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.216
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh my god.

00:18:08.216 --> 00:18:09.955
I shouldn't even
mention Facebook, then.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.152
SPEAKER 1: That's OK, that's OK.

00:18:12.152 --> 00:18:14.360
Throughout this process,
you're experiencing pressure

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.070
from the government, but there
must be societal, cultural--

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.410
your friends, people you know.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.292
The film portrays
really vividly, sort of,

00:18:23.292 --> 00:18:25.250
the experience of your
staff walking in and out

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.389
of the office.

00:18:26.389 --> 00:18:28.430
And having to go around
and not be seen together,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.680
and not be seen looking
out the windows.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.900
What was it like
producing this documentary

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.200
and producing the show
in that kind of climate?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.100
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
So for me, we had

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.950
kind of a cultural and
generational divide,

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.729
because many of my
staff had to come

00:18:43.729 --> 00:18:45.145
against the will
of their parents.

00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:45.853
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:49.180
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Because, like,
especially under the military,

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.360
many of my family kind
of went against me,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.310
and they believed the
fact that I was a spy

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.720
and I was paid by America.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.430
And people that I went
to school-- for 20 years,

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.030
known these friends
for 20 years,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.540
started to doubt my intentions.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.810
The amount of people that I
lost, that came out of my life,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:12.340
that I blocked on
Facebook was a lot.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.720
And it was very
hard, because here--

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.166
[INAUDIBLE] like,
a bunch of people

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:21.040
shouting death threats
to you in the streets,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.980
and that's not even [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.760
It's people that you knew all
throughout your life, people

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.820
that were your flesh and
blood, who went against you.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.240
And that was very difficult. But
then I was like, you know what?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.870
Screw them.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.605
SPEAKER 1: So
Sara, you start off

00:19:35.605 --> 00:19:37.980
wanting to make a documentary
about an interesting person

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.160
that sort of exemplifies
the story of using comedy

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.890
as a weapon in politics,
did you ever have

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.530
a moment where you said, uh-oh.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.110
I might need to get out
of here, this is not safe.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.610
Or--

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.290
SARA TAKSLER: There
were a few moments where

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.940
it felt a little questionable.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.680
I mean, one, Bassem
mentioned, right,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.950
that I was there when the show
got canceled the first time.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.940
And I was sitting in someone's
house who works for the show,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.600
and we were watching it on TV.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.940
And she was like,
you should leave.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.440
You have footage that they're
not going to want you to have.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.680
And I was supposed to
fly out two days later,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.850
and I was at the airport.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.725
And as my drives were
going through security,

00:20:13.725 --> 00:20:15.074
I had just seen "Argo"--

00:20:15.074 --> 00:20:15.990
that was out the time.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.510
I just couldn't wait for the
plane to get into the air.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.593
SPEAKER 1: The filmmaker--

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:20.800
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.600
But within the office,
I mostly felt very safe,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.230
because the people I was
with were the people who

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.100
like to work at a comedy show.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.710
It was very familiar for me.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.072
But there were certain times,
like when they were first

00:20:35.072 --> 00:20:37.530
told that they were going to
be some protesters showing up,

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.446
there had been people
posting on the internet,

00:20:39.446 --> 00:20:41.551
and there were concerns
that it might be violent.

00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:43.050
And so they told
the staff that they

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.690
didn't have to come in the
next day of the taping.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.021
And so some people on the
staff looked pretty nervous.

00:20:48.021 --> 00:20:49.770
And I was like, oh,
if they don't come in,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.964
I don't have to come.

00:20:50.964 --> 00:20:53.130
And so I was kind of like,
(WHISPERS) don't come in!

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.540
Because I was scared.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.760
And they went around the
room, and they were like,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.330
are you going to come?

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:57.810
Are you going to come?

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:58.920
And everyone was like,
yeah, I'll be here.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.461
I'll be here.

00:20:59.461 --> 00:21:01.590
And I was like, oh
man, if they're brave,

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.430
I have to be brave.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.070
So I really took my
cues from the staff,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.090
and they consistently
stepped up.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.220
BASSEM YOUSSEF: And
there was one time that

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.430
was really violent, and I
was calling Sara to come,

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.470
and she was in America.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.382
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah, so
someone from his staff

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:20.340
was like, you might not
want to come right now,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.256
things are really bad.

00:21:21.256 --> 00:21:25.404
So I talked to Bassem to ask
his opinion, and he said, look,

00:21:25.404 --> 00:21:26.320
I'm going to be there.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.570
My staff is going to be there.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.270
Worst case scenario-- a
producer from "The Daily Show"

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.370
gets blown up and I
get tons of press.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.560
So I think you should come.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.387
And I went, so--

00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:37.370
SPEAKER 1: It'd be huge.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.310
So this segues, I
think, to another topic

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.430
that I wanted to cover.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.520
Which is the Committee to
Protect Journalists awarded

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.010
Bassem the International
Press Freedom Award,

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.330
I think, in 2013.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.520
And there's a
tendency with people

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.480
who advocate for free speech to,
sort of, lionize these people.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.380
Declare them living saints,
like they can do no wrong,

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.700
they have to never be afraid.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.230
And something that I
think the film touches on,

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.920
in a really human way,
is the personal cost

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.880
of this day-to-day-- the cost on
your family, on your daughter,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.720
on the staff.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.230
And it makes real the fact
that this is a really stressful

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.030
situation, and
acknowledging that you're

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.670
going to have to go off-air.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.770
Bassem, when you were doing
the Q&amp;A on your last live show,

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.740
and the audience was
heckling you, basically,

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.790
at one point, saying, why
aren't you doing this?

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.873
Why aren't you doing this?

00:22:28.873 --> 00:22:30.780
Stand up to them.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.424
You very earnestly,
say, I'm working on it,

00:22:33.424 --> 00:22:34.340
but I can't right now.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.030
BASSEM YOUSSEF: So
this was not the only--

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.200
this was actually
members of the press

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.279
who showed their disappointment
with me, how I'm not

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.320
brave enough to stand up.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.153
And the guy who was
leading that heckling, I

00:22:48.153 --> 00:22:50.970
met him in Germany three
days later, and he came up

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:51.840
and he apologized.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.030
And was like, I'm sorry,
I escaped to Egypt shortly

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.085
after you did.

00:22:55.085 --> 00:22:56.190
SARA TAKSLER: From Egypt.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.780
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
From Egypt-- and I'm

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.447
very sorry that I
didn't understand.

00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:03.030
I didn't understand that kind
of pressure that you were under.

00:23:05.556 --> 00:23:07.650
People were hanging on--

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.650
it was not anger at
me, as much as anger

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.370
of the whole situation--
that this hope

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:12.690
that we had been taken away.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.040
Because I was not the first
to be taken off the air.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.920
They would-- it
happened very slowly.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.239
But we were the biggest,
so when that happened--

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:23.280
people were just waiting.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.160
They looked at us as the
thermometer of freedom.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.530
If that show is off
the air, that's it,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.440
we are back to square one again.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.890
And when that happened, people
were even more angry at me,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.330
not at what happened.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.604
It's like, guys, I'm
not the bad guy here.

00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:40.770
SPEAKER 1: And that's kind
of what I want to get at.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.540
I mean, can you talk about--

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.440
how do you calibrate
sticking with it

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.874
versus knowing that you
need to sort of accede

00:23:48.874 --> 00:23:50.040
to the government's demands?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.373
Or when do you decide to leave--

00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:52.630
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No demands--

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.920
you either say what's right,
or you don't say it at all.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.260
Because I was given
other options.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.490
I was giving an option
to stay and play along,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:04.180
and be part of that
pre-revolution--

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.110
SPEAKER 1: So they were
going to let you keep

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.600
the show if you basically--

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.516
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh yeah,
and tripled my salary

00:24:08.516 --> 00:24:09.230
and everything.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.290
It was on the table.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:18.444
And And even after I left, they
were tries to bring me back.

00:24:18.444 --> 00:24:19.860
Like every couple
of months, there

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.030
was someone who'd
call me, and it's

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.840
like, we'd like to get you back.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.673
And it's like, what do
you mean, 'get back'?

00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:25.900
Well, you can come back
and say whatever you want,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.170
but there's going to
be some understanding.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.190
And understanding,
in that lingo,

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.444
means that we're going
to review your script.

00:24:34.444 --> 00:24:36.110
SPEAKER 1: Do you
still get those calls?

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.401
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:40.460
I mean, not very recently.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.060
And the thing is, my answer
was always the same--

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.250
I cannot be a makeup on
the face of your regime.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.020
You want me back
just to save face,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.740
to tell people that
we have democracy.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.500
Here's "Al-Bernameg"
and Bassem Youssef,

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.271
he's always back and
everything is good.

00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.520
But it's not, because many
of my friends, many of them

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.120
are in jail.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.680
Many of them are disappeared.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.131
Many of them are
not living anymore.

00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:02.880
They got killed
[INAUDIBLE] because of it.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.910
So you cannot go back with
a good heart and say, hey,

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.590
let's make fun of
things, you know?

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:17.550
First of all, I always say this,
and I make some people angry

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.050
when I say, comedians
and satirists,

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.050
they're not freedom fighters,
they're not activists.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.920
They are someone who
try to say their opinion

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.030
in a different way.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:32.700
Nobody should get hurt if
they would tell their opinion.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.615
And even when Jon
Stewart, in the middle,

00:25:35.615 --> 00:25:37.740
between the first and the
second time I was banned,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.470
he said, man, it's not--
he was calling me, saying,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.040
it's not worth it.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.950
Your safety is more important.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.320
So it is not--

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.360
there's no reason to play
chicken and jeopardize

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.940
your life and other
lives around you.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.350
SARA TAKSLER: And that was
towards the end of the show.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.790
It was hard, because I
didn't know what to root for.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:05.580
As someone who has lived my life
in comedy and who loves satire,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.917
the show was very
symbolic for me, too,

00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:09.750
like, I think, a lot
of the people in Egypt.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.770
But once you become friends
with Bassem and the team--

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.460
that's more important.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.640
And so you kind of
hope the show ends,

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.030
so that they can be safe,
and mentally safe, as well.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.410
SPEAKER 1: Is that your advice--

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.826
that was your
advice at the time--

00:26:23.826 --> 00:26:25.034
SARA TAKSLER: No, I wasn't--

00:26:25.034 --> 00:26:26.700
we didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.470
And the way we
ended up structuring

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.690
the film was the
first part of the film

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.950
is about what the situation is
and this fight for free speech.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.440
And then the middle of the
film is this external battle,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.467
and the government
and protesters

00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:41.050
and different people
putting pressure.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.508
And then the third
part of the film

00:26:42.508 --> 00:26:44.767
is the internal
battle, where you

00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:46.350
think you're just
doing something that

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.360
sounds fun and feels
important and feels good,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.600
and then suddenly, everyone
has an opinion on it,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.770
and not just strangers,
like his family.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.910
And his wife and his daughter
and his parents were affected.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.580
And so it becomes
harder to do a job just

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.420
because it matters to you--

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.870
you're dealing with safety.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.374
SPEAKER 1: I think that one
of the most powerful scenes

00:27:09.374 --> 00:27:11.790
in the film-- you could blink
and miss it-- but it's when,

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.107
I think, your grandfather--

00:27:13.107 --> 00:27:14.190
BASSEM YOUSSEF: My father.

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.890
SPEAKER 1: Your father just
says, I'm proud of you.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.170
And imagining the
context of the Egypt

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.840
that he grew up in,
standing backstage

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.590
at a huge shiny studio, and he
just said, I'm proud of you,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.380
and it was very matter of fact.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.814
But I think it exemplified
a lot of people's feelings.

00:27:30.814 --> 00:27:32.230
I do want to be
conscious of time.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.960
And I know there are probably
questions in the audience.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.090
If you do, line up at
one of these microphones,

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.430
and depending on how friendly
you look, we'll call on you.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.560
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes, please, can
I have one friendly reporter--

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.110
SPEAKER 1: Some softballs first.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.580
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I mean--

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.010
SPEAKER 1: OK, so
here's a softball.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.300
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Somebody
can give me a friendly--

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.696
I don't want anybody's who's--

00:27:49.696 --> 00:27:51.570
SPEAKER 1: You live in
the United States now.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:52.403
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

00:27:52.403 --> 00:27:54.250
SPEAKER 1: How's
that for material?

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.860
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.399
I mean, there is no
shortage of that.

00:27:58.399 --> 00:27:59.940
SPEAKER 1: What
advice would you give

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.140
to comedians who are thinking--

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.848
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Oh
yes, what advice could

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:07.830
I give, because, of course,
I did well with my life, yes.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.750
Because, of course, I
got it all figured out.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.000
I have no advice for you guys.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.590
I mean, God bless you.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.610
But hey, you know what?

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:20.470
I mean, you went through
eight years of George W. Bush.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:22.260
And I know that now,
you look at George W.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.450
Bush as a good president.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.210
Compared to this
guy, anybody is.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.850
But I think it will pass.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.760
It's really up to-- here's
my thing, it's not advice,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.290
but it's an observation.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.290
You can laugh as much as
you want about Donald Trump

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.700
and make fun of him.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.770
But if you don't go out
and vote every two years

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.350
and change the dynamics in
the Congress, in the Senate,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.860
I mean, you can
laugh all you want.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.900
He's going to be there
for eight years--

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.520
he's going to be
laughing at you.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.630
So that's the whole thing.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.440
Because yeah, he's not
going to go away because you

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.062
throw 15 jokes at him.

00:28:54.062 --> 00:28:55.770
SPEAKER 1: But what
do you make of comedy

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.500
in the age of Donald Trump?

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.409
The latest controversy
is Kathy Griffin, with--

00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:02.950
staged a photo of her with the
severed head of the President.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.366
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yeah, and I
was very angry, because that's

00:29:05.366 --> 00:29:06.200
our thing, you know?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.670
We are the ones
who behead people.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.640
I mean, come on, you can't
take that away from us, too.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.010
I mean, you're even
white-washing beheadings--

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.704
it's horrible.

00:29:15.704 --> 00:29:18.120
SPEAKER 1: I'm going to pivot
away from this while I still

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.895
have a job.

00:29:18.895 --> 00:29:19.690
Yes, sir?

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.387
Please, as soon as possible.

00:29:25.387 --> 00:29:27.220
AUDIENCE: First of all,
I want to thank you,

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.380
Bassem and Sara,
for coming here.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.338
This is really awesome.

00:29:29.338 --> 00:29:31.110
I have a question.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.290
So as, now, I guess, an
expatriate, and currently

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.580
speaking as an Egyptian
living outside of Egypt,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.774
what do you think we
can do from the outside,

00:29:41.774 --> 00:29:44.190
and how realistically affective
do you think that will be?

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.800
BASSEM YOUSSEF: As an
Egyptian living outside--

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.470
I mean, it is one of the
hardest questions that I get.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.850
Because when people
say, what should I do?

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.010
I will give you personal advice.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.295
What you should do, as an
Egyptian living abroad,

00:29:59.295 --> 00:30:01.420
is to work on yourself to
be the best that you can,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.795
so when the country really
needs you, and it's available,

00:30:03.795 --> 00:30:05.500
you can come back
and make a change.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.290
But that right now, I
mean, all that you can do

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.240
is rant on Facebook-- seriously.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.610
I mean, this is
an honest answer.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.892
I mean, I can give
you a very shiny--

00:30:15.892 --> 00:30:18.100
AUDIENCE: I mean, if we stay
here, there will be no--

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.630
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well,
I mean, but lately--

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.270
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Or like,
hopefully, you'll get a say.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.811
But seriously, I
mean, I can give you

00:30:23.811 --> 00:30:29.440
like a very shiny answer of,
like, go and organize and do--

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.100
It is honestly, practically,
the best thing that you can do

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:39.670
is be the best person you can,
the best at what you can do.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:41.770
And hopefully,
when things change,

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.350
and you are able to come
back and make a difference,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.190
you will.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.870
But seriously, focus on yourself
now-- and psychologically,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.360
it is much better.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.800
You, as an Egyptian,
you will understand--

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.120
you live outside and
Egypt still consumes you,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.190
everything that happens there.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.310
So you need to take
care of yourself.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.328
Now, I'm being like Dr. Phil.

00:31:05.328 --> 00:31:06.762
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:10.140
SPEAKER 1: Can we talk a little
bit about offense-giving,

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.976
and how you approach the
value of giving offense,

00:31:12.976 --> 00:31:14.350
and how it's
regarded differently

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.440
in different cultures?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.880
I mean, you were arrested,
literally, for offending Islam,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.089
among other things.

00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:22.130
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Although,
I didn't offend Islam--

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.220
this was like
something even made up.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.860
But we were very conscious
about the culture difference.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.132
We had to be culture-conscious.

00:31:30.132 --> 00:31:31.840
I mean, here, you
don't care, because you

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.400
are protected not just by--

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.800
SPEAKER 1: Well--

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.250
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Laws, but
you're protected by society.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:41.800
Yeah, there's a backlash,
but you are still--

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.020
nobody will come and
arrest you from your house.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.260
So that's a big difference.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.430
So we had to be conscious
for one simple reason--

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:52.210
because we were speaking to a
vast majority of people who are

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.787
still--

00:31:52.787 --> 00:31:55.120
they might agree with us, but
they're very conservative.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.760
So you want you want
to win them over.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.970
So we didn't want to make the
mistake of making a joke that

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.660
would be offending for
something that they believe in,

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.970
so they can still
continue listening to you.

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.760
That was the thin line
that we were walking.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.220
SPEAKER 1: So as long as
you're making them laugh,

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.303
you think you can get away
with a little bit more.

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.930
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Yes, but we also had

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.250
to be very sensitive
about certain issues.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.960
I mean, the stuff that we were
discussing in the writers room,

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.300
we had to edit half of it.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.150
SPEAKER 1: There's a scene where
a very serious man gets on,

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.120
and there's subtitles, and
he says, does God order

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.420
you to kill Bassem Youssef?

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.550
Not yet.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.587
I mean, presumably,
you're skating pretty--

00:32:40.587 --> 00:32:42.420
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Not
now-- he said 'not now.'

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.230
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.438
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No, he said--

00:32:44.438 --> 00:32:47.190
there was a sheik
giving a fatwa.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.860
People talk to me on the
internet or on the phone asking

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.110
me, is it [NON-ENGLISH] for
me to kill Bassem Youssef?

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.450
And I say, tell him, not now--

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.860
which is interesting.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.190
There's actually a chain of
emails with the subject--

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.756
"Can I kill Bassem Youssef?"

00:33:00.756 --> 00:33:02.880
SARA TAKSLER: If your
grandmother would forward you

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.510
that one more time.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.565
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes, yes.

00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:07.485
And of course, all of these
emails were sent on Gmail.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.960
SPEAKER 1: Naturally.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.906
BASSEM YOUSSEF: And so--

00:33:12.906 --> 00:33:16.650
SPEAKER 1: This is going
really well, I think.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.990
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Go ahead.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.890
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.210
Thank you both for being here.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.430
I had a question for Sara.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.931
You were at "The Daily Show"
for over a decade, and--

00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:28.180
SARA TAKSLER: I'm still there.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.639
AUDIENCE: Oh, there you go.

00:33:30.639 --> 00:33:31.430
SPEAKER 1: For now.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.766
AUDIENCE: You,
arguably, have seen

00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:37.035
this golden age in political
satire on television.

00:33:37.035 --> 00:33:38.640
And I was wondering
if you could just

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.814
speak a bit to what
it's been like to write

00:33:42.814 --> 00:33:44.272
across these three
administrations?

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:47.310
And what Jon Stewart's
hallmarks were

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.720
that some of these other
shows are seeing now.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.050
SARA TAKSLER: Well, I've been
at "The Daily Show" since 2005.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.240
So when I came in,
Bush was president.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.490
And most of the time, I've been
there, Obama's been president.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.960
So this new shift is--

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.460
we're still kind of
figuring out how all of that

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.050
will work, in terms
of production.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:14.670
But for me, the interesting
thing was sort of,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:18.210
because a lot of that time I
was doing the film on the side,

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:23.370
I definitely didn't have
an awareness of how special

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.080
it was to be able to tell jokes.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.260
And not just to work in a
place where you can make jokes

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.580
about whoever is in power, or
whatever hypocrisies you see,

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.150
but that there's
competitors doing

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.600
the same thing, who make it
easier for each one to exist.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.270
Like, if there were five people
doing the same show Bassem

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.561
was doing, his show would
probably still be on the air,

00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:43.960
because there's not so much
pressure on any one place.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.690
So I think through
doing the film,

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:52.500
I've had a greater awareness of
an appreciation for this job.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:56.580
And I mean, I obviously cared
a lot about the power of satire

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.440
to begin with, and
that's why I wanted

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.130
to focus on Bassem's story.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.690
But I don't think I
understood until--

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.300
and this is speaking on
behalf of me, not the show,

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.000
but this administration--

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.180
I really started to understand
the movie in a new way.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.000
I watched "Tickling
Giants" again the weekend

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.390
after our election,
at a film festival.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.660
And I was like, I have seen
this movie 1,000 times,

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.896
and suddenly I was
like, oh, I get that.

00:35:23.896 --> 00:35:25.770
I related to it in a
different way, because--

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.090
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I told
you we're ahead of you.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.460
SARA TAKSLER: Oh yeah,
you're ahead of me-- of us.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.800
And a person in
the audience said

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.500
that the movie is a cautionary
tale for this country.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.999
And I felt like
that was correct,

00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:38.040
that was how I felt, too.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.580
Because the idea isn't-- we have
a very strong history of free

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.630
speech in this country,
and comedy shows exists,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.207
and lots of different people
say lots of different things.

00:35:46.207 --> 00:35:47.790
And what I'm learning
through the film

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.280
is that most people,
regardless of political party,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.679
actually really value that.

00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:53.220
They value different
things about it,

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.330
but I've been surprised
that different people--

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.340
someone from Ted Cruz's
presidential campaign

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.960
offered us support.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.429
Some people from the Koch
network have offered us

00:36:03.429 --> 00:36:05.970
support-- like, all different
people I didn't expect to reach

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.150
out--

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.025
SPEAKER 1: As in Coca-Cola,
or Koch brothers?

00:36:08.025 --> 00:36:09.850
SARA TAKSLER: The
other one, the latter.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.190
Coca-Cola's welcome to come
on board. if they want to.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.870
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, if
they're listening.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:14.760
BASSEM YOUSSEF: And
the poster is red.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.375
SARA TAKSLER: But yeah,
all different groups

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:15.720
are coming together.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.830
The poster is red.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.190
But people are supporting
the idea of free speech.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.390
And I think, like me,
a lot of Americans

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.720
didn't realize until
this year that we really

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.179
are happy that
free speech exists,

00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:27.720
and that now is the
time when we have

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.370
to speak up for it to continue.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.137
When you start to see "Saturday
Night Live" being criticized,

00:36:32.137 --> 00:36:34.470
and things like that, that's
when you have to speak out.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.193
You don't wait for a
full-blown dictatorship.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.090
SPEAKER 1: Please.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.980
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
both for being here.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.515
Sara, thanks so much for all
the work, for "The Daily Show."

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:44.770
SARA TAKSLER: Thank you.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.170
AUDIENCE: I'm a huge fan.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.695
Bassem, thanks for being
a beacon of revolution

00:36:48.695 --> 00:36:49.820
and the things that you do.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.270
I had a question about
how you feel as--

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:54.160
I mean, you were
a doctor, so how

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.100
do you feel now, looking
back at your school years

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.100
and everything like that, do you
ever think, like so many of us

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.929
Americans do, what
did I do with my time?

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:03.970
Where is my degree going?

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.983
Does that ever happen to you?

00:37:07.983 --> 00:37:11.394
BASSEM YOUSSEF: That's a
very discouraging question.

00:37:11.394 --> 00:37:12.310
No, here's the thing--

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.650
I spent 19 years in
medicine-- seven years

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:19.630
in medical school and
12 years practicing.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.250
And I don't regret
a single moment

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:26.350
because, actually, it made
me the person who I am now.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.410
A lot of people say, how did
you discover your talent?

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.590
How did you discover your--

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.090
I was not.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.470
I was just a nerd.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.630
And this is how I
actually managed a show--

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.450
I was a nerd.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.460
I was there, first one in in the
morning and last one to leave.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.530
I think my years in
the medical profession

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.770
was a character-building tool.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.640
It was amazing, and I think
it made me appreciate a lot,

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.770
I think, on a
personal level, too.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.490
I don't speak about
that a lot, but I

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.520
rose to fame extremely
fast, and everything

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.260
was taken from me, overnight.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.400
I think if I was a much
younger person, who

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.900
didn't have that
kind of experience,

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.630
I think I would have
killed myself by now,

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:16.340
because this was a very
extreme experience for anybody.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.350
When I rose to fame
very fast, I remained

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:23.690
grounded, because I thought
that all of this is not natural.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.440
I'm someone who used to
go to hospital shift study

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.670
18 hours a day--

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.210
all of this was weird.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.870
So I didn't embrace it.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:35.800
I never embraced it.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.770
So when it was taken away,
I was like, oh, now, it

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.390
sounds normal.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:41.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.820
So I think it guarded
me, psychologically,

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.290
to go through that journey
as a medical doctor,

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.600
and it helped me on
a personal level,

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.120
on a psychological level,
more than anything.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.850
So it never went to waste.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:03.959
And plus, I can do emergency
procedure now very, very--

00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:05.250
if you give me the right tools.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:06.920
AUDIENCE: I thought it was weird
you went four months unemployed

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.800
with those qualifications.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.800
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No--
yeah, well, one thing

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.477
happens when you go
to entertainment,

00:39:13.477 --> 00:39:16.060
it's kind of like you don't want
to go to the hard work again.

00:39:18.977 --> 00:39:19.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.820
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Thank you so much.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.745
SPEAKER 1: What would it take
for you to go back to Egypt?

00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:27.790
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Ah-- not now--

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.730
a lot of things.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.480
And it doesn't-- it
has to be a huge shift,

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.860
not just because of
a certain president,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.590
because I think I have burned
all my bridges with the current

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.160
regime.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.263
Even if Sisi ceased
to exist tomorrow,

00:39:41.263 --> 00:39:48.280
I was vocal against all the
military regimes in the region.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.720
So I think I'm blacklisted
for a long time.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.360
However, I do miss some
stuff about the country,

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.210
namely, two things--

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:05.150
mangoes, because you
guys don't have mangoes.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.340
And if you think that you
have mangoes, you don't.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.420
They are cucumbers.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:16.730
They taste like cucumber, they
have a texture of a cucumber,

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:17.589
it's horrible.

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:19.380
You don't know what
mango is until you come

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.930
to Egypt, with all due respect.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.930
And the second thing is
our beautiful beaches

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.070
and coast and kite-surfing.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.470
Because you guys
don't have beaches.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.382
Maybe in Miami, but if you
are in Los Angeles-- it's

00:40:31.382 --> 00:40:33.590
beautiful beach-- but you
can't even touch the water,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.600
it's so cold.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.404
SPEAKER 1: OK--
beaches, mangoes.

00:40:36.404 --> 00:40:38.070
BASSEM YOUSSEF: So
beaches and mangoes--

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.535
If you supplied
this here, I'm fine.

00:40:41.535 --> 00:40:44.450
SPEAKER 1: What about--

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:45.620
are you a political figure?

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.180
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.050
SPEAKER 1: Why not?

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.383
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I don't like
to think of myself as that.

00:40:49.383 --> 00:40:51.360
SPEAKER 1: Ah, well,
that's not what I asked.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.770
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well,
I mean, a lot of people

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:59.780
think of me that way, which
I resist very strongly.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.810
SPEAKER 1: Do you think
that's productive resistance?

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:08.390
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes, because
I don't like for comedians

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.350
to be mixed up as politicians.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:15.050
SPEAKER 1: What is the cost
for a comedian, a host,

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.525
to become more
explicitly political?

00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:20.660
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I
mean, I think it

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.660
takes a lot from your satire.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.030
So if you have let someone
like Al Franken, when

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.320
he did the shift, he left
career of comedy behind him.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.570
And then he became dedicated--
that's acceptable-- you

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.110
can shift.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.635
You can shift from a doctor
to a comedian to a politician,

00:41:35.635 --> 00:41:36.260
but you can't--

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.707
I think it is counterproductive
to be both of them

00:41:39.707 --> 00:41:40.415
at the same time.

00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:43.100
SARA TAKSLER: I think, also,
at least in this country,

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:46.280
maybe in Egypt, there is
a bit of a political act

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.340
by watching "Al Bernameg,"
and sitting in public.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.500
Here here, I think
it's misguided to think

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.870
that you're doing
something and speaking

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.240
by watching a comedy segment?

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.990
Like, hopefully, you
enjoy it and it makes

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.680
you feel less alone
and you laugh,

00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.930
and maybe you learn something.

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.080
But unless you do something
with that information and act

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.090
in some way, it's passive.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.820
So if you think that
by supporting Bassem,

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.520
you're active
politically, you're not.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.990
Laughing at a joke
is good for you,

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.570
but if you want to
change something,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.932
you have to change it actively.

00:42:15.932 --> 00:42:18.140
SPEAKER 1: Can you imagine,
though, in your lifetime,

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.950
returning to an Egypt where
you would be considered

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.770
a political figure, and
where that level of support,

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.360
that level of fame
that you enjoy

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.150
would be a political asset?

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.110
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No, I
wouldn't like to be--

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.670
no, it's horrible.

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:32.360
I don't know.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.070
I mean, after watching
"House of Cards,"

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:38.100
I don't think I want
to be a politician.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.930
I don't know.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.471
It's-- no.

00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:42.970
SPEAKER 1: We may have you back
in a year and ask you again.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:43.803
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

00:42:43.803 --> 00:42:44.780
But you know what?

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.690
Just because we're on record,
never say never, Bassem 2020.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.190
OK?

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.773
SPEAKER 1: There you
have it-- please.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.010
AUDIENCE: All right, this is
a question for both of you.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:00.350
In the US, we have liberal
comedy shows at night.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.690
How come we don't have
conservative comedy shows?

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.790
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Because
conservatives are not funny.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.050
Seriously, they're not.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.030
I mean, I'm sorry,
can you name one?

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:11.590
There was what, Dennis Miller?

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.455
SPEAKER 1: But that
was a transition.

00:43:13.455 --> 00:43:15.280
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Who
totally became unfunny

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.740
after he supported--

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.330
SARA TAKSLER: I
think they've tried.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.400
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
There's something--

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.340
SARA TAKSLER: There's shows
that have tried to do it,

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.480
but they haven't
found an audience.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.820
So I don't know if that's--

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.060
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No!

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.170
It's not the audience--

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.020
they don't have it.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:24.972
SARA TAKSLER: But they haven't
found an audience because they

00:43:24.972 --> 00:43:25.310
haven't been good yet.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.768
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Because true comedy

00:43:26.768 --> 00:43:35.630
goes against taboos and
against those fake pillars

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:42.040
of society and moralism that
people want to stick to.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.350
You have to be subversive,
and conservatives,

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:48.200
the only way they could be
subversive is becoming rude.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.980
And I know that's pretty
much a generalization,

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.250
but I stick to it.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.650
Look at Fox News-- every time
Fox News' "Fox and Friends"

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:04.010
or Sean Hannity or--

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.752
the guy who is
harassing people left--

00:44:05.752 --> 00:44:06.710
SARA TAKSLER: O'Reilly.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.150
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I know.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:08.050
I know.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:11.620
So look at them when
they try to be funny.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.470
They are offensive
and they are horrible.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.940
I mean, we can be offensive,
but we can be funny, I think.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.730
I think.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.397
But that's my opinion,
I could be wrong.

00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:22.813
AUDIENCE: Well,
do you see anybody

00:44:22.813 --> 00:44:24.345
in Egypt trying to
fill your shoes,

00:44:24.345 --> 00:44:25.969
who's more aligned
with the government?

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:27.530
BASSEM YOUSSEF: There a lot of--

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:28.130
what?

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:28.990
Aligned with the government?

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.900
Oh, they're horrible.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.430
The same thing--
still conservative,

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.140
bad sense of humor.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:36.620
But there are other
amazing talents in Egypt,

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:40.880
but they're not allowed to cross
that line to political satire.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.710
They're only allowed
to do social comedy.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:45.460
SPEAKER 1: Please.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.260
First of all, thank you
so much for being here.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.789
I apologize if this
question's redundant,

00:44:50.789 --> 00:44:52.580
I haven't had a chance
to see the film yet,

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.830
so I don't know if it covers,
sort of, what's next--

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:56.210
SARA TAKSLER: Well, we'll wait.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.830
Go watch it.

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.170
AUDIENCE: But I wanted
to ask, one thing

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.760
that I think is striking
over the last few years,

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.730
with the hiring of Trevor Noah
and also John Oliver's show, is

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.610
not just the golden age
of political satire,

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.850
but of outsider
perspectives shining

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.410
like a new view on
different issues.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.239
And I was wondering if you've
thought now that you are here

00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:21.530
in the US, of doing something
where you're not speaking

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.210
to an Egyptian
audience, but really

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.224
bringing these issues
more to the forefront

00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:26.640
for an American
audience, as well?

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.014
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Sure I mean, this

00:45:28.014 --> 00:45:30.890
is a classic example of us
taking white men's jobs.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:31.586
But--

00:45:31.586 --> 00:45:32.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:40.880
It's-- I think, coming here,
coming here to America was

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.825
very--

00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:45.560
I mean, I'm in Google--

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.410
which is very apparent, OK?

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:54.710
So here's the-- I
think, at the age of 43,

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.430
I'm reinventing myself,
maybe for the third time.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.910
I'm someone who is not just
making a career shift-- it's

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:06.290
a career shift, a country shift,
a language shift-- everything

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.320
is different, and
it is difficult.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.790
Speaking to someone
who-- like, I

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:14.030
don't have perfect command
of the English language.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.650
I have a very apparent
accent, you can hear it.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.810
And you don't know if
you're going to be accepted.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.600
First of all, how you
look, how you sound,

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.710
or the fact that
you are an outsider.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:30.020
And then, even if they do,
what can you do different

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.750
than the other outsiders
who have already

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.440
been there before you?

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.400
So it is very
interesting, very scary.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.560
I look forward that I would
have my own space in media

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.750
in the United
States, and hopefully

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:49.580
offer a different
global perspective

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.960
to comedy and satire.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.110
And especially, the way that I
feel is a little bit different

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.660
is that, is that if you're going
to talk about people coming

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.993
from the Middle East-- there
are a lot of amazing Middle

00:46:58.993 --> 00:46:59.880
Eastern comedians.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.940
But most of them,
or all of them,

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.784
have been raised and born here.

00:47:04.784 --> 00:47:06.950
I'm the only one to actually
come fresh off the boat

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:10.160
from that area and the war
that everybody's scared of.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.080
So hopefully, we'll
make a change.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:12.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.130
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:16.120
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.220
Thank you very much
both for being here

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.710
and for all of your
work and sacrifices

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:25.150
you've had to make to help
promote free speech and people

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.690
thinking for themselves more.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.950
It's a very general
question, so please

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.570
feel free to answer however--

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:33.940
whatever tangent you
feel fit, but you kind of

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.870
hinted at before the idea of
people thinking from authority

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.320
and not questioning.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.210
I assume, not questioning
the statements of authority

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.840
for themselves.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.950
So I'm wondering--
very general question--

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:50.170
besides founding
my own comedy show

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:54.130
or our own hit comedy show,
what things can we do,

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.890
or what is the direction
to promote people

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.870
to start to think for
themselves a bit more

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.250
and ask more questions?

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.070
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah, so the whole
point for "Tickling Giants"

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:09.034
is not just to be
inspired by what he does,

00:48:09.034 --> 00:48:10.950
but to then internalize
that in your own life.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.102
So I mean, I don't know what
you're into, but, for example,

00:48:15.102 --> 00:48:17.060
I'll tell you two things
I saw this week that I

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:17.840
thought were cool.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:23.540
One was there's a
woman who makes fonts--

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.560
that's her job.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.034
And she took Arabic
and Hebrew and realized

00:48:27.034 --> 00:48:28.700
that-- so like, in
English, all you need

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.710
is the top half
of a word, and you

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.066
know what word's being said.

00:48:32.066 --> 00:48:33.440
And so she studied
both languages

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.330
and saw that, I forget
which was which.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.340
I think in Arabic, you needed
the top half of the word,

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.590
and in Hebrew, you needed
the bottom half of the word.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.939
So she made a new font that's
half Hebrew and half Arabic,

00:48:42.939 --> 00:48:45.230
with the idea being that two
groups, if they can't even

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:47.438
talk to each other, how are
they going to make peace?

00:48:47.438 --> 00:48:50.300
And that was just like, her own
cool thing to express herself.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.390
There was also some
campaign that I

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:55.010
saw where people
made a video that

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:58.370
was showing how if we treated
mental health the same way

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.860
we treated physical health,
how ridiculous it would seem.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.290
And it was all these people
with physical ailments being

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:04.790
told that they don't
need medication

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.165
and they don't
need to do things,

00:49:06.165 --> 00:49:08.450
and it was a funny
video to express it.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:10.700
I don't know which
issues matter to you,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.360
but find your own way to
bring attention to that issue.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.090
And whether it's holding
a funny sign at a protest,

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:21.920
or whether it's speaking out in
a room and asking a question,

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.820
or whatever your thing
is, find a creative way

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.579
to express that--
and a nonviolent way.

00:49:28.579 --> 00:49:30.620
And then, I would also
say, because we're in this

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:32.930
particular room of a lot of
people who know more about

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.770
the internet than I
do, which is isn't--

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.060
don't flatter yourself, that's
not that high a bar-- but I

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.070
assume you're much higher
than that, as well.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.900
For us, we're trying
to get the message

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.270
out about a few things,
which are free speech

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.740
and abuses of power.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:52.160
But then also,
because of the timing

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.800
of when this movie happens to
be coming out in our country,

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.900
there's all this
talk of Muslim bans,

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.330
and I want people
to realize when

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:03.780
you're talking about these
scary foreign group of people--

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.270
Bassem is an example of that.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.630
And he's an example of an
immigrant who's been exiled.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.640
And so we have this
thing called the hashtag

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.130
#MeetAMuslimAtTheMovies,
and the idea

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:16.220
is supposed to be that in the
same way for a lot of people,

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.230
Oprah was their
first black "friend,"

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.820
I'm hoping that if
you maybe haven't

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.400
had an opportunity in
your life to meet people

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.129
in the Muslim
community, that this

00:50:24.129 --> 00:50:25.670
could be an introduction
to who we're

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.620
talking about when
we talk about Muslims

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.080
coming from another country.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.540
But what I want is
as many people as

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.000
possible to have conversations
about these issues,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.819
and people with different
backgrounds and ideas.

00:50:37.819 --> 00:50:39.860
So we're trying to get as
many people as possible

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:40.856
to watch the movie.

00:50:40.856 --> 00:50:42.230
And then we have
a dialogue guide

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:44.210
to kind of kick-off
these conversations.

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.670
So just as a challenge
to this room,

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.240
if you like the idea of those
conversations happening,

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.540
if you have any suggestions or
ways that you can help drive

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.400
people to the
trailer on YouTube,

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.710
drive people to
Ticklinggiants.com,

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:01.117
and encourage them to see the
film and then talk about it,

00:51:01.117 --> 00:51:01.950
that would be great.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.530
SPEAKER 1: And how can
people see the film, Sara?

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:05.196
SARA TAKSLER: So
people can see the film

00:51:05.196 --> 00:51:08.090
if you go to
Ticklinggiants.com, their way

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.950
is driving you to-- it's going
to be on a bunch of places,

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:11.867
including Google Play.

00:51:11.867 --> 00:51:12.741
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:14.810
SARA TAKSLER: But it comes
out on iTunes, Amazon,

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:16.490
and directly through
Ticklinggiants.com.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.421
BASSEM YOUSSEF: None
like Google Play.

00:51:18.421 --> 00:51:19.420
SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.420
SARA TAKSLER: And no one in
here has ever used Google Play.

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.040
SPEAKER 1: It's a little
sharper on Google Play, right?

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.145
And when does it come out?

00:51:23.145 --> 00:51:25.970
SARA TAKSLER: So June 6,
it's available on iTunes,

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.155
and June 13, it's
available everywhere else.

00:51:28.155 --> 00:51:29.780
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Including the web site,

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.012
plus a 30 minutes outtake.

00:51:31.012 --> 00:51:32.720
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah,
if you take the movie

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.250
from Ticklinggiants.com,
you'll get

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.645
30 minutes of extra footage.

00:51:35.645 --> 00:51:37.362
SPEAKER 1: Is there
anything that you cut

00:51:37.362 --> 00:51:38.180
from the film that you really--

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.346
BASSEM YOUSSEF: It was like,
brief scenes of nudity.

00:51:40.346 --> 00:51:41.180
SARA TAKSLER: Yeah.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:41.470
BASSEM YOUSSEF: In the outtakes.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:42.910
SARA TAKSLER: We have a whole
nude version of the film.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.701
SPEAKER 1: The bath
scene, notwithstanding.

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:46.399
Is there anything
else that you didn't

00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:48.440
get to include in the film
that you wish you had,

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.160
or-- including the sequel?

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.400
SARA TAKSLER: I mean,
there's a ton of--

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.204
so there's a few hundred
hours of footage,

00:51:52.204 --> 00:51:53.870
so there were a lot
of different stories

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.470
that we could have told.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.680
There was one scene that
was really hard to remove,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.690
but it just kind of
kept not working, which

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:02.579
was when the show was canceled
and the staff finds out,

00:52:02.579 --> 00:52:03.620
they're all out of a job.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.720
They were supposed
to be doing a song

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.180
and dance on that next
episode that they never

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.750
had a chance to
do, which was being

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.640
critical of the president.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.400
And they decided, even
though they had all just

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.770
lost their jobs, they went
up to the rehearsal studio

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.720
and they did the dance
with just crazy energy.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.490
And this one guy looks in
the camera, and he says,

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:23.630
the dream will not die.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:24.920
The dream will not die.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.030
And I loved that moment.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:30.320
Just that if you're a person who
expresses yourself creatively,

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.570
you can take away free
speech and people may even

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:35.090
choose for a period of time
to give up their free speech

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.740
if they think it
will make them safe,

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.960
but once you've tasted
free expression,

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.470
you will always
have that desire.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.640
SPEAKER 1: And you cut that?

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.634
SARA TAKSLER: I know.

00:52:42.634 --> 00:52:44.300
Think of how good the
other was, though.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.670
SPEAKER 1: That's--
oh my god, yeah.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:46.160
Great.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.630
SARA TAKSLER: That's the
worst scene in a movie,

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.042
so you guys are going
to love the rest.

00:52:49.042 --> 00:52:49.944
SPEAKER 1: The least moving
part of the whole thing.

00:52:49.944 --> 00:52:51.105
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Is
it in the Outtakes

00:52:51.105 --> 00:52:52.100
SARA TAKSLER: It's
in the outtakes, yes.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.479
SPEAKER 1: OK, perfect.

00:52:53.479 --> 00:52:55.520
We have time for maybe
one or two more questions.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.230
Conveniently, there
one to two people.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.938
BASSEM YOUSSEF: And
before that, since we

00:52:58.938 --> 00:53:02.120
are in the business of
shamelessly promoting

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:04.460
ourselves, there at the table
there, there's my book--

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.270
SPEAKER 1: I was
going to get to that.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.509
BASSEM YOUSSEF: "Revolution"?

00:53:06.509 --> 00:53:07.550
"Revolution For Dummies."

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:08.470
OK, OK, I'm not going to say it.

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:09.410
SPEAKER 1: It's
available in the back

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.300
for purchase and
at fine bookstores

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:11.670
everywhere, of course.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:12.878
BASSEM YOUSSEF: For purchase.

00:53:12.878 --> 00:53:14.820
You're already saving a
lot of money on your--

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.260
SARA TAKSLER: Your free lunches.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.540
BASSEM YOUSSEF: On
free lunches, so, yes.

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.560
You can afford-- these are
like four lattes, down there.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.460
You can get it.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.450
And it's funny, and it has
never said before, never told

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:29.270
before stories.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.055
There's also brief
nudity in the books.

00:53:31.055 --> 00:53:33.359
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.400
Last couple of questions.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.750
AUDIENCE: OK, this one will
be lighter than the other one,

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:37.040
I promise.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.880
So you've done
the show in Egypt,

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:43.349
and now you're here in America.

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:45.140
Have you thought of
interesting differences

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.560
between the sense of comedy
that the two cultures have?

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.310
BASSEM YOUSSEF: It's
different everywhere.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.250
It's even different
within Egypt.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.200
So it's even different
within the same country,

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.780
with different
socioeconomic levels, right?

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.410
You are from Egypt and you know
that sometimes what's funny

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.207
for a guy with a
certain education

00:54:02.207 --> 00:54:03.290
is different from another.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:04.250
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.990
So how about just your
audience, compared

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.974
to maybe, some population
here in America?

00:54:07.974 --> 00:54:09.890
BASSEM YOUSSEF: No, it's
different, of course,

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:15.496
because even within
America, people

00:54:15.496 --> 00:54:16.620
allow for different things.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.040
For example, people
find it very easy

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.221
to laugh at "Friends," right?

00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:22.720
It's very easy,
slapstick, whatever.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.730
But it takes you
much more thinking

00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:28.510
to laugh at "Frasier," because
it's much more compli--

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:31.010
and then, like another level,
to laugh at political satire,

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:33.300
because you have to
be politically aware.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:36.620
So I think I will still
be choosing people

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.610
who are much more aware of
political and global issues,

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.070
because you know
that's my shtick.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:49.190
And I know I'm not the best
person to do this everyday,

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:50.840
today social comedy
here, because there

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.714
are people who have been
here all their lives

00:54:52.714 --> 00:54:54.711
and they do it much
better that I do.

00:54:54.711 --> 00:54:55.210
Yes.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.220
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.160
And you, sir, shall
have the last word--

00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.010
quickly, please.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.884
AUDIENCE: So, I'm glad
to have the last word.

00:55:00.884 --> 00:55:03.570
So thank you, Bassem, thank
you, Sara for coming here

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:05.010
and for making that movie.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.850
And it's not a question,
but as an Egyptian,

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:16.800
and as I was following Bassem
Youssef from day one, his show,

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.170
even my son was waiting
for it, because he

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.165
has the same last name, so--

00:55:21.165 --> 00:55:24.820
Youssef, Youssef,
Bassem Youssef.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.260
We miss his show a lot.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.420
My wife-- I didn't
watch the movie yet--

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.440
when my wife watched the
movie, she was in tears,

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.010
because every time
we talk about him,

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:43.690
every time we remember
what he has been doing,

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:49.810
I mean, we remember this "phase"
in Egypt that we were all like,

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.690
longing for, and
now we miss a lot.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:57.430
So I just want to give more
like, thank you for Bassem,

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:58.270
for what he did.

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:04.329
And our hearts are with him
in his "exile" in the US.

00:56:04.329 --> 00:56:06.370
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, it
can be your own country,

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.450
and you can still be in
exile, mentally, right?

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:09.033
You know this.

00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:10.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course.

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:11.570
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well,
thank you so much.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:12.903
AUDIENCE: So, thank you, Bassem.

00:56:12.903 --> 00:56:14.675
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Thank you.

00:56:14.675 --> 00:56:15.665
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:15.665 --> 00:56:17.557
[INAUDIBLE] work.

00:56:17.557 --> 00:56:18.140
You know what?

00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:18.820
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, sir.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:19.790
Your check's in the mail.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:20.200
BASSEM YOUSSEF: You know what?

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.070
I paid him.

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.810
I paid him to do that.

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.296
SPEAKER 1: Worth every penny.

00:56:24.296 --> 00:56:25.895
BASSEM YOUSSEF:
Dude-- I got you.

00:56:25.895 --> 00:56:26.820
I got you--later.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.360
SARA TAKSLER: I
want to point out

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.700
that this guy was nodding
the entire time you explained

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.400
how bad mangoes here are.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.135
So he's [INAUDIBLE]
level as well.

00:56:34.135 --> 00:56:34.760
I noticed that.

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.210
SPEAKER 1: See him after class.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:38.820
I can't imagine a
better way to end.

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:41.720
Thank you, Sara, you've
made a beautiful film.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.790
It, I think, has 100% on
Rotten Tomatoes at the moment?

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:45.590
SARA TAKSLER: 100% on
Rotten Tomatoes, yeah.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.131
SPEAKER 1: So if
you don't believe me

00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:48.690
and you don't
believe the critics,

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:50.899
go check it out on June
13, "Tickling Giants."

00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:52.690
Thank you, Sara Taksler
and Bassem Youssef.

00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:52.800
SARA TAKSLER: Thank you.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:53.880
And if you want to--

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.785
I forgot to say we
have a Thunderclap.

00:56:55.785 --> 00:57:00.660
So if you want to donate your
social media status on June 13,

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.520

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:08.790
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.750
Thank you all for coming and
thank you both for being here.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.850
