BILL DUANE: So
welcome everybody.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.330
We have some folks here
in the room, and then

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.220
lots of folks on Livestream.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.150
This is a continuation
of a program

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.040
we did a week and a half ago
on self-care and mindfulness

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.290
in particular, the role of
compassion and self-care

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.570
and mindfulness.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.920
And so this is needed now.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.320
So my name is Bill Duane, and
I look after the Well-Being

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.270
and Sustainable Performance
programs here at Google.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.010
And during my
team's team meeting,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.970
we took time to do a check-in
on how is our own well-being.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.720
And for many of us, most of us,
actually, it was pretty bad.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.240
It was sort of remarkably bad.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.250
Lots of emotional distress.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.360
And just to put a name to
it, the particular cause

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.640
for the distress was
two further incidents

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.110
of black men being
killed by police

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.629
and the issues of systemic
racism in our justice system

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.790
that that represents.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.290
And then, of course,
there have been

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.080
the sort of like litany
of other stuff going on.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.720
It just seems like every
time you watch the news,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.610
the rate of these things
is rapidly increasing.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.120
So not all of us,
but a number of us

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.310
felt sort of distinctly not OK.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.610
And on top of that, given that
we're the well-being team, when

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.900
we unpacked it, we
realized that we felt bad

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.744
about feeling bad, right?

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:37.910
We're just like, oh, I don't
want to feel like this.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.480
We shouldn't feel like this.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.300
And of course then it's
possible to feel bad about that.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.390
And it's feeling bad
all the way down.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.000
So one is, I just wanted to
start off the introduction just

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.650
acknowledging that if
that's where you're at,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.480
you're not alone.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960
It seems like there's
something really different

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.080
and-- this is an odd way to
use the word-- but special

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.040
about this time that makes
it something different.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.060
And that specialness
has a lot of potential

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.100
to think differently
about the way things are.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.220
But in the short term, there's
also the very practical need

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.130
to tend to our
internal experience

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.060
so that we can show up in
the world the way we want to.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.030
So this talk is going to
focus on the expertise

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.120
of our presenters, which
is to say mindfulness,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.270
and in particular,
mindfulness and compassion.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.810
But I also want to note that
mindfulness is not the only way

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.770
to deal with these.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.250
In particular, connecting
with friends and family

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.690
is a great way of self-care.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.690
Exercise.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.690
Sleep.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.490
Sleep is amazingly
supportive for this.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.350
So there's probably a
number of other things

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.940
that are supportive
for you, and I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.300
encourage you to really
pay attention to those

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.210
and make time for those.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.840
But for this
session, we're really

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.750
going to be focusing
on mindfulness

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.650
as a means toward self-care.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.940
And one thing I
want to point out

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.140
is that we're talking
about self-care

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.770
not as a way of
numbing or escaping,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.930
although it's really reasonable.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.130
When you feel bad,
you're just like, well,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.562
I would like to feel better,
please, as soon as possible.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:19.270
And some of the
strategies for doing that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.329
are sort of suppressing
and turning away.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.870
The real thing that's amazing,
what we're talking about here,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.490
is this idea of actually
turning towards the difficulty

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.740
and turning towards your
internal experience.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740
But that's sort of a radically
counter intuitive, right?

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.950
So how do you do that?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.860
How do you do that
when you feel bad?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.550
And the answer is, compassion.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.520
Compassion allows you to
hold difficult experiences

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.360
in a way that can keep
you focused on it,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.570
but also focused
on other people.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.550
And normally when we
experience strong emotion,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.210
we're a puppet to that emotion.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.770
It's sort of stimulus response.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.320
By cultivating the
skills of self-awareness,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.350
self-management, and
compassion, when you experience

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.180
these internal
feelings of discomfort,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.370
you can actually
put a little bit

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.272
of a pause in there between
stimulus and response.

00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:16.730
There's a great
Victor Frankl quote

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.810
of "In between
stimulus and response,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.290
there's the capacity
for a pause.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.080
And in that pause lies the
chance for our freedom."

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.510
So that's what we're
talking about today.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.470
And once you're free of
that sort of automaticity

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.480
of behavior, then something
beautiful happens.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.310
And the beautiful
thing that happens

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.530
is the opportunity to act
in the world in a way that's

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.780
in alignment with your values.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.810
And this is the way
that we can both tend

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.540
to our internal experience while
also making the positive change

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.020
in the world that we want to.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.970
It's this idea of an
engagement with ourselves

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.430
and with our communities
and with the systems

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.430
that we're a part
of it while also

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.210
tending to our own self-care.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.077
So that's obviously
a pretty tall order.

00:04:59.077 --> 00:05:01.160
So I'm about to hand it
off to two friends of mine

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.550
so they could do the
actual work of this.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.370
It's sort of radically
counter intuitive.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.070
So I have two dear friends.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.830
One is Sharon
Salzberg, who is really

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.640
one of the meditation OGs.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.790
She's one of the first people
to bring vipassana practice

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.700
in the current wave
to the United States

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.110
and really do a bunch of quite
beautiful translation of this.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.910
She is one of the founders
of the Insight Meditation

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.840
Society in Barre,
Massachusetts, which

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.060
is one of the preeminent
vipassana centers

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.730
and schools in the west.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.920
She is also the "New York
Times" bestselling author

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.430
of books like "Real Happiness,"
"Real Happiness at Work,"

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.750
"Real Happiness at the Dry
Cleaner," "Real Happiness

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.050
While Taking Out the Garbage."

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.590
No.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.710
Getting back to real books now,
is "Loving Kindness" and a book

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.990
on loving your enemies.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.830
And one of the
things that I really

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.370
enjoy about Sharon as a
student and also as a friend is

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.560
deep wisdom and knowledge
from some of the source wisdom

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.470
traditions that these
practices come from.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.850
She really knows her stuff.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.010
But it also seems
very real to me.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.860
Like Sharon is also a New
Yorker who has seen some shit.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.920
And there's an earthiness
and a saltiness

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.570
to the way that she
teaches that I find really

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.555
necessary, because my
relationship with compassion

00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:26.680
has to exist in the real
world, and that real world

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.250
as is far from perfect,
as I started off with.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.570
Also joining us
is my other friend

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.000
Phoenix Soleil, who is
a longtime meditation

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.924
practitioner.

00:06:38.924 --> 00:06:40.340
She is also an
expert in something

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.120
called nonviolent
communication, which

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.980
is a class that's
available from time

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.430
to time here in Mountain View.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.600
And let me know if you would
like the contact information.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.990
She also offers coaching
and meditation mentorship.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.290
She is also a teacher in
training at Spirit Rock, which

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.790
is one of the other preeminent
vipassana centers in the United

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.790
States.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.360
And she is also a New Yorker
who has seen some shit.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.150
So I should also point
out that I'm from Queens.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.390
So we seem to have quite
the group of New Yorkers

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.790
representing in this area.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.820
So please join me in welcoming
Phoenix and Sharon, who

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.420
will be leading us in some
practices and a little bit

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.510
of lecture and also
some exercises.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.120
So thank you.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.053
This is was put together at
extremely short notice again,

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.420
Phoenix.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.880
So thank you very
much, and welcome.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.140
PHOENIX SOLEIL: I'm so
happy to see all of you.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.450
And I was really grateful
to be here a couple few days

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.060
ago at the New York office.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.950
And it's interesting.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.400
I was telling a lot
of people that I

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.180
noticed that after
doing that hour,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.540
I noticed that I wasn't as--
I didn't feel as helpless when

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.410
I would read the news because
I had done something that

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.430
was in connection to my values.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.410
And I just want
to compliment all

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.030
of you for coming
together here today

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.050
and people who are joining
us, because you're taking time

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:28.060
in your day to put some
attention on some really

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.370
difficult subjects.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.570
Like I think one
of the ways that we

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.789
habitualized to deal with things
is push them away, you know?

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.710
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.110
because sometimes you have
things you need to do.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.140
People have families.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.230
You have jobs.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.240
And sometimes you just can't
handle the feelings inside,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.750
and it might be really
intelligent and smart to take

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.670
some time and say, I'm not
going to deal with this,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.800
and I'm going to do whatever
is really urgent in my life.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.140
What we know is that over time
there's a consequence to that.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.820
It costs.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.420
There's the stress involved,
because it's still there even

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.800
if we're not looking at it.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.479
And that space that we're
putting it to gets full.

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:19.770
If we keep putting things in
it, it keeps getting full.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.900
And then something small
happens with someone we love,

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.700
and we might lose our temper.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.160
Or we cut someone off in
the highway, and you know,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.230
it just builds up.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.610
And then it becomes
like a volcano.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.270
And we know, we see on the news
some of the effects of people

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.680
having volcanoes inside.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.910
So right here you're doing
the difficult human job

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.780
of coming and facing the pain.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.270
The other thing, though--
on the other hand,

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.190
the other way that we can
handle something difficult--

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.680
is to fall apart.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.020
And I think that's what
causes-- a lot of us

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.100
choose the other one.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.200
I'd rather push it
away than fall apart.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.390
I'm afraid of being
so overwhelmed

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.640
that I won't function.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.670
And as a New Yorker,
it's been bred into me

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.350
that I have to function.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.470
You know, I've seen
all the "Rocky" movies

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.860
and I know that I'm supposed
to just get up there, put it

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.850
all to the side and win the
gold or whatever championship.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.330
So those are the two pieces.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.980
But then that falling apart,
does that help anyone?

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.890
You know, it's so
beautiful that as a human

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.530
we are affected by things.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:47.170
But is that going to-- it's
beautiful, that sensitivity.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.920
And we see what happens
when people aren't

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.590
connected to their sensitivity.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.330
So what is the answer here?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.250
And this is one of
the practice that

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.630
creates this other space
that's in the middle, which

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.220
is equanimity.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.520
This creates this space where
you can process the pain,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.210
and you can be with
it in this loving way.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.590
And what you get to be is
able to see the big picture.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.770
You're not consumed
by it-- and this

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.710
is how I sometimes feel-- and
you're not pushing it away.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.477
And that is what we're
creating, and it takes time.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.060
We have a culture
where it's like, you

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.560
want to take a quick pill.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:35.870
And the quick pills don't
end up creating more safety

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.010
in this society,
for us internally

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.330
and for other people around us.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.730
So I'm just going to check
in if there was anything

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.720
I wanted to start with.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.170
The other important piece is
that sometimes taking that time

00:11:54.170 --> 00:12:00.190
to do that self-care
can feel so selfish.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:06.420
We want to do things, but
this is the preparatory work,

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.390
because when you're having a
conversation from that pain,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.520
are you really open
to hearing someone?

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.530
Can you really bring
compassion to them

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.590
when you don't have
compassion inside?

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.010
When there's all this,
like, oh my god, I

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.250
can't stand this,
a lot of times we

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.600
don't have the
resource that we need

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.790
to be able to sit and think and
really look at the big picture.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.510
Because I think the problems we
have, there aren't quick fixes.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.720
These are these slow solutions.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.590
They need the long range.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.200
And I want to start with a sit.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.080
And I want us to come into this
room and come into our bodies.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.610
And it's interesting that
we talk about running away,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.720
because I think focusing
on the breath is

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.890
a healthy way of running away,
in a way, because you are

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.040
connecting to your body
and you're connecting

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:09.800
to the experience of
being a human right now,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.620
right now in this moment.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.320
And whatever thoughts
you have about things,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.850
you can put them on the
side for a little bit, OK?

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.010
So I'm going to ask
you to close your eyes.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.630
If you don't feel comfortable
closing your eyes,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.500
you can put your attention
on the floor or something

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.040
neutral like the wall.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.230
And if you find
that what's inside--

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.720
you can keep your eyes open.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.540
That's one of the suggestions.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.920
And there's many kinds of
breaths that you can use.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.914
I like this-- we're going
to take a long breath in,

00:13:48.914 --> 00:13:50.330
and then what we're
going to do is

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.640
we're going to purse our
lips and let the air out

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.570
through our lips,
if people can see.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:03.090
And you're pushing it
as long as you can.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.840
Just a long exhale.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.680
And you just let the tension
go out with your breath.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.930
OK.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:20.880
So let's take a deep
breath in and pause

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.190
and let the breath out
through your pursed lips.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.800
Take another deep breath in.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.550
And you can do this
on your own pace.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.720
Don't feel like
you have to wait.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.080
And take a pause.

00:15:18.115 --> 00:15:20.781
And then I'm going to ask you to
do three more on your own pace.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.790
Appreciate you doing
all that with me.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:30.060
And then we're gonna count
from five to one, and at one,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.340
please open your eyes and
bring your attention back

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.800
to the front of the room.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:44.704
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.280
Thank you.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.608
I notice that people's
expressions seem more relaxed.

00:16:55.608 --> 00:16:58.300
Yeah.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.785
I'm gonna pass it
over to Sharon.

00:17:00.785 --> 00:17:02.160
SHARON SALZBERG:
It was at Google

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.544
that I first heard the term OG.

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:05.710
I had no idea what it means.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.077
Do you all know what it means?

00:17:08.077 --> 00:17:09.660
See, not everyone
knows what it means.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.785
It means original gangster.

00:17:12.947 --> 00:17:15.030
This is the first time
anyone ever called me that.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.750
And I prize it.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.975
Everywhere I go I say, you
know the best introduction

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:20.107
I ever had?

00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:20.815
It was at Google.

00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:22.000
It was Bill Duane.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.240
He called me an OG.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:34.010
So I did go to India quite a
number of years ago in 1970.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.830
Came back in 1974 as
a meditation teacher,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.760
a mindfulness teacher.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.240
And it's kind of extraordinary,
of course, to see the wave,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.260
and to see the new
prominence of the word.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.850
And one of the concerns I have
about the word mindfulness

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.670
and the implications it
might have for people

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.640
is a kind of passivity,
you know, or complacency.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.820
Like in a kind of immediate
way, I was leading a meditation

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.760
once, and we began
with listening to sound

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.530
before moving to the breath.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.460
And I got no further than,
listen to the sound and someone

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.700
raised their hand
and said, well,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.800
what if it's the sound of
the smoke alarm going off?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.780
Should I sit here
mindfully knowing

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.050
the smoke alarm is going off?

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.250
Or should I get up?

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.600
And I said, I'd get up.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.200
But the ways mindfulness
is defined correctly

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.410
often brings a kind
of confusion just

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.230
because of the associations
we have with the word.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.680
Mindfulness means accepting
things the way that they are.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.280
Mindfulness means being with
things without judgment.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.660
Kind of sounds like
you're going to sit there

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.020
with the smoke alarm going off.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.720
So metaphorically, I think
that's a good picture

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.810
of our time.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.140
There are lots of
alarms going off.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.659
And sometimes we can think,
oh, something like mindfulness

00:19:06.659 --> 00:19:08.950
is going to give me the
ability-- it's like Bill said--

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.870
to sort of number out.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.250
I'm going to just accept
things the way that they are.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.740
I'm going to just be with
things without judgment.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.660
And it's not quite
like sitting there

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.600
with the smoke alarm going
off being passive at all.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.350
Really we're talking
about many levels.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.660
We're talking about having
a dynamic relationship

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.360
with our experience
instead of, perhaps,

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.810
being so caught in habit.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.210
We're talking about, just
as Phoenix was saying,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:48.150
finding a place in the middle
where we're not necessarily

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:52.310
consumed by what's going on
because that really debilitates

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.400
us, or devastates us,
and doesn't necessarily

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.990
give us any room to act.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.850
Nor are we going to
hate it and fear it

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.340
as a kind of cultivation,
like, you know,

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.300
I've been meditating
for 45 years.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.030
I shouldn't feel this kind
of thing anymore, dammit.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.300
You know?

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.680
It's just not useful,
either extreme.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.860
And so there's a kind of
creativity in that energy.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.700
And I feel it is very aligned
with the power of love

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.940
or the power of compassion.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.120
I think one of the things I've
done in meditation practice,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.592
or we do in any kind
of introspection

00:20:31.592 --> 00:20:33.050
when we're really
looking-- doesn't

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.840
have to be meditation-- is
I felt like I really looked

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.220
at all the things--
probably not all,

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:47.320
but many of the things that
I'd been told were true.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.000
Where does strength lie?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.740
How alone am I?

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.240
What are the
divisions between us?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.300
What's the reality?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.810
Is a quality like
love or compassion

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:08.680
really as foolish and gooey and
sentimental and weak as I've

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.580
been taught?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:19.470
Is vengefulness and hatred as
strong as I need in this time?

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.890
So I feel one of the
greatest gifts I've

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.070
gotten from my own
practice is that ability

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.330
to look with a kind
of rigor and honesty.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.160
And it needs a
lot of compassion,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.310
because it's not always
easy, what we see

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.520
in terms of our conditioning.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:43.350
I feel like there's
a core within all

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:50.100
of that of recognizing
our wish to be happy,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:54.510
to feel a sense of belonging
in this body and this mind

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:00.180
with one another, a
sense of home somewhere.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.975
And even more than that,
almost like the right to that,

00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:08.630
no matter who we are, no
matter what others tell us

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.700
about us, whatever stories
are told about us, that that

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.100
is really at the
core of our being.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:21.380
And so I think mindfulness
is very connected to that

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.640
as well, as we practice.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.010
And again, we can
practice mindfulness

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.250
a million different ways.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.958
It doesn't have to be
through meditation.

00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:35.130
But it's that quality
of looking and looking

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.620
with a kind of
sense of your own,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:44.270
I'd say, innate dignity, that we
do deserve a kind of happiness.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:51.520
And so I've practiced
with striking fast food

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.390
workers, for example, striking
for $15 an hour minimum wage,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:04.180
and who are risking everything,
everything in their lives

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.130
to sort take a stand and say,
I have some worth as person.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.470
I've sat with people
who have been subjected

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.330
to incredible violence,
or their families,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:29.240
and have watched in awe
as people have tried

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:36.990
to work through where their
ultimate happiness might lie,

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:45.530
and how they might reweave
the story of what's

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.700
possible for a human
being based on the things

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.270
that they've gone
through and their wish

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.460
to make this a better world,
and not just kind of cycle

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:01.370
down and endlessly spiral down.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.260
There are a lot of admirable
people in this world, I find.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:09.964
We don't often hear about them,
perhaps, which is a problem.

00:24:09.964 --> 00:24:15.050
But for me, the core of my
being able to venture forth

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:20.830
into some of these
terrains is-- having

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:25.750
had some shit happen
in my own life-- has

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.430
been really the
offering of some tools

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.020
so that these aren't
just idealistic notions.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.850
And it certainly isn't
leading to a kind of passivity

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:42.020
or complacency, but
really some tools

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:50.840
to help me see through kind
of the myths I've been given,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.890
work out of them, find
sources of strength

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.900
that I never imagined
were strong at all,

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.970
which is why I teach quite
a lot of loving kindness

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.697
meditation, which maybe we'll
do toward the end of our time

00:25:03.697 --> 00:25:04.280
here together.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:15.290
And of all techniques,
it's one where people often

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:19.019
approach it in the beginning
is, like, that's stupid.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:20.310
How can that make a difference?

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.070
But like all things,
it's an experiment.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.060
You know, it takes
a little risk taking

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.300
to see for yourself
if this is something

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.810
that might be onward leaning.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.920
It does begin, I think, with
a kind of self-knowledge

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:45.170
that is very personal.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.200
It's very insightful.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.760
And this is really one of the
greatest powers of mindfulness.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.510
These days when we
talk about mindfulness,

00:25:54.510 --> 00:26:00.970
mostly we talk about things like
really enjoying your cup of tea

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.870
because you're
actually tasting it.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.320
You're not so
crazily multitasking

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.170
while you drink the cup of tea.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.040
And that's really good.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.070
But classically, the
main goal of mindfulness

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.300
is to reveal our
lives to ourselves,

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.150
to understand so much more
about what's motivating us,

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.950
and what's onward leading,
and what's really bringing us

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:29.020
down, or even crushing us.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.140
And then we know so much.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.540
So one exercise I thought
we could do before we go on

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:44.810
is sit together
for a little bit,

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.880
have each person explore some
of the emotional terrain you've

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.350
experienced recently,
whatever that might be,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:27:01.940
choose one really predominant
emotion, and look inside it.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.960
Not why is it here, and what
am I going to do about it,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.940
and should I switch therapists
or whatever, but you

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.050
know, what is this feeling?

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.650
First, what is it in my body?

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.300
And just take note of that.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:21.930
And then see if you can watch
the movie of that feeling.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.542
Sometimes if I'm working with
people over a period of time,

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.250
let's say it's something
like-- let's say

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.790
it's anger-- I'll say
next time we meet,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.750
see if you can tell
me three things you

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:38.700
found inside the anger, and
one of them can be change.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.160
Maybe there's sadness in there.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.770
Maybe there's fear in there.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:47.010
Very, very commonly, there is a
sense of hopelessness in there.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.350
So just a few things.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.160
And whatever is in
there, it's changing.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.400
It's coming, it's going,
it's actually fluid, however

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.270
static or concrete we might
take it superficially.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.200
So we'll do a little
bit of that together.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:10.380
And then for those of you
who are, after the exercise,

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.806
going to be writing,
you can just

00:28:11.806 --> 00:28:12.930
write it down for yourself.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.550
Those of you who are here,
you can either write,

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:21.380
or we'll have you just speak
to one another if you wish.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.610
OK?

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.550
So let's sit together.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.746
And going back to the
refuge that is the breath,

00:28:28.746 --> 00:28:29.995
because it really is a refuge.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.595
As my early teachers
would say, you

00:28:37.595 --> 00:28:40.095
don't have to believe anything
in order to feel your breath.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.670
You don't have to
call yourself, you

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.030
know, I'm Buddhist or Hindu,
or reject anything else.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.930
If you're breathing,
you can be meditating.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.630
And as one teacher said--
I've always really thought

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.080
it was charming-- he said
the breath is very portable.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.800
Right?

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.440
So you practice now.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:06.047
We'll practice just
for a few minutes.

00:29:06.047 --> 00:29:07.880
But then you're at work,
or you're somewhere

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.600
where it's very stressful,
or you're commuting,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.110
and you're getting
really anxious,

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.690
and you're getting
really harried.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.930
You can breathe.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.030
Just rest of your
attention on the breath.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:24.630
So it's right there for you as
a way of getting some space.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.720
So again, you can have
your eyes open or closed,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.470
however you feel most at ease.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.170
See if you can find the place
where the breath is clearest

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.770
for you or strongest for you.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.380
Maybe the nostrils, the
chest, or the abdomen.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.690
Find that place.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:01.640
Bring your attention
there and just rest.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.122
See if you can feel one breath.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.380
And if you find your
attention wandering,

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.503
don't worry about it.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.840
Maybe your mind has jumped
to the past or the future,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.210
judgement, speculation,
or you've fallen asleep.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.230
Really, it's OK.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.950
See if you can let go of
whatever has distracted you.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:34.624
Let go gently.

00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.040
And just bring
your attention back

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.248
to the feeling of the breath.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.440
And see if you can bring to
mind just an array of emotions

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.830
you've felt in the
last week or two,

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.026
just what flashes through
you as you contemplate that.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:49.530
It could be anything, from
anger to boredom, whatever.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:24.430
And then choose one or two--
certainly one at a time--

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.640
and actually enhance it.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.780
Strengthen it.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.562
See what it feels
like in your body.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.580
And to do this, clearly
you can't be lost

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.190
and, you know, this is the only
thing I'll ever feel forever,

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.980
or this is wrong to feel.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.566
This is an experiment.

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:53.065
What does it feel
like in your body?

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.840
Then observe the movie of
it, the unfolding of it.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.420
What do you see within it?

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.210
Just watch.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.230
See what might emerge.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.490
And remember that no
matter what you discover,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.970
one of the characteristics
is going to be change.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.059
It's going to be impermanence.

00:35:54.059 --> 00:35:55.142
It's going to be movement.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.998
Now when you feel ready,
you can open your eyes.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.220
If you want to take
a few moments just

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.261
to reflect on what you
saw, maybe write it down.

00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:20.760
I don't know if
there's anybody here

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.480
who wants to speak to the
person next to them or not.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.850
I feel I've learned
some much myself

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.930
in doing that kind of
exercise, like look at how much

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.760
loneliness there
is in that desire.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.160
Look at how much hopelessness
there is in that anger.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.380
So I think we'll
take a few minutes

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.620
for questions or comments before
we go on with the program.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.350
AUDIENCE: I was trying
to focus on what

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.330
I watched on
television last night,

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:24.190
and trying not to put
judgment into that analysis.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:27.410
So I hear anger.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.860
And so then I'm
like, OK, unpeel it.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.110
There's fear.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.850
But then I'm like,
there's ignorance.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:37.742
But then, oh wait, I
don't want to judge others

00:38:37.742 --> 00:38:39.200
when I'm trying to
understand them.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.270
That's why I'm watching this
spectacle in the first place.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.912
But I can't get
past that judgment.

00:38:45.912 --> 00:38:47.370
SHARON SALZBERG:
You want to start?

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:50.350
You want me to start?

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.190
PHOENIX SOLEIL: Why
don't you start?

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.900
AUDIENCE: And I'm
looking for tools

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.270
to get past it, because
it's going to be

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.750
an interesting few months.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.630
This affects every relationship
because friends and family

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.890
don't always agree.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.120
Excuse me.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.844
So insight.

00:39:09.844 --> 00:39:10.760
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.010
I wouldn't make assumptions
that everyone in this room

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.370
agrees, you know,
or wherever you

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.650
are, because that is also true.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:26.790
And I think there's another
way of understanding the term

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.320
judgment, which is maybe not as
broad as our usual way, which

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.510
is, I think, the way
you were using it.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.030
Because we have views.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.710
We have discernment.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.473
And there is such a
thing as ignorance.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.230
Any of us can have
some knowledge

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.160
of how the universe works, and
hopefully growing knowledge

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.000
of how the universe works.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.470
And if somebody is living
in defiance of that,

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.687
then there's discordance
and there's suffering.

00:39:59.687 --> 00:40:00.520
It's just how it is.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.720
Like if you-- from the
meditative point of view,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.530
it would say if you completely
refute the idea of change,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:14.250
you refuse to admit that
we're all going to die,

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:18.000
there's a society maxim
right there, right?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.470
Stay in control of
everything all the time.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.440
You can manage that.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.750
Don't admit any vulnerability,
because you should

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:31.170
be ashamed of painful feeling.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:39.170
And/or you don't deserve to feel
good, to let in the pleasure,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.440
either because there's too
much suffering elsewhere,

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.990
or you just don't deserve it.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.020
I mean, there's a million
things like that that

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.870
are ignorant that we all have.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:58.650
And when they run our lives,
then we are suffering.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:04.670
That's why we suffer, is
because we're so out of sync.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:11.970
So there are some
almost scientific laws

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.120
of the universe.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.916
Everything changes all the time.

00:41:15.916 --> 00:41:18.540
And we are all connected.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.700
We live in an
interconnected universe.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.890
So what happens to some
group of people over there,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.280
it never stays over there.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.579
It filters out over here.

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:30.870
There is no over there anymore.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.480
And science shows us that.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.060
Environmental consciousness
shows us that.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.760
Even epidemiology shows that.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.960
Economics shows us that.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.950
We live in an
interconnected universe.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:48.830
So if you have a whole world
view that says that's not true,

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:50.910
it's kind of scary.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:54.890
But that's different than
holding someone in contempt.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.390
So when we use
the word judgment,

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.970
it's kind of specific.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:09.870
It's feeling contemptuous,
or it's feeling so superior

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.460
that we can only
assume somebody is

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.890
coming from a really
damaged place to have

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.010
the view that they have.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.750
There are lots of ways in which
we separate very strongly.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.140
But that's one of the
fascinating things

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.832
about compassion.

00:42:29.832 --> 00:42:32.040
There's like, how can you
have compassion for someone

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.480
and really feel they're wrong?

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.590
And do everything
you can to keep them

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:45.040
from being able to
affectuate their,

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.540
to your mind, wrong view.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.640
I don't know that I want
people who really completely

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.620
disbelieve in interconnection
running climate

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.180
policy, or anything, really.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.530
So I would work hard to try
to keep that from happening.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.510
And I don't think
that has to come

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:18.980
from a place of real
hatred and alienation.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.830
It's always useful, I
think, to look at ourselves,

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:30.390
and when we are the most
disconnected, what's

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.300
cooking in there?

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:41.930
And I hazard a guess that
we would find layers of fear

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.300
in ourselves.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.950
And I would probably make
that assumption about others.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.076
And I personally have not
been watching anything,

00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:52.230
but I have a book deadline.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.730
PHOENIX SOLEIL: Can
I say something?

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.755
SHARON SALZBERG: Please.

00:43:55.755 --> 00:43:57.130
PHOENIX SOLEIL:
I think this goes

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:03.940
at the heart of one of
the gifts of meditation,

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.170
is being able to
hold the paradox.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.780
I think what scares
people sometimes

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.220
about doing healing work is,
well, I'm going to be removed.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.350
And is it OK that I
can have my safe life

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:25.080
and care for my loved ones when
so many horrible situations

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.740
in the world and
the environment.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.660
And it's about,
can you hold both?

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.620
Because actually, the
thing is that the stronger

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.730
you are and the
more able you are,

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.280
the more you can bring to the
difficult things in the world.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.830
But what some people can do
is try to isolate themselves.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.150
And so it requires that strength
of being able to see both.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.240
When you saw the judgment,
being able to also see the fear,

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.320
and to be able to see, oh yeah,
I could focus on this thought.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.780
And that's what a lot of
us would do, is focus on,

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.190
this is all the ways
that they're wrong.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:08.040
And you take a
breath, and then you

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.880
notice, well, there's
a sensation of pain.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:14.980
There's also this feeling
of my feet on the ground.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.560
There's the fact
that I'm breathing.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.650
There's all of these things
happening at the same time.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.820
And that is actual
health, is being

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.310
able to see and hold all of that
complexity, because when you

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.850
hold all that complexity,
instead of being overwhelmed

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:35.520
by, wow, this person is so
judgmental, you can hold,

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.280
yes, and we're all human
and we all have this.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.700
And we also have
this vulnerability.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.010
And we also have this incredible
urge to help each other.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.380
Being able to hold that
thought at the same time

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.580
that you're holding the thought
of this particular human

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:55.030
being being so
difficult to be with,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.650
that's being able
to hold a paradox.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:01.200
And the other tool
I would bring is

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.280
that with nonviolent
communication, a lot of times

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.370
we have this thing called
translating the judgment.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.060
A lot of times when
there's a strong judgment,

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.900
there's this need, this
beautiful human need

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.450
that's not being met.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:20.410
And when you get to
that need, then it

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.150
changes your perspective,
because then instead

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.190
of focusing on
what's not working,

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.600
you're focusing
on what you want.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.230
And that can be liberating.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.430
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that has been unearthed

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:38.600
in this recent
series of experiences

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.710
is, for me, an ambivalence
around the idea of justice.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:48.770
And I think part of
it is even a fear

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:53.040
of-- like an equating justice
with revenge that I think of,

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.190
sort of an eye for an eye, like
if you did something wrong,

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.880
then you should be punished.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.145
And I'm just looking for
a different perspective.

00:47:07.165 --> 00:47:08.040
PHOENIX SOLEIL: Yeah.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.580
I think one of
the things I go to

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:13.990
is that I don't
think, as a society,

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:17.730
the medium has done a very good
job of showing alternatives

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.870
to punitive systems.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.670
But there are lots
of people, and there

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.780
are countries who have
taken on practices

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:31.140
that are more about restoration
of trust and rehabilitation.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.090
And they're
incredibly successful,

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.730
and most of the
time, less expensive

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.140
than a punitive system.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.840
So part of it is
research, and knowing

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.260
that those things exist, and
really getting the evidence

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.660
that they work.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.570
Because I think I remember
being a high schooler

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.950
and thinking that some
people are just bad.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.960
And I think what's great about
doing practices where you're

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.665
looking at yourself is that
you get to see your quote,

00:47:58.665 --> 00:48:02.370
unquote bad parts
and be like, huh,

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.130
this is similar
to that bad thing.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.000
It's not the same scale.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.470
But I can see how
this pattern works.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.320
And when you can
see that, and you

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:15.050
start seeing shifts, even small
shifts, then that is giving me

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:21.140
a personal trust in the ability
of people to change, you know?

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:26.430
Because if I-- I'm just really
touched by your face right now.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.475
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:28.475 --> 00:48:29.350
PHOENIX SOLEIL: Yeah.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.250
I mean, I think
that's what excites me

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.060
about doing the work
that I'm doing, is

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.610
because when I started to see
my ability to change myself,

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:44.140
and I saw people who were
doing similar work-- now

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.850
I cry a lot out of happiness.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.200
And that's that the holding
the paradox right there,

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:57.020
is that at the same time
that there's immense pain,

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.170
there's so many people who are
putting their lives at stake

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.180
to change things.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.820
SHARON SALZBERG: It's beautiful.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.860
And I think a lot of people--
of course, a lot of people

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.910
do use the word justice
to mean revenge.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.750
And it's something I've been
afraid of for a long time

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:21.460
in this country,
because I could well

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.430
imagine it's just like too much,
and someone would seek revenge.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:32.300
But the pattern of escalation
is so clearly laid out

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.820
in front of us,
and someone else is

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:39.180
going to turn on that
group-- seemingly group--

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:43.230
and then it's just
going to keep growing.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:50.089
And as soon as the police
shooting in Dallas happened,

00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:51.630
friends turned to
me and said, you've

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.260
been taking about this
for years, which I have,

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.860
because it scares
me so much, just

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:02.300
this kind of violent
escalation, which

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:10.520
is what every teacher
and person of nonviolence

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.260
has talked about.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:19.540
And I've also seen, as
we have, the word justice

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:28.260
used in the most beautiful way,
which is really looking bigger,

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.486
looking at causes and
conditions for actions.

00:50:33.486 --> 00:50:33.986
Why?

00:50:33.986 --> 00:50:35.890
Why?

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.900
What makes somebody
choose a certain path,

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.220
or have a certain view,
or really understanding

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:46.510
these things don't just
happen, that we're all

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:51.830
coming from all these influences
and interactions and conditions

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:54.390
and socioeconomic
conditions, and everything.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:59.570
AUDIENCE: Because so much of
contemplating cause and effect

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.160
seems so unjust,
that I could suffer

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.740
because of the circumstances
of my birth or benefit.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.810
You know, that seems
profoundly unjust.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:11.785
So it's confusing.

00:51:11.785 --> 00:51:13.160
SHARON SALZBERG:
I mean, again, I

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.620
would say I would
look at justice

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.910
not as a sort of
rationale system

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.010
to answer the question
of why, but more

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.460
that clauses and
conditions exist,

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:34.170
that there's a kind of
lawfulness to the universe,

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.970
that things actually in
some level can make sense.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:44.570
And I think if we are
moved to do that work

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:49.040
to try to make it a different
world, a better world,

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.220
we have to look at
causes and conditions.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.150
Otherwise we're just
staying on the surface.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:59.750
So for example, once in Barre,
where I co-founded a retreat

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.830
center, the Insight
Meditation Society,

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:10.085
we had a visiting
Thai activist who

00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:12.460
was saying-- we were just
hanging out in someone's living

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.480
room and speaking.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.910
And he was saying,
you know, if you

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:21.870
want to deal with
sex trafficking,

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.431
you've got to look at
Thai agricultural policy.

00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:25.722
Why are those farmers starving?

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:31.180
Like, look deeper.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.720
And that was
unforgettable for me.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.390
I mean, we can't always
look deepest, you know?

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:41.250
But we can look deeper,
I think, in anything.

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.000
And then we see
ourselves in one another.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.890
We see laws and conditions.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.032
And we move where
our hearts take

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:51.675
us to see what we can address.

00:52:51.675 --> 00:52:53.050
PHOENIX SOLEIL:
One of the things

00:52:53.050 --> 00:53:01.970
that I do is I teach mindfulness
and emotional intelligence

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.490
tools to incarcerated youth.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.026
And it's a beautiful
experience of the world,

00:53:12.026 --> 00:53:15.390
because I will
see someone, and I

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.990
will hear a youth who's
been incarcerated,

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.680
and they will talk about
the incredible love

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.470
they have for their family.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:26.840
And I will see the
tenderness that they

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.300
have for some of the
people they care about

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.600
and the lengths they have
gone to protect and to care.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.250
And then sometimes,
there will be something

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:41.540
about some gang
or some situation,

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:43.310
and there's just no compassion.

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.690
There's just like, yeah,
they deserve to go,

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:48.000
and I have no problem.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.320
And it's like, how
do you hold that?

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:58.910
And I had a friend who got
accosted and robbed in Oakland.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:00.564
And she was in pain.

00:54:00.564 --> 00:54:01.980
And she knows that
I do this work.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.813
And she's like, I just
don't understand what

00:54:03.813 --> 00:54:05.830
could lead someone to do that.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.290
And again, it was
another paradox there,

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:11.130
because I was like, I
could tell her stories.

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.250
I could tell her so many
stories of young people

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:17.050
who are paying rent, or
who are homeless and are

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.650
trying to figure out how
to make food-- to eat.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:21.690
But at the same
time, in that moment,

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:24.920
was someone with a cast.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.900
And I was like this
is not the time

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.360
for me to bring in their story.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.330
She needs to heal before
she can have space to hear.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.350
So that's what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about what

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.370
we need in this society.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:45.200
I think we're all walking around
with casts in different ways.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.520
And we're also all walking
around with so much love.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.290
And then that is so bad,
I just don't have space,

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.310
and I shut down.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.540
And all the beautiful parts
of me aren't available.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.960
And how do we work
with all this?

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.270
And that's what we do here.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:08.320
We sit in it, so that we're not
just going to the next thing

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.410
and not processing.

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:12.250
We're sitting here and
we're being with it.

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:14.220
SHARON SALZBERG:
Certainly in this society

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.530
there's a tremendous
phobia about looking

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.770
at pain and suffering.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.560
If it's your own, it's
cast as something shameful

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.230
or to be avoided.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.627
If it's someone else's,
you'd rather tuck him

00:55:26.627 --> 00:55:28.210
away soon so you
don't have to see it,

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:32.140
it's so unseemly that you are
displaying such suffering.

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:41.178
And that's a struggle many of
us have with our conditioning.

00:55:41.178 --> 00:55:44.470
And interestingly enough,
I find myself these days

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:50.500
also talking a lot
about the relationship

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.910
we might have to joy and
pleasure and happiness,

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.710
not just because my books
are all called happy

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.840
something or other,
which are titles

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.263
the publisher
gives them, not me.

00:56:06.467 --> 00:56:07.550
But it's intriguing to me.

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:09.860
I've spent so much
of my life trying

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.980
to come to terms with suffering,
and in a hugely important way,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.020
you know, what's the
role of compassion,

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:19.190
rather than all that
separation and so on.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.730
And it's just been
lately I've also

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.490
been kind of playing a
lot in the fields of joy

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.360
and happiness.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.970
And part of it is also part
of that healing in this time,

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:36.920
because it feels so wrong,
somehow, to just take a moment

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.940
and enjoy something.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.279
But in the end, we're
talking about balance.

00:56:40.279 --> 00:56:41.570
We're talking about resilience.

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:45.380
We're talking about having
some sense of inner resource

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:47.780
so we don't feel so
utterly depleted,

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.630
because if we do feel utterly
depleted and overwhelmed

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:54.960
and shattered, we don't
have the wherewithal

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.550
to actually try to
make a difference

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.400
or even keep tuning in.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.510
It's like too much.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:05.330
I was talking to Bill before
a little bit about Russia.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.800
And I always think about this
time I went to the Soviet

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.690
Union--it was still Soviet
Union in those days,

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:18.360
a long time ago in the '80s--
and I went with my friend,

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.740
my colleague, Joseph
Goldstein, to teach.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.300
And it was actually illegal to
teach meditation in those days.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.660
So we went as part
of a tour group.

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.800
And we even brought Joseph's
mother as kind of cover,

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.710
so no one would know
what we were doing.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.290
And every afternoon we
would disappear, he and I,

00:57:35.290 --> 00:57:38.110
and we would go off
with a translator

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.146
into someone's living
room, and we would teach.

00:57:42.146 --> 00:57:44.110
And I found myself
speaking a lot

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:46.600
about compassion in those days.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.870
And every time I did, I kind
of got this really-- there

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.620
was this really funny
feeling in the room.

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.450
So I finally sat down
with the translator

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:57.980
and I said, when I say
compassion, what do you say?

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.410
And they said, oh,
it's like this state.

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:03.510
You're miserable and
you feel horrible,

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:08.330
and you're broken by the
suffering that you see.

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:11.930
And it's like someone
has taken a giant stake

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:14.520
and driven it
through your heart.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.010
And I thought, no wonder
there's a really funny feeling

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.190
in the room.

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.850
And it's like, oh.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:23.210
But we can actually be
pretty close to that.

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.020
And it's not selfish.

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.240
It's not self-centered.

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.390
It's not weird to feel I need
a different kind of balance,

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.890
you know?

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:36.180
I need something that
is more uplifting,

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:42.570
that will give me that kind
of resilience and help me.

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.190
So that's very, very important.

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:49.200
And I did a program-- it was
a four-year program working

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:55.460
with frontline domestic
violence shelter workers.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:59:00.250
And we asked in the beginning--
it was actually interesting

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.410
just in the context
of work-- so we said,

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:05.200
what's your greatest
stressor at work?

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.830
And this was all written so
you didn't have to disclose

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:09.150
anything if you didn't want.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.816
And that was interesting,
because people

00:59:10.816 --> 00:59:13.100
who did choose to
speak would sometimes

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.760
say surprising things,
like colleagues,

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:22.860
not sort of the hideous
workload or something.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.580
But it was interesting
to look at.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.190
And then the second
column was, what

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.870
do you do to kind of lift
your spirits, or get a break,

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:34.060
or get some
perspective on things?

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.070
And they'd write them down.

00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:40.220
And then the third
column was, how do you

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.316
feel about the things you wrote
down in the second column?

00:59:43.316 --> 00:59:48.790
So every single person, as far
as I know, through four years,

00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:51.290
in that second column,
wrote down music.

00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.100
It was all different
kinds of music,

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.200
but everybody wrote
down listening to music.

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.220
For some people they
were quote religious.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.220
Other people it was nature.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.525
And this is New York City,
you know, it's very gritty.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.720
And sometimes people looked
at that second column

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.910
and they said, that's
what really helps me.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.860
I'm not doing any of that.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.420
That's not good.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.780
Or maybe they wrote
down, I drink a lot.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.160
And they'd say, I'm doing
a little too much of that.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.170
Maybe I need to stop that.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.230
And one woman who
did read her thing,

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:31.570
she said, I watch a lot
of "American Idol," which

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:32.800
I laughed.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.010
I said, oh, I saw that once.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:37.410
I got unbelievably stressed out.

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.820
For me it was like watching
continual rejection, you know?

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.560
There's not a way in the
world that, for me, it

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.450
would have helped.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:48.550
And then we just said,
OK, here are these tools.

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:51.450
If you want to experiment
with them, here's meditation.

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:52.310
Here's yoga.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.300
Here are these other things you
might try, because in the end,

01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:01.890
you cannot go on in a good way
without both a sense of relief

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:06.980
and some experience of joy,
which could be very immediate,

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:12.340
somebody's smile, or a friend,
or something that will really

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:13.839
help us.

01:01:13.839 --> 01:01:15.880
PHOENIX SOLEIL: And I
think that's why what we're

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.280
doing here is so important.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.625
We talked about-- when we
were thinking about today,

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:27.490
it was like, well, when do
we want to have a dialogue?

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:31.540
When do we want to-- and it's so
important that that be set up.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.870
And it also is important
that-- it's at a time--

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:37.750
because what I was saying
about walking around

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:44.080
with casts-- with what's
happening in the news,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.310
I think it's like getting hit.

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.930
It's being really
emotionally hit.

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.660
And so we really need to
take care of ourselves.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.640
And it's not being selfish.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.530
It's getting prepared.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:59.420
It's like clearing
the space so that we

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.430
can have those dialogues and
we can take those actions,

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:07.320
because I think all of us
want to create a better world.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:18.000
And there's just different ways
of how to get ourselves healed,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.600
how to heal the emotional
casts that we're in,

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.800
and these are one of the tools.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.160
And some of it is being
able to take a break

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.490
and see the beauty in the world.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:34.850
It's good for me to remember, no
matter what the headlines are,

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.060
there are hummingbirds.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.660
There's water.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.400
There's waves, there's the sun.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.060
We're on a huge rock
orbiting a fireball.

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:51.290
Let's make this more fun.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.680
SHARON SALZBERG: So this
is its own distinct method

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.810
of meditation, where rather
than resting our attention

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.650
in the feeling of the breath,
the sensations of the breath,

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:12.640
we rest our attention
in the silent repetition

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.220
of certain phrases.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:19.950
So the phrases are ways of
paying attention differently.

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:24.630
So for example, if you
are in the habit of kind

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.900
of looking at yourself
at the end of the day

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.670
almost as though to
evaluate yourself,

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:30.440
like how did I do today?

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.379
And let's say you have the habit
of pretty well only remembering

01:03:33.379 --> 01:03:35.420
the mistakes you made and
the things you could've

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:40.950
done better, and what you didn't
really like, let's just say.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:43.730
So much so that your whole
sense of who you are,

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:46.470
and all that you
will ever be, just

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.510
collapses around that
really stupid thing

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.550
you said at lunch and a meeting.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.790
So the practice of loving
kindness is one of gift giving.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:56.290
It's offering wishing well.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:04:00.010
So instead of fixating
on all those mistakes,

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:05.530
we kind of expand our sense of
who we are, like anything good

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.280
happen today?

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.930
Any good within me?

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:14.260
And it's not meant to be
deluded or wishful thinking.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.850
You're not insisting, oh, wasn't
that a brilliant, witty thing

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:17.570
I said at lunch?

01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:20.880
Maybe it was really stupid, and
there are consequences to that.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.390
But that's not all that we
are, so it's that collapse.

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.240
So what do we look at?

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.480
So we pretty well only
look at what's wrong.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.020
And who do we look at?

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.480
Who do we look through?

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.270
Who doesn't count?

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:36.380
Who is the other?

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.940
Not even just by dint
of prejudice or bias,

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.250
but just indifference.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:45.990
So what happens when we look at
them rather than through them?

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:48.360
So all of this is done
through the silent repetition

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.810
of certain phrases.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.880
Phrases are very simple,
like may I be happy,

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.900
may you be happy.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.520
Being words, they
are quite imperfect.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.330
I know that.

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:02.850
But it's a vehicle for us
to pay attention differently

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:07.150
and to include where maybe
we've previously excluded,

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:10.600
or to loosen the grip of
some of those fixations

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.770
on what's wrong and so on.

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.660
So we make that
offering to ourselves,

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:21.970
to all kinds of different beings
in our sphere, those we like,

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.400
those we don't like that much.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.065
And we end with all
beings everywhere.

01:05:27.065 --> 01:05:29.060
So there are a million
variations of this,

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.260
and I'll guide you
through one, OK?

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.470
So see if you can
sit comfortably.

01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:39.350
You can close your eyes or not.

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.850
Let your energy just
settle in your body.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.326
See if there are three or four
phrases that make sense to you

01:05:57.326 --> 01:05:58.470
as this kind of offering.

01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:04.280
Common phrases are things
like, beginning with yourself,

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:15.780
may I be safe, be happy,
be healthy, live with ease.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.600
Live with ease means that the
things of day to day life,

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.410
like livelihood, like family,
may not be such a struggle.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:23.890
May I live with ease.

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:34.130
May I be safe, be happy,
be healthy, live with ease.

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:38.170
You can use these phrases or
any phrases that come to mind.

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:45.980
Just three or four very general,
and repeat them over and over

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.710
again with enough
space and enough

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.780
silence so that it's a rhythm
that's pleasing to you.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.710
I have a friend who
thought he'd get

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.190
extra credit by
saying more phrases

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:56.356
if he said them really fast.

01:06:56.356 --> 01:06:58.300
You don't need to do that.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.900
See if you can gather all your
attention behind one phrase

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:06.220
at a time, and then the next.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.440
And the skill set is
really very much the same.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.850
If your attention
wanders, doesn't matter.

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.956
See if you can gently let
go and just come back.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
And then if there's
a benefactor, someone

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.819
who's helped you, maybe mentored
you or inspired you from afar,

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:12.390
bring them here.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:18.729
Maybe say their name to yourself
or get an image of them,

01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:21.550
get a feeling for
their presence.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.910
And offer these phrases
to them, even again,

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.720
if the phrases aren't perfect,
they're like a vehicle for us,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.760
they're serving us.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.780
And then a friend, the first
friend who comes to mind.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.510
Someone you find slightly
annoying, not really bad, just

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.830
a little bit.

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:43.780
Just see what happens.

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:05.870
And all beings everywhere,
all people, all creatures,

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.370
all those in existence.

01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:16.790
May all beings be safe,
be happy, be healthy,

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:17.700
live with ease.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.140
And when you feel ready,
you can open your eyes.

01:15:11.785 --> 01:15:13.620
So thank you.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.637
Thank you.

01:15:14.637 --> 01:15:15.720
PHOENIX SOLEIL: Thank you.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.276
SHARON SALZBERG:
Thank you, and you.

01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:24.210
BILL DUANE: So thanks
to Phoenix and Sharon

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:26.290
for coming on very short notice.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:28.040
Everything that we put
together has really

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.300
been sort of responding to
the needs of the community.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.370
And in particular,
thank you to Richika,

01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:36.410
who did all this planning.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:38.500
For any of you have put
together a tech talk

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.520
or something similar, getting
a tech talk room on two days'

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.820
notice and putting everything
together is a huge feat,

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.850
so thank you.

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:53.390
In terms of follow on
resources, there's gPause.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:56.550
And gPause is holding,
in particular, this sort

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.750
of compassion meditation.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:03.700
Every day at noon Pacific
time, if you go to go/gpause,

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.620
you'll find the GVC,
so you don't have

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.090
to be in any particular place.

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:10.370
And then there's all the
other gPause programs.

01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:14.150
In addition, there's also the
EAP, the Employee Assistance

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:21.780
Program, as well as gCalm, which
is a mindfulness-based stress

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.850
reduction system,
that online platform

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:26.432
that's doing quite well.

01:16:26.432 --> 01:16:28.890
So with that, also thank you
for showing up for yourselves.

01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:30.470
This is really challenging work.

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.910
And I think everybody who
shows up to do this work

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:36.690
is in a great position
to be a leader.

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:39.480
So thank you so much for coming.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.680
Thank you guys.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.230
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.
