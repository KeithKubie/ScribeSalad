00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's see if we understood inclusion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.540
Let's say that we have a level one and

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.390
level two cache that
maintain inclusion property.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.900
Let's say that the dirty block is
replaced from the level one cache

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.580
by something else, and
we need to write it back.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.000
This write-back access,
can it be a level two hit, and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.910
can it be a level two miss?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.620
So check here.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.440
If the right back axis from
level one can be a hit in L2,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.650
check here, if the right back axis
from L1 can be a level two miss.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.807
Now let's look at the level one and
level two cache, but

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:43.520
this time, they make no
attempt to maintain inclusion.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.476
Again, if we have a dirty block
replaced from the level one cache,

00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:51.710
the level one cache
has to write it back.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.050
This write-back, can it be a level two
hit and can it be a level two miss?
