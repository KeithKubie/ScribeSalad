00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.160
Let's have a look at
text alternative images.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.630
We can use the old attribute to
provide a text alternative images.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.480
However, we need to think about what
role an image plays in the page

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.800
to work out what type of text
alternative it should have.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.350
Let's have another look at this
newspaper page from the previous lesson.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.360
I've got VoiceOver running and

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.390
I'm going to use the mouse pointer
Moves VoiceOver Cursor option

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.130
to let me quickly inspect things for
VoiceOver.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.880
Now, you probably don't want
this on all of the time.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.990
But it can be good for
quickly testing things.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.700
&gt;&gt; HTML content.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.120
So here, we have a picture of a cat
illustrating that article on cats.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.942
VoiceOver announces this has.

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:41.410
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that was pretty sub optimal.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.420
I can pull up div tools on the image and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.440
add an alt attribute which says a cat
staring menacingly off into space.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.560
All right, so
now I can try VoiceOver again

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.563
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on Chrome, HTML content,

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:57.648
a cat staring menacingly off into space.

00:00:57.648 --> 00:01:00.290
&gt;&gt; And now you have a nice succinct
description of the image and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.070
move on to the article.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.940
A couple comments on the alt attribute.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.342
Alt allows you to specify a simple
string to be used whenever an image is

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:13.445
not available, whether the image
fails to load like it has here or

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:16.451
you're a web crawling bot or a screen.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:21.771
Alt differs from any other type
of caption, including a title,

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:27.560
in that it will only be used
if the image isnâ€™t available.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.610
Caption or title typically
provides extra context for

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.250
the image,
rather than an alternative to the image.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.800
Writing useful alt text
is a bit of an art.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.030
In order for a string to be a usable
text alternative it needs to convey

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.020
the same thing as the image
in the given context.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.720
To give a more complex example, we have
that logo image in the masthead link.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.730
That link is going to take
us back to the homepage.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.840
So it might be tempting
to write home here.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.660
That's not a functional
alternative to the image.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.880
It's actually going to create
a more confusing experience,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.750
because then we might get the idea that
it's an image of some kind of home.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.030
Instead, we can describe this image
pretty accurately simply as The Funion.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.830
You may or may not want to explicitly
call out that it's a logo, but

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.770
given it's an image, that's more or
less implied anyway.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.800
An easy way to check whether
alt text is sensible,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.110
is to imagine all your
images are broken.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.440
Can you still understand
the page content?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.230
Now there's one image I left in here
that I'd like to take a closer look at.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.560
You have this magnifying glass logo,
inside the search link.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.731
If I checked it out with the VoiceOver,
&gt;&gt; Magnifying

00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:34.430
glass,
&gt;&gt; I can hear that we've hopefully

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.870
added an alt text of magnifying glass,
but if I inspect the link as a whole.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.970
&gt;&gt; Magnifying glass search link.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.240
&gt;&gt; We can hear that it
is actually redundant.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.490
&gt;&gt; Magnifying glass search doesn't
convey anything that search doesn't.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.390
How do we know that if we leave the alt
text out, we'll probably hear the image

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.320
file name which we already saw as
a potentially horrible experience.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.350
So in this case, I'm going to
to use an empty alt text, and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.048
we'll see what that does.

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:05.770
The empty alt text actually removed
the image from the accessibility tree

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.620
altogether, so the image is now
completely skipped by the screen reader.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.550
In this case it's actually what we want,
because the image was redundant.
