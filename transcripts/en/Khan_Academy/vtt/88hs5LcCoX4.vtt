00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:02.484
- [Voiceover] We've already
talked about light having

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:05.318
wave-like properties, and the
waves that we're familiar with

00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:06.952
in our everyday life we consider to be

00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:09.718
disturbances traveling through a medium.

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:12.118
We talked about dropping
a pebble in water,

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:13.117
and the water's a medium,

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:15.617
and we see the wave travel outwards.

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:19.118
We think about sound waves,
which is disturbance in the air.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:22.385
We think about a wave
traveling through this rope,

00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.217
the medium there is the rope.

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:27.151
So, in the mid-19th century it
was completely reasonable for

00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:30.751
folks to say, "Well look,
light has wave-like properties;

00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.652
it must be a disturbance
traveling through a medium."

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:35.651
And they said, "Well what
do we call that medium,

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:37.717
even though we don't observe it directly?

00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:40.618
Well, let's call it the
luminiferous Ether."

00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:43.217
So an obvious question
that was facing folks

00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:44.985
who had this reasonable
assumption, they said

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.684
"Well, can we somehow detect
the luminiferous Ether?

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:52.518
Can we validate the
luminiferous Ether existing?"

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.685
And a key realization is,
is "Well, we must be moving

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.417
quite rapidly relative to
the luminiferous Ether."

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.112
How do we know that?

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:04.051
Well, we just have to remind
ourselves that, obviously

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.491
the Earth is rotating, but
not only is it rotating

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:10.351
on its own axis, but it's
rotating around the sun.

00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:15.351
So if this is the sun right
over here, this is the Earth.

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.150
The Earth is rotating, and
these are all rough figures,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.150
the Earth is moving around
the Sun at approximately

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:30.151
30 kilometers per second.
30 kilometers per second!

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.818
By our everyday standards,
that's quite fast,

00:01:32.818 --> 00:01:34.084
but we're not done yet.

00:01:34.084 --> 00:01:38.784
'Cuz the Sun is also moving
around the center of the galaxy.

00:01:38.784 --> 00:01:40.684
And this isn't an actual
picture of the Milky Way;

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.118
obviously we haven't gotten
this far from our own galaxy

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:45.353
to actually get this
type of a vantage point,

00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:49.418
but if the Sun were right
over there, the Sun,

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:54.418
estimates are, are moving with
a speed of 200, roughly, 200,

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.341
let me write that in a better color so

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.484
you can actually see it,
200 kilometers per second.

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:05.386
200 kilometers per second

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:08.318
around the center of the Milky Way,

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:11.527
and then the Milky Way
itself could be moving.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:16.171
So we don't know our actual,
kind of, our orientation

00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:18.651
relative to the Ether, but we are,

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.551
we're constantly changing our orientation,

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:22.518
we're moving in these orbital patterns.

00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:26.252
If there is some type
of luminiferous Ether,

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:28.951
if there is some type
of luminiferous Ether,

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:31.884
and I'm just gonna draw
these lines over here

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:34.153
to kind of show our luminiferous Ether,

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.690
we must be moving relative to it

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.084
if we orient ourselves just the right way.

00:02:39.084 --> 00:02:41.752
In fact, the odds of us
being stationary relative to

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.052
the Ether are pretty close to zero,

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:45.291
especially if we wait a little.

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:47.884
If we're stationary relative
to the Ether right now,

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:50.832
let's say at this point, since
we're changing our direction,

00:02:50.832 --> 00:02:52.350
we're not going to be
stationary relative to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.051
the Ether at that point.

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:55.165
And that's just when you consider

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:56.884
the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:58.719
It's even more true
when you think about the

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.184
solar system's orbit around
the center of the galaxy,

00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:03.751
or even the movement of the galaxy.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:07.011
So, we should be moving
relative to the Ether,

00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:10.517
or the Ether should be
moving relative to us.

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:13.355
So we should be able
to detect some type of,

00:03:13.355 --> 00:03:16.184
some type of what's
called an "Ether wind".

00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:18.750
'Cuz it should be moving relative...

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.485
Ether wind.

00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:23.518
Now how would you detect an Ether wind?

00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:25.985
Well, let's think about
some other type of medium

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:27.717
moving relative to us.

00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:32.717
Let's say that we are
sitting on an island,

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.818
let me do this in a better
color for an island.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.451
So let's say that we're
on an island that's in

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.117
the middle of a stream.

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:43.984
So these are the shores of the stream.

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:45.951
These are the shores of the stream.

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.119
And there is some type of a current.

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:52.617
So the water is moving in that direction.

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:55.219
So that's the medium.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.151
And now let's start a wave
propagating through this.

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.084
So if I were to just
take a pebble and drop it

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.185
right over here, what would happen?

00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:06.950
Well the wave is going to
propagate faster to the left

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.317
than it is to the right.

00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:10.751
This is from our everyday experience,

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.085
and that's because to
the left it's moving,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.617
the medium is also moving to the left.

00:04:15.617 --> 00:04:17.717
So as the medium moves,

00:04:17.717 --> 00:04:19.484
and then you propagate
through that medium,

00:04:19.484 --> 00:04:21.484
you're going to move faster
to the left than to the right.

00:04:21.484 --> 00:04:25.017
So the wave is going to
propagate, is going to propagate,

00:04:25.017 --> 00:04:27.951
something is going to propagate,

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:30.384
so after a small period of time,

00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:31.886
the crest on the right might be there,

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:33.585
but the crest on the left might be there.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:37.017
So it might look something like this.

00:04:37.017 --> 00:04:39.018
And then after another period of time,

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:43.586
it might look something, it'll
look something like this.

00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:46.084
So the general point is, for
this little stream example,

00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:48.684
you're going to see your
wave propagate faster

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:51.750
in the direction of which
the medium is moving.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.584
So similarly, if you have an Ether wind,

00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.817
if you have Ether wind and
this luminiferous Ether

00:04:58.817 --> 00:05:01.892
is the medium by which
the light propagates,

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:05.431
the light is a disturbance in this medium,

00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:08.377
then if this Ether wind has some,

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:10.804
let's say it has some speed,

00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:12.317
let's just call it "S".

00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:17.317
If you were try to propagate
light in that direction

00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:25.084
versus in this direction,
versus in that direction,

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:28.384
it should go faster, we
should notice it going faster

00:05:28.384 --> 00:05:30.951
if it's going along the
same direction as the Ether.

00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:32.285
'Cuz it's propagating through something

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.118
that's also moving relative to us.

00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:37.951
And likewise, if it's going
in the opposite direction

00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:40.184
of the Ether, even though
it's propagating through

00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:42.185
the actual Ether at that same speed,

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:45.052
the Ether is moving in the
other direction, so the light,

00:05:45.052 --> 00:05:48.371
based on our 19th century
understanding of the universe,

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.385
the light should seem slower.

00:05:50.385 --> 00:05:52.051
So you can imagine, people
started to theorize,

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:55.884
"Well, maybe we can measure
light in different directions

00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:59.718
and see if, relative to
us, if relative to us,

00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:02.351
we see a different velocity for light."

00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:05.751
Now the problem was, is that
in the mid-19th century,

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.318
light is incredibly fast.

00:06:07.318 --> 00:06:10.250
We now know that the speed
of light is approximately

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.250
300 thousand kilometers per second.

00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:20.585
And in the mid-19th century,
we didn't have good tools

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:25.218
to measure this with a lot of accuracy.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.685
Especially because the Ether wind itself,

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:29.984
even if you say "This is
30 kilometers per second,

00:06:29.984 --> 00:06:32.217
maybe we're moving around
the galaxy at, you know,

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:35.519
200 kilometers per second, maybe
300 kilometers per second",

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.784
that's still a small fraction
of the actual speed of light.

00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:43.384
So if you don't have a lot of
accuracy when you're measuring

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:45.618
the speed of light in these
different directions, and

00:06:45.618 --> 00:06:48.485
the Ether wind is so slow
relative to the speed of light,

00:06:48.485 --> 00:06:51.484
well, with just traditional
tools in the 19th century,

00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:52.951
you're not going to be able to detect

00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:56.250
this actual Ether wind, if it existed.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.184
And that's what gets us to the famous

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.118
Michelson-Morley Experiment,

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:02.634
because there they didn't
just directly try to measure

00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:04.938
the speed of light in
one direction or another,

00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:09.517
instead they thought about,
"Let's split some light into

00:07:09.517 --> 00:07:12.018
two different directions,
and then recombine them

00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:13.884
and see the interference patterns.

00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:16.818
And if the different directions
traveled at different speeds

00:07:16.818 --> 00:07:19.118
then we'll have different
interference patterns."

00:07:19.118 --> 00:07:22.484
And we're going to see
that in the next video.
