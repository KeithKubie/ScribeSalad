00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.159
 
so there's two general hypotheses or

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:07.169
so there's two general hypotheses or
 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.189
so there's two general hypotheses or
theories about the nature of time one of

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:10.199
theories about the nature of time one of
 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.670
theories about the nature of time one of
them will call present ISM and present

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680
them will call present ISM and present
 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.470
them will call present ISM and present
and present ISM the notion is is that

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
and present ISM the notion is is that
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.200
and present ISM the notion is is that
only the present is real the past was

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
only the present is real the past was
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.259
only the present is real the past was
real the future some configuration of

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269
real the future some configuration of
 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.419
real the future some configuration of
the future universe will be real but for

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429
the future universe will be real but for
 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.870
the future universe will be real but for
now only the present Israel in contrast

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
now only the present Israel in contrast
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540
now only the present Israel in contrast
the opposing view is called eternalism

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
the opposing view is called eternalism
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.720
the opposing view is called eternalism
internal ISM you have the past president

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
internal ISM you have the past president
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060
internal ISM you have the past president
future are all equally real so that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
future are all equally real so that
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010
future are all equally real so that
makes the present just an arbitrary

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
makes the present just an arbitrary
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160
makes the present just an arbitrary
point in time or an arbitrary moment in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
point in time or an arbitrary moment in
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.610
point in time or an arbitrary moment in
time so one way to think about this is

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620
time so one way to think about this is
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.420
time so one way to think about this is
now is to time as here is to space so in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
now is to time as here is to space so in
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760
now is to time as here is to space so in
the same sense that I happen to be here

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
the same sense that I happen to be here
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.280
the same sense that I happen to be here
and some viewers are out at some other

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290
and some viewers are out at some other
 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.080
and some viewers are out at some other
point in space and we're all comfortable

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
point in space and we're all comfortable
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910
point in space and we're all comfortable
with that notion that other points in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
with that notion that other points in
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430
with that notion that other points in
space are equally real in eternalism you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
space are equally real in eternalism you
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.810
space are equally real in eternalism you
have to be comfortable with the notion

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820
have to be comfortable with the notion
 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580
have to be comfortable with the notion
that other moments in time are as

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
that other moments in time are as
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.280
that other moments in time are as
equally real as this moment in time and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
equally real as this moment in time and
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.620
equally real as this moment in time and
this is just an arbitrary moment so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
this is just an arbitrary moment so
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.130
this is just an arbitrary moment so
under that view there are other moments

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
under that view there are other moments
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590
under that view there are other moments
so there's a continuum of moments in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
so there's a continuum of moments in
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.419
so there's a continuum of moments in
time that are essentially already laid

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429
time that are essentially already laid
 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.059
time that are essentially already laid
out within the universe and that

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069
out within the universe and that
 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.760
out within the universe and that
universe in physics called the block

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
universe in physics called the block
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.309
universe in physics called the block
universe so under the block universe it

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319
universe so under the block universe it
 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.380
universe so under the block universe it
makes sense to engage in a conversation

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
makes sense to engage in a conversation
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.499
makes sense to engage in a conversation
about time travel because there's other

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
about time travel because there's other
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260
about time travel because there's other
moments to go to not that this doesn't

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
moments to go to not that this doesn't
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999
moments to go to not that this doesn't
speak to the issue of whether time

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
speak to the issue of whether time
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.919
speak to the issue of whether time
travel is actually pause plausible or

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929
travel is actually pause plausible or
 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.789
travel is actually pause plausible or
not it's probably not but it enables the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
not it's probably not but it enables the
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010
not it's probably not but it enables the
conversation because other moments in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
conversation because other moments in
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.789
conversation because other moments in
time exist now under present ism we can

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
time exist now under present ism we can
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770
time exist now under present ism we can
pretty much take the possibility of time

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
pretty much take the possibility of time
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749
pretty much take the possibility of time
travel off the table because there's no

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
travel off the table because there's no
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.489
travel off the table because there's no
other moments to go through only the

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499
other moments to go through only the
 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.440
other moments to go through only the
present is real so it doesn't make sense

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
present is real so it doesn't make sense
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.379
present is real so it doesn't make sense
to ask if you can travel to moments in

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:54.389
to ask if you can travel to moments in
 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:57.039
to ask if you can travel to moments in
time in the past or future that don't

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049
time in the past or future that don't
 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.879
time in the past or future that don't
exist now there's a class here between

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889
exist now there's a class here between
 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:08.440
exist now there's a class here between
neuroscience and physics so intuitively

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
neuroscience and physics so intuitively
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.509
neuroscience and physics so intuitively
the time time seems to be changing we

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519
the time time seems to be changing we
 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.110
the time time seems to be changing we
humans experience the flow of time

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
humans experience the flow of time
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.230
humans experience the flow of time
under a journalism it's where everything

under a journalism it's where everything
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.900
under a journalism it's where everything
is already laid out the flow of time is

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
is already laid out the flow of time is
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.820
is already laid out the flow of time is
a deep mystery because it would seem to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
a deep mystery because it would seem to
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.900
a deep mystery because it would seem to
be that if all moments in time are

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
be that if all moments in time are
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.430
be that if all moments in time are
already laid out within the block

universe that the flow of time shouldn't
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.050
universe that the flow of time shouldn't
exist or must be an illusion so if the

the flow of time is an illusion we have
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.920
the flow of time is an illusion we have
this clash between physics and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
this clash between physics and
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.850
this clash between physics and
neuroscience because the dominant theory

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
neuroscience because the dominant theory
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.720
neuroscience because the dominant theory
in physics is that we live in the block

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
in physics is that we live in the block
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490
in physics is that we live in the block
universe and there's by an eye should be

universe and there's by an eye should be
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.380
universe and there's by an eye should be
clear there's no consensus there's no

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
clear there's no consensus there's no
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.110
clear there's no consensus there's no
100% agreement but the standard view in

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
100% agreement but the standard view in
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.270
100% agreement but the standard view in
physics is that and this comes in large

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
physics is that and this comes in large
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.290
physics is that and this comes in large
part from relativity that we live in a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
part from relativity that we live in a
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.020

journalist universe in the block

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030

universe in which the past present

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
universe in which the past present
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.090
universe in which the past present
future is equally real so this raises

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100
future is equally real so this raises
 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.820
future is equally real so this raises
the question of whether we can trust our

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
the question of whether we can trust our
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.450
the question of whether we can trust our
brain to tell us that time is flowing so

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460
brain to tell us that time is flowing so
 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.810
brain to tell us that time is flowing so
I think we need to have a improved

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820
I think we need to have a improved
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.120
I think we need to have a improved
dialogue between physics and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130
dialogue between physics and
 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.340
dialogue between physics and
neuroscience here so on one hand we have

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350
neuroscience here so on one hand we have
 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.630
neuroscience here so on one hand we have
to decide is if we want to accept that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640
to decide is if we want to accept that
 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.300
to decide is if we want to accept that
our subjective sense of the flow of time

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
our subjective sense of the flow of time
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.910
our subjective sense of the flow of time
is an objective fact about the universe

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
is an objective fact about the universe
 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.180
is an objective fact about the universe
we perceive time to be flowing things

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190
we perceive time to be flowing things
 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.740
we perceive time to be flowing things
seem to be changing the past seems to be

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750
seem to be changing the past seems to be
 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.170
seem to be changing the past seems to be
vaporizing into into the past and the

vaporizing into into the past and the
 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.310
vaporizing into into the past and the
future seems to be wide open now if it's

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320
future seems to be wide open now if it's
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.900
future seems to be wide open now if it's
the case that we live in the block

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910
the case that we live in the block
 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.980
the case that we live in the block
universe that seems to be illusory in a

universe that seems to be illusory in a
 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.220
universe that seems to be illusory in a
very deep sense so we have to decide if

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230
very deep sense so we have to decide if
 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.980
very deep sense so we have to decide if
we want to take our subjective sense of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990
we want to take our subjective sense of
 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.110
we want to take our subjective sense of
the flow of time as an objective fact

the flow of time as an objective fact
 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.780

about the universe that must be

deepest sense of that word because we're

deepest sense of that word because we're
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.950
deepest sense of that word because we're
perceiving something that doesn't exist

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960
perceiving something that doesn't exist
 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.370
perceiving something that doesn't exist
in the physical world that physics

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380
in the physical world that physics
 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.870
in the physical world that physics
doesn't need to explain because it

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
doesn't need to explain because it
 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.950
doesn't need to explain because it
doesn't exist and the snarls

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
doesn't exist and the snarls
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.920
doesn't exist and the snarls
needs to address where the solution

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
needs to address where the solution
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.779
needs to address where the solution
comes from and this illusion is

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789
comes from and this illusion is
 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.100
comes from and this illusion is
presumably tightly coupled with the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
presumably tightly coupled with the
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.380
presumably tightly coupled with the
problem of consciousness

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390
 
 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.640
