I want to share the most beautiful

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.010
I want to share the most beautiful
 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.830
I want to share the most beautiful
equation in math with you okay so

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840
equation in math with you okay so
 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.140
equation in math with you okay so
actually this is literally if you search

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
actually this is literally if you search
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.210

math yeah you will find it so this thing

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770
math yeah you will find it so this thing
 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.259
math yeah you will find it so this thing
I might need to use a little bit of the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
I might need to use a little bit of the
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.730
I might need to use a little bit of the
board I'll just write this pi we already

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740
board I'll just write this pi we already
 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.170
board I'll just write this pi we already
know what pi is right there's another

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
know what pi is right there's another
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.880
know what pi is right there's another
number in math which is called I this is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
number in math which is called I this is
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.689
number in math which is called I this is
the square root of -1 so somehow I equal

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
the square root of -1 so somehow I equal
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.910
the square root of -1 so somehow I equal
to the square root of -1 which you're

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
to the square root of -1 which you're
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.680
to the square root of -1 which you're
not allowed to do there's no way you can

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690
not allowed to do there's no way you can
 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.269
not allowed to do there's no way you can
multiply two numbers together and get a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
multiply two numbers together and get a
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.549
multiply two numbers together and get a
negative one well there is if you allow

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
negative one well there is if you allow
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.229
negative one well there is if you allow
what are called complex numbers or

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
what are called complex numbers or
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.969
what are called complex numbers or
imaginary numbers so that's this I you

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979
imaginary numbers so that's this I you
 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.680
imaginary numbers so that's this I you
can multiply those two together you can

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
can multiply those two together you can
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450
can multiply those two together you can
get even more crazy number not only

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
get even more crazy number not only
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.059
get even more crazy number not only
something doesn't end but it's not even

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069
something doesn't end but it's not even
 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.219
something doesn't end but it's not even
a real number but there's another number

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229
a real number but there's another number
 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.959
a real number but there's another number
in math also and that number is called E

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
in math also and that number is called E
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.329
in math also and that number is called E
and E appears on a lot of these

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339
and E appears on a lot of these
 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.910
and E appears on a lot of these
scientific calculators is another number

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
scientific calculators is another number
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.559
scientific calculators is another number
which is just like pi in the sense that

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569
which is just like pi in the sense that
 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.270
which is just like pi in the sense that
it's transcendental doesn't stop

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
it's transcendental doesn't stop
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.459
it's transcendental doesn't stop
anywhere and also there isn't a there

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
anywhere and also there isn't a there
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.110
anywhere and also there isn't a there
isn't a very nice way to express what it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
isn't a very nice way to express what it
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.660
isn't a very nice way to express what it
is so this one goes by 2.71828 and so on

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
is so this one goes by 2.71828 and so on
 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.150
is so this one goes by 2.71828 and so on
actually this number is also quite

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160
actually this number is also quite
 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.070
actually this number is also quite
impressive it's one eight two eight one

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
impressive it's one eight two eight one
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.410
impressive it's one eight two eight one
eight two eight 45 90 45 and more digits

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
eight two eight 45 90 45 and more digits
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120
eight two eight 45 90 45 and more digits
beyond there okay so a bunch of nice

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
beyond there okay so a bunch of nice
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.550
beyond there okay so a bunch of nice
numbers but this e actually comes also

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
numbers but this e actually comes also
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950
numbers but this e actually comes also
somewhere else in mathematics even

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
somewhere else in mathematics even
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.240
somewhere else in mathematics even
though I told you this doesn't have sent

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
though I told you this doesn't have sent
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550
though I told you this doesn't have sent
any nicer repeating decimal or even

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
any nicer repeating decimal or even
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370
any nicer repeating decimal or even
terminating decimal with E you can get a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
terminating decimal with E you can get a
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780
terminating decimal with E you can get a
by saying suppose I have a box of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
by saying suppose I have a box of
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.310
by saying suppose I have a box of
chocolates with a hundred chocolates and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
chocolates with a hundred chocolates and
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440
chocolates with a hundred chocolates and
I drop them all on the ground and I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
I drop them all on the ground and I
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.580
I drop them all on the ground and I
tried to put them all back in this is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
tried to put them all back in this is
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.570
tried to put them all back in this is
like these nice chocolates but

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580
like these nice chocolates but
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.160
like these nice chocolates but
everything's different right you can ask

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
everything's different right you can ask
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.470
everything's different right you can ask
like what's the probability that every

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480
like what's the probability that every
 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.850
like what's the probability that every
chocolate went back in the wrong spot

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
chocolate went back in the wrong spot
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160
chocolate went back in the wrong spot
and that probability becomes very close

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
and that probability becomes very close
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.290
and that probability becomes very close
to 1 over E that's this and the more

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300
to 1 over E that's this and the more
 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.610
to 1 over E that's this and the more
chocolates you have the closer it is to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620
chocolates you have the closer it is to
 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.610
chocolates you have the closer it is to
this anyway three crazy numbers it turns

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620
this anyway three crazy numbers it turns
 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.280
this anyway three crazy numbers it turns
out that if you take E and raise it to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
out that if you take E and raise it to
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.120
out that if you take E and raise it to
that then I can finish the equation with

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
that then I can finish the equation with
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730
that then I can finish the equation with
two more numbers like the most basic

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
two more numbers like the most basic
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.460
two more numbers like the most basic
numbers in math are 1 and 0 and this is

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
numbers in math are 1 and 0 and this is
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.730
numbers in math are 1 and 0 and this is
true so what's going on here is I've

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
true so what's going on here is I've
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770
true so what's going on here is I've
just put together 3 completely

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
just put together 3 completely
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.259
just put together 3 completely
ridiculous numbers and they together

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
ridiculous numbers and they together
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.610
ridiculous numbers and they together
make negative 1 for all of the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
make negative 1 for all of the
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.289
make negative 1 for all of the
of the nest that was here because all

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299
of the nest that was here because all
 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.059
of the nest that was here because all
come back in together right here and

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069
come back in together right here and
 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.070
come back in together right here and
this is this is a this is an Avis called

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
this is this is a this is an Avis called
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.410
this is this is a this is an Avis called
Euler's identity and it is actually the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
Euler's identity and it is actually the
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.789
Euler's identity and it is actually the
most beautiful equation in math because

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799
most beautiful equation in math because
 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.199
most beautiful equation in math because
it combines all of these different

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
it combines all of these different
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.039
it combines all of these different
constants together

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049
constants together
 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.140
constants together
there's your pi there but suddenly the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
there's your pi there but suddenly the
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.640
there's your pi there but suddenly the
pi got joined with all these other ones

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
pi got joined with all these other ones
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.729
pi got joined with all these other ones
so there's some other other other fun

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
so there's some other other other fun
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.170
so there's some other other other fun
parts here - have you seen this is the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
parts here - have you seen this is the
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.500
parts here - have you seen this is the
shirts with the PI and the I the joke

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
shirts with the PI and the I the joke
 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.460
shirts with the PI and the I the joke
where pi says get real and I says be

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
where pi says get real and I says be
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.229
where pi says get real and I says be
rational right there they're basically

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239
rational right there they're basically
 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.300
rational right there they're basically
calling each other out so I seen those

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310
calling each other out so I seen those
 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.800
calling each other out so I seen those
shirts ever since I was in high school

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
shirts ever since I was in high school
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.259
shirts ever since I was in high school
of like the speech bubble get real be

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
of like the speech bubble get real be
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.670
of like the speech bubble get real be
rational it's like the pot calling the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680
rational it's like the pot calling the
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.030
rational it's like the pot calling the
kettle black but actually that should

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
kettle black but actually that should
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.020
kettle black but actually that should
that shirt should have one more punch

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030
that shirt should have one more punch
 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.449
that shirt should have one more punch
line the last punch line should be let

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
line the last punch line should be let
 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.680
line the last punch line should be let
me let me write the joke first this one

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
me let me write the joke first this one
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.420
me let me write the joke first this one
says get real and this one says be

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
says get real and this one says be
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.360
says get real and this one says be
rational the correct way to put the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
rational the correct way to put the
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.870
rational the correct way to put the
punchline on this joke if I should say

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
punchline on this joke if I should say
 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:30.559
punchline on this joke if I should say
join me and will be one so of course

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569
join me and will be one so of course
 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.559
join me and will be one so of course
that's a negative one right there but

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569
that's a negative one right there but
 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.300
that's a negative one right there but
somehow this was this this punchline the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
somehow this was this this punchline the
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.159
somehow this was this this punchline the
joke was never said before and though we

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169
joke was never said before and though we
 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.690
joke was never said before and though we
thought of this joke about two years ago

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
thought of this joke about two years ago
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.589
thought of this joke about two years ago
American it we have we already great

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599
American it we have we already great
 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.200
