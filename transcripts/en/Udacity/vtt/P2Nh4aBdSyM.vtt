00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.690
How many moves did you come up with,
David?

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; So, I was able to do
the problem in 11 moves.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.270
I won't talk you through
the entire process, but

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.460
if you'd like to pause this
video you can take a look and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.000
see the exact moves I used,
and see if they match yours.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.340
We know that 11 moves are the most
efficient way to solve the problem, but

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.650
these aren't the only 11 moves that
can actually solve the problem.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.910
&gt;&gt; Good, David.
That's the correct answer.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.360
So now that we have solved
this problem together,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.010
next time you go to a cocktail party,
you can entertain all of your guests by

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.040
showing how you can do this problem so
effectively and so efficiently.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.160
Even if all of them flounder trying
to do things on their napkin that's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.670
not succeeding.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.200
&gt;&gt; So we've not yet talked about how
an AI method can determine which states

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.340
are productive and
which states are unproductive.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.440
We'll revisit this issue
in the next couple lessons.
