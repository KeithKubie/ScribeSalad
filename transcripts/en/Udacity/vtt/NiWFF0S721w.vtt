00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.400
There are many examples of how the media misrepresents studies. For example,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.320
here are some recent headlines based on a real scientific study. Husbands who

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.340
do more housework may have less sex. Want to have more sex? Men stop doing

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.140
chores. Men not doing chores. Having a lot of sex. These media headlines are

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.650
based on a correlational study that measures the time and type of chores,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.280
masculine and feminine and the amount of sexual encounters. In this study, they

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.910
found that couples who split the type of household chore, masculine versus

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.310
feminine reported five sexual encounters per month. However, when men completed

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.502
approximately 17 hours of masculine type chores and women completed

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:47.080
approximately 35 hours of feminine type chores they had nearly two more sexual

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.220
encounters per month. Chores or types of chores, masculine versus feminine. And

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.800
sexual encounters in this example. A variable is any characteristic that can

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.470
vary across individuals or across time within the same individuals. And this is

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.300
a correlational study. Because we are not manipulating any variables. Instead

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.140
we are just simply observing a mathematical relationship between two variables.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.240
In this case chores, the number and type, masculine versus feminine and the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.200
amount of sexual encounters. An important distinction in correlational studies

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280
is that they do not manipulate any variables. Instead we're just measuring to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.290
see whether the variables are related. This differs from experimental studies,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.360
wherein researchers actually manipulated independent variable; and measure the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.910
effect on the dependent variable. We will cover these types of studies, after

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.059
looking at correlations.
