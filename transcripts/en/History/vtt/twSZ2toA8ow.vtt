00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.670
NARRATOR: It is a moment of
great excitement on Oak Island.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.380
Rick Lagina and
Gary Drayton welcome

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.040
representatives from
Brycon Construction

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.330
and Irving Equipment Ltd.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540
They have come to make the final
preparations for what promises

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.210
to be the most ambitious
and technologically advanced

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.080
operation ever attempted--

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.670
Mike, how are you doing?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.000
NARRATOR: --in the 223 year
long history of the Oak

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.250
Island Treasure Hunt--

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.580
the installation of a
25-foot deep metal coffer

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.080
dam off the coast
of Smith's Cove.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.420
When completed,
the encircled area

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.580
will be drained and then
excavated in an effort

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.580
to find the elusive
flood tunnels,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.080
and perhaps a direct entrance
to the Oak Island Money Pit.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.540
But before construction of
the coffer dam can begin,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.580
a new access road and
platform must be laid out

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.040
to allow for the
massive equipment,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.210
including a 300-ton
crane, to be transported

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.500
down to the beach area.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.120
That crane is the
biggest item that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.460
will have to be moved down.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.710
And then, of course, it
will have to track out.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.120
So we have to seriously
reconfigure the path

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960
from 10X down to Smith's Cove.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.120
And by serious, I
mean quite serious.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.920
Once this process gets all done,
what's your timing look like?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.620
We're thinking it's
probably a week and a half.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.210
Aside from that, I think you
guys got your marching orders.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.380
And anything we can
do, you let us know.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.250
Fair enough?
- Yep.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.120
That's no problem.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.880
All right, gentlemen.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.460
Good luck.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.880
NARRATOR: With the new road
to the beach completed,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.670
brothers Rick and Marty
Lagina are finally

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.580
ready to break ground on
this summer's most ambitious

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.830
and most eagerly
anticipated project,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.330
the excavation of Smith's Cove.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.250
Today, the team from
Irving Equipment Ltd.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.250
has begun delivering the
heavy machines and equipment

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.460
that will be needed
in order to construct

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.500
a massive steel coffer dam.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.790
[truck horn]

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.830
They're here.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.250
Well, here we go.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.670
Pretty remarkable,
isn't it David?

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.500
NARRATOR: Over
the next few days,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.750
the team will assemble a 300-ton
crane at the Money Pit area

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.460
before it can be staged on the
nearby beach, where some 2,200

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.710
tons of earth have
been moved to build

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.210
a perfectly flat work surface.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.790
And in a couple of days,
that will be put together.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.120
Yep.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.330
And roughly two,
three weeks from now,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.880
we'll be down at target depth.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.210
It's cool.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.500
Just think how long
it took your father.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.210
We didn't have
the technology then.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.040
Exactly.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.000
NARRATOR: Once the
crane is in place,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.290
construction can finally
begin on the nearly 525-foot

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.670
long watertight barrier.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.380
When it is completed, the
ocean water will be drained out

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.540
and then the entire area,
nearly 12,000 square feet,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.330
will be excavated.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.040
This will allow the
team to uncover not only

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.330
important artifacts, such
as the mysterious lead cross

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.420
discovered at Smith's
Cove last year,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.540
but also possible evidence of
an ancient flood tunnel system.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.420
Because of the
find of the cross,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.000
we have to do a
very disciplined,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.830
archaeologically-driven dig
in order to see if there

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.210
are other similar artifacts.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.080
We've always thought that
there may be a treasure trove

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.040
of information in Smith's Cove.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040
At the end of this
exercise, we're

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.880
going to know more
about Smith's Cove

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.250
than has ever been known before.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.460
It's a big operation.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.710
It's scary in a sense.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.120
It's daunting and it's exciting.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.380
There's a story here--

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.580
Yep.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.210
--and it's
constantly unraveling.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.540
Yeah.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.920
For me, the quest
is really to find out

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.380
what happened here long ago.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.580
And I hope that there's
answers down there.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.290
I do too.
