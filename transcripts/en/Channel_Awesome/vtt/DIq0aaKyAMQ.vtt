00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:12.120
[Disneycember theme]

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.500
[Doug] It's Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.860
And if you think that doesn't date, it take a listen to this!

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.410
President Chelsea, Clinton.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.359
Yep, that's the kind of on the nose writing we're gonna be dealing with here.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.880
Well, okay, looking at this, ,aybe it's supposed to be the late 21st century that gives a bit of time, 2049!

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.380
Yeah, definitely optimism at the height of foolishness.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.770
But, whatever, it's children's fiction.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.800
What's the story?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.860
Well, Zenon, a tweenage girl, lives on a space station and does all sorts of things that girl that age usually does.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.280
Hang out with her friends, listen to bands, get in trouble, all that stuff.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.140
But when she sees that the biggest funder of the space station seems to be up to no good,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.035
She tries to call him out on it, but nobody believes her.

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:57.179
As punishment for her actions, she's grounded.

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.440
Literally, she's grounded down to Earth, which she barely remembers because she left when she was in kindergarten.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.209
As you'd imagine, Earth and the space station are very different from one another,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.191
and she has a hard time fitting in.

00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:09.750
Her Aunt Judy is a little odd,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
The clothes are all different, people talk different, even the food and gravity are off from what she's used to.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
But slowly over time, she starts to make friends,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.020
and they start to realize maybe all those things she was saying about the funder was true.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.160
As those evildoers try to track her down because she has some sort of secret disc.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.260
And ultimately, she ends up trying to save her space station, while also trying to get a dance with her favorite boy band.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.600
Yeah, it's pretty silly.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.540
You should probably imagine there isn't really THAT much in this for adults.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.360
This is clearly made for a very target audience of, I don't know,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.968
let's say five to eleven year olds.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:44.760
Because of this, a lot of the storytelling

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.780
and acting is a little over the top, but I have to admit, when I was that age,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.260
This is the kind of acting and storytelling I liked listening to.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.580
It is exaggerated,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.750
There are a lot of catch phrases,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.140
But the film does try to contribute a few interesting ideas and fun environments.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.540
The space station for example,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.042
It's a really cool design.

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:03.780
I just love looking at.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.540
I love these colors, I love these setups.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.220
Okay, it looks a little cheap,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.520
But, it's almost like being on Deep Space Nine except from the little kids point of view.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.140
I always thought that became a neat idea.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.260
But the nice thing is the fun stuff doesn't stop when she leaves the space station.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.060
Her interactions on Earth are actually kind of interesting.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.860
Because she's not very familiar with it,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.960
She thinks everyone constantly has to dodge tornadoes,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.040
and earthquakes,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.340
and sicknesses.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.540
And if someone grew up on a space station,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.440
that is probably what they would assume.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.420
They say that gravity on Earth compared to the space station is also 30 pounds heavier,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.800
And they demonstrate this very cleverly by just having her go on this bridge

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.080
that's at an angle and they tilt the camera,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.039
and that's a very simple way of showing it, but it's also really effective.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.540
There's also fun contrast.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.240
Like even though she constantly gets into trouble and can do all these cool things on the space station,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.980
She's afraid of horses.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.360
She's known as a risk-taker back at home, but she's terrified of trying a burger.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.540
She even has good comebacks for these stereotypical bullies.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.060
Seeing how people on Earth and space station is dressed different,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.740
this one girl goes up to her and asked if she's gonna be in a freak show or dressing up for Halloween

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.080
Her response?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.300
[Zenon] You win, it's the Halloween thing,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.700
Now,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.980
lend me that mask you're wearing,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.340
and I'll have the most hideous major costume ever!

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.520
[Doug] Oh, snap!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.800
I love that!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.840
You think she's gonna go through the whole movie just with her head down, looking sad and stuff,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.700
But, no!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.720
The first insult she gets, she throws it right back!

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660
I love that they played around with that a little bit.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.000
But, on top of that, it has a clever way of demonstrating a very familiar lesson.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.660
It is a fish out of water story,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.820
and about adapting,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.119
But, it's a kind of adapting that a lot of kids that age can understand.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.080
It's moving from one location to another.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.620
Where the clothes are different,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.180
and the language is different

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.889
and tiny things you took for granted can suddenly get you in a lot of trouble.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:50.220
But by adding that extra element of having it in the future and on a space station, it makes it a little bit more interesting.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.120
It's more fun than creative,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.760
Even if sometimes the effects are pretty laughably bad.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.350
Come on, these were embarrassing even by the standards back then.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.479
But while the effects don't look that great,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.509
They do still take the time to have a character be in a moment.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.470
While the characters

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.180
don't look like they're really there,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.340
They feel like they're really there.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.600
The movie takes time to just focus on their reaction,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.800
and play some nice music and feel the environment.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.700
And they give the same thing on Earth too,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.840
where you can appreciate the ocean and landscapes and such.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.000
I think this movie knows

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.520
what's gonna be fun about it is the environment.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.390
And they let you as a kid enjoy it.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.760
Is a cliched?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.320
Sure.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.580
Can the characters get annoying?

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.080
Sometimes.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.900
But a few imaginative ideas and visuals,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.779
mixed with even a few good performances from the boyfriend and the aunt.

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.619
Give it a nice enough atmosphere where if I was the appropriate age they were aiming for?

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.600
I would probably enjoy it.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.330
Not much in it for adults, but I don't really think it's meant for adults.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.090
It's meant for kids who need to learn about being out of place.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.940
But also about accepting new ideas and new environments.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.029
And this does have some imaginative ideas and environments.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.049
Most adults would fall asleep, but I think most kids would have a cheesy, but fun time.
