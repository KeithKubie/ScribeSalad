00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.203
( intro music )

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.215 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.350
This first picture is really
my first understanding

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.420
of exploration and discovery.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.721 line:0%
As early as I can remember,
my mother would take me

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.056 line:0%
on nature walks behind our house

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.926 line:0%
in the south shore
of Massachusetts.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:29.662
Each day, we would go
in the back of the woods

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.999
and at each step
there was discovery.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.834
I can clearly
remember these days

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.670
of going under the
leaf litter and finding

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.673
lady slippers, or flowering
Indian peace pipes

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.141
or an old fox skull.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.378
These days of discovery
have stayed with me.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:46.946
This sense that the
forest was a place

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.449
of spiritual communion
has also stayed with me.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.051
My mother's sense of awe

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.521
at each thing that we would
find that was extraordinary,

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.191
really was contagious
and it instilled in me

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.661
this lesson that I
carry with me today.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.030
That the definition of
extraordinary is just that.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.632
It's finding something ordinary,

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:09.001
but somehow elevated in meaning.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.237
It started with really
this ephemeral bloom

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.504
of a lady slipper.

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.940
In the third grade, I was asked

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.809
to do a project on an animal

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.144
and as I flipped through
the encyclopedia of animals

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:20.947
I came across the
ring-tailed lemur.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.382
I completely fell in love.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.517
I told my family that I
was moving to Madagascar

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.985
and they all laughed at me.

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.353
( audience laughing )

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:30.022
But it really was then that I
began this life-long commitment

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.791
to a place that was
so far from home

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.359
but so close to my heart.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.728
I did research for this project.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.397
I went to our local
library and I came across

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:40.833
this National Geographic
issue from 1988.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.168
I can remember
plopping myself down

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.670
on a bean bag chair and
reading through this issue,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.872
"Lemurs on the edge
of survival".

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:49.008
It created in me this
sense of urgency,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:50.176
this sense of passion,

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.677
this sense of purpose

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.479
that I needed to
go to Madagascar

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.115
and protect lemurs from
this very certain fate

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.052
of endangerment, of extinction.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.187
A few years later,
in the same library,

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.589
I came across a book
called "The Aye-Aye and I"

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.090
written by Gerald Durrell.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.793
I read through this voraciously.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.294
It became my favorite book,

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:11.363
and in many ways it still is.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.199
Gerald Durrell became my hero.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.701
He was a naturalist
that was dedicated

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.637
to saving animals in peril.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:20.840
He had a very special place
in his heart for Madagascar.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.809
He is known as saying
"The world is as delicate

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.845
and as complicated
as a spider's web.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:28.047
If you touch one
thread, you send shutters

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.349
running through all
of the other threads.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.918
We are not just tearing
the web, we are really

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.488
tearing great holes in it."

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.525
I really began to
dedicate myself

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.694
to finding a way to
go to Madagascar.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:44.263
I wanted to write
a letter to Gerald Durrell

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.232
and I sent him a letter
right after I read the book

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.867
and I told him how much
that book meant to me.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.270
A few months later, I got
a letter back from his wife

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.571
telling me that
Jerry had passed.

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:54.273
That really propelled
me even more

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:55.908
to really start my
career and find a way

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.376
to get to Madagascar.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.511
As you can tell from this story,

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.781
I did find my way to Madagascar.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.683
I just met Lee Durrell,
his wife, last year there.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.852
I have now spent
the last 15 years there.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:10.690
First doing this carnivore
behavioral biology research,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.791
then starting my own

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.125
environmental education
initiative

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.927
and before my senior
year in college,

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:17.997
I decided to be intrepid
and start off my own project

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.199
in the northeast of
Madagascar, where Jerry worked.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.202
This is what I found.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:25.938
This picture is
incredibly disturbing.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:29.042
This picture still
haunts me to this day,

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.245
and yet I have come
to understand it.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.248
This is a far cry from the
image that I had in my head

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.150
from reading Jerry's book,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.918
and yet it was so
important for me

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:43.823
to really understand
what this image meant.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:46.492
I did the first research
creating a systematic survey

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:47.693
of hunting in Madagascar.

00:03:47.693 --> 00:03:48.861
That started 10 years ago.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.196
We have now monitored
this population

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.597
for the past 10 years,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:55.168
really looking at their
reliance on local wildlife.

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.336
It was the first
systematic survey.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.138
Madagascar's paradigm
has always been

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.673
that the island was on fire

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.809
and that slash and burn
was destroying the forest

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.777
yet there was a
more hidden threat

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:07.546
crippling the wildlife
populations in Madagascar.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.882
It was this undercover
threat of hunting.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.984
No one had explored this before

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:13.352
and so I set out to do that.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.255
In addition to the
wildlife surveys,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.323
I initiated a kind of project

00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:20.425
to look at a lot of
the lemur populations

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:21.660
and how hunting was occurring.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.163
I just want to send a special
"thank you" to Jon Betz,

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.364
who is hopefully here.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:26.798
He is a National
Geographic photographer

00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:28.501
who came out to visit
me a few months ago

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.772
in Madagascar and the next
series of images are all his.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.573
In addition to the
hunting surveys,

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:37.477
we set up ways of
training local Malagasy,

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:38.977
training Malagasy
university students

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:40.713
to monitor their own wildlife.

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.049
We did this in both diurnal
and nocturnal surveys.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.117
We wanted to understand
the ways in which hunting,

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.852
and I was very
unidirectionally focused,

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.988
looking at how hunting
impacted

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.090
these wildlife
population dynamics,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.724
and not just lemurs
but the tenrecs.

00:04:52.724 --> 00:04:54.593
These are like little hedgehogs.

00:04:54.593 --> 00:04:56.361
We set up a mark
and capture project

00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:58.664
to look at population dynamics.

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.533
We attached radio
transmitters to their backs

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.268
to follow them and
understand their range

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.969
and understand the ways in
which their life history

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.506
was affected by hunting.

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:13.579
All of this wildlife, albeit
beautiful, exotic, extraordinary

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.515
was reduced by local
people to one thing:

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:17.683
food.

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:20.386
All of it was food.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.888
As I spent year after
year in these communities

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:26.391
and as I learned all of
their local languages,

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:28.794
I came to realize that I needed

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:31.731
to look through the
forest in their eyes.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:33.799
It all became clear to me.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.635
These people weren't criminals,

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.103
although they were.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:40.272
Most of the hunting in
Madagascar is illegal.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:41.908
But these men were family men.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:42.975
They were providers.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:46.779
They were protecting
their family's welfare.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.148
What I set out to do was
to start a research team.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.116
Locally, we called
ourselves MAHERY

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.085
which means strength
in the Malagasy language.

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:54.754
It also is an acronym
that stands for

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:58.156
Madagascar's Health and
Environmental Research.

00:05:58.156 --> 00:06:01.394
In 2008, our team did
a systematic survey

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.029
of how wildlife is connected
to human nutrition.

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.765
We found that when
the local communities

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.900
lost access to wildlife,
their rates of anemia

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.370
would actually
increase by 30 percent.

00:06:11.703 --> 00:06:13.739
These results were astounding.

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.709
It really taught us
that if local people

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.611
messed with their
natural environment,

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.379
they were actually
self-depleting

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.114
their own nutritional resource.

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:25.084
It was this direct linkage
between environmental change

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.420
and human well-being.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.156
It also taught me that if
you mess with mother nature,

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.792
she might stop taking care
of all of her children.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:37.630
For the past 15 months,
what ended last month,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.632
we decided to study this
phenomenon in earnest.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.667
Through support from the
Rockefeller Foundation,

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.435
we enrolled 700
people into our study,

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:45.237
and on a daily basis
over these 15 months

00:06:45.237 --> 00:06:47.806
we measured everything that
they were eating in their diet.

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.575
Every four months we
took a blood sample.

00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:53.379
We took fecal samples,
fingernail samples,

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.114
so that we could understand
the ways in which

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.284
all of these things that
are coming from the forest

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.352
were providing nutritional
benefits to them.

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:01.921
From the fecal samples,
looking at the ways

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:04.423
in which intestinal
parasites affected nutrition.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.859
How dietary intake
and pharmaceutical use

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:09.127
affected their microbiome.

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.263
I wanted to stop
having tunnel vision.

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:13.065
Stop looking at only the ways

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.768
in which humans were
affecting the environment

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:18.170
but also the ways in which
the environment circled back

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.038
and can benefit humans

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:23.409
to reframe the conversation
of conservation.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.244
Not only were we looking at
nutrition and food security,

00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:27.780
we were also looking
at a different dimension

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.749
of human and
wildlife interaction.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.917
The ways in which
hunting wildlife

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:34.052
presented a disease risk.

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:36.555
So 75 percent of emerging
infectious diseases

00:07:36.555 --> 00:07:38.691
are zoonotic, meaning
they are transferred

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.992
from animals to humans.

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:42.961
Everything like SARS
and avian influenza,

00:07:42.961 --> 00:07:46.065
Ebola, HIV, all of
these major pandemics

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:48.034
are actually started
in animal hosts

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.235
and transferred to humans.

00:07:50.235 --> 00:07:52.204
But the most interesting
thing that I learned

00:07:52.204 --> 00:07:53.972
is really from local people.

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:56.909
The image behind me
is a local rendition

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.377
of the Kalanoro.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:03.148
She is a part of their local
spiritual animist pantheon.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.950
She is always envisioned
in the same way,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.253
as a dwarf with long
hair and long fingernails

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.787
and backwards facing feet,

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:10.522
with her heel pointing forward

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:11.791
and her toes pointing backwards

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.293
so that when she walks, no
one can track and find her.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.662
But she does appear
in people's dreams.

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:19.565
What she tells them
in those dreams

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:22.735
is which animals
to have a taboo for.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.571
She can, in many ways, be
seen as a conservation spirit.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:29.441
She is telling certain
people what to not eat,

00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:31.410
what wildlife species
should be protected.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.979
And yet what she really is

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.346
is a health spirit.

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:36.649
In those dreams,
she is giving messages

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:39.117
like "Don't eat this
particular type of wildlife

00:08:39.117 --> 00:08:40.719
because your skin
will change color.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.920
You'll bleed from your eyes,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.223
You'll bleed from your
ears or you'll die."

00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:46.992
All of these symptoms
are indicative

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:48.260
of zoonotic disease transfer.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.696
I got very interested
to see whether or not

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:52.898
there was actually
a relationship between

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:55.935
this traditional
epidemiological knowledge

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.704
and what was actually there
as a present disease risk.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:02.007
What I found through
surveying 1,200 households

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:04.276
over the past 10 years was

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:06.845
that the number one
most commonly tabooed

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:09.482
wildlife species was
the hedgehog tenrec.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.116
More than 50 percent
of the population

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:14.519
had a taboo
for the hedgehog tenrec.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.555
Although these stories
have been passed on

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:21.093
for generations, what
we found was that

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.828
just last year there
was a discovery

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.863
that the bubonic
plague is present

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.632
in the hedgehog tenrec

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:31.236
and that they have
this kind of immunity

00:09:31.236 --> 00:09:32.605
to bubonic plague.

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.907
It consistently spills
over into human populations

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:36.708
and wildlife populations

00:09:36.708 --> 00:09:37.776
and rodent populations

00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:39.345
and presents a disease risk.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.813
If you have been
following the news,

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.381
in October of last year,

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.417
Madagascar experienced
the largest epidemic outbreak

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:48.353
of bubonic plague
since the middle ages.

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:49.822
I just think there is
a tremendous amount

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:53.092
that we can learn
through local knowledge.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.793
So what happens now?

00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:57.262
We know for two reasons that
wildlife consumption is bad.

00:09:57.262 --> 00:09:58.930
It presents this terrible risk

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.666
to endemic wildlife populations.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:01.867
It presents a tremendous

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.769
infectious disease
risk to local humans,

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.504
and yet it provides
this critical

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:08.140
source of nutrition
to local people.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.775
So where do we go?

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.710
We decided to implement

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.480
a sustainable chicken
husbandry project.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.949
This is a good idea for
several different reasons.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:19.150
Number one is that I have done
a taste preferences study

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.786
looking at 23 different
species of wildlife

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.588
and 10 species of
domesticated meats

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:23.822
and across the board,

00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:25.558
chicken is their number
one taste preference.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.893
So not everything
tastes like chicken.

00:10:27.893 --> 00:10:29.261
( audience laughing )

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:32.297
The second is that
using this pervasive

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.466
and complex taboo
system across the board,

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.135
no one has
a taboo for chicken.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:38.770
If we are looking
at a population intervention

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.506
that is applicable to everyone,

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.174
chicken is the answer.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:44.109
Wildlife species
are less preferred

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:45.744
and also less expensive.

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:48.280
If we can develop ways to
make chickens more productive,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.815
it can reduce the price

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:52.217
and almost naturally wean
people away from wildlife

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:53.886
and into chicken.

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:56.655
The problem is that
there is Newcastle Disease.

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:59.424
This is a pathogen that
wipes out 80 to 100 percent

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:01.593
of the chicken flock seasonally.

00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:02.895
We just received funding

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.263
from the Nordic
Family Foundation

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.764
a few weeks ago, actually,

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:08.667
and it will import
a vaccine from Malaysia,

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.369
subsidize its costs.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.137
We will get extension agents
that will be teaching people

00:11:12.137 --> 00:11:15.141
about bio-security measures
and husbandry conditions

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.409
and hopefully be able to
really tackle the problem

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:19.311
on a local scale.

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.212
The case study
that I've mentioned

00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:23.014
is not operating in isolation.

00:11:23.014 --> 00:11:25.184
It's part of a larger
effort called HEAL,

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.786
Health and Ecosystems:
Analysis of Linkages.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:29.655
It's a program
that's based at WCS.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.590
I've recently
become the director,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.825
as of January.

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:34.927
It's a 25 institution
consortium that partners

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:37.963
academic, NGO, and
governmental organizations

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.265
together to tackle
this data gap.

00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:41.867
It's very intuitive
that the environment

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.369
and health is linked,

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.072
and yet the evidence
base is very weak.

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.841
What I see as a very
natural transfer

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:52.845
from the terrestrial system
into the marine system

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:54.713
to look at the ways in
which marine conservation

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:57.349
through no-take zones,
seasonal closures,

00:11:57.349 --> 00:12:00.052
or gear restrictions
can protect biodiversity

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.320
but also increase the
productivity of fish docks.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.090
This increased productivity
doesn't stay within the bounds

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.758
of the marine protected area,

00:12:06.758 --> 00:12:09.428
but spills over into
adjacent communities.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.596
We want to measure
empirically the ways in which

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:12.965
there are nutritional benefits,

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.067
livelihood benefits,
health benefits,

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.135
that arise from
marine conservation

00:12:17.135 --> 00:12:18.537
so we don't think of it

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:20.439
as an environmental
intervention.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.107
We can frame conservation

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.577
as a public health intervention.

00:12:25.877 --> 00:12:28.214
In closing, I just
want to say

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:29.180
that I really found

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.817
this extraordinary place
in Madagascar,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.686
but I also found it
in my back yard.

00:12:34.686 --> 00:12:37.623
The more and more
I discover about myself,

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:40.058
the more and more I see
that these experiences

00:12:40.058 --> 00:12:42.127
were entirely parallel.

00:12:42.127 --> 00:12:45.063
That as I began to look
through local people's eyes

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.532
and see how they
really saw the forest

00:12:47.532 --> 00:12:49.668
as benefiting their health,

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.271
we, too, are receiving
a very certain type

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:56.142
of health benefit from the
areas that surround us.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.611
I just want to say
that exploration

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:02.147
can really take us far afield,

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:04.482
and yet I think the most
important thing that we can do

00:13:04.482 --> 00:13:07.486
is take what we find
in those explorations

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:10.022
and make sure that
we take it home.

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:11.223
Thank you.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.058
( applause )

00:13:13.058 --> 00:13:15.761
( outro music )
