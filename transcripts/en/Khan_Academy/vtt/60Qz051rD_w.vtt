00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
This is Sal here and I'm with Ben Eater, who I consider to be an expert at many things

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.960
What are we gonna talk about today.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.760
Hey let's talk about semiconductor.  And semiconductors is the computing revolution

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.340
in electronics, the phones in our pockets. they are all made of chips

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.880
that have semiconductors in them

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.940
Right right and they are made from silicon.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.740
Silicon and that's why we have this periodic table here

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.820
we see silicon here with an atomic number of 14. Which means it has 14 protons

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.720
and a neutral silicon would also have 14 electrons

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.000
Right but what we care about is the electrons that are in the outermost shell the valence electrons

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.640
For any any viewers who aren't familiar we have a whole series on valence electrons and I encourage to watch them

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.040
if what ben and I are talking seems to be a bit confusing

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.000
But a neutral silicon atom will have 14 electrons but the 4 in the outermost shell

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that are likely to react

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.920
and so when chemist

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.480
depict silicon or depict how it might react

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.820
they think primarily about this 4 electrons

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.140
but we just drew this 4 , these are 4 VALENCE electrons

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.520
there's another 10 for a neutral silicon atom that will be sitting closer to the nucleous

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
right but those dont react with other atoms as much so we dont really think about those

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.100
so in a semiconductor you've got basically a whole crystal of silicon atoms

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.100
se let's see if we can imagine that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100
so we have a cristal here

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.580
each of these circles represents a silicon atom

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.580
and we are only going to think about the valence electrons

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580
so this silicon atom has 4 valence electrons

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.620
so it could be 1, 2, 3 and 4 valence electrons

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.600
so it could be bonded to a neighboring silicon

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.000
let me do this in a ifferent color so we can keep track of its valence electrons

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.820
to a neighboring silicon

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.000
whose valence electrons are 1, 2, 3 and 4

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.120
and when we see what happened here is that they formed a covalent bond

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.300
wich allows both of these silicons to share both of these electrons

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.240
yeah so he drew them in different colors  but both of them feel like they own both electrons

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:31.240
right , and in chemistry , once again, the atoms get stable when they have 8 valence electrons

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.960
and so for silicon does this with 4 other silicons

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.700
it can pretend that it has 8 valence electrons

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.920
like this one right over here

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.620
it kinda feels like it partially owns 8 valence electrons

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.740
even though he only contributed 4

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.760
the other 4 comes from the neighboring silicons

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.600
yeah and all of the silicon atoms in this crystal structure feel that way so its very stable

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.440
and once again, what we are seeing is just a 2-dimensional slide

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440
this thing would be 3-dimensional

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.040
yeah its a 2-dimentional depiction really cause the bonds are , you know , 3 dimensional

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180
but yeah this is just a representation

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.820
so what we are interested in is- we are talking about computers and electronics and so we want to talk about current flow

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.220
and so the question is , can current flow through this , is this a conductor?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.620
well what we just talked about , looks like everything would be very stable here it doesnt seems to be a lot of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.960
strong incentive , even if you were to put a current through this , and let's do that

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360
even if you were to put a current through that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
so if i were to put a current across this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.360
se there is a batery right over here

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.820
and this is the negative side, the negative terminal

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.000
this is the positive terminal

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840
and we tipically talk about current going from positive to negative

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840
but we know that is actually the electrons are flowing

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060
yeah its a little confusing unfortunally i guess

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.800
benjamin franklin had 50% chance of getting it right and he got it wrong

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.160
he had it wrong well he did many other good things

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.760
so we'll excuse him this one

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760
we'll give him a pass . but the electrons

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.500
the electrons want to , you know , if you have a complete circuit

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500
the electrons would go the other way around

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.600
they would go to the positive terminal

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.740
but , all of these electrons in this silicone lattice

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.060
it looks like they are pretty happy , there is no reason for them to move

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.560
good conductors , when we think about the transition metals

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560
things like copper they have a sea of electrons

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.280
lots of free electrons moving around around

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.720
in this metallic bonds

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.440
in fact this wire we have over here if it was made of , say , copper it would have just a lot of free electrons

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.960
the sea of electrons that could flow

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.720
but here the electrons look like they are pretty happy where they are

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720
they dont really have a lot of incentive to move around

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320
right so how is this usefull

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.320
when we are building something like a computer

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280
yeah , so by itself its not

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.860
so what we do is  , we add some impurites to the silicon

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.080
we call this process doping

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.540
we are just adding some impurities to the silicon that let's us conduct electricity

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.680
those are some interesting things

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.440
can there be like any impurity?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.440
no , so there are actually very specific impurities

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.940
and so one impurity is phosforous

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.860
i see , so let's take a look to the periodic table

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.660
any time I hear the name of an element i need to refer to the periodic table

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.220
to get my bearings , ALRIGHT , so phosphorous

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.220
look is right next to silicon in the periodic table

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.780
it has an atomic number of 15

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.260
and so a neutral phosphorous would have 15 protons and 15 electrons

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
but if we think about its valence electrons

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.260
it would have one more

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.260
so it has 5

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880
it would have 5 valence electrons

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.540
yeah and that 5th valence electron is like super important

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.000
so let's think about what's going on here

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.660
if i replace this silicon with a phosphorous (blue)

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.720
if i were to replace this silicon with phosphorous

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:57.120
it could have 1, 2, 3, 4 but then it  has a 5th valence electron

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.120
that wouldnt be able to find a covalent bond

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.820
so he is kind of sitting there

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.800
and let me do that again maybe this one over here is a phosphorous

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:14.920
and so this is 1, 2 , 3, 4, and the it has a 5th valence electrons

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.060
so it has this extra electron

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.640
yeah so it has an extra electrons

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.340
and they are free to move around , they are not stuck in these covalent bonds

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.340
right , this covalent bond is kind of a stable configuraton

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.340
you have the 8 valence electrons

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.280
but here you have these extra ones , and yeah these are more , liberated i guess to move around

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.660
AND we have this battery hooked up here , you have this positive terminal

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.280
and electrons are gonna be atracted to that

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.280
yeah so this one , this one right ove here it might be able to be atracted to that one , that one can move there

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.280
and eventually get to the wire

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.760
like this guy can replace that guy

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.000
and eventually the electrons could start flowing

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.920
the way we are looking at this , with two atoms could kind of make that leap

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.900
right right , it could make the leap , it could go straight

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.420
so this stuff could start flowing

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.700
if this extra phosphorous electron were to move to the right

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.500
then this phosphorous would have a positive charge

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.300
and so maybe it grabs an eletron on from here and that grabs an electron from the wire  a

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.280
and so you start having current flowing

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.520
fascinating

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.360
thats one way of doping silicon to get current flowing

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.720
but there is another way

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720
and that is with something like , Boron

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.500
let's get another lattice here

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.480
alright so let me go back to the periodic table

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.480
you just said boron

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.620
so boron has an atomic number - let me go back and pick another color , purple for boron

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.620
so boron has an atomic number of 5

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.180
but it has 3 valence electrons

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.200
it has 3 electrons in his outermost shell

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.260
so boron's valence electrons may look like that depending on the convention you use

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.320
so let's dope  this silicon lattice with a little bit of boron

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.340
so the ones that are not labeled , lets assume they are silicon

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.340
but i'll throw a couple of borons here

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.340
so this is a boron

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.560
the boron would have 3 valence electrons

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.360
let me get rid of this one 'cause that one would've only been there if it was a silicon

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:33.780
so let me change the color-im actually getting rid of this one

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.440
because boron only has 3 valence electrons its not able to fomr this fourth covalent bond

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.140
let me do a couple more borons

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:50.780
so maybe this is a boron right over here and it has 3 valence electrons

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.780
and so it wasnt able to form this fourth covalent bond

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.900
and so it almost feels like there is a hole here

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.900
yeah , and thats actually how its called

00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.960
its a hole

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.960
that should go into "naming things"

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.360
very creative

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.640
sorry , yeah so this is called "holes"

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.520
those are called holes

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.040
they are places where an electron would want to be in a normal silicon crystal

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.220
but there isnt one there because we've introduced this boron impurity

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.840
i see, and i think i see were this is going becau-you know just having this extra valence electron

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840
introduce a kind of inbalance

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.400
and allow electrons to flow

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.540
it made it a little bit less stable

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.080
eyup

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.600
this is also a bit of an unbalance

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.780
a little less stable , yeah

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.780
so let'ss hook a battery up to it

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.780
yeah let's put a battery on this

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.220
and we get-so this is a positive , this is the negative

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600
so let's see , if this is a positive-this is a positive

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
so electrons would want to go here

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200
electrons are going to be atracted to the positive terminal

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.240
but in this case maybe we dont have a lot of free electrons

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.240
we actually have more holes than electrons

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.880
we have more holes than electrons so what can happen

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.280
is that the electrons that are coming from the negative terminal

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.500
they could , you know , they could make their way

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.660
or , you know , they could make a chain

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.720
but eventually these electrons can fill this hole

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.720
yes , a nearby hole , and then maybe

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.440
, you know , the hole will kind of transition to the - you know , one way to think about it

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.040
is if this electron here

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.880
fills this hole

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.460
then you have a hole here

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.560
yeah , just like the electrons can wonder around when we had the phosphorous over at the left

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.700
the holes are kind of free to wonder around a bit

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.680
right , those kind of give a place for the electrons to jump to

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.760
exactly , yeah so electron coming out of the negative terminal of the battery

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.700
are going to find a nearby hole

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.700
and when they do that , then the boron

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.660
, you know , where that hole is filled is going to be a little more positivelly charged

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.100
a little bit more negativelly charged

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.500
so then , a hole is gonna want to free-up

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.500
so other electron can move

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.360
so what will eventually happen is that , just how we depicted

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.340
this electron could go there and then a hole would be here

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.460
and then , maybe that electron could get to the wire over here

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.780
and then the electrons would move to the right

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.780
the electrons would move to the right across the wire

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.340
and form a current

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.360
while the holes kind of move to the left

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.600
and we kind of see the holes as a positive thing

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.980
even though its a "non-thing"

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:23.500
yeah we like to think of the holes as moving even though its an absense of something

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.040
but yeah we think of the holes as moving

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.680
so , in both of these cases  , in one case we have electrons moving and in the other case

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.220
we have holes moving

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.860
we have a term for this

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.860
they are called "charge carriers"

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.860
so either the electrons or the holes are both considered charge carriers

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.740
becuase they allow a charge to be carried  through this material

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.351
right , they both create a kind of an unbalance

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.500
the phosphorous creates extra electrons

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.500
this creates holes that can be filled by other electrons

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500
and then the holes can keep moving

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.020
so in the case of the left we call this N-tipe material

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.560
that makes sense , im guessing N is for negative carrier

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.500
yeah because the electrons are negative

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.680
and then the boron dope thing on the right we call P-type

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.780
and these are the two types of silicon that we use in semi-conductors

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.900
fascinating , i think that i can already see where this can go
