is that to move
 

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.240
is that to move
to the next level that we will have to

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.250
to the next level that we will have to
 

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.500
to the next level that we will have to
shift the focus away from from being

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.510
shift the focus away from from being
 

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.270
shift the focus away from from being
overly infrastructure support focus to

focus on innovation coming out of our
universities the difficulty in that is

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140
universities the difficulty in that is
 

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.300
universities the difficulty in that is
is that we don't have the resources to

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:29.310
is that we don't have the resources to
 

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.630
is that we don't have the resources to
do that by ourselves and once again we

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640
do that by ourselves and once again we
 

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.590
do that by ourselves and once again we
have to return to to our public partners

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600

professor Eisenberg then also looks at

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.100
professor Eisenberg then also looks at
 

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.010
professor Eisenberg then also looks at
defining these high growth potential

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.020
defining these high growth potential
 

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.140
defining these high growth potential
businesses and saying that these are

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:12.150

these are companies with products and
services that has a potential high

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100
services that has a potential high
 

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.210
services that has a potential high
market acceptance they have large

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220
market acceptance they have large
 

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.670
market acceptance they have large
potential markets they have good

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680
potential markets they have good

a small organization through hate to
contribute these then run about 30

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:39.900
contribute these then run about 30
 

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.410
contribute these then run about 30
businesses per annum that cape town with

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.420
businesses per annum that cape town with
 

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.530
businesses per annum that cape town with
its three million population need to

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540
its three million population need to
 

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.870
its three million population need to
create and the answer to that is very

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880
create and the answer to that is very
 

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.420
create and the answer to that is very
simple is that we need to be we need to

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.430
simple is that we need to be we need to
 

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.210
simple is that we need to be we need to
rid ourselves of our dependency on our

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220
rid ourselves of our dependency on our
 

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.150
rid ourselves of our dependency on our
on our rental model so we need to be

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
on our rental model so we need to be
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.400
on our rental model so we need to be
freed up from that and therefore we need

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:58.410
freed up from that and therefore we need
 

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.220
freed up from that and therefore we need
resources and the easiest resource to do

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.230
resources and the easiest resource to do
 

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.490
resources and the easiest resource to do
that is to have our own facility at this

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500
that is to have our own facility at this
 

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.340
that is to have our own facility at this
stage we rent our premises from from a

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.350
stage we rent our premises from from a
 

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.770
stage we rent our premises from from a
commercial landlord and if we could rid

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:09.780
commercial landlord and if we could rid
 

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.260
commercial landlord and if we could rid
ourselves of that model we could

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:12.270
ourselves of that model we could
 

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.689
ourselves of that model we could
contribute much more

00:13:13.689 --> 00:13:13.699
contribute much more
 

00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:15.489
contribute much more
to the develop of entrepreneurship and

and within the region so the issues that
 

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:22.900
and within the region so the issues that
we currently looking at is how do we

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:22.910
we currently looking at is how do we
 

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.929
we currently looking at is how do we
then with our public partners we do have

00:13:27.929 --> 00:13:27.939
then with our public partners we do have
 

00:13:27.939 --> 00:13:31.989
then with our public partners we do have
a huge property portfolios available

00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:31.999
a huge property portfolios available
 

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:35.349
a huge property portfolios available
some of which is underutilized

00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:35.359
some of which is underutilized
 

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.069
some of which is underutilized
completely at this stage and how do we

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079
completely at this stage and how do we
 

00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:40.840
completely at this stage and how do we
unlock the political wall and the

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:40.850
unlock the political wall and the
 

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.109
unlock the political wall and the
political goodwill to help us then

00:13:44.109 --> 00:13:44.119
political goodwill to help us then
 

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:47.470
political goodwill to help us then
proceed further in creating a great city
