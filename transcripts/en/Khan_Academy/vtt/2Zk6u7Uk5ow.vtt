00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:01.935
- [Voiceover] What I want
to do in this video is

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:06.893
think about what it means to
have an opposite of a number.

00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:10.063
Let me draw a number line here.

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:12.660
Let's draw a number line.

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:15.239
And let's put some numbers
on this number line.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.422
We can start at zero,

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.778
and if we go to the right
we have positive numbers.

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:24.778
One, two, three, four, five.

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.138
As we go to the left we
get more and more negative.

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:33.094
So negative one, negative
two, negative three,

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:37.097
negative four, and I can
keep going on and on and on.

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:39.560
Let's pick one of these numbers.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.694
Let's say that we pick the number three.

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:47.141
What is going to be the
opposite of the number three?

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.822
Well the opposite of the
number is a number that's

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:54.964
the same distance from
zero but on the other side.

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:57.995
So three is three to the right of zero.

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.015
One, two, three.

00:01:00.015 --> 00:01:02.535
So its opposite is going to
be three to the left of zero.

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.682
One, two, three.

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:10.081
So the opposite of
three is negative three.

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.880
Let me make a little table here.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.082
If we have the number, the number.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.520
And then we have its opposite.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.655
We have its opposite.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:25.448
So we just figured out that
if you have the number three,

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:30.093
its opposite is going
to be negative three.

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.484
Now what if your number is negative?

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:37.267
What if your number, let's
say the number negative four.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.744
What's the opposite of that?

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:40.287
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.342
and try to think about it on your own.

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:45.489
Well, you say, okay, negative
four is right over here.

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:46.928
That's negative four.

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:48.623
It is four to the left of zero.

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:52.465
One, two, three, four to the left of zero.

00:01:52.465 --> 00:01:55.763
So its opposite is going to
be four to the right of it.

00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:59.142
So one, two, three, four.

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:01.429
It's going to be positive.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.565
It's going to be positive four.

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:06.362
So you're probably starting
to see a pattern here.

00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:10.250
The opposite of a number is going to be

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.048
the opposite sign of that number.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:15.894
If you have a positive three here,

00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:17.960
its opposite is going
to be negative three.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.620
If you start with negative four,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.580
its opposite is going to be positive four.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.274
One way to think about
it, it's going to have the

00:02:25.274 --> 00:02:29.233
same absolute value but
have a different sign.

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.951
Or another way to think about it is,

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.412
however if this is three
to the right of zero,

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:36.034
its opposite is going to be
three to the left of zero.

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:38.775
Or if the number is four
to the left of zero,

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:42.791
its opposite is going to be
four to the right of zero.

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:44.973
So we'll do one last one.

00:02:44.973 --> 00:02:47.816
What is the opposite of...

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.647
What's going to be the opposite of one?

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.167
Well one is one to the right of zero,

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.848
so its opposite is going to
be one to the left of zero,

00:02:57.848 --> 00:02:59.229
or negative one.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.912
Or another way to think
about it, one is positive

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:04.431
so its opposite is where you're
going to change the sign.

00:03:04.431 --> 00:03:06.277
Instead of being positive
it's going to be negative.

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:08.332
It's going to be negative one.

00:03:08.332 --> 00:03:10.709
Either way that you can think about it.
