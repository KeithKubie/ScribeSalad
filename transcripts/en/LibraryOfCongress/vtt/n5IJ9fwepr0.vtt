00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.573
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.640
&gt;&gt; Hello. Welcome.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.683
My name is Kate Julian
and I'm the deputy editor

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.016
of the Sunday Outlook section
at the Washington Post.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.430
The Post is a very
proud charter sponsor

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.363
of the festival again this year.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.373
Before we get started
I want to remind you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.296
that the pavilions presentations
are being filmed for the Library

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.616
of Congress' website
and for their archives.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.256
Please be mindful of this as
you enjoy the presentation.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.720
In addition please do not sit on
the camera risers that are located

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.286
in the back of the pavilion.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.420
Thanks. It's my great pleasure

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.636
to be introducing National Book
award winner M.T. Anderson.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.273
M.T. Anderson was born and
grew up in Stow, Massachusetts

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.276
but he spent a couple of years
as a young child in Italy

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.443
where he was fascinated by the roman
ruins he saw dotting the landscape.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.723
When he returned to kindergarten

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.553
in the United States his teacher
was confused by his style of playing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.426
with blocks, which involved stacking
blocks in big jumbled piles.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.436
As he patiently explained to
her, he was building ruins.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.556
He says that's what he's
been doing ever since.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.416
[Laughter] If Anderson's
writings are ruins,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.283
they are magnificent ones.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.260
He has published everything from
picture books to children's novels

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.973
to books for young adults.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240
Excuse me.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.303
His short stories for
adults have been published

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.640
in such literary journals
as Northwest Review,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.380
the Colorado Review
and Conjunctions.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.426
He also moves seemingly
effortlessly from genre to genre

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.960
from vampire novels to
biographies of classical composers,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.286
from science fiction to satire.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.363
Whatever he is writing he combines a
focus on big ideas with a sharp ear

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.013
for dialog and a wicked
sense of humor.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.200
As he has said, "I
love being an author.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.430
There is nothing like realizing
that all one has to for the rest

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.330
of the day is sit around
making up jokes

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.453
that will entertain
me and a 10 year old."

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.386
[Laughter] His satirical 2002
young adult novel Feed Imagines not

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.860
so improbably a future in which may
people have a device called a feed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.260
implanted in their brains
thereby enabling a kind

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.806
of wireless instant message.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.606
Feed was a finalist for
the National Book Award

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.340
and the New York Times
heralded it as proof

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.360
that young adult novels are alive
and well and able to deliver a jolt.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.093
And then there is Octavian
Nothing the first volume

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.590
of which won the National
Book Award.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.930
A profile of Anderson

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.300
in the Washington Post two years
ago described Octavian Nothing as,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.426
"An ultra-challenging
two-volume young adult novel

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.520
that runs 900 plus pages
and asks teen readers

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.616
to contemplate the
American Revolution

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.750
from a wildly unfamiliar
point of view."

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.570
I should add that it's written
in 18th century English.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.750
Anderson's books expect a lot of
their readers there is no doubt

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.756
but as he remarked in the same Post
profile, "It's insulting to believe

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.280
that teens should have a different
kind of book than an adult should."

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.940
His most recent book, The Suburb
beyond the Stars is a sequel

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.513
to 2004's The Game of Sunken Stars.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.253
Please join me in welcoming
M.T. Anderson.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.780
[Applause]

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.996
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Thank you.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.196
It's great to see you all here.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.863
It's wonderful especially
given this heat.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.596
You know I come from the wilds of
Vermont at this point and you know

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.330
up there it's sort of 45 degrees.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.930
To come down here and
have a few extra days

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.663
of summer is both a
blessing and curse,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.183
but with this jacket
on mainly a curse.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.743
Anyway thank you for coming out.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.276
Today what I'm going to talk
about is writing and travel

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.550
and leaving home and returning
home and specifically the suburbs

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.563
and The Suburb beyond the Stars.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.626
And I should begin to say --

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.233
by saying that I grew up in
a small town in Massachusetts

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.113
and it was a very standard town.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.926
You know we had our little
brick library with a turret sort

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.526
of from the Carnegie era.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.753
We had our little you know white
churches with the steeples.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.433
We had our haunted house and you
know our apple orchard our bad girl,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.396
sort of all these things in
a standard American town.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.426
And it was noted only to be
intensely normal and dull

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.313
in America, which was
in fact how I liked it.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.380
And we were all proud of that.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.180
Even the bullies in my town
were perfect American bullies.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.273
Like they stuck with the
classics you now what I mean?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.810
Like the swishy, the
swirley, the monkey bite.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.006
You know all the things that
really you know have continued

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.400
through the generations
to torment nerds like me.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.016
So you know perhaps
because my town was in fact

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.240
so resolutely American I
very early took an interest

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.756
in the idea of traveling.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.743
When I went to that little red
brick library I read a lot of books

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.440
that were about travel to the
most exotic places possible.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.056
So I loved all those books like --

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.323
you know those old books
of adventure from the turn

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.913
of the century where sort
of English people wearing

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.240
in fact far heavier jackets than
the one I'm wearing now traipse

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.120
through the desert or go
up through the Himalayas

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.643
and then are standing there next
to this sort of treasure trove

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.730
of you know ancient
Tibetan artifacts

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.500
that they have just arrested
out of the hands of the monks

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.600
or whatever it is that
they're going to take back

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.466
to England and put in a museum.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.486
I loved all of those sort of insane
books heading off into the wild.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.293
And of course all those books of
travel that are entirely fantastical

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.466
like Conan the Barbarian.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.450
I don't know if anyone actually
still reads Conan the Barbarian.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.283
But you now he travels
around the early earth

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.366
as it is depicted despite the fact

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.763
that Conan the Barbarian's
author lived in Texas and claimed

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.030
that the whole thing was supposed
to be somehow a portrait of Texas

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.470
that just happened to include
yeah, giant, brawny barbarians,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.153
giant snake gods, demons, you know.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.580
Although maybe actually -- I
haven't been to Texas so maybe some

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.893
of you are from there I don't know.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.000
[Laughter] So what
thrilled me in all

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.926
of these books are not just the
specific moments of adventure.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.800
You know the fumbling mummies,
the lassoed pterodactyls

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.440
but also the vast untamed landscape.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.543
In my little safe, suburban
house I dreamed of a world

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.456
of howling wilderness
and secret valleys.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.333
I hoped that there were
still places to discover --

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.973
places like that to discover on
the earth and I hoped even more

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.640
that there were still places
that remained undiscovered

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.986
and unplundered until
the end of time.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.370
And part of the pleasure of
these books was not just the plot

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.116
but the mood of place.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.893
The sense of this expansive
landscape of adventure,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.206
that's what I loved, the
romance of geography itself.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.393
So I always assumed that when I
grew older I would be traveling

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.280
around the world and writing
books of exotic adventure.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.993
As it turned out however there
were two little problems with that.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.240
So problem number one is
that it appears that people

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.053
in other countries speak
different languages.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.473
[Laughter] It's very irritating
for those of us who speak English.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.600
And we are trying to rectify
it in all kinds of ways

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.966
but we still haven't ironed it out

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.100
and I'm horrible at
languages myself.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.050
So when I travel it's
a real problem.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.816
I mean I can think a very basic
German so in a pinch if I need

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.980
to order like a bombing raid on
the Netherlands or something,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.440
but basically I -- you know
I'm really bad at languages

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.786
and I've been trying for about
20 years to learn French.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.180
But unfortunately it's,
I don't know, no dice.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.390
Pada dice.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.256
Something always goes wrong.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.923
In fact one summer
a girlfriend of mine

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.736
and I decided we would
both learn French.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.776
And she learned all these mamby
pamby sentences like you know,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:57.996
"Which way to the bus station" and
"How much for a pitcher of milk?"

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.743
Well I decided I was going
to learn French entirely

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.973
from French baroque opera.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.353
[Laughter] Which for one thing means
I actually don't know any French

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920
at all.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.720
But also it means that
the conversation has

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.890
to reach a certain kind of pitch
before I can join in [Laughter]

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.166
because all the phrases
I know are things like,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.333
"I fear his terrible vengeance."

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.506
And "Fatal love.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:24.860
Drink this scorpions venom
and be forever silenced."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.643
Yeah sure, I can say that
in French if you need me to.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.316
"It is your own children's
bodies I hurl before you."

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:35.950
That I can say.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.213
You know I'm right there if that's
where the conversation goes.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.053
[Laughter] But, yeah it never
really works out for me.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.366
You know we learned French
to go to France and it turned

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.273
out we bought the tickets.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.340
We didn't get them in the mail
though and we ordered them,

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.406
this is before the internet.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.456
And we didn't get them in the mail
and we finally went to the office

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.483
and it turned out there was an empty
office with a guy like the AT&amp;T guy

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.110
like closing off the
two phone lines.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.990
And the owners of this travel agency
had actually fled to the middle east

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.523
with our money and everyone else's.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.923
So we didn't go to France.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.123
We went to Canada instead which
is America's France I guess.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.433
Well any we went to Quebec, Quebec
City and that kind of thing.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.640
We were traveling around on the
Gas Bay Peninsula, which is a very,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.126
very beautiful area up there

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.696
where in fact most people
do not speak English.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.643
They do only speak French.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.833
And this was a good example
of how terrible my French is.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.053
So we're up there wandering
through this beautiful,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.653
beautiful provincial park up
there and we came to this place

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.280
where all the grass was crushed down

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.146
and clearly several large deer
had been sleeping there overnight.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.736
It was really kind
of an idyllic scene

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.560
and we're walking along the path
away from there and this guy comes

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.466
up and asks me in French,
"What's up the path."

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.023
So I think, well I'm going to
try and tell him in French.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.496
So what I wanted to say to him
was, "Over there there's a spot

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.000
where some large deer
were sleeping."

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.060
So now of course I couldn't
remember the word for deer.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:07.543
I remembered only that it was
cognate with the Latin word

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.843
for deer, which is cervus.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.976
The word I was actually
looking for is cerf.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.910
I was thinking that
the word must be cervo.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:19.646
Well anyone who knows French knows

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.023
that the word cervo
means not deer but brain.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.070
So what I said to him in the end
was not "Over there there's a spot

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.356
where some large deer were
sleeping" but "That is the place

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.670
where the giant brain sleeps."

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.670


00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.870
[Laughter] So he looked at me
in incomprehension and disgust.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.226
I realized that, "Damn, I had once
again failed to learn French."

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.180
So I just said to him, "It is your
own children whose bodies I hurl

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.540
before you."

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.806
And I stomped off into the forest.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.893
So he wandered off thinking
[Speaking in a foreign language]

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.736
until he went around the corner
and found himself face to face

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.136
with the giant tentacles
and massive single eye

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:04.766
of the disembodied brain,
waked from it's slumber.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.480
So that happens to me every time
I try to speak a foreign language.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.506
Like why did I have to discover
that in Napoli the word [Speaking

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.483
in a foreign language]
means bring me some chicken.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.300
The word [Speaking in a foreign
language] means bring me some

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.320
dog meat.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.453
Why do they have to be so close?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.996
And this brings to my second
point, the reason I found it hard

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.730
to travel as much as I wanted to.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.623
I am drab and fussy eater.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.150
I have a lot of good allergies, I'm
hypoglycemic and that means I need

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.143
to eat a huge amount of protein
to actually keep myself running

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.193
and that's a huge problem
when you're traveling.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.773
I mean it really does not take
me much to make me hungry.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.220
If I were the Donner party I
would have actually suggested

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.200
that we started eating the
people before we even set

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.280
out from Illinois.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.436
So one time I was in this
little ex kingdom of Sikkim

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.790
which is up in the Himalayans.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.190
And I had cleverly
chosen to go there

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.200
when the Avian bird flu
was raging which meant

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.983
that there was actually an
interdiction on all chicken --

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.033
on the serving of chicken
and all other animals there.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.206
Now never mind that you can't
actually catch Avian bird flu

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.820
from cooked chicken and never mind
the live chickens are walking right

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.686
through the level of restaurants
with their little brood

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.523
of chicks following right behind
them in a row, proudly heading

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.336
to table seven if having a
family night out you know.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.853
It's the 12 top or
whatever with the chickens

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.513
but anyway there was
no chicken to be had.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.540
I was in this town which was
called perhaps fittingly Yuksom,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.813
which was on the edge of the
howling Himalayan wilderness

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.186
that contains Kangchenjunga.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.400
So I went to this restaurant
and the guy said,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.553
"Oh we have one frozen chicken
from before the interdiction.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.880
You can have that.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.013
Would you like that?

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.346
And I was like, "Yeah,
I would like that.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.946
I would like that."

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.813
Because you know I'm
falling apart with protein.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.146
So I beg for this chicken
and he says,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:04.813
"I'll bring you chicken pieces."

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.146
And I said, "Yeah, chicken
pieces, yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.213
So he goes and I wait and I
wait and I wait and I wait

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.346
and finally he brings
it out and it's not

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.813
like chicken pulled off
the bone like in a curry

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.443
and it's not chicken pieces like
thighs or drumsticks and breasts.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.246
What he'd done is he'd taken this
precious chicken, the last chicken

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.453
in Sikkim and he diced it.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:22.910
He cubed it precisely and every
morsel was like a little cube

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.543
of like bone and tendon
and meat all in --

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.446
with sort of a few scraps of skin
with covered with chili powder.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.093
But you know like who
cared, I was desperate.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.306
I picked it up and began to
gnaw on the bones like this.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.383
So I'm gnawing on the chicken
trying to tear the meat off

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.736
and meanwhile there are these
stray cats on the dining room table

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.913
that are walking towards me
trying to get the chicken.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.320
And these are mangy stray cats

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.140
with big bald patches
and bumps all over them.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:55.766
They're slinking along towards me.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.233
I'm sitting there trying
to keep them away

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.866
with my elbow while eating these
things and then they're hair starts

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.333
to fly all over the place.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.200
It's getting caught
in the chili powder.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.533
I'm eating their hair,
pushing them backwards

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.066
and then one grabs
a piece of chicken.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
And the thing is that cats can
choke on cooked chicken bones.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.703
It's very dangerous and even
though they were strays I couldn't

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.630
have that.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.030
So I'm taking the chicken
out of the cats mouth then

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.060
with my same hand shoving
it in my mouth

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.740
and I just thought there's no
way I'm coming out of his alive

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.480
without some insane feline
disease which is going

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:26.870
to be very hard to
explain to my doctor.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.276
So it was at his moment that
I decided that there has go

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.570
to be a better way to do this.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:34.696
There has got to be a way to travel
the world, experience the thrill

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.503
of travel some place where I can
still Chipwiches and Captain Crunch.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.800
[Laughter] So I decided I would
focus on novels of adventure,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.803
exotic adventure which
would allow me then

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:54.016
to experience these
fantastical vistas

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.470
in the safety of my own living room.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.803
I would travel in my mind.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:00.200
Explore new realms
from my office chair.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.273
Emily Dickenson says,
"There is no frigate

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.873
like a book to take us lands away."

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.450
So I could remain chained to home
and hearth and still arrange widely.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.043
I could stay in my own home and
still dream of traveling in places

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.923
like Vermont and Delaware.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.556
So that is in fact what my
recent books have been about.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.970
And I should say that the idea

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:24.806
of literary traveling is beautifully
summed up by T.S. Elliot.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.366
He writes this in this
poem, Little Gidding.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.060
"We shall not cease
from exploration.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.883
In the end of all our exploring
will to arrive where we started

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.633
and know the place
for the first time."

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.240
And I love that idea that writing
takes you away from a place you know

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:44.453
so that when you come back to
what you know it's unfamiliar.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.413
So in the case of this book
that I'm hocking today,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.363
which I'm sure is available
at a nearby bookseller,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.636
The Suburb Beyond the Stars,
the idea was the first book

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.496
in that series -- it's the
second book of that series

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.430
that will contain four books in all,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.030
the first one is actually
called The Suburb --

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.326
I'm sorry the first one is
called The Game of Sunken Places

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.226
and it was written about
kind of magical events

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.840
that take place in Vermont.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.473
Because when I was a kid that's
where we would vacation in Vermont

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.926
and vacationing there, reading
adventure books while I was there,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:18.666
somehow that amazing
Vermont landscape

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.046
with all those beautiful
mountains it looked so mysterious.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:23.900
It looks like you could
get lost forever

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.033
and no one would ever
be able to find you.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:27.743
That in my mind became
like grafted on to all

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.616
of the adventures I was
reading while I was there.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.336
So I thought what I could
do is I will write a series

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.026
of adventure books that
take place in this sort

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.286
of transformed magical Vermont.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.366
So The Game of Sunken Places
was the first one of those.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.496
The second one which has just come

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.063
out is called the Suburb Beyond
the Stars and it's a continuation.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.263
It's a kind of a sort of
horror novel set in a suburb,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.650
because I grew up in a suburb.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.250
I know the suburbs well.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.196
In some ways I thought
to myself it's not scary

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.703
to have a horror novel.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.446
I mean its light horror but
it's not scary to have that set

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.093
in a Victorian house because
that doesn't do the thing

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.670
that T. S. Eliot is
talking about in a way.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:11.780
A Victorian house no longer takes
you away from yourself in a sense

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.433
because very few of us live
in Victorian houses you know.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.273
And we're prepared when we see a
Victorian novel in a house we think,

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:22.943
"Oh when are the chains
going to start clinking.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.910
When is the headless
nun going to come by?"

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.886
If she doesn't come out we like
yell down the hall for her,

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.426
"Headless nun", you know?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.293
Incidentally, this isn't entirely
relevant to my talk but like ghosts

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.760
that appear at the exact time
when they're murdered to they have

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.640
to like readjust for
daylight savings time?

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.936
[Laughter] Just a question
do you know what I mean

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:46.736
or they late for half the year?

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.670
I don't know.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.870
Anyway so I thought to myself if
I do this novel set in a suburb

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:56.730
which is a place I know, it
will actually feel stranger

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.830
because the unknown, the mysterious,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.850
the supernatural will
be taking place

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.213
in a setting that is very familiar.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.060
It will defamiliarize
the familiar and I think

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.490
that will be a more powerful effect.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.983
So this book is in fact set in
a suburb very much like the ones

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.016
that were being built around me

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.216
when I was a kid except I've update
the architecture a little bit

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.216
to make it you know the
architecture of the 2000's

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.616
as opposed to the 1980's.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.226
So they are more like palladium
windows for those of you

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.006
who are connoisseurs of the
architecture of the suburbs.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.366
And in fact, the other
book that I have come

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.690
out with recently is called Jasper
Dash and the Flame Bits of Delaware

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.373
which was a transformation
of the state of Delaware

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.006
into something even more
exciting than it already is.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.733
And so if you look at my website

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.583
which is mtanderson.com
you can find actually --

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.550
I have like an interactive
map of the state of Delaware

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.536
as a fantasy map that will tell
you completely untrue facts

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.656
about the state.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.323
Though I found I visited it
just the other day and I have

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.656
to say nothing could be weirder

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.003
than the actual experience
of going there.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.516
I met the governor who had
written me a very tart letter

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.310
about a few inaccuracies in my book.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.830
So it's the only time a state
governor has actually called

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.310
me Buster.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.086
[Laughter] But anyway -- that letter
is actually reproduced in the back

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.800
of the paperback version

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.600
of this book Jasper Dash
the Flame Bits of Delaware.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.666
So I went to meet him.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.866
He was tremendously nice.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.066
He was a very good sport and
I'm driving back from Delaware

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.800
and many call it the capital
of Delaware and on Route 1

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.163
and we're driving back late at
night and we see a helicopter going

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.436
over with a big search
light and we said,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.450
"Oh someone must have
escaped from somewhere."

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:43.800
Well just today when I
was at the Delaware table,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.300
the different state's booths
they told me that what was going

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:51.453
on was sniper was actually
firing on the cars on the highway

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.946
that I was driving on and they
were trying to find the sniper.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.413
So there was my Delaware experience

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:00.873
so actually it was
far more frightening

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.980
than the Delaware I had imagined.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.610
[Laughter] Do you know what
I mean, but that's unusual.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.676
So yeah these books in
a way are all my attempt

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.753
to reimagine the American
landscape in a fantastical way,

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.966
in a way that is kids
like so many of us do.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.613
We you know -- so many of us
see the little stream that runs

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.440
through the backyard of our house
as a mighty river or the hill nearby

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:28.573
as a mountain and make
up a kind of mythology

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.140
of the imagination
about the place we live.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:33.820
I wanted to make up
that kind of mythology.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.566
So you now when I think of
the fantasy books I loved,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.433
Robert E. Howard, the creator

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.766
of Conan the Barbarian he based
Conan's home Semaria on his realm

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:46.933
of keltic twighlight
on Fredericksburg.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.406
Little did he know the
actor slated to play Conan,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.043
the king of Aquilonia
would instead end

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.076
up playing governor of California.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.323
[Laughter] In H.P.
Lovecraft's Dream Quest

00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.843
of Unknown Kadath a many journeys
through a landscape of nightmare

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:03.416
in search of a city of dreams only

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.893
to discover what he really seeks
is an image of Beacon Hill,

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.673
Boston from his childhood
glimmering in the sunset.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.000
Ray Bradbury's Martian
Chronicles maybe set in the deserts

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.073
and the canals and broken
cities of the red planet,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.906
but what the tales record

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.373
in many ways is the tale
of American settlement.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.006
In a similar way I wonder whether
we Americans embrace the landscape

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.870
of fantasy so that we can
once again be pioneers.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.066
We can once again be faced with
vast wilderness, this time purged

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.213
for the guilt of its plunder.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.040
We drive through our own landscapes
and see towns merge sloppily

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.493
with other towns, no seam, no
distinction, no woodland at the edge

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:48.813
of the village in which
an ogre might lurk

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.993
and we past the same rotation
of Home Depot, WalMart, T.G.I.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.380
Friday's and Ruby Tuesday's
and we long for a map

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.576
where one town is made of brass
and another of fluted pillars.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.180
In that land the forests
are huge again.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:05.606
The mountains are full of mystery.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.286
We may continue to expand and these
kingdoms will never be exhausted

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.926
of their riches.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.240
Our opacity need never be satisfied.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.133
Though we've sloshed already
from shore to shining shore,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:18.596
we seek now this soothing manifest
destiny of dreams and we light

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.456
for new territories unexplored.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480
Thank you.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.880
[Applause] Thank you.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.680
Now we have time for
questions if anyone has them

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.253
or we can all just sit here really
awkwardly for about 10 minutes.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.363
Oh and there are microphones.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.433
So this gentleman right
here, driven to read.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.300
&gt;&gt; Yes I was wondering, although
you didn't talk about it,

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.550
I was wondering what inspired
you for Whales on Stilts?

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.373
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: And so he's
asking about my book Whales

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:58.366
on Stilts and what inspired me.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:00.366
And that was book for one thing

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.266
because I was writing a historical
novel set in the revolution

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.576
which was very dark and
very hard to do for me.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.900
And it involved a huge amount of
research so I wanted to go on kind

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.280
of a mental vacation and
whales on stilts was just kind

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.273
of me saying I want to have a
book that's purely joyful and fun

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.086
and the reader who reads
it will feel like they're

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.686
on summer vacation mentally.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.820
And so that really was
kind of the basic idea.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.556
I knew the characters I wanted
to have and I just had to think

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.263
of kind of struggle for them.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.383
And around that time a very tragic
thing happened which is a bunch

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.076
of whales somehow swam
on to the beach

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.493
on Cape Cod somewhat
near where I live.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.620
Though that was tragic I started
to think what would an invasion

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.700
of whales who want to take
back the land be like.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.296
I mean whales actually
did walk for a while.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.470
They got tired of it.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.856
[Laughter] Anyway that book is
actually about this invasion

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.683
of whales that storm on to the land

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.260
with laser beam eyes
to take it back.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.380
There you go.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.046
Thank you for reading it.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:03.513
&gt;&gt; Thank you for telling me why.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.913
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.380
Hi.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.780
&gt;&gt; Keeping with your points on
foreign language it feels like a lot

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.713
of your characters say in
Feed or Octavian Nothing,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.870
speak in a language that could be
foreign to the unassuming reader.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.956
And I've heard that you really
immerse yourself in order

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.283
to get the language choice
right and everything.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:24.920
Could you talk about
that a little more?

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.253
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah, sure.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.253
I do a lot of like emerging
because I feel like the language

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.986
that we speak in actually

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.386
in some ways creates the
world that we live in.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.053
You know it creates the way that we
understand it and in many creates --

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:36.386
it convinces us of what matters

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.166
and what doesn't matter,
that kind of thing.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:40.580
So I do do a huge amount of research

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:42.946
about the language
before I write a book.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.096
So for those Octavian Nothing
books set in the 18th century

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.076
for six years while I
did the research for that

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:50.566
and wrote them I basically read
only books from that period or about

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.520
that period like Latin and
Greek books that kind of thing.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.840
And that's because I wanted
to get that language right.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.393
For Feed which is a book set
in sort of an idiotic future

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.993
where everyone is a moron and as
result of having this little chip

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.720
in their head that kind of
constantly broadcasts the internet

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.036
to them, which means they
constantly are receiving you know

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.410
advertisements for everything that
they see and that kind of thing.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.996
I read a lot of slick magazines
like you know 17 and you know GQ,

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.133
Vogue and all that kind of
thing so I had that kind

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.580
of saying like, "Hey guys."

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.723
And a voice inside my
head when I wrote that.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.963
And one time I got a message on
some kind of blog or something.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.146
Someone wrote, "He always uses
the word like in his writing

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.866
and no teenager says like anymore.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:49.460
It's like he was a teenager back
in like the 80's or something."

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:54.066
[Laughter] And I said [Sound
effects] So I decided to find out

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.986
and I went down to the main
kind of student strip in Boston

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:00.903
and I just kind of walked
randomly down the street to see --

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.030
just sort of listening
to conversations,

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.216
but just sort of hearing
the words that were used.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.843
And surprising the police didn't
pick me up and I discovered

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.096
after having wondered up and
down the street a few times

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.290
that overwhelmingly
people said like.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.513
They said it so much that in fact
I felt worried about using the word

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.486
like in the normal context
by the end of the evening.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.033
So yeah, that kind of research
is stuff that I have done.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.436
Yeah. Back on this side sir?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.933
&gt;&gt; What gave you the
idea for Jasper Dash?

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:36.663
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: So
this is a question

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.923
about Jasper Dash who's a character
from my pals and perils series

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:40.743
that includes both Whales
on Stilts and Jasper Dash

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:43.996
and the Flame Pits of Delaware.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.730
And he is a kid who is from a
kind of early adventure book

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:51.753
like Tom Swift or something
and he believes in sort

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.140
of exciting inventions
and he is going to sort

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.226
of you know make the world a safer
democracy and that kind of thing.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.483
The problem is his inventions
are all like the inventions

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.890
from an old adventure book.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.490
So he's like, "I have invented a
phone for which you need no wires.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.676
And it's small enough you can carry
it around with you on this cart.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:14.430
"And you now the problem
with that is

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.536
of course the world has really
moved past the future of the past.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.790
And I just loved whose
books when I was a kid.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.613
I loved the idea of reading
children's adventure books

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.120
which people hadn't read for
years and feeling like, "Wow,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.613
my dad might have read this."

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.093
So that was kind of the idea for
that kind of reading those old books

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.673
and wanting to revive that
character and think what would it be

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:34.183
like for him to be
in the modern world?

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.713
But thank you for reading and
for asking the question, yeah.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.160
Yes.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.760
&gt;&gt; I love writing science
fiction books.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.760
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Great.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.626
You love writing them?

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.493
&gt;&gt; Well I mean like in class for --

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.093
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah great.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.093
&gt;&gt; The teachers always tell me
that you can't write anything

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.560
that you don't know with experience.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.893
Like I told them what
about Lord of Rings,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.360
we don't have experience on that.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.560
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah
exactly, yeah.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.693
&gt;&gt; Would you have any
thoughts on that?

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:03.893
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah
I mean I don't know

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:05.560
if J.R. Tolkin had hairy feet or not

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.360
but no I mean I think [Laughter]
well here's how I would put it.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.093
You might be writing about
something you know but in a very,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.160
very unfamiliar alien context.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.693
So, for example a lot of people have
argued that Lord of the Rings is

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.760
in some ways about you know
the World War I for example

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:20.206
and the sense of loss during that.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.720
And when you are thinking about
science fiction the things

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.386
that move you might in fact
be very familiar to you even

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:28.970
if they are happened
on worlds far away.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:30.666
It's the internal truth,
not the external truth

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.433
that you have to really know.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.253
And I think that's
about the time we have.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.320
So thank you all very much.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520


00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.150
[Applause] Thanks.
