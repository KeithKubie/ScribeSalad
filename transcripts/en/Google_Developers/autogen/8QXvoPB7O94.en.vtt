the added it to the spec this is the
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.170
the added it to the spec this is the
parsing spec you know start tag name

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180
parsing spec you know start tag name

image change the token to IMG and

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250
image change the token to IMG and
 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.390
image change the token to IMG and

recently alexey 10 came up with this

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760
recently alexey 10 came up with this
 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.640
recently alexey 10 came up with this
which i really liked you would use this

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650
which i really liked you would use this
 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.920
which i really liked you would use this
in place of your image elements and what

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930
in place of your image elements and what
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.470
in place of your image elements and what
it does is it loads an SVG for browsers

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480
it does is it loads an SVG for browsers
 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.260
it does is it loads an SVG for browsers
that support SVG and it loads up

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270
that support SVG and it loads up
 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.510
that support SVG and it loads up
ng for browsers that don't so the way a

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520

modern browser would posit is it sees

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110
modern browser would posit is it sees
 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.230
modern browser would posit is it sees
SVG and it goes okay it's got weight and

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240
SVG and it goes okay it's got weight and
 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.120
SVG and it goes okay it's got weight and
height one hundred percent over 100

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130
height one hundred percent over 100
 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.300
height one hundred percent over 100
pixels and it sees this and this is a it

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310
pixels and it sees this and this is a it
 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.040
pixels and it sees this and this is a it
sees this as an SVG image element

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050
sees this as an SVG image element
 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.720
sees this as an SVG image element
because in SVG images are spelled out

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730
because in SVG images are spelled out
 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.510
because in SVG images are spelled out
full rather than IMG it's got a width

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520
full rather than IMG it's got a width
 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.010
full rather than IMG it's got a width
and a height and I'm going to load this

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
and a height and I'm going to load this
 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.660
and a height and I'm going to load this
because this is how you define the

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670
because this is how you define the
 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.030
because this is how you define the
source of an image in in SVG because you

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040
source of an image in in SVG because you
 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.950
source of an image in in SVG because you
know why have links when you can have X

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960
know why have links when you can have X
 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.910
know why have links when you can have X
links so and then it sees this and that

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920
links so and then it sees this and that
 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.890
links so and then it sees this and that
doesn't mean anything to SVG images so

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900
doesn't mean anything to SVG images so
 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.630
doesn't mean anything to SVG images so
it's ignored so we're now showing the

it's ignored so we're now showing the
 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.660
it's ignored so we're now showing the
SVG image and all the browser such as

SVG image and all the browser such as
 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.550

Android to or IE 8 and below they will

Android to or IE 8 and below they will
 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.160
Android to or IE 8 and below they will
pass it like this no idea what that is

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.170
pass it like this no idea what that is
 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.810
pass it like this no idea what that is
i'm going to ignore him or treat it like

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820
i'm going to ignore him or treat it like
 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.000
i'm going to ignore him or treat it like
an unknown element oh look the developer

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010
an unknown element oh look the developer
 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.740
an unknown element oh look the developer
has spelled image wrong it's okay i'm

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:34.750
has spelled image wrong it's okay i'm
 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.780
has spelled image wrong it's okay i'm
going to correct it for them it's 100 by

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790
going to correct it for them it's 100 by
 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.740
going to correct it for them it's 100 by
100 no idea what that means i'll ignore

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750
100 no idea what that means i'll ignore
 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.900
100 no idea what that means i'll ignore
that and then oh there's the source of

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910
that and then oh there's the source of
 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.800
that and then oh there's the source of
the image you're going to download the

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:43.810
the image you're going to download the
 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.320
the image you're going to download the
PNG so it's kind of nice because it

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330
PNG so it's kind of nice because it
 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.670
PNG so it's kind of nice because it
doesn't require javascript and it's a

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680
doesn't require javascript and it's a
 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.320
doesn't require javascript and it's a
nice way to conditionally load the you

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330
nice way to conditionally load the you
 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.400
nice way to conditionally load the you
know the kind of file at the browser

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.410
know the kind of file at the browser
 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.380
know the kind of file at the browser
supports we got quite excited about it

supports we got quite excited about it
 

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.420
supports we got quite excited about it
and we were tweeting about it the

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430
and we were tweeting about it the
 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.880
and we were tweeting about it the
mistake we made is we did not test it so

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.890
mistake we made is we did not test it so
 

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.410
mistake we made is we did not test it so
a few of us did just that and we found

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.420
a few of us did just that and we found
 

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.350
a few of us did just that and we found
out something interesting all of these

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360
out something interesting all of these
 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.440
out something interesting all of these
browsers support SVG but which browsers

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.450
browsers support SVG but which browsers

all of them get it wrong is just one or

all of them get it wrong is just one or
 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.750
all of them get it wrong is just one or
some of the browsers are going to are

some of the browsers are going to are
 

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.790
some of the browsers are going to are
going to get this wrong and they'll end

it's actually an SVG oh I'll do that

it's actually an SVG oh I'll do that
 

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.259
it's actually an SVG oh I'll do that
instead so the main parts are seized the

instead so the main parts are seized the

markup and it sees the image but it
 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.949
markup and it sees the image but it
misses the SVG context and then the main

am I am I downloading PNG it cancels
that download and goes for the SVG

that download and goes for the SVG
 

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:35.199
that download and goes for the SVG

yeah so he stopped this test and he

yeah so he stopped this test and he
would just use that as evidence so what

the answer collectively you are correct
yes all of the browser's here are going

yes all of the browser's here are going
 

00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:11.769
yes all of the browser's here are going

to download that image and this behavior
 

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.620
to download that image and this behavior
is part of the spec so in the browser in

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.630
is part of the spec so in the browser in
 

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.210
is part of the spec so in the browser in
the beginning there is nothing and then

construction steps for that element to
 

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.810
construction steps for that element to
run and for image it's really

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:31.820
run and for image it's really
 

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.210
run and for image it's really
complicated actually creating an image

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.220
complicated actually creating an image
 

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.830
complicated actually creating an image
element but step 14 down here at the

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:35.840
element but step 14 down here at the
 

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.420
element but step 14 down here at the
bottom is where it actually makes the

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:37.430
bottom is where it actually makes the
 

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.760
bottom is where it actually makes the
request and request the image so

visibility doesn't matter at all it

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.210
visibility doesn't matter at all it
 

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.580
visibility doesn't matter at all it
doesn't come into it and that's kind of

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:42.590
doesn't come into it and that's kind of
 

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.410
doesn't come into it and that's kind of
good because it means that your images

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:44.420
good because it means that your images
 

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.030
good because it means that your images
can download before your CSS is

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040

responsive images polyfills did not work
because by the time your javascript gets

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.110
because by the time your javascript gets
 

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:56.110
because by the time your javascript gets

this won't be a problem in the future
the resource priority spec we've

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880
the resource priority spec we've
 

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.180
the resource priority spec we've
specified the postpone attribute which

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.190

tells an image that it shouldn't display

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.110
tells an image that it shouldn't display
 

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.940
tells an image that it shouldn't display
if it's displaying on among other things

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:11.950
if it's displaying on among other things
 

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.800
if it's displaying on among other things
but what if we what if we are using CSS

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:14.810
but what if we what if we are using CSS
 

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.050
but what if we what if we are using CSS
what then so here we've got a div that's

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.060
what then so here we've got a div that's
 

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.640
what then so here we've got a div that's
displaying on and inside there's a div

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:18.650
displaying on and inside there's a div
 

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.130
displaying on and inside there's a div
with a background image so it's kind of

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:21.140
with a background image so it's kind of
 

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.600
with a background image so it's kind of
similar to the image one but we saw that

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.610
similar to the image one but we saw that
 

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.820
similar to the image one but we saw that
images are ignoring CSS but here we're

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:24.830
images are ignoring CSS but here we're
 

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.160
images are ignoring CSS but here we're
actually in CSS land already so are

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.170
actually in CSS land already so are
 

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.410
actually in CSS land already so are
there any browsers that are going to

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.420
there any browsers that are going to
 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.340
there any browsers that are going to
going to download that or they just

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.350
going to download that or they just
 

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.870
going to download that or they just
going to ignore it so once again it's

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880
going to ignore it so once again it's
 

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.820
going to ignore it so once again it's
not going to be displayed so you could

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:33.830
not going to be displayed so you could
 

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.400
not going to be displayed so you could

we get this recalculate style layout

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:32.900
we get this recalculate style layout
 

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.750
we get this recalculate style layout
recalculate style layup happening over

recalculate style layup happening over
 

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.460
recalculate style layup happening over
and over again and that's that's not

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:36.470
and over again and that's that's not

looking great the code we're using is

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:38.510
looking great the code we're using is
 

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.910
looking great the code we're using is
really simple we're just loop through

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:39.920
really simple we're just loop through
 

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.320
really simple we're just loop through
all of those paragraphs and set the

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:41.330
all of those paragraphs and set the
 

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.030
all of those paragraphs and set the
offset wit for the green block to the

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.040
offset wit for the green block to the
 

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.340
offset wit for the green block to the
paragraph now the first time we go

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:45.350
paragraph now the first time we go
 

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.720
paragraph now the first time we go
through this loop we ask the brows of

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.730
through this loop we ask the brows of
 

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.540
through this loop we ask the brows of
what is the size of the green box and it

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:49.550
what is the size of the green box and it
 

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.040
what is the size of the green box and it
goes oh I know I know that answer

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.050
goes oh I know I know that answer
 

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.900
goes oh I know I know that answer
because I've just drawn it here's your

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:52.910
because I've just drawn it here's your
 

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.330
because I've just drawn it here's your
answer easy peasy and then we set the

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:55.340
answer easy peasy and then we set the
 

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.950
answer easy peasy and then we set the
the whip to the paragraph but the next

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960
the whip to the paragraph but the next
 

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.450
the whip to the paragraph but the next
time we come around the loop we ask the

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:58.460
time we come around the loop we ask the
 

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.740
time we come around the loop we ask the
browser wats to wait for the green box

00:25:59.740 --> 00:25:59.750
browser wats to wait for the green box
 

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.710
browser wats to wait for the green box
it's like hmm I used to know the answer
