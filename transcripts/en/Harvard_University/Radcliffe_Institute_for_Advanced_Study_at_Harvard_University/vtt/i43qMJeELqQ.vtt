00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.854
- Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:10.270
I hope you had as interesting
a conversation in your break

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.500
as I did at mine.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.900
And we brought up a bunch of
problems in the first half.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.960
And it's up to this panel to
bring us all the solutions.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.890
My name is Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.360
I'm the Life Sciences
Director here at Radcliffe.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.060
And it's my pleasure to
introduce Zirui Song, who's

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.060
going to be our moderator.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.340
Zirui is an Assistant Professor
of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.619
Medical School, and also
an internal medicine

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.420
physician at MGH.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.570
He has worked in the US
Department of Health and Human

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.060
Services, the Center for
Social and Economic Dynamics

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.000
at the Brookings Institution,
and the Massachusetts Health

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.080
Policy Commission.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.830
And you can read his many awards
in your booklet if you like.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.480
He is very able to lead this
panel on alternative models

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.381
at state and federal levels.

00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:57.880
Thanks.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.450
- Thank you so much for
that kind introduction.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.670
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.390
Thank you all for being here.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.585
Thank you for coming back.

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:12.960
It's an honor for
me to be a part

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.750
of this distinguished panel
among all of the guests

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.120
that you will hear from shortly.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.070
My role is to facilitate
the discussion

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.560
and help bring about as
many insights as possible

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.640
for you all to consume.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.310
In framing this
discussion, we can

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.100
think about alternative
models to healthcare reform

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.090
on a spectrum, if you will.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.206
On one end, there is the
single payer types of policies.

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:36.330
Again, single payer may
mean many different things.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.100
And I hope we go
into that today.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.870
It involves
decisions like, who's

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.130
bearing the risk, how
do we pool the risk,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.700
how do finance the care, how
do we pay for it, would you

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.844
have a fee for service
system under single payer,

00:01:46.844 --> 00:01:49.260
would you have a global payment
system under single payer?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.180
Those are some of
the nuanced decisions

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.040
under the single payer
end of the spectrum.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.030
On the other end
of the spectrum,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.590
we have decisions surrounding
things like, how far do we

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.290
allow, or how much do we
allow private insurance

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.590
companies to help bear the
risk at the expense partially

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.669
of government?

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.820
Decisions such as, how
far do we expand a program

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.240
like Medicare Advantage, or
a program like the exchanges,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.210
which operate based
on a private platform?

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.620
Within this spectrum, and in
thinking about the alternative,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.510
I would like to pose
and encourage you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.030
to think about three
fundamental questions.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.310
The first is to what degree is
guaranteed coverage required

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.511
to achieve universal coverage?

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:41.640
I'd encourage us to think about
the nuances and the differences

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.770
between guaranteed coverage
and universal coverage.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.940
The second is to what
extent does health insurance

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.800
provide health security?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.690
Again here, the
nuanced differences

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.810
between having health
insurance and actually having

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.940
health security.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.010
The third question is how do
we align affordable healthcare

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.380
with acceptable healthcare?

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.800
Again, the nuanced differences
between what is affordable

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.470
and what is to us, as
a society, acceptable.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.530
Now, in thinking about
these three questions,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.540
I'd simply like
to pose that there

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.030
is a positive way of
thinking about it.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.400
Positive not from the
good or bad perspective,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.100
but positive from the positive
or normative perspective.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.100
So to each of these
questions we can think of it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.808
from a policy standpoint
that is positive

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.480
and from a policy standpoint
that is normative.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.440
For the first question of the
differences between guaranteed

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.420
coverage and universal coverage,
rephrased as what is our path

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.420
to universality, the
positive interpretation

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.120
might be that this is
about a set of regulations

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.970
or requirements.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030
So what regulation
or requirement

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.640
would you like,
would one vote for?

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.500
But I would argue that
the normative stance,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.480
the normative
argument, behind this

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.020
is what is the role of
government in our society?

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.470
I hope our speakers
touch on that today.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.840
For the second
question, to what extent

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.840
does health insurance
provide health security,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.220
the positive
interpretation might

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.710
be that this is about
actuarial value,

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.209
that when you have
an insurance plan

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.100
it's got to cover
a set of things.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.870
And how broad is
that set of things

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.670
under the universe of everything
that medicine can provide?

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.850
But the normative side of
this is much more about

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.590
what is the definition of
security in a person's life.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.052
That's a different question than
the positive interpretation.

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:41.510
And the third
overall question, how

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.400
do we align
affordable healthcare

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.340
with acceptable
healthcare, affordable

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.820
from a positive standpoint
might center on cost sharing.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.200
What is a person's premium?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.630
What is a person's deductible?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.690
What is a person's co-insurance
or co-pay at the office?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.790
But from a normative
standpoint, the differences

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.350
between what's acceptable
and what is affordable

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.290
may center, at the end of
the day, on what is right.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.040
What is right.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.200
I will close my remarks
there and introduce you

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.150
to the first of
our speakers, who

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.730
is Mr. Michael Lighty,
the Director of Public

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.300
Policy at the California
Nurses Association

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.350
and the National Nurses United.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.650
Following Mr. Lighty will
be Professor Bill Hsiao,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.920
who is an Endowed Professor
of Economics at the Harvard

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.470
School of Public Health.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.350
Following Professor Hsiao we
will have Dr. Michelle Doty,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.800
who is the Vice President of
Survey Research and Evaluation

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.859
at the Commonwealth Fund.

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:41.150
Thank you again for being here.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.650
I look forward to
learning with you.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.390
- Thank you, Zirui.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.110
And thank you all
for being here.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.330
I don't know how I got on a
panel with all these doctors--

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.970
that's the question--
and in this conference.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.280
So I really appreciate
the Radcliffe Institute

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.900
including us.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.470
My talk is really
about SB 562, but I

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.780
have to start with politics
because I took that out

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.790
of this talk.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.480
I was at Senator Sanders'
announcement of his Medicare

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.310
For All bill on Wednesday.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.070
And I've been doing
this work since 1991.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.640
And I can tell you it's
a different reality

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.850
for healthcare policy and
politics in this country.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.850
There is-- I mean,
to go essentially

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.190
from zero to 17 senators
from 2013 to 2017,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.112
to see the upsurge, and
how the Senator made

00:06:37.112 --> 00:06:39.070
that a centerpiece of
his presidential campaign

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.490
and since then.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.270
And then, to see the
polling, which as we know,

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.880
varies tremendously by
what type of question

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.820
you ask-- how you ask it, you
can generate-- you can generate

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.880
80% support for Medicare
For All and you can generate

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.950
30% support for single payer.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.150
But overall, the trend is clear.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.020
It's clearly on the
upsurge in popularity,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.570
clearly on the upsurge
as a political--

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.260
as Professor Carpenter said--
a political litmus test.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.690
So we are in a new
moment politically.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.942
And our approach in California
reflects that moment

00:07:09.942 --> 00:07:12.400
in the sense that we believe
you have to start at the state

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.350
level because federalism, as our
other colleague talked about,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.790
is at the heart of
the American system.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.040
And the example of
Canada is instructive.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.560
It started in Saskatchewan
and became Canadian Medicare.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.270
And so, we do believe
that if we can

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.610
prove that this type
of program works

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.260
in a state like
California, especially

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.330
which has the
resources of a nation,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.580
then we can do it federally.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.670
And so, that is actually part
of our political strategy.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.070
Rooted in this is--

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.170
to start to answer
your questions-- we

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.480
really are on the side
of guaranteed healthcare.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.870
And we're on the side
of that as both a frame

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.280
and as a policy position.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.489
We see it as a moral
imperative because really

00:07:54.489 --> 00:07:56.530
what I'm talking about is
the nurses perspective.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.840
I'm going to provide an
analysis of single payer

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.110
that reflects two things.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.620
One is what nurses
bring to this issue

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.280
in their perspective of rank
and file nurses at the bedside.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.220
And also, in relation to
the Affordable Care Act.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.280
So we did two things.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.360
We took a lot of policy
work that our union had

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.990
done over a number of years.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.600
And we took the New
York Health Act,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.640
which was passed by
the New York Assembly,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.740
and really was the first
state single payer bill

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.710
to be designed after
the Affordable Care Act.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.500
And so, that's the
policy environment.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.730
But we do start with
these citizenship values.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.000
And that's why I was
particularly excited to be here

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.049
because we really believe
that a healthcare system has

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:40.190
to reflect those civic values
that animate our society.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.659
And so, we talk about equality,
justice, and democracy.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.840
A single standard of care for
all is at the heart of this.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.300
A single standard of
safe therapeutic care

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.420
is how we put it, a universal
standard of excellence.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.900
One illustration of that.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.720
I talked to the director
of a trauma center

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.620
at a major medical center
in Southern California.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.440
He said yeah, not only do
we spend $80,000 a month

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.030
trying to get paid
from the insurers,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.510
but we also have different
standards and levels of care

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.800
based on what plan you have.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.860
Not simply different benefits,
not simply different coverage,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.990
but literally a different
standard of care

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.160
derived from this
fragmented system.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.320
So we start with that.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.260
But we start with that
the right to health.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.570
Not simply the
right to healthcare,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.840
but the right to
health, as Dr. Benjamin

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.280
was talking about earlier.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.950
That is a core value
of justice that we

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.060
have to apply to the
healthcare system.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.890
Otherwise, we literally cannot
end the disparities that still

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.000
characterize it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.580
And finally, one of the
key points about a publicly

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.500
financed system,
like single payer,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.270
is that it is more democratic.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.570
We are bringing the
civic value of democracy

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.060
and popular participation
into the healthcare system

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.360
because we're going to finance
it publicly through taxes.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.380
And that value of
participation and control

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.830
and democratizing that
system is at the core

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.945
of what we're trying to do.

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:05.140
When we do look at the surveys--
this is from the Kaiser Family

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.850
Foundation-- what
people care about,

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.650
generally, they think quality
of healthcare is good.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.470
But if you look
at their premiums,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.449
the deductibles, the drug
costs, whether their insurance

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:16.990
is going to cover the services
they need, whether they can go

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.198
to the hospital without
paying more, what you realize

00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:23.890
is finances are a barrier to
the guarantee of healthcare.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.200
That's the barrier we're
trying to overcome.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.100
The insecurity derives
from that, the restrictions

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.810
on access, based primarily
in finances, but also

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.250
in narrow networks.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.140
And some of the
changes that have

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.190
been made on the delivery
side have definitely

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.320
gotten people concerned.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.350
What they don't believe is that
they use too much healthcare.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.306
And while we are
explicitly building

00:10:50.306 --> 00:10:52.180
on the foundation of
the Affordable Care Act,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.500
we do reject the
fundamental premise of it.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.500
And that is that, as an
earlier presentation said,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.360
it was designed to
bend the cost curve.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.587
That was the-- that was
the mantra coming out

00:11:01.587 --> 00:11:03.170
of the Office of
Management and Budget

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.790
during the Obama administration.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.670
And the way to
bend the cost curve

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.970
is to put skin in the game.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.990
So you had to pay
more in order to use--

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.182
in order to properly
utilize healthcare.

00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:15.140
And what we're going to
see instead, of course,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.850
is that Americans have--

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.060
go to the doctor less,
they stay in the hospitals

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.160
for shorter lengths of stay.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.400
And in fact, it is not a
question of overutilization,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.850
but primarily an
issue of cost derived

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.330
from the price of healthcare.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.430
None of the concerns
that Americans have

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.260
can be addressed
by transparency.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.350
There was a lot of discussion,
particularly in 2016,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.990
about, hey, if we just
open up and we show people

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.616
what things cost, or we tell--

00:11:44.616 --> 00:11:46.490
for example, a bill just
passed in California

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.410
on prescription
drug transparency.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.770
We don't believe
that any of that

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.280
is going to make a difference.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.500
It's really not
whether they know.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.990
It's about whether they
get the care they need.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.640
That is really, I think,
at their top concern.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.150
So what our perspective is
is that the healthcare system

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.820
is primarily organized
as an industry.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.570
And that industry-- and
Elizabeth Rosenthal,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.299
a longtime reporter at the New
York Times has written a book

00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:13.340
called American Sickness.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.420
This is her premise.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.780
That really what we've
seen, in her lifetime,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.660
as a writer is the
transformation from a care

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.140
giving profession to
a healthcare industry

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.900
based on revenue and profit.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.460
And it is that model that is
driving the cost increases.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.600
And we have to change it.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.490
Quality is actually
skewed to the top.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.430
During the Great Recession,
for the first time,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.400
wealthy people spent
more on healthcare

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.860
than your average income
person because they simply

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.570
had the resources to do it.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.720
There are a couple of
analyzes about that.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.550
Angus Deaton, 2015 Nobel
Prize winning economist,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.550
has said that healthcare
is a driver of inequality,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.230
not simply a reflection of it.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.690
But how it's financed,
how it's accessed,

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.540
where the resources
go, drives inequality

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.430
in the society as a whole.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.220
Technology improvements
benefit the wealthy most

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.280
and other things that
are capital intensive.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.760
Obviously, expensive
prescription drugs

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.420
is a good example as well.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.260
So when we look at
this we compare--

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.270
this slide's a little
skewed, but I'll explain it.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.300
We're essentially
looking at the contrast

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.390
between maximizing revenue or
this single standard of care.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.280
Because to maximize
revenue, of course,

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.610
means you've got to cherry pick
the patient population that you

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.450
insure.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.332
Because if you insure
a lot of sick people,

00:13:34.332 --> 00:13:36.290
you're going to need
those reinsurance payments

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.380
that apparently Tom Price
doesn't want to give

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.640
the insurance companies.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.950
So you can't have a
single standard of care

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.200
because you've got to
attract those ultimately

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.760
who don't need very much care.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.450
Market competition is not
effective because essentially

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:55.490
what we have is we have
the hospital corporations,

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.630
in many cases, dominant players
in their local communities,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.320
prescription drug corporations,
and the insurance industry.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.070
None of those entities have
any regulation on price.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.390
They literally can charge
whatever they want.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.390
There is no price regulation
at any point in the system.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.650
So the market competition
actually benefits them

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.680
as it benefits their revenue.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.350
A higher prescription drug
can justify a higher premium.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.620
Higher hospital charges can
justify a higher premium.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.650
Similarly, the higher
premiums provide more revenue

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.620
to the prescription drug
companies and the hospitals.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.460
What really is at work here
is that industry dynamic.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.079
That's opposed to a
safe, therapeutic care

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:38.870
in the most appropriate
setting because you

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.990
wouldn't bring those
market values to bear

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.110
in the clinical setting.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.390
There is a great emphasis on
shift to lower cost setting.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.280
Here, we have an
example of where

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.280
a lot of the emphasis
in the healthcare system

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.230
is to go to outpatient care.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.420
That is, of course, in
many ways beneficial.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.470
If it's driven by budget
and cost, then it's not.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.040
So if a procedure that's more
safely done in the hospital is

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.930
instead done at an
outpatient clinic,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.310
the difference in revenue to an
entity like Kaiser can be $0.80

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.210
on the dollar.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.800
The same procedure
in the hospital

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.930
can cost that much
less in a clinic.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.840
And in many times,
that's beneficial.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.300
In other times, is it a question
of is the clinical efficacy

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.870
the driver there?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.300
We believe in the
highest skilled caregiver

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.320
closest to the patient.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.080
That's directly counter
to workforce models that

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.970
would say, no, we
need to de-skill

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.610
and have less expensive
healthcare workers as part

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.580
of the industry model.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.430
Hospitals, in many cases, are
becoming technology centers

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.590
with a lot of the care
being delivered elsewhere,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.840
maybe through even telemedicine.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.610
Rather, we want
to use technology

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.090
to enhance professional
clinical judgment.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.360
And so, we contrast this
ultimately with a healthcare

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.700
system to meet
patient needs based

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.710
on the morality of caregiving.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:02.160
And that is what informs
our perspective on SB 562.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.570
The morality of
caregiving has to be

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.630
at the heart of our
health care system.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.720
So we favor social
insurance in that

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.550
we want to replace
these rising premiums

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.870
with progressive financing.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.900
I never talk about public
financing of health care

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.110
without saying that it will
replace insurance company

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.510
premiums, deductibles,
and co-pays.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.920
That's at the heart of it.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.250
It's not an additional
amount spent.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.830
It is a replacement for what
we're currently spending

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.990
and then generating savings.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.270
No cost to access care
where you need it.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.760
We eliminate
deductibles and co-pays.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.870
Your average deductible
now is $1,400.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.860
We identified 36%
of Californians,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.340
15 million Californians, have
a deductible of $2,000 or more.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.710
The research shows
concretely that that

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.720
is a barrier to access.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.240
Comprehensive benefits
not based on premium costs

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.510
because we have to separate
what you pay for healthcare

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.250
from the healthcare you need.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.910
And that's a core value
of single payer financing.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.230
Complete choice of a provider.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.520
That is a bias that we have.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.859
We believe narrow networks are
counterproductive to insuring

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:12.536
guaranteed healthcare.

00:17:12.536 --> 00:17:14.619
And we also don't believe
that industry practices,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:18.099
like mergers and acquisitions,
add any value to the system.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.690
It's a public solution.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.480
Everybody in, nobody out,
automatic enrollment,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.930
perhaps there's some level of
state-based administration.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.119
There is a role for
supplemental benefit programs,

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.120
but you'll see in 562 it's
a very comprehensive one.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.700
And ultimately, the
key point, costs

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.220
lowered through leverage
to control prices,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.220
progressive financing,
and universal healthcare.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.620
And that includes
mechanisms like paying

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.360
for value over volume through
global budgets on hospitals

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.490
or other per capita payments.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:52.300
And so, in that sense, it builds
upon the Affordable Care Act,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.260
but we do believe that
prices are the driver.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.480
Progressive taxation,
again, price controls

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.400
on drugs and
devices, elimination

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.700
of profits, marketing costs,
and waste, global budgets,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.432
as I said, and then, negotiated
fees and payments to providers.

00:18:07.432 --> 00:18:09.640
So essentially, what we do
is we create a single risk

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.320
pool with everybody in.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.730
We look for uniform rates,
so that all providers

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.066
are paid on the same basis.

00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:19.690
And then, we use some
of the mechanisms

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.090
that I learned from
Professor Hsiao

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.050
to create a single pipe, which
is the payer, to providers.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.600
That's the essence
of the proposal.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.690
And it's like Medicare.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.840
It's an expansion--
at the federal level,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.614
it would be an
expansion of Medicare.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.280
There are various
types of single payer.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.904
We could discuss more in detail
the different national systems,

00:18:38.904 --> 00:18:43.670
as I know Michelle Doty will
do far better than I could.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.750
And obviously, the
VA is a good example

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:51.580
of how controlling prescription
drug prices and actually

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.100
an effective use of
electronic medical records

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.140
could be emulated.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.560
Quick look at
healthcare spending.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.420
And you'll see there's
a lot of discussion

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.747
about out-of-pocket expenses.

00:19:02.747 --> 00:19:05.080
And you say, well, you're
going to eliminate deductibles

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.080
and co-pays, so how are you
going to regulate access

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.870
or appropriate utilization?

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.880
Other countries have
out-of-pocket costs.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.460
Well, it turns out those
out-of-pocket costs, generally,

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.470
in many cases, are quite low.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.070
And it's not, in fact,
a comparable situation.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.350
In Switzerland, the system
that's most like ours,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.690
has actually higher
out-of-pocket costs than us.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:32.050
Otherwise, the national systems
have substantially lower.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.320
We essentially spend more and
get less in other countries.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.350
This is a table on outcomes.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.450
What I like about this--

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.000
status rather, demographic
status and health outcomes,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.220
risk factors.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.130
What I like about this is that
it shows that a lot of those

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.390
notions that we believe are
drivers of healthcare costs--

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.930
obesity, of course, we're way up
there and it is a big driver--

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.600
are actually less
prominent here.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.320
We have a society that isn't
the oldest in the world,

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.240
in fact, on average, as a
percentage of population.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.210
That's not necessarily a
driver of healthcare costs.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.590
I'm going to skip over this.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.870
We do have, as I
mentioned, fewer hospital--

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.540
shorter length of stays
and fewer doctor visits.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.520
This is why does
healthcare cost so much.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.810
Because prices are high.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.200
It sounds like a
joke, but it's true.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.510
You can see a
comparison of prices

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.713
just on some procedures,
pretty radical differences.

00:20:34.285 --> 00:20:36.580
The favorite one
is an appendectomy

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.610
in the United States is going
to cost three times what

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:40.810
some countries charge.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.110
And so, you see here, there
are pretty substantial price

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.080
differences in the US driven
by this industry model.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.580
Prescription drug prices
are another good example.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.480
This is a chart that shows
employers are paying more

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.740
in compensation, but
wages aren't going up.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.940
It's essentially a transfer of
wealth between corporations--

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.570
from corporations to
healthcare insurance companies.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.202
And the workers are ended
up paying most of it.

00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:09.725
I see I've gone on and
on about the politics,

00:21:09.725 --> 00:21:13.140
so I'm not getting my
presentation done on time.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.220
But essentially-- I want
to just do this quickly.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.930
The healthcare
disparities is exactly

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.450
as you said, Dr. Benjamin,
completely related to zip code.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.630
These are comparisons of
different geographic areas

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:25.650
in California.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.030
Essentially, your
life expectancy

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.080
depends on where you live
and your race and class.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.410
And that's just the way it is.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.070
And so, we have to address that.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.650
Three million Californians
still under-insured.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.590
Half of those are undocumented.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.904
Talking about the ACA.

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.070
I just want to get quickly--

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.111
I got to get out of here.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.220
This is what we're
trying to do, as I say,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.100
pass legislation in California.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.100
And then, let that be a model
to federal Medicare For All

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.070
and win healthcare justice.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.217
Just quickly on the
key provisions of the--

00:22:03.217 --> 00:22:04.550
and then I will get out of here.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.410
So I apologize.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:12.260
The key provisions-- we call
it the Healthy California Act.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.050
This is the definitions.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.360
It guarantees healthcare to
all residents of California.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.940
It eliminates insurance company
bureaucracy, claims denial,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.220
and marketing costs.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.180
It really emphasizes that
everybody is in one system,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:30.380
so you cannot have private
payers paying for those

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.810
benefits that the system covers.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.990
So that provider is either going
to be in the system accepting

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.900
payments from it, or they're
going to practice entirely

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.250
outside the system.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.200
Insurance products
can only cover

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.302
those benefits that are not
covered as part of the system.

00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:47.510
And then, it's this independent
healthcare authority,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.450
the single pipe, that channels
existing federal and state

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.810
healthcare revenues.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.780
So it depends upon
getting those waivers

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.630
from the federal
government to be a part B

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.990
provider under Medicare, to
take the Medicaid money that's

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.290
coming into the state, and to
get the money that is currently

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.140
spent as tax credits
into the system as part

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.520
of the public financing.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.210
For example, $53
billion is given

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.790
from the federal government
to California employers

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.780
as a tax benefit for
providing insurance.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.030
Our view is those
insurance markets don't

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.280
exist without that tax subsidy.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.200
So instead of
having that subsidy

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.910
go to the profits
of the insurers,

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.660
it goes to pay for
healthcare, as an example.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.030
We do provide complete
provider choice.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.900
And we also-- and this
is, I think, a key point--

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.440
our bias is on professional
clinical judgment.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.590
We believe that has to be the
basis for healthcare decision

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.920
making.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.800
And if clinicians are provided
with the time and resources

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.800
to make those decisions,
and we create a system where

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.770
you can evaluate those
decisions after the fact

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.350
through quality
review, catch outliers,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.970
that is a much more effective
way than pre-authorization,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:07.700
than claims denials, independent
medical review by insurers.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.490
And nurses will tell you that
insurance companies are making

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.960
clinical decisions every day.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.334
And that is what we want
to seek to eliminate.

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:16.250
Here are the benefits.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.760
You can see, on the
long-term care piece,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.420
we are going to continue the
existing Medicaid benefits,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.890
but not means test them.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.810
So that's an expansion
of long-term care.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.540
We are not yet
tackling nursing homes.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.810
That's projected to occur
within the first two years.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.430
We did an economic analysis.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.830
We estimated $331 billion,
saving California $375 billion.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.930
Key point, 70% of healthcare
expenses in California

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:46.640
are publicly financed.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.680
We are simply not getting
our money's worth.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.930
To talk about this--

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.890
this is essentially
a system that

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.760
uses tax money to subsidize
an industry model of revenue

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.980
and profit instead of
guaranteeing healthcare

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.700
for all.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.260
That's what we're changing.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.400
And that is at the heart of it.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.030
It's

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.950
We have a couple of ideas
for revenue sources,

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.540
but it is a substantial savings
to business, in particular.

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.590
22% for those businesses who
are providing benefits now,

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.220
up to 13.4% for medium
sized businesses.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:25.410
It is a way to create jobs and
fund innovation and investment.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:29.360
This is our program to win.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.786
And I would say, to the earlier
question about advocacy,

00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:34.520
advocacy has put
this on the map.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.400
Advocacy is driving
this in California.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.650
We are literally going
to have town halls

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.080
and door knocking
in every assembly

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.160
district in California.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.480
We believe that's what
it's going to take.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.600
So we have to meld-- and it's
really nurses in the forefront.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.300
So we meld the
credibility that nurses

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.730
bring to this issue,
their direct experience

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.130
with patient care and
the insurance companies,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.610
and a approach to this that
emphasizes clinical judgment

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.560
as we put everybody
in one risk pool

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.200
and eliminate the fragmentation
of the system that

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.580
is responsible for
so much inefficiency.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.730
So I look forward to talking
with you more about it

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.210
and really appreciate
the opportunity.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.043
Thank you very much.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.400
- Good afternoon.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.050
I'm an economist, if you
read the introduction.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.540
And you may wonder what
would the economist

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:32.050
know about healthcare.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.430
I don't know anybody want
to voluntarily give me

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:42.290
a definition, what
is a male economist?

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.100
Let me offer one to you.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:51.770
A male economist is
one with 1,000 theories

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.775
about how to make love,
but have never met a girl.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.190
And I want to say
that I did meet

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:06.100
a few girls on single payer.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.000
In my professional work, I
designed a single payer system

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.120
for nine countries
around the world.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.690
Half of those countries
did adopt them.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.130
The one with the longest
history is Taiwan.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.330
So I'm--

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:29.690
And then, when the state of
Vermont commissioned my team,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.570
designed one for Vermont.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.630
But then, it did
not get implemented.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.910
So I come here to give you
a presentation to actually

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.330
talking about something
that Professor Campbell

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.720
and Carpenter will be
better to talk about.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:54.130
And that is the political
economy of a single payer.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.100
And so you have a better--

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:02.260
perhaps, you can get a better
appreciation the difficulty

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.890
to climb that mountain.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.980
And then, what citizens
can do to actually move up

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.480
that mountain.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.940
So with that in mind then,
let me just quickly--

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.810
I will not take up your time
to summarize the major problems

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.690
confronting United States.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:30.070
Even after Obamacare,
there are 29 million--

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.990
and the latest figure
says maybe 28 million--

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:37.055
Americans still uninsured.

00:28:37.055 --> 00:28:40.690
And there are 30 million
Americans are underinsured.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.710
At the same time,
our costs continue

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:52.380
to escalate taking a
larger and larger share

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.260
of the government's
budget, Massachusetts

00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:01.090
budget, your individual
budget, employers budget,

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.840
including Harvard
University's budget,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.270
and also pay directly out
of our pocket, perhaps.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.540
And third, if you
look at closely,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.250
United States have the best
quality of care in the world.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.490
At the same time, you
go to Mississippi Delta,

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:26.160
you go to Idaho, you see the
third world class medicine

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.850
there being practiced.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.810
It's highly uneven in America.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:38.070
As well we do not
really emphasize

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.440
prevention and primary care.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.650
We have a system, it's
hospital centered.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.920
So this is where we are.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.030
How do you solve that problem?

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.270
Well, I like to ask why.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.330
So I'd like to leave
a point with you.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:06.700
I like to argue the
reason is America

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.540
is the only affluent
country in the world

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:17.510
build this system on the
free market principle.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.820
No other affluent
country does that.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.995
If you have free
market, you want

00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:29.290
to give people free choice
of insurance, doctors.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.210
You want to give doctors,
hospital free choice

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.320
to charge patients.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.460
You want to give freedom to have
drug companies charge whatever

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.950
they wish, but
protected by patents.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.100
That's what we have.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.070
So American people
have to understand

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.880
you have to change your
ideological foundation

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:58.990
upon which our healthcare
system is built since 1920s.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:05.490
So here, I like to summarize
for you the consequences

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:10.290
of what we have then.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:15.780
And that is we have very
high administrative costs.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.260
Everyone knows that.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.930
And that's been documented.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:29.200
FBI declares that there are
8% to 10% of fraud and abuse

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.840
in claims in the
Medicare program,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.650
but we are unable
to weed it out.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:41.180
I tell you what happened when
Taiwan adopted single payer.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.810
In the second year, they were
able to reduce the healthcare

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.890
costs by 10% because
now they have

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.760
a complete record of what
the hospital and the doctor

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.380
have done.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.240
And they are able
to identify who

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.120
is really abusing the system.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.430
And that's what Canada did too
on they're single payer system.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:10.120
I don't need to go
through each one for you.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.980
But high drug costs
has been mentioned.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.150
And if you look at America,
the free market system,

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:24.870
our specialists are paid much
more than our primary care

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.990
doctors and our internists.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:32.160
If you look at the data,
the average net income

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.120
of the doctors in
private practice,

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.100
the specialist surgeons
are making three times

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:46.490
of what family physicians
making, or general internists.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.205
No other country does that.

00:32:49.205 --> 00:32:53.810
And what that does is we attract
our young medical students

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.440
going into these specialties.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.470
And as the old
saying goes, if you

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:03.850
teach someone only to
know how to use a hammer,

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.520
everything becomes a nail.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.860
And you look at the
research report,

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:14.890
how many how much over
surgery, over performance we

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.380
have in America.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.150
Because 60% of our
doctors are specialists.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.200
Only 40% are general
practitioners or family

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.610
doctors.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:32.050
And if you look at the UK,
Canada, Germany, France,

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:38.050
it's just the reverse,
60% primary care doctors,

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.450
40% specialists.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.010
This is what a market
system does for you.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:52.530
So we know these are the
problems created by the market

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.315
through research.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.350
Then, I would argue, single
payer is only one solution.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.180
Because I do not--

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.409
I confess, in spite of
what happened on Wednesday,

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:14.659
I don't think majority America
will vote to have single payer

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.090
system tomorrow.

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:21.440
It's a long journey yet.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.230
So let's look at what will
we save in a reasonably

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.780
pure single payer system.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.159
Here, I can quantify for
you through my own research.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:43.260
We can decrease the
administrative spending

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.489
by about 15% of the
total healthcare costs,

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:55.659
which will come to $500
billion every year.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.010
That's how much we're
spending wastefully

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:03.090
not to do medical care, but
to actually make doctors--

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.660
like Dr. Torquin was talking
to me over lunchtime--

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:11.575
about filling in forms and using
different electronic health

00:35:11.575 --> 00:35:12.075
records.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:19.760
Second is we can reduce
the abuse and fraud.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:26.966
That could amount to
$150 to $180 billion.

00:35:26.966 --> 00:35:34.310
Purchasing drugs by negotiating
with pharmaceutical companies

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:38.450
could again produce
close to $150 billion.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.200
These figures do
not come from me.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.270
Come from researchers.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.930
If you add them up on
the left hand column,

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:55.200
they could amount to $850
billion every year savings.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.280
Today, among the experts,
particularly the economists

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:06.210
and policy people, we are public
saying in America, every year,

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:12.440
we are wasting $1
trillion in healthcare.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.820
And I will quote my younger
colleague, Dave Cullen,

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.880
who just gave a talk like
that just a week ago.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.080
And Dave is a conservative
and careful researcher.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.020
He doesn't mouthing
numbers loosely.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:35.420
$1 trillion every year,
that's what we could say.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:39.200
We're not spending that now
for effective healthcare

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.700
for the people.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.860
But then, you have
to spend money

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.530
to accomplish single payer.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.290
You have to cover the uninsured.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.270
That costs money.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.220
You have to bring
up the people who

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:59.260
are underinsured to a standard
you're going to give them.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.960
You have to provide
money, perhaps,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.320
to elevate some of
the compensation

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.740
for some specialties,
like family physicians

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.300
or geriatrics.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.310
You may have to provide money
for retraining of the workers.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:24.050
If you take the difference
between the two,

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:31.420
you can save close to $500
billion every year in America.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:37.540
So if you want to understand
where Senator Sanders come up

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:46.640
with a figure he can save
$6 trillion in 10 years,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.390
it's from analysis like this.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.070
It's not pulling
out of the thin air.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.630
Now, why aren't we there?

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.110
Well, here I venture
into political economy.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.000
And Professor
Campbell and Carpenter

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.830
can freely criticize me.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.780
I only look at who
are the gainers.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.960
The uninsured and underinsured,
Professor Campbell already

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.470
talked about low income
people and minority

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.980
people, particularly
legal immigrants,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.210
they do not participate
politically.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:43.590
Although they will benefit,
they may not organize and really

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.840
put pressure to
trying to produce

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.750
benefits for themselves.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:54.000
All Americans, like what Michael
just showed in California,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.750
could benefit.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.040
But the benefit is
relatively little, relatively

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:04.170
small, let's say
$1,000 each person.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.500
That's spread to everyone.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.050
There is empirical evidence
supporting a political theory

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.410
called collective action.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:19.940
When benefits are
spread out to everyone

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.060
in these modest amounts, people
do not organize to support it.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:31.930
That's in well-written
books, in textbooks.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:33.940
That's who will gain.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.720
Let's say who are going to lose.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.240
Private insurance industry,
the benefit they get

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.160
is concentrated.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.320
Their annual revenue right
now is $1.4 trillion.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:57.030
And their profit, publicly
acknowledged, is about 5%.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:03.690
As a actuary, before
I became an economist,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:05.340
I can tell you there
are different ways

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.430
to hide your profit in
the insurance company's

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.190
financial statements.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.395
And that was my job
before I was reborn.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.960
You have-- you
have to then also--

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:31.560
how about the people who are
doing administrative billing

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.390
and insurance work now.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.590
I estimate-- and this is a
very approximate estimate--

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:43.375
two to four million American
workers may lose their jobs.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.690
When you deny people jobs,
you know what they will do.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:55.890
They will go in the street
and block all the traffic.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:56.930
No one talk about it.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.720
Will you take it lightly?

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.280
Pharmaceutical industry
going to be affected.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.460
I'm over time now.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.640
And I'm going to cut it short.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:19.020
So you look at the
winners and losers,

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:26.150
then you can say, well, what
actions are they going to take?

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:32.060
What the losers may do to block
you in our political system?

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.920
I give you an estimate.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.580
If the health
insurance industry used

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:46.580
1/10 of 1% of their annual
revenue to decide to fight you,

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.620
they can generate $14 billion.

00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:53.840
Running for the President
of the United States

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.210
only costs $1 billion.

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.520
And there are eight,
nine key committees

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.345
handle health
legislation in Congress.

00:42:02.345 --> 00:42:05.820
And they only have to
be able to determine

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.230
the election of the chairperson
and the ranking member

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:14.810
of these committees, 18 people.

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.380
They can block your
legislation or dilute it.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.170
That's the reality, people.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:31.990
So where-- so here I'd like
to leave you with a cartoon

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:36.250
and just to remind you
this might be the mountain,

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:40.360
or this might be the
surgery you have to perform

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.070
to achieve single payer.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.190
However, I'm not pessimistic.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.480
I work in different
countries-- like I said,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.630
nine countries
designed single payer.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:01.170
In countries with steeped,
vested interest groups

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:05.160
you actually have to take steps.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.096
And one of the major
steps of our citizenry

00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:14.840
is I think American citizens
need to be educated, educated.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.210
And I think that's
why you are here.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.950
But there are not
enough of you yet.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:28.010
And you have to get these
facts and say you are actually

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:31.970
going to benefit, maybe
it's $1,000 per person,

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.710
but a family of four
that's $4,000 to you.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.600
Make them internalize it.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.590
Make them-- give
them information

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.350
that they can argue
with their neighbors.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:47.480
And designing a
program, how do we

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:51.040
help the ones who are
going to lose their jobs,

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.430
or minimize the
number of people who

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.670
are maybe losing their jobs.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.770
All these details are
not worked out yet.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.190
And so, you have a
lot of work to do.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.530
But it's really exciting.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:07.050
Thank you.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.970
- I hope everyone has
had enough coffee,

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.950
their chocolate bar is
kicking in, maybe, hopefully,

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.380
it's not putting you to
sleep because I'm going

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.360
to be presenting some data.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.430
And it makes some
people a little sleepy.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.010
So get ready.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.450
And I'll try to make this
as painless as possible.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:38.370
So first, I'm very pleased
to be here with you today.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:41.430
For those who are unfamiliar
with the Commonwealth Fund,

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.580
we are a nonpartisan,
private foundation

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.360
that conducts and supports
health policy research.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.890
The mission of the
foundation, which

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:55.440
is about to complete 100
years in existence next year,

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.880
is to achieve high quality,
affordable healthcare for all.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.710
We are based in New York City.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.540
And we also have
an office in DC.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.030
So I'm very pleased to
be here with you today.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.080
So today, I'm going to
spend the first half

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.700
of the talk presenting data from
two recent Commonwealth Fund

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.840
reports.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.840
I will first compare the
performance of US healthcare

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.870
system from a
global perspective,

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:25.110
then compare the
performance of states pre

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.750
and post the
Affordable Care Act.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.970
The second part of
the talk will focus

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.940
on what we can learn from
high performing countries

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.900
and the experiences of states,
and how we can move forward

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.240
on improving US healthcare
in the short term

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.020
and the long term.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.770
And I hope that all
of these discussions

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.600
today will spur some
lively discussions

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.080
like it did this morning.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.370
Let's begin by talking about
US healthcare performance

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.650
from a global perspective.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:59.000
As background, it is often
said that the US has the best

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.760
healthcare in the world.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:07.640
Right here, in 2004, George W.
Bush said these exact words.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:13.720
But limited evidence
supports this claim.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.420
We do know that, as
this exhibit shows,

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.580
that the US spends
far more on healthcare

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.591
than other high
income countries do.

00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:22.090
We know that spending
healthcare has

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.930
grown more rapidly in the
US than in other countries.

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.120
And the key question
is whether the US

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.310
achieves better
performance given

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:31.640
its high level of spending.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.640
We've already
heard-- you already

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.380
know the answer to this.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.600
The answer is no.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.120
In "Mirror, Mirror," our
international comparison

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.300
report, we used recent data
to compare healthcare system

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.810
performance in the US with
that of 10 other high income

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.980
countries.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.840
In this report,
countries are ranked

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.380
based on 72 indicators
that measure performance

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.610
in five domains.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.910
And data come from our
international surveys,

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:01.810
the OECD, the WHO, and
also other sources.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.330
This slide summarizes
the overall findings

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.130
from this report.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.910
The visual displays
the magnitude

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.470
of the overall
performance differences

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.520
between the 11 countries
included in this report.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.330
The performance score is
based on standard deviations.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.040
It's a common method for
understanding differences

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.930
within a group.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:31.240
And as you can see, the
US not only ranks last,

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.790
but has a substantially
lower score

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.770
than most other countries.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.170
This figure also shows
that three countries

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.137
are top performers, the
United Kingdom, Australia,

00:47:42.137 --> 00:47:42.970
and the Netherlands.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:44.729
And keep these three
countries in mind

00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:46.270
because I will be
coming back to this

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.922
at the end of my presentation.

00:47:49.922 --> 00:47:51.380
The only reason
why I'm showing you

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.170
this slide that's not
very friendly to the eyes

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.680
is that it includes more
detailed performance on country

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.040
rankings and why
the US ranks last.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.480
Because it ranks last
on four of the five

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.285
domains of performance,
which is shown in the rows.

00:48:09.285 --> 00:48:11.660
If you go to the report, you
can see all sorts of details

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.290
that feed into this table.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:21.060
In the equity domain,
which is near the bottom,

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.520
notice that the US
comes last and the UK

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.480
and the Netherlands rank
number one and number two.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.540
In these countries, there are
relatively small differences

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.770
between lower and higher
income adults on 11 measures.

00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:37.590
In contrast, the differences
in income in the US

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:40.500
were especially large
on measures related

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.870
to financial barriers to care.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:46.890
44% of low income adults and
26% of higher income adults

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.260
reported financial
barriers to care.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:54.210
And this compares to the US
where only 7% of low income

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:57.330
and 4% of higher income
reported these problems.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.150
So higher income
adults in the US

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:07.160
report more problems than the
lower income adults in the UK.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.750
In the next set of
slides, I'm going

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.660
to shift focus and talk
about this inequality and use

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:16.940
data from the Commonwealth
Fund's Scorecard on State

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.330
System Performance to look
more closely at the difference

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.250
in state performance.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:25.820
But before I do, I just wanted
to provide a brief background

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.630
to the ACA.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.046
I'm repeating a little bit of
what was already said today,

00:49:29.046 --> 00:49:32.900
but this is just to frame the
conversation because of one

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.950
of the things that the
law intended to do.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:39.100
For decades, there has been
a wide gulf between whites,

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.530
Latinos, and blacks in
terms of health insurance

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:43.450
coverage and access.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:47.860
The proponents of the ACA hoped
that the law's major insurance

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.310
coverage expansions and
reforms would bridge those gaps

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.740
by making health insurance
more affordable to adults

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.630
with low and moderate incomes.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.450
And of course, this was
done through the ACA

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.550
when marketplaces
were established

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:04.720
to help families, moderate
and low income families,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.690
purchase plans on
the marketplace

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:12.610
with the standard benefits
with subsidies and assistance.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:17.380
It also expanded Medicaid to the
adults with the lowest incomes.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.640
But the Supreme Court decisions
made this optional for states.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.770
We've already heard this.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.480
Because the Supreme
Court decisions

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.150
made Medicaid expansion optional
for states, as a result,

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.330
you can see in this
table, that there's

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.910
a lot of variation
about states' decisions

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:35.580
about what they
did about Medicaid.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.200
And I'm not going to spend
much time on this table,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.640
but I just want you to--

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.630
suffice it to say that 31
states and DC participated

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.610
in Medicaid expansion,
so you can focus

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:47.740
on the purple and the yellow.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.170
And 19 have not.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:51.850
And we've already
heard this offers

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.700
a very excellent
opportunity to study

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.550
the effects of the expansion.

00:50:59.129 --> 00:51:00.670
So for the next few
slides, I'm going

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:04.570
to be focusing on the data
from the 2017 State Scorecard

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.840
to show you the impact
of states' decisions

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.820
on Medicaid expansion.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:13.690
First, the big takeaway is
this, that during the first two

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:17.020
years of the ACA
coverage expansions

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.020
the uninsured rates
dropped dramatically

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:24.010
across the country for whites,
Latinos, and black adults

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.010
regardless of whether
they expanded Medicaid.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.200
The gaps between whites
and blacks and Hispanics

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.620
narrowed, as the law intended
and hoped it would do.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.200
But take a look at
what happened in states

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.100
that expanded Medicaid.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.460
I think there's a
chart to your left.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.950
The uninsured rates
are significantly lower

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:45.920
for Hispanics and blacks
living in Medicaid expansion

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.042
states versus those
adults that live

00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:49.250
in states that didn't expand.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.110
During this time,
minority populations

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.020
also experienced historic
gains in their ability

00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.720
to access healthcare
when they needed it.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.660
In this chart, we're
looking at another outcome,

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.530
whether or not you experience
financial barriers to care.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:09.020
Again, I'm comparing
non-expansion states

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.170
versus the expansion states.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:17.480
And what you see here is
that across the country

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.520
gaps between Hispanics
and white adults narrowed.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.800
There was a smaller share
of Hispanics and whites

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.680
across the country that are
skipping care because of costs.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.210
But again, if you look at the
Medicaid expansion states,

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:35.210
Latinos and Hispanics
who live in those states

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.780
are significantly less likely
to skip care because of cost

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.370
than the Latinos
and Hispanics who

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:44.200
live in non-expansion states.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.380
This is the same analysis that
points to the black white gap.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.270
Among black adults,
the average rate

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:56.350
of foregoing care because of
cost was lower to begin with.

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:59.860
And it declined slightly
more in expansion states

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.350
compared to
non-expansion states.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:05.230
So this has led to actually
a greater reduction

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:07.830
in black white disparities
on this indicator

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:12.520
in expansion states versus
the non-expansion states.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.690
So what are the key takeaways
from these two benchmarking

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.840
reports from the
Commonwealth Fund?

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.520
So while the US has made
significant progress

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.590
since the ACA
coverage expansion,

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:26.470
it still lags in comparison
to other countries

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:31.710
on affordability, on
access to care, on equity.

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.030
The ACA's coverage
expansions made a difference

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:37.325
for Latinos and blacks
across the country.

00:53:37.325 --> 00:53:40.940
It made historic gains in their
ability to access healthcare.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.890
And gaps between
these groups narrowed.

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:46.710
But what state you
live in matters.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.830
It matters a lot.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:52.400
And still, according to a report
that was released last week

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.910
and to the recent
CPS statements,

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.380
our ACA tracking survey finds
that 14%, or an estimated

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:06.210
27 to 28 million working age
Americans, remain uninsured.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.470
So where does this leave us?

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:14.000
Let's go back to what we learned
from international comparisons

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.280
and look at Australia,
UK, Netherlands.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.860
And what do these three
countries have in common?

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.240
The most important is that
they provide universal coverage

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.400
and access and
financial protection

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.140
from healthcare cost.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.010
The US offers the least
financial protection,

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:35.520
and is the only country,
among these 11 high income

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.200
countries studied, without
universal health insurance.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.740
But these top performers finance
and organize their healthcare

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.750
in very different ways.

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:47.030
This drives home the
idea that there does not

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:49.910
have to be a one size
fits all solution

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:52.766
to achieve universal coverage.

00:54:52.766 --> 00:54:54.140
Let's look at the
three countries

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.120
who are the highest performers.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.410
The UK, in the NHS,
services are paid

00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:03.980
for through general tax
revenue as opposed to insurance

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.610
premiums.

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.380
There are no caps, general caps,
but out-of-pocket cost payments

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.580
only apply to prescription
drugs and medical appliances.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.010
And low income and other
vulnerable populations

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.080
are exempt from
cost sharing, which

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.755
is why they score the highest
in our "Mirror, Mirror" report

00:55:21.755 --> 00:55:23.350
on measures of equity.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:27.380
Healthcare in the UK
is centrally directed

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.930
and has more direct
management, accountability

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:33.150
to the government than in
other healthcare systems.

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.690
If you look at
Australia, everyone

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.790
is covered under the
public insurance plan

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:39.920
that is also called Medicare.

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:44.930
Much like the NHS,
Australia's Medicare

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:46.820
is funded through tax revenue.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.390
There are caps on out-of-pocket
prescription costs only.

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:51.920
And it's dependent on income.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.750
But the protections
for low income

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.489
are not as good as they are
in NHS and in the Netherlands,

00:55:57.489 --> 00:55:59.030
which is why you
see that they're not

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.580
the highest performers
on the equity measures.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:06.330
Unlike Australia and the
UK, the Dutch health system

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:09.330
relies on private insurers
to fund health services

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.280
for its population.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.450
Everyone with the same
insurer pays the same premium,

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.840
regardless of age
and health status.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.940
All plans include a standard,
basic benefit package.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.910
Subsidies are available for
people with low incomes.

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:30.510
Adults are required
to enroll in a plan,

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:32.280
or they must pay a fine.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.520
This should sound very familiar.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.890
This model shares
many similarities

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:40.620
with the insurance
marketplaces that was created

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.960
under the Affordable Care Act.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.720
Clearly, we are not the UK,
Australia, or the Netherlands,

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.380
but we can learn from
other countries about ways

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:54.310
to achieve universal coverage.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.160
I want to conclude
with some thoughts

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.410
on some short and
long term strategies

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:01.920
that we need to consider in
order to stabilize and improve

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.960
coverage and access in the US.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.930
First, we need to stabilize
the individual market.

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.370
We've heard about this.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:11.190
Here are three
things policymakers

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:13.110
and the administration
can do now

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.840
to help stabilize the
individual market.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.090
The first, the
administration has not

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.730
made a long term commitment
to paying insurers

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:23.160
for the cost sharing
reductions for low income

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.470
enrollees in the marketplaces.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.690
Congress could resolve
this without making--

00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:29.400
by making a permanent
appropriation

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.930
for these payments.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:33.120
Without this
commitment, insurers

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.850
have already announced that
they are increasing premiums

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.700
to hedge against the risk
of not receiving payments

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:41.179
from the federal government.

00:57:41.179 --> 00:57:42.720
Congress and the
administration needs

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.910
to signal to insurers
participating

00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:48.420
in the marketplaces that it
will enforce the commitment

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.100
to the individual mandate.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.650
Again, uncertainty about that--

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:54.420
like the cost
sharing reductions--

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.610
is leading to higher
than expected premiums

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.380
for the next year.

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.740
We also need to fund and support
outreach and enrollment efforts

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.410
for the 2018 open enrollment.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.630
Latest data from our
ACA tracking survey

00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:09.990
shows that 40% of the
remaining uninsured adults

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:13.160
were not aware of
the marketplaces.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.150
CNS announced at
the end of August

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.540
that it plans to drastically cut
funding for the ACA advertising

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:20.610
and navigator grants.

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:23.340
So we know from our research
that people who received

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.010
personal help were much more
likely to enroll in marketplace

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:29.830
plans than those who didn't.

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:33.340
Long term strategies for
stability and greater coverage,

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.650
first, make tax credits
and cost sharing reductions

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.840
available to people
with higher incomes.

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:43.060
There is a steep cliff for
people who make 400% of income

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.200
or above.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.720
Allowing people who
earn more than this

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.570
to be eligible for
tax credits could

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.840
cover an estimated
1.2 million people,

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.000
according to a Rand analysis.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.240
A larger fix, in terms of
impact and political will,

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.750
is that the 19 states that
have not expanded Medicaid

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:07.150
could decide to do so.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.130
Another strategy
that's being discussed

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.810
is the reinsurance program.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.450
You may have heard that
Alaska just received approval

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.150
for their state
reinsurance program.

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:21.340
Now, while this is expected
to reduce insurance premiums

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:26.680
in Alaska and cover
more people, Alaska

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.240
is really a special case.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.750
For most states, this
would take until 2020

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:34.470
to set up a reinsurance program.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:37.240
Finally, while it appears
that most counties will

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.190
have at least one
insurer offering

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.770
plans in the
marketplaces this year,

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:45.160
Congress could consider a
fallback health plan option

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.620
to protect consumers if
they don't have a plan

00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:52.150
to choose from with subsidies
available to help qualify

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.790
enrollees to pay
for these premiums.

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.220
So what I want you
to leave with is

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.930
that there exists a range of
options and actions, big fixes,

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:04.840
little ones, for moving
forward to improving

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.850
healthcare in the US.

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:09.220
And I think as a debate about
the future of healthcare

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:14.710
in the US continues, I'd like
to close with a final thought.

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:19.750
More than 30 million people
now rely on the ACA reforms

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.010
and expansions.

01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:23.380
And there are nearly
30 more people--

01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:26.620
30 million people
who are uninsured.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.310
I think it is critical that
the health of these 60 million

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:33.550
people be the central
focus in our debates,

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.640
regardless of which approaches
or strategies are ultimately

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.896
chosen.

01:00:38.896 --> 01:00:41.270
So I want to thank my colleagues
at the Commonwealth Fund

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.490
for their valuable research.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.890
And also, on this last
slide, provide you

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:50.009
with some resources for your
own research and analysis.

01:00:50.009 --> 01:00:50.842
Thank you very much.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.270
- Thank you all so much for
your insightful comments

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:08.510
and wonderful lessons that
you've shared with us.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:12.470
I would like to ask, what
policies and conditions

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:18.470
from your expertise, be
it in California, in nine

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.460
other countries
across the globe,

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.290
do you believe that the United
States could feasibly adopt

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.890
say over a 10 year horizon?

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.830
There are undoubtedly an
incredible number of lessons

01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:37.160
that we could adopt at both
the federal and at the state

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.696
levels.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.070
And there are
undoubtedly lessons

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:43.880
that because of economic, or
political, or social realities

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.180
in our country that will be
difficult for the United States

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.740
to adopt.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.944
Given your expertise and
your years in the field,

01:01:50.944 --> 01:01:53.360
I wonder whether you could
help us understand a little bit

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.250
better, what, in
your opinion, could

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.325
be feasibly adoptable
over a 10 year horizon?

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:07.360
- I guess I'm the
optimist, or true optimist,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.170
here in the room.

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:13.900
I'm certainly not going to
disagree with Professor Hsiao,

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:21.220
but the California dynamic is
that you have 13 million people

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:28.840
on Medicaid, Medi-cal,
once again, and 15 million

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.940
who are underinsured.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.170
And it's a state of
39 million people.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.060
Right there, you're at 28.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.640
So I'm going to argue that
the benefit to this reform

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.380
is deeper--

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:44.230
it is broad, but
it also is deeper.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.090
And you have a government
that's controlled

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.900
two thirds by Democrats
and a Democratic governor.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.580
And that's not likely
to change in 2018.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.910
So the politics-- in our
view, the politics favor this.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:59.710
And you also have the
initiative process

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.930
in California, which can
be used both to overturn

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:05.110
legislation or enact it.

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:09.580
So those factors-- and
we came pretty close.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.460
The pharmaceutical
industry spent $131 million

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:17.320
to defeat a price control
initiative that got nearly 47%

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.080
of the vote in 2016.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.400
So I take those factors
together to say that we actually

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.920
have a real shot in
California, whether it's

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.020
2018 or with the next governor.

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:31.540
And we're pushing hard for 2018.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.300
We still think that this
can be the template.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.030
And so, all of a
sudden, if California

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:39.100
looked different from
the rest of the US--

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.200
for example in those
international comparisons,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.620
if it looked more like the
Netherlands or Australia--

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.530
don't think it's going
to get to the UK--

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:49.120
then that would be
a comparison that

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.010
then would motivate
the federal government

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.630
to move to a Medicare for all
type system much more quickly.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.380
That's our theory.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.470
- I think that one thing
to put into perspective

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:07.640
is that when we talked
about the single payer

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:13.340
Australia and Netherlands
is that these countries

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.150
transitions to this
about 40 to 70 years ago.

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:21.060
And it took at least 20 or more
years to get to that point.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.040
And so, we have to operate
within that political reality

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.940
when we're thinking about
next steps in the US

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.630
and the incremental
fixes that can be made.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:36.560
I do think that the state
natural experiments are

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.150
very powerful.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.030
And will-- I agree
with you-- will serve

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.100
to maybe motivate other states.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:48.140
But it really will
have to happen--

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.571
for big change to happen it has
to happen at the federal level.

01:04:51.571 --> 01:04:52.070
I'm not on?

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.540
Thank you.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:02.920
So I think I'll
stop there and let

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.560
Dr. Hsiao give more examples.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:15.230
- I don't have the magic
bullet for United States.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:19.520
I would really think there is--

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.270
I would divide into
three audiences.

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:26.690
One is what academics can do.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:33.230
Academics can actually try
to apply their knowledge,

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:40.820
design something realistically
and practically can be adopted,

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:43.580
and workout the step by step.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.460
I don't think that
work has been done yet.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:51.410
And I'm equally
guilty for America.

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:54.510
I gave up on America in 1993.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:59.330
That's why I turned towards
the international work

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.910
before I tumbled in Washington.

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:03.980
Every week I flew to Washington.

01:06:09.548 --> 01:06:12.890
On the political
participation, I really

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:20.060
think it's really important
how do you engage the citizens,

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:25.000
and also understand they
really have a stake in it.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.040
I will argue business leaders
know they have a stake.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.960
I know the provost of
Harvard, Alan Garber,

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.420
he faces a difficulty
to find the money

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.630
to pay for the increased
health insurance premium

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:45.250
last year where our
workers, unionized workers,

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:49.000
was going to go on
strike over that.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.610
So business leaders
really feel it.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:58.530
But these common people, many
of them, may not feel that.

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:03.470
And I think a lot of education
and grassroots organization

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:04.650
are needed.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:08.000
But in terms of policy,
I will put forward

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.550
a few ideas for you.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:18.590
One is trying to introduce a
public option, as Professor

01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:21.200
Carpenter pointed out.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:26.776
Originally, actually give
people a public option

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:30.460
and you can voluntarily enroll.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:36.970
And now, we have ACA in place,
but some places, there's no--

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:42.770
there are very few insurance
plans being offered to people.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:46.420
And the competition doesn't
exist in these places.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:49.670
Why not use a government option?

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:53.950
Say, this is what the
public can offer you.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:56.890
And you can buy it.

01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:00.430
We are not mandating you
have to buy the public.

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.435
Second, since
Medicare For All is

01:08:04.435 --> 01:08:08.580
going to be a very
attractive option,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:13.030
and is a wonderful
political slogan,

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:14.605
Medicare is not perfect.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:21.729
Medicare, the benefit package
and the payment system

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.670
needs major, major change.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:33.180
I was involved in late
1960 design Medicare.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.930
We know where we fell short.

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:44.960
But no political pressure
to fill in these gaps.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.380
Now when the drug
benefit came in really

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:54.149
under abnormal circumstances,
I would call it.

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:57.140
Medicare can be made better.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:02.819
We did not have so many elderly
people or nursing home care.

01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:06.870
We need a long term
care policy in America.

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:12.059
Look at Japan with the largest
number of elderly people.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:19.580
22% of the population
are over age 65.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.420
How do they take
care of that problem?

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:29.540
They pay you if you are
wanting to stay home to take

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.571
care of your mother or father.

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:39.260
Singapore, if you buy
a house within a mile

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.629
of your parents', your
mortgage rate is reduced.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:53.080
They had all these innovations
going around in the world.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.230
We don't look at them.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:10:01.410
We think America is the best,
the number one in everything.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:07.090
I woke up, sorry, when I began
to do international work.

01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:09.580
Other countries have
work ahead of us,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:14.800
as Michelle pointed out, among
all the rankings they gave,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.070
Netherlands, Australia, UK.

01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:21.170
American was the last.

01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:25.100
They must-- other countries
must be doing something right.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:30.290
I would-- so Medicare
needs to be improved.

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:36.890
Third, there are legal
barriers for state

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.540
to adopt single payer.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:49.280
Like ERISA law forbidding
you to say to the employees

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.570
you'll have to buy
certain insurance.

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:55.540
That's a barrier
California still face.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:11:00.900
That was the thing
we faced in Vermont.

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:05.790
We spend money employed and got
volunteered the best lawyers

01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:11.760
in America to advise us
how to get around that law.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.610
But we are not sure.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.960
A lot of these barriers
should be taken down

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.740
as intermediate steps when
you move toward better system.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:26.800
Sorry, I talk too much.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.750
So we can really take
a number of things.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:35.660
And it may take us a
decade, but I'm optimistic.

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:41.020
I think it's the second
presidential election from now,

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:45.070
from 2016, that's when
single payer is really

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:49.810
going to be debated
in a very serious way

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:56.980
and looking for real,
practical, viable, politically

01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.000
acceptable way.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.530
Here I-- sorry, I give you my--

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:08.710
I look at policy
making in three stages.

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:14.400
First-- this came from
poor woman's work.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.810
First stage is you get some
issue embraced as a key issue

01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:26.150
by some political party
or powerful group.

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:31.820
Now, Senator Sanders got the
Democrat party to do that.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:38.030
But that's a vision, like
a beautiful mountaintop.

01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:40.300
But it's not a
policy how do you go

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.780
from here to that mountaintop.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:47.940
Second stage is
to actually design

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:56.986
politically viable
options for that.

01:12:56.986 --> 01:13:00.580
Then third stage, then
you go through legislation

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:05.800
where a lot of horse trading,
or you call sausage making,

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.250
occurs.

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:12.290
Then you come up with
something really workable.

01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:15.441
We are, in my view, it's the
first stage with the latest

01:13:15.441 --> 01:13:15.940
event.

01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:20.170
- Thank you all so much
for your helpful responses.

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:21.525
I really appreciate it.

01:13:21.525 --> 01:13:23.650
We will yield the rest of
our time to the audience.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.415
Just as in the earlier
session, please

01:13:25.415 --> 01:13:27.040
feel free to come up
to the microphone.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.750
Please introduce yourselves.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:31.360
And please formulate
your remarks

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.620
in the form of a question.

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.820
Thank you.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.630
- Hello?

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:36.370
Hi, my name is Alexis Soul.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.170
I'm on Medicare.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.780
And I have union
health insurance.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:47.800
So I'm pretty set
unlike many Americans.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.040
I want to thank you all for this
fabulous, fabulous stuff you're

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.210
doing.

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:54.250
I lived in California
for about 30 years.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.890
And I'm very interested to
hear what happens there.

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:06.150
The elephant in the room when
Michelle was talking about--

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:10.390
no, no, it was Dr. Hsiao.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:14.530
You were talking about who
benefits by the current system

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:20.180
and how much money can be
poured into these elections.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.920
And I think that campaign
finance reform is something

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.970
that we should just always think
about and act on at any point.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:35.800
And I guess I want to ask
you all about your thoughts

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.660
about that.

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:43.580
- Quickly, we, in 2006,
sponsored Proposition 89

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.080
because we actually
believed that we

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.110
couldn't win this type of
reform without changing campaign

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.610
finance.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:53.210
And we actually targeted
initiatives, not just

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:56.450
candidates, for that
campaign finance reform.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.060
It did not do very
well, I must tell you,

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.880
in part because unions
didn't want us to change

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.610
how initiatives were funded.

01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:08.630
But we do believe that that
may still be a precondition.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:12.200
Though, the
experience of prop 61,

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.260
where we came close
despite the big money,

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.979
tends to create more
optimism than we had in 2006.

01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:19.520
But we agree.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.005
That is a key and
immediate problem.

01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:32.070
- Hi, I am-- my name is
[INAUDIBLE] I'm a senior

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.970
at Harvard College.

01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:34.225
I'm an undergraduate.

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:35.850
First thing I want
to say is all of you

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:37.724
on this panel and
the last panel,

01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:39.390
I want to be a physician
when I'm older.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.306
And I think I want to
go into health delivery.

01:15:41.306 --> 01:15:43.390
You're all legends.

01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:47.440
Just like thank you very
much for sharing your work.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.230
First of I'll say
my brother actually

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:50.546
works for Oscar Health.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:53.170
And they're trying to enter the
insurance market in California.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:55.290
And a lot of these issues
that you're tackling

01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.780
are things they deal with a lot.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.750
I, myself, I think I'm more
interested in Dr. Doty's

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:03.930
work, which is international
health systems.

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:06.180
And I had a pretty specific
question about something.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.500
You briefly touched on--
and Dr. Song briefly asked--

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.680
and it's about the Netherlands
and also Switzerland.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.050
Those are two nations that I
feel-- and I'll keep it short--

01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:18.600
they emulate basically
what we have here,

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.655
but they do it
right, like you said.

01:16:20.655 --> 01:16:22.030
You touched on
some of the things

01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:24.624
the Netherlands does well, but
both of those nations, I think,

01:16:24.624 --> 01:16:26.040
are grappling with
what we're also

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.280
grappling, which is an older and
increasingly sicker population,

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.592
and their costs
are rising as well.

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:33.300
The Switzerland is an
interesting example

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.790
because it's divided into
cantons, which is a little bit

01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:36.670
federalist as well.

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:38.814
It's similar to the state
structure we have here.

01:16:38.814 --> 01:16:40.980
I was wondering if you, or
others who know about it,

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.260
could comment on specifically
in the short term,

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:46.010
maybe not in the next
decade, but maybe

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:48.660
in the next five
years, what are some

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:51.099
of the things we could take
away from those systems

01:16:51.099 --> 01:16:52.140
and apply them to the US?

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.880
Because I do think
I'm of the mindset

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:59.340
that rapidly overhauling the ACA
for a full single payer system

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:03.570
is pretty divisive, and
having to convince 160 people

01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:07.830
currently insured under the
ACA that the increase in taxes

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:11.190
and potential premiums is better
than the care they already

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:13.380
receive or the
insurance they have.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:19.110
- So what I'll say about
Switzerland and the Netherlands

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:22.620
is from a delivery system
perspective they all

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:27.600
embrace the idea that
it's important to care

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.620
about chronic care
management and do it well,

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:37.260
to care about patients who are
the high need and high cost.

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.630
And they designed
their delivery system

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:44.620
to take care of that
population really well.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.300
And that means that
cost sharing is low.

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:52.260
The primary care
infrastructure is

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.170
designed to address
long term preventive

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.860
care for those populations.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.810
So they actually are able
to keep the costs down

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.560
for the highest needs
and the high cost.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.010
So that's one thing.

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:09.150
The other thing
that they do well

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.850
is really the cost
sharing for low income.

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:19.590
In Switzerland, they actually
rank with us pretty highly

01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:21.510
on out-of-pocket costs.

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.310
But that high
out-of-pocket cost really

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:26.040
is for higher
income individuals.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.850
What sets us apart is
that we have actually

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:31.590
high out-of-pocket costs for
low and moderate income families

01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:35.647
and other countries
don't do that.

01:18:35.647 --> 01:18:37.730
- Michelle, I'm curious
about this because we do--

01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:41.690
we get this debate
quite a bit actually.

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.310
My understanding
of those systems

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:49.250
is that the level of government
regulation and public financing

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.600
is quite high.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.630
And that people think
that these systems

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:56.049
are the same, but actually
in some fundamentally--

01:18:56.049 --> 01:18:57.590
politically, in some
fundamental way,

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:59.798
they're very different
because the role of government

01:18:59.798 --> 01:19:04.742
is far beyond what even is
standard in the US, certainly.

01:19:04.742 --> 01:19:06.200
And I wondered if
you could comment

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.200
on that political difference.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.741
Because it seems
like they're heavily

01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:11.060
regulated systems in that sense.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.770
- They are.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:16.910
I think that the ministers
will have heated debates when

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:21.530
they're developing
their budgets about how

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:24.980
the money is going to be
spent throughout the system.

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.900
And I have to say that from
the international perspective

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.480
that they actually
also come to us

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.760
to learn about bundling and
bundle of payments and the ACO

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.340
and lessons learned from there.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.650
So while I like to say,
oh, we have so much

01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:44.960
to learn from other
countries, that there actually

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.880
is a lot of
cross-fertilization of ideas

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.650
because they are grappling
with how to contain costs

01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:53.780
just as much as we are.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:58.220
- Can I throw a sour grape
into this discussion here?

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.770
The countries you mentioned,
Switzerland and Netherlands,

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:08.960
the highest costs among
affluent countries

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:13.400
is United States,
more than 17% GDP.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.240
The second one is Switzerland.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.710
The third one is
the Netherlands.

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.460
So if you are looking
for efficiency,

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.970
you may not want to do it,
but for practical reasons,

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:29.770
political reasons, you want
to look at them closely.

01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:31.190
And you are right.

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:34.880
Netherlands went
through a whole 10 years

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:41.620
really bring the private
insurance under control.

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.180
Pooling the risk nationwide.

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.850
Before it wasn't.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:52.725
And now, you pay the
premium to a central fund.

01:20:52.725 --> 01:20:56.085
The insurance collect the money,
but go to the central fund

01:20:56.085 --> 01:21:01.400
and then reallocated back
with the risk adjustment.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:08.060
But also, what they paid to the
providers are highly regulated.

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.800
But they give them some
room for flexibility.

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:17.470
- So my question here is
given that level of regulation

01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.900
and government
control, is that really

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.540
going to generate less
of a political fight

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.306
by the industry interests?

01:21:24.306 --> 01:21:25.430
That's a question, I think.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.920
- My name is Katherine Arrott.

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:36.530
And I'm on the board of--

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:41.990
Massachusetts has 27 regions
to provide in community care

01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:44.450
for the elderly
who are low income.

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:53.210
If we go back into the
early 2000s when HIV,

01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:54.980
we got our first drugs.

01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.940
But they were not affordable
except to the very well off.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.880
And we wanted to
share those drugs

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.030
with the rest of the world
because they did not have them

01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:13.640
and they could not afford them.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:19.370
And so, we approached and we
lobbied the drug companies.

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:22.070
And they finally
conceded, yes, they

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:26.210
would consent to selling the
drugs at a much lower price

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:29.810
provided their patents
were protected.

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:33.950
So you can reach out to the drug
companies and work with them.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.030
And I would suggest--

01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:40.270
now, one of the issues is with
the genome having been fully--

01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:42.170
not fully explored--
but that's why

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:46.910
everybody in the drug
companies are rushing forward

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:48.680
to develop new drugs.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.640
That takes money.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.730
So they've become a
place of great investment

01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:58.020
where there can be tremendous
return if they are successful.

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:02.690
The drug companies are in
all of the top 10 sections

01:23:02.690 --> 01:23:06.560
of endowments, mutual
funds, and everything else.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.070
And I think the only way to get
that under control and still

01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:12.860
allow them to get the
investments they need

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:18.320
to continue their work is to
treat them as a utility and say

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.720
you can have this percentage of
gain to do with what you want,

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.450
but you cannot continue to
raise your drug prices through

01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:32.540
the ceiling because somebody
will pay for it and then

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.660
re-invest in us because
they want to improve

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.590
their endowment.

01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:43.100
I think that's a discussion that
has to be had on a very broad

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:48.200
across because the times have
changed from how drugs could

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.220
be so successful.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.640
What do you think?

01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:05.030
- I'm a reader of the
Marcia Angel's books

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:07.040
on pharmaceutical industry.

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.280
So I have certain bias.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.430
10 years ago, I did look
at the financial reports

01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:20.100
of the big pharmas,
five major companies.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:25.610
The argument that if
you reduce the price,

01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:28.640
or allow regulation
of price, then

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:31.250
they are going to reduce
their research, to me,

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:34.460
is a scare tactic.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.840
If you look at detail what
they spend for marketing,

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:47.220
advertisement versus how much
they spend really for research,

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.430
they spend equal amount on that.

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:53.100
And if you look at
the past decade--

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:56.240
I'm not a student of
the drug industry,

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.010
but I follow a little bit--

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:01.580
so much of the new inventions
come from small companies,

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.010
and then they buy it.

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:06.325
So it's not--

01:25:06.325 --> 01:25:13.320
I think, yes, we should be
very careful not to deny-

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.130
to worry about it--

01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:19.050
we do want to keep
innovation and invention.

01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:23.100
But I think the case made
by pharmaceutical companies

01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.660
is exaggerated.

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.100
That's my--

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.410
And how do you do it?

01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:29.220
Look at England and Germany.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.860
They are countries
with big pharma--

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:35.030
and Switzerland.

01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:37.670
They negotiate with
pharmaceutical companies

01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:39.810
for prices.

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:44.850
Did that-- so many drugs that
they discover in England.

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:48.210
England is a major inventor
and production of drugs.

01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:55.730
And England doesn't let
pharmaceutical company just

01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:58.290
charge whatever they want.

01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:00.140
Now, of course, American
company's defense

01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:03.950
is to say, well, that's
why we have to make

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.350
more money from Americans.

01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:07.830
- So we can subsidize the UK?

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:08.330
- Right.

01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:13.280
- OK, thank you.

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:17.460
- Hi, I'm Bria Dunham.

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.380
And I'm faculty at
Balton University

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.600
and the Director of our
Undergraduate Health Science

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.560
program.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.890
You all acknowledged some of the
political thorniness involved

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:29.190
in moving from where we are
now to a single payer system,

01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:30.870
whatever form that takes.

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:33.390
And I was wondering if
you see any way forward

01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:36.180
through that thorniness
that is attuned to issues

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.370
of reproductive
justice, particularly

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:42.970
in the form of securing
publicly funded abortions.

01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:43.470
- Exactly.

01:26:43.470 --> 01:26:46.290
Two things, one is
SB 562 does that.

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:48.990
We publicly fund abortions,
but more interestingly,

01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:52.080
so does S 1804,
the Sanders bill.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.480
It actually overturns
the Hyde Amendment.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.540
And it's quite unique because
the other single payer bill

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.590
in Congress doesn't do that.

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.090
And that was a conscious
policy decision.

01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:04.770
That it would be--
it was assumed

01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:06.780
to be easier politically
not to do it,

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.967
but it was not acceptable
as policy to do it.

01:27:09.967 --> 01:27:11.550
And so, we think
it's very significant

01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:14.850
that both the California and
that federal bill go right

01:27:14.850 --> 01:27:17.182
and say, yes, we're going
to cover reproductive health

01:27:17.182 --> 01:27:18.390
services, including abortion.

01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:26.350
- Hi, my name is
Gabrielle Amascolo.

01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:29.140
I'm a retired pediatrician.

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:31.790
And I want to say
thank you to all

01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.990
for this such
informative presentation.

01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:39.490
And to you, Dr. Hsiao, I'm going
to ask that you don't give up

01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:43.682
on us lowly Americans
because we're not

01:27:43.682 --> 01:27:44.890
the ones you went to talk to.

01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:49.420
You went to talk to that
group on the right side,

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:52.540
the black money
group, who obviously

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.700
doesn't want to hear you.

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:58.360
And so, I think the
information you gave us--

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:02.020
it's a complex issue, but the
information and those numbers

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:07.040
you gave us are very easy
to understand for anyone.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:13.970
So I think that I would love to
see some research groups, some

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:21.670
of you maybe, really give
us lowly Americans the steps

01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:25.510
that we have to take
to climb that mountain

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:29.740
to change because obviously
we did it with ACA.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.200
Nobody thought
that that was going

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:35.260
to be good through one vote.

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.450
And we worked very
hard on doing it.

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:48.400
So I am really not totally
lost control of this,

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:53.890
but I do think that we
need to have education

01:28:53.890 --> 01:29:01.970
to us to really move onto the
grassroots in every nation--

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:05.590
every state rather--
and we need help.

01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:10.600
We can't do it just this
small, indivisible groups,

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.430
or whatever groups
we are working with.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.110
We need help.

01:29:14.110 --> 01:29:18.130
And I'm looking to
Harvard to give us that.

01:29:23.099 --> 01:29:24.890
- Thank you all so much
for your questions.

01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:27.918
Let me now turn it over-

01:29:27.918 --> 01:29:32.391
- Thank you very much.

01:29:32.391 --> 01:29:35.760
So it's my privilege
and great challenge,

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.400
given the fantastic
material that we covered

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.650
all afternoon and the
great variety of it,

01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:42.660
to summarize for you.

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.420
So I would say in
the first panel

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:49.770
we talked about how the ACA and
Medicaid, though they're not

01:29:49.770 --> 01:29:53.700
perfect, really have
a branding problem.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.250
So we talked about the
ACA, despite its near death

01:29:56.250 --> 01:30:00.060
experiences, has
achieved historic lows

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.430
in uninsured Americans.

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.000
And that despite the assumption
that Medicaid is broken,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.950
many of the patients
who receive it

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:10.170
are actually quite
happy with it.

01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:12.450
It feels instead as
though the problem, or one

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:14.520
of the problems, is that
millions of Americans

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:16.950
don't even know
they're on Medicaid.

01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:17.970
We have MassHealth.

01:30:17.970 --> 01:30:20.790
We have Kynect, Medi-cal.

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:22.560
That's a branding problem.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.990
We also have,
apparently, hundreds

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:28.870
of legislators who don't
know what these programs are.

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:31.560
They don't know what
the programs cover,

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.850
like long term care or opioid
treatment, who is covered,

01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:39.360
disabled children, and as they
discovered, not just low income

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.900
individuals, but also
much of the middle class.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:48.660
They also discovered that
the importance of the ACA,

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.470
and of Medicaid, as
fundamental economic pillars

01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:56.370
of many of our communities, as
employers, and also because,

01:30:56.370 --> 01:30:59.520
as Dr. Benjamin noted, that
a healthy population makes

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.830
good business sense.

01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:03.570
And so, for all
of these reasons,

01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:06.720
I think our legislators
heard this summer when

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:10.460
citizens rose up to protest.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.430
We also talked about
some paradigm shifts.

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:16.910
We talked about the current
fragmented system that's

01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:22.500
risen from our industrialized,
market driven medicine

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.570
that leaves us with high
administrative costs, high drug

01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:29.180
costs, and an imbalance
between specialists

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:30.980
and primary care
that would really

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.130
lead to an improvement
in public health.

01:31:33.130 --> 01:31:37.040
And that we may have $1
trillion wasted every year.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.070
That is quite a number.

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:42.560
We're talking about
a paradigm shift,

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.100
one that emphasizes
prevention over treatment,

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.800
and one that really
recognizes the profound social

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.450
determinants of health.

01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:53.870
We heard, in the first panel,
about Boston Medical Center's

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:57.680
programs to work with the
community on food pantries,

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.950
on housing, on jump
rope challenges.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:03.710
But Kate Walsh also
said they can't

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:08.570
be all things to all
people, which brings us back

01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:12.710
to the question of who's
responsible and of citizenship.

01:32:12.710 --> 01:32:15.600
We examined citizenship
at many levels.

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.310
We talked about states as
citizens in the federal system,

01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:21.200
and that the federalist
system itself

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.460
can be leveraged so that
states can test adaptations

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:30.270
as proof of concept and
as political strategy.

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:32.270
So for example, we
had Romney care here

01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:34.250
in Massachusetts
that was something

01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:36.140
of a model for Obamacare.

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:39.380
And California, I hope, can
hit the ball home for us

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.950
and really inspire the
rest of the nation.

01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:46.340
But we also talked
about political economy

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:49.220
and political reality
and some sour grapes.

01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.560
And Dr. Hsiao gave
us a dose of reality

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:55.100
that there are very
powerful, vested interests

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.226
behind these choices.

01:32:57.226 --> 01:32:58.850
I thought this was
an interesting point

01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:04.650
that there are many small
winners across the citizenry,

01:33:04.650 --> 01:33:07.600
but a few very powerful losers.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:11.340
And because of this, everybody
needs to be mobilized,

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.300
educated.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:16.230
Everybody needs to learn
what is at stake as voters

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:19.500
who hold our legislators
accountable, as employers,

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:24.640
as healthcare professionals,
as academics, and as advocates.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.520
Different sectors, the
only way we can do this

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.470
is for different
sectors to come together

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:32.020
to solve these problems
to elevate health

01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.630
as a shared value that
reflects our commitment

01:33:34.630 --> 01:33:38.469
as a nation to justice,
equality, and democracy.

01:33:38.469 --> 01:33:40.510
And with that, I thank
all our panels from today.

01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:42.343
And I thank you for
your fabulous attendance

01:33:42.343 --> 01:33:44.100
and questions.
