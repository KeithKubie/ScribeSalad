00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.296
When we use the quadratic formula, we want to be sure to use parenthesis. We

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.990
want to use parenthesis around the values of b, a, and c. For this equation,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.770
the value of a is 3, the value of b is negative 4, and the value of c is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.887
negative 5. So these are the placeholders for the numbers a, b, and c. You

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:21.604
should always do this when you start to solve a quadratic equation using the

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:26.534
quadratic formula. This will prevent us from making any sign mistakes with

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:31.656
negative b and the minus 4ac. So we plug in the value of b here and here, the

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:37.506
value of a here and here, and the value of c here. Now that we've plugged in,

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:40.966
it's time to simplify. You try simplifying this expression, and when you think

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.920
you have your final answer, enter it here. You can either write your answer as

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.870
two fractions with plus or minus in between them or you can enter in your

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.998
answer as one giant fraction. The plus or minus symbol will be in the

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:52.946
numerator.
