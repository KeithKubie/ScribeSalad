&gt;&gt; KOLEDA: Hi, I'm Eric Koleda from the AdWords
API Developer Relations team. This presentation

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.590
will provide an introduction to the AdWords
API Sandbox, and information on how you can

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.309
start using it. We get a lot of questions
about the Sandbox. And this screencast will

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.169
address the most common issues that developers
encounter. To get started, what is the Sandbox?

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:28.499
The Sandbox is a testing environment for API
calls. This means that the calls made here

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:34.670
will have no effect on your existing campaigns;
add groups, ads, and keywords. The Sandbox

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.800
is open to everyone, and it doesnÃ­t require
any tokens to use. Best of all, it's free.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.649
All you need to get started is a Google account.
And you may already have one. If you've already

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.679
sign up for AdWords, Gmail, YouTube or similar
Google services, you have everything you need

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.999
to start using the Sandbox today. If you donÃ­t
have a Google account, you can create one

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:03.019
from any e-mail address. So how do you use
the Sandbox? For authentication, use the login

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.450
and password of the Google account you selected.
The authentication method is the same as in

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.620
production. For v13, this means an e-mail
and Password Header. And for v2009, this means

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.570
generation an authToken. The key differences
between requests made to production in Sandbox

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.720
are the Header Values. The Sandbox automatically
generates five client accounts based on the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.700
Google account you choose to login with. The
format of this account e-mails is client_n,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.140
where n is a number of one through five, +
login id, where login id is the login of the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.540
Google account you used during authentication.
So for example, if you login using joe@gmail.com,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:56.400
one of your client accounts would be client_1+joe@gmail.com.
Another Header Value that's changed is developerToken.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.980
The value used here is not the same as your
productionToken. The format is login id++currency

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.500
code. You can look up the full listing of
currency codes on the AdWords API documentation.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.010
Finally, the Header applicationToken is ignored
by the Sandbox. You can leave without other

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.880
requests completely. Request made to the Sandbox
must be submitted against the different URL

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.210
in production. The basic URL structure is
the same and only the domain is changed. In

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.500
the v13 version of the API, the domain is
Sandbox.google.com. And then the v2009 version

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.640
of the API, the domain is adwords-Sandbox.google.com.
Before you can start making a request against

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.730
the automatically generated client accounts
we've mentioned earlier, you must first initialize

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.980
them. This is done by making a call to the
account service method, getClientAccounts.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
This request must be made as an MCC user,
so ensure you do not include the client e-mail

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.170
header. There are important tips and tricks
about the Sandbox that you should be aware

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.590
of. The XML format of the request sent to
the Sandbox are exactly the same as those

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.040
sent to production. The AdWords API namespace,
unlike the URL, should not be changed. Here's

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:32.260
an example request sent to the Sandbox, "Please
note the AdWords API namespace remains adwords.google.com."

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.599
If you use one of the official AdWords API
Client Libraries, making a request against

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.930
the Sandbox is easy. The only change required
is setting a flag in the configuration file.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.349
This makes it simple for your application,
to switch routine to production and Sandbox

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.819
Environments. Each library use a slightly
different flag, so consult the README file

00:03:50.819 --> 00:04:00.130
that was included with the library. The Sandbox
does come with some important limitations.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.020
Accounts in the Sandbox start empty. If you
already have an existing AdWords account,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.020
your Sandbox account will not contain a copy
of your production data. It is possible to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.700
write a script that populates your Sandbox
account with relevant data for testing. Also,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.109
Sandbox accounts reset approximately every
month, clearing out all the data within. Watch

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.740
for Sandbox reset announcements on the AdWords
API form. Another limitation is that some

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.710
method in the Sandbox returned dummy data,
specifically the ReportService, TrafficEstimatorService,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:41.629
and KeywordToolService. Finally, the Sandbox
has no web interface. There are a number of

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.300
great resources where you can get more information
about the Sandbox. Using the Sandbox provide

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.449
some of the basics covered here as well as
the limitations discussed. You've also written

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.099
the best practice article, detailing how to
initialize your account and how to simulate

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.520
error messages. If you have any follow-up
questions or encounter any problems when using

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.379
the Sandbox, push your question to the AdWords
API form, and we'll be glad to help. Thank

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.479
you for listening and enjoy using the Sandbox.
