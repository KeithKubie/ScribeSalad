1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.841
But I mean,

2
00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.960
the example I was using this in some of my colleagues have been broken by this

3
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.140
is,
is,
you know,
the Syrian war has been very well covered.

4
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:09.480
Every crime has been very well documented,
you know,

5
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.800
often with video footage of exactly the crime being carried out as it made any

6
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.540
difference whatsoever.
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.650
The Syrian one is one where you hear,

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.010
you hear rational people say that like Assad is not our enemy and that how do

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:28.860
you,
what do you feel about that?
I mean,

10
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:32.880
I think with dealing with the legacy of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the,

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.090
even if you want to help,
what's the point?
You can't,

12
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:37.200
you're only gonna make it worse.

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.200
I think a lot of people feel that way and I think that leads some people to

14
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.330
think Assad is not a good guy.

15
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.330
He probably does have the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hands,

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
but we should deal with them anyway because that's better than Iraq or

17
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.050
Afghanistan is because when we do get rid of,
uh,

18
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.600
a leader like Libya with Gaddafi or Iraq with Hussein,

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.680
that what happens is you get this power vacuum and then it becomes far worse.

20
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.070
We've tried every model.
We've tried invading Afghanistan,
taking over,

21
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.720
trying to rebuild the entire culture and armed forces and government ourselves

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.560
that has failed miserably.
Try to rock Libya,

23
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.190
tried leading from the back,
um,
you know,
limited intervention,

24
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
hoping that the guys on the ground could do the fighting for us.
And then Syria,

25
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.410
we've tried almost no intervention whatsoever.
Um,
and all three have failed.

26
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.790
So I think now you've got people,
I mean,

27
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
the thing I always think most people would say we should have intervened in

28
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:34.200
Rwanda.
I think almost everyone would say,
I mean,

29
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:36.600
Bill Clinton would say that's his biggest regret,
I think in this presence.

30
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.910
And most people would say,
we should have intervened in Rwanda.

31
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.010
I think everyone to happen tomorrow.

32
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.670
You'd have a lot of people here saying it's not worth it.
We won't help.

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.650
We can't make the situation better.
So why even try?
Well,

34
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:53.730
it's so hard when you look at the rest of the world and you see these horrific

35
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.900
conditions and you see war lords in power and you see atrocities being committed

36
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.260
and we're sitting over here and you know,

37
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.370
in the valley watching on Internet and drinking Starbucks,

38
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.170
you know,
oh,
it's just Trump.
Go say,

39
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.530
well more so American American foreign coverage was never was never great.

40
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.240
No.
Now it's almost gone.
I mean Yemen,
we'll see.
I mean,

41
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:19.870
because of the crash Shoji murder may be,

42
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.830
maybe something can happen with Yemen cause and there is a lot we can do that

43
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:25.650
because we are directly supporting one side.

44
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.810
It almost seems like what you were talking about,
but in a far lesser extent,

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.033
the,

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.880
the feeling that you get when you're in these war zones that it's almost like

47
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:35.820
it's not real that you're,

48
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.570
you're covering it through this lens so you're immune from it.

49
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.840
It almost feels like we view the massive conflicts of the world that way.

50
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.700
They're like,
we're watching it on television,

51
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:51.300
we're seeing it on our phones or our laptops.
It's not,
it's real.

52
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:55.170
I know it's real.
It is.
It's a real issue,
but it's not real.
Look in terms of,

53
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:58.740
it's not knocking on my door.
Yeah.
No,
it's almost like we feel about it that way.

54
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.860
Yeah.
And the numbers as well.
I mean,
you know,
in Syria it could be 800,000 dead.

55
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.230
Um,
do people really think what that means?
What does 800,010 actually mean?

56
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.420
Do they win?
I think with certain numbers,
you,
you just,

57
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.130
they just become a,
just becomes digits and it just doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

58
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.610
It doesn't,
uh,
you look,
if you hear five guys get killed in a shootout,

59
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.700
you go walk this five guys were dead.
Yup.
And you start thinking about it.

60
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.660
You hear a 500,000 people died on the other side of the planet.
It's almost,

61
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.800
it almost doesn't register.
Yeah.
But for you or registers.

62
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.010
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you know,
I mean,
the reason I started doing this,
you know,

63
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.920
when I was a kid,
as soon as I started reading about these situations and,

64
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.830
and you know,
when I,
when I,
I remember reading that in my government,

65
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:45.170
the British government was arming,
you know,
often the wrong side.
Yeah.

66
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.330
And these conflicts,
I remember thinking,
how is this not fun page news,
right?

67
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.620
How is everyone not talking about this every single day?

68
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.170
And I still feel like that now even though I'm clearly out of step with,

69
00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:55.630
you know,
most of the population.

70
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.550
But what you are so immersed is it hard for you when you come back and you see

71
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.430
the Trump gossip and all the nonsense and all the things that we engage in on a

72
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:08.050
daily basis here in America that are really trivial at best.
I mean,
you know,

73
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.420
is it hard for you to,
I mean,
you mean you,

74
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.330
you get to see the worst shit happening in the world all the time.

75
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.400
Is it hard for you to relate?
Yeah,
I mean,
you,
you,
you know,
I mean,
one of the,

76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.430
one of the main symptoms I had of,

77
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:25.830
of the PTSD from covering this for so long was,

78
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.600
was it was numbness to physical danger when I was there,

79
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.220
but it was numbness when I got back home.
So you'd come back and you know,

80
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.360
at one point you used to think,

81
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.210
if I come back with the footage I have of whatever conflict,

82
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.350
it's going to have some kind of impact.
It's going to create some kind of ripple,

83
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.660
right.
And you come back and you think it's going to be,

84
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.800
there's going to be nothing.

85
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.990
The film's going to go out as a few people are going to tweet.

86
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.560
A few people are gonna,
you know,
send me a message that that's it.
