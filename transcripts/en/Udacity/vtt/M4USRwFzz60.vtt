00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.140
We saw we can go from
decimals to percents,

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.860
now let's go the other way around.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.790
This is exactly the opposite of
the procedure we used before.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.040
Instead of moving the decimal
place two to the right,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.400
we'll move our decimal
place two to the left.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.665
Let's try this out with the quiz.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:19.685
In the U.S. Senate a 60% supermajority
is required to stop a filibuster.

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.645
A filibuster is basically
just somebody talking a lot.

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.195
What is 60% in decimal form?

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:25.885
Enter your answer here.
