Some of these features presented in
this lesson may be a bit advanced for

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.080
your first API, but
are definitely things to keep in

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.890
mind when you're ready to take
your next application public.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.740
But one of the best pieces of advice
I've heard in regards to making

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.960
developer friendly APIs is
to learn from the best.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.620
Check out the in point design and
documentation from providers you like.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.380
Or popular among the large
developer communities.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.250
Figure ou the things
they are doing right.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.930
And try to figure out the ways to
implement those good practices

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.840
in your own applications.
