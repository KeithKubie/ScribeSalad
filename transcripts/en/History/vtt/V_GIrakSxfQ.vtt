00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.877
- We're at my shop.

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:05.505
And it's a balmy 36 degrees in
Jamesville.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.798
Come on in.

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:08.007
This is my forge.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.634
I got this from a buddy of
mine.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.678
If you ever need anything and
you tell him,

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.012
he can usually find it.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.348
Got my anvil set up here.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.727
<i>And it's a bit small but
a Farrier anvil,</i>

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:21.271
<i>and it works fine for what I
today typically.</i>

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.690
A little welder that I use for
a lot of different things,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.695
my metal sculptures, any kind
of builds.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.073
<i>- My home forge is in central
New Jersey,</i>

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.617
<i>town of Edison.</i>

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.454
As you can see from behind me,
it's snowing.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.456
And that is fantastic.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.374
At least I'm warm inside my
shed.

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.962
I don't know anything about the
cameramen, though.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.339
They're--they're gonna be cold

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.258
standing on the outside looking
in.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.638
- For the most part, this is
where I do the jewelry

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:57.891
and my leather work,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:02.228
which includes saddle repair,
tack, et cetera.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.022
I make chaps.
You name it.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:07.942
This messy table right here is
typically what I'll do

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:11.196
any of my casting or soldering.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:13.865
I started doing it maybe ten
years ago

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.201
as opposed to sending the
castings out.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.911
It works great.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.123
This bench over here is kind of
where I do all the fine work,

00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:25.502
anything from sizing a ring,
stone setting.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:29.255
<i>Anything kind of small and
finicky I do at this bench.</i>

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.716
<i>And really, that's--that's
about it.</i>

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:32.967
It's a relaxing place.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.511
I enjoy it.

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.513
- So I'm almost done grinding.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.473
I haven't put an edge on it
yet.

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.142
But I want to test the heat
treat by beating the crap

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.562
out of something, so I'm just
gonna beat up

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.274
one of these 8x8s that I have
right here.

Back edge still straight.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.453
Nice.
Looks like it should survive.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.914
That is unless they throw
something really dumb at it,

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.042
like chop through at 2-inch
steel rod.
