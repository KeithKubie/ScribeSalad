00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.320
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh Matt, you brought Spud today. Can I hold him?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.210
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Of course.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi puppy, you're so cute. How old is he?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.637
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, my little canine friend here is about two years old, so that's about 14

00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:13.010
in human years.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.970
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, and how old are you my human friend?

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well actually I just celebrated my 30th birthday.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.290
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Happy Birthday.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.170
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, but why do you ask? How old are you?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.864
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; About 200,000 years old.

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:28.120
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 200 what, you look good for your age.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.650
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. What could I say?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.119
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But that's not possible, you can't be that old.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.497
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I know. I'm not 200,000 years old, but modern humans are. You should know

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:38.460
that, you're a genetics expert here at Udacity.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.942
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, yeah I knew that. Yeah, modern humans, homo sapiens have been around for

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.848
about 200,000 years, but we're not the only kind of humans that's existed on

00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:49.380
our home planet.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.480
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's true. Homo habilis was around for 2.5 million years.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.134
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right, homo habilis, one of the first primitive forms of human lived

00:00:57.134 --> 00:01:02.854
almost 2.5 million years ago before going extinct after a million years. In

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:06.445
total, they lived almost five times as long as modern humans have been alive

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:11.312
today. Actually, let's go look at the timeline and learn a bit more about human

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:12.540
evolution.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.570
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'll go with you, I'm just going to go put Spud down.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.176
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
