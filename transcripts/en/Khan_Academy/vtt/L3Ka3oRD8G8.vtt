00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:02.320
So far most of what
we've been focused on has

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.336
been Europe and some of
you all have argued that,

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:05.883
"Hey, why is this called
World War I? It should

00:00:05.883 --> 00:00:07.901
be called Europe War I." In reality,

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.067
especially because the
major European powers

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:11.852
had these empires throughout the globe,

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:15.321
it really was a world
war. The most significant

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:18.458
fronts were the Western
front and the Eastern front,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.587
but we have many, many, many other fronts,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.990
many other campaigns. A
lot of these helped shape

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.723
the modern world,
especially the world of the

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:29.083
twentieth century. You had
fronts, campaigns in Africa,

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.323
between the various
colonies that the empires

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.988
had in Africa. You had a
front here in the Caucasus

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:39.356
between the Ottoman empire and Russia.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:42.073
You had Japan involved.
Japan, in World War I

00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:44.474
was on the side of the
allies. It wasn't one of

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:47.213
the major actors in World
War I, but it helped

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.515
provide naval support,
it helped against some

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:53.668
of Germany's colonies in
the pacific and in China.

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.998
What I really want to
focus on in this video

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:00.930
is in some ways one of the
most interesting campaigns,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.600
or I guess several
campaigns of World War I,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.334
because it really helped shape the modern

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.072
Middle East and a lot
of the way countries are

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:11.342
shaped now and a lot of
the conflicts we now see

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:13.470
in the Middle East to
some degree can be tied

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.491
to what happened leading up to World War I

00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:18.832
and what happened after World War I.

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:20.486
Just as a little bit
of context, this entire

00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:22.483
region right over here,
what we consider to be

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:25.282
the Middle East now, especially Arabia,

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:28.159
was nominally under Ottoman control.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.238
The Ottoman empire had
been losing power for

00:01:30.238 --> 00:01:33.327
centuries leading up to
the twentieth century,

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.828
especially if you look
at the Arabian Peninsula.

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:38.572
It wasn't direct Ottoman
control. It was very

00:01:38.572 --> 00:01:41.596
hard to control the
various Arab tribes there.

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:44.737
Egypt by this point, as
we enter into World War I,

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:49.263
in the late 1800s the
British occupied, began

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:52.208
to occupy Egypt, essentially
took control of Egypt.

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:55.073
As we enter into World
War I, Egypt is officially

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:58.468
a protectorate of the British empire.

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:04.010
Egypt is, for all purposes, it is British.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.938
Egypt is of huge
strategic interest at this

00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:08.665
point in time. In fact,
it continues to be of

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:10.909
huge strategic interest because it has the

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.342
Suez Canal. The Suez
Canal is right over here.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:20.157
It's a man-made canal,
made in 1869 by the French,

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:22.277
and it connects the Mediterranean Sea with

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:25.074
the Red Sea. To see its
importance, you just have

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:28.330
to look at the map at a more global scale.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
It's the fastest way to
get from Europe by ship

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.932
into the Red Sea and into the Arabian Sea

00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:38.678
and to India, which was
a significant part of

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:41.072
the British empire there,
or to go further East,

00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:43.739
go into the Indian Ocean and
go to places further East.

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.875
It was of huge, huge,
huge strategic interest.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:50.264
That lays the groundwork
for, essentially, the

00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:53.409
various campaigns. Oftentimes
they would be collectively

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.436
called the Middle East
campaigns, or they're

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:59.434
separated sometimes as the
Sinai and Palestine campaign

00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:01.202
and the Mesopotamia campaign.

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:04.158
Mesopotamia, that's in modern-day Iraq.

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:08.061
The Sinai Peninsula, that's
part of modern-day Egypt.

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:14.696
Palestine in 1914, what was
then considered Palestine,

00:03:14.696 --> 00:03:19.007
is now part of Israel,
part of the West Bank,

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:21.748
part of the Gaza Strip, part Lebanon.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:24.490
As we'll see, all of these
countries that we now

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.933
recognize as different countries,

00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:30.930
Lebanon, Jordan, Syria,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.213
these were all kind of
carved and shaped by

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.263
what happened during World War I

00:03:36.263 --> 00:03:38.575
and at the end of World War I.

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:41.325
As we get to the beginning,
right at the outset

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:46.262
in 1914, the British
land right over here at

00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:50.656
the southern end of Mesopotamia.

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:52.342
Over the course of the war they just keep

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:56.006
driving northward along the Tigris River.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.986
They keep driving northward and northward

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:00.860
and northward. By the
end of the war, they've

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.863
essentially captured
what you would consider

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:07.088
most of modern-day
Iraq. For the most part,

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:10.407
it was a very successful
campaign for the British,

00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:12.661
although they did have
some significant setbacks.

00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:19.594
In particular, at the end
of 1915 you have the British

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:24.600
who are held up in Kut.
They were essentially

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.263
sieged by the Ottoman
empire, 147 days siege.

00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:32.662
After the 147 days they had to surrender.

00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:35.272
They were starving in there.
They couldn't get supplies.

00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:37.133
They were dying of
sickness. This is actually

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:41.821
a picture of an Indian soldier
after the siege of Kut,

00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:44.662
after they were taken
by the Ottomans after

00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:48.190
they surrendered. Even
though the Mesopotamian

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.330
campaign was successful
for the British, the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.203
siege of Kut is recorded in
British military history,

00:04:55.203 --> 00:04:57.082
or global military history,
as one of the biggest

00:04:57.082 --> 00:04:59.739
humiliations for the
British army, where you had

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:02.581
that many troops who had
to surrender. They were

00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.663
starving, literally, to
death. One thing I should

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:07.580
point out: I'm going to be
talking about the allies,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.934
the British troops, but
in the Middle Eastern

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:15.663
campaigns and the Sinai
and Palestinian campaign

00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:19.266
and in the Mesopotamian
campaign, Indian troops,

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:21.332
which were part of the
British empire, played a

00:05:21.332 --> 00:05:23.411
significant factor,
especially in the Mesoptomian

00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:26.407
campaign, and so did the Australian and

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:28.996
New Zealand troops. When
we talk about British

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.147
troops, we're also talking
about all of the various

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:34.889
nationalities that were
part of the British empire.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.070
By 1918, they were able
to capture much of what

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.825
is now modern-day Iraq, or
much of I guess you could say

00:05:40.825 --> 00:05:43.536
Mesopotamia. On the other side of, I guess

00:05:43.536 --> 00:05:45.909
you could call it on the Egyptian side

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.074
of the campaign, the
first few offensives were

00:05:51.074 --> 00:05:54.239
actually taken by the
Ottomans. They say, "Hey look,

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:57.748
the British hold the Suez
Canal. If we could take back

00:05:57.748 --> 00:05:59.796
the Suez Canal, that would
be a pretty crippling

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:02.265
blow for the British,
especially in their ability

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:05.598
to get to the various
ports of their empire."

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:09.496
So in 1915, you have
the Ottomans try to make

00:06:09.496 --> 00:06:11.902
an offensive to try to
capture the Suez Canal.

00:06:11.902 --> 00:06:15.987
It's repulsed. It fails.
They try again in 1916.

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:19.993
That fails again. After
that, the British then

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.552
take the offensive. Once
again, it's the British,

00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:24.666
but we're talking, they
have Egyptian troops,

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:27.597
they have Arab troops;
well, Egyptians are Arabs.

00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:29.796
They have Australian troops with them.

00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:30.932
They have Indian troops with them.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.663
They start to make an
offensive. That offensive

00:06:33.663 --> 00:06:35.673
essentially continues
through the course of

00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:45.657
World War I. In 1915 they are
able to defend the Suez Canal.

00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:49.009
In 1916 they defend it
again. By 1917, they're

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.929
making an offensive. After
several tries, they're

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:59.160
able to take Gaza in 1917.
Then they're able to take

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.070
Jerusalem, which was
kind of a major source of

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.996
prestige. Obviously
Jerusalem has a thousands

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:09.128
of years history of
various armies trying to

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:13.199
take Jerusalem. Then they
continue on and as they

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.599
saw that the end of the war
was imminent, especially

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:19.238
as we get into 1918, the
British were, and the allies

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:22.246
were, essentially on a land
grab. They knew that as

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:24.269
soon as an armistice is
called, it's kind of your

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:26.825
last chance to grab more
land, and then it goes

00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:29.135
to the bureaucrats to
start negotiating things.

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:31.604
So in 1918 the British
are essentially on a

00:07:31.604 --> 00:07:33.933
land grab, especially the allies.

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:38.468
They take Damascus. They
get all the way north

00:07:38.468 --> 00:07:45.072
to Aleppo. By the end
of 1918 you essentially

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:48.199
have the end of the war.
You have an armistice

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:50.598
at the end of October
with the Ottoman empire.

00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.320
We know that the Austro-Hungarians signed

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.826
their armistice in early
November, and so do

00:07:54.826 --> 00:07:57.806
the Germans and World War I is over.

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.731
Now, there's a bunch of
interesting things here

00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:03.069
and I'm kind of doing
a very broad survey of

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.335
these campaigns. One is the famous movie

00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:08.742
Lawrence of Arabia. It
took place during these

00:08:08.742 --> 00:08:11.460
campaigns. This is a
picture of of T.E. Lawrence,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.330
who was many, many, many
things, but he was this

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.247
interesting character
who helped the Arabs rise

00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:24.074
up against the Ottomans,
against the Turkish rule.

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.908
He was heavily involved
in helping to coordinate

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:30.282
the Arabs' uprising against the Ottomans.

00:08:30.282 --> 00:08:32.845
In this case, the Arabs
were helping the allies

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:37.489
essentially push the Ottomans back.

00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:39.840
The most interesting
thing, the outcome of this,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.664
and we'll probably talk
into a lot more detail

00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:44.577
about this in future
videos, is because by the

00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:47.801
end of the war you have
the allies in control

00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:50.406
of all of this territory
... in control ... let me do

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:54.793
that in a better color
... in control of all of

00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:57.471
this territory, right
over here, it was really

00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:01.794
left to them to carve up
the modern Middle East.

00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:05.535
It was agreed to ahead
of time that the French

00:09:05.535 --> 00:09:10.865
would gain control of what
is now Syria and Lebanon.

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:13.955
This is roughly, Lebanon's
right over there.

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:18.120
Syria, we're talking roughly this region,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.435
including Damascus, so
roughly this region right

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:24.065
over here, and it left
the British in control of

00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:34.998
what is now Israel,
Palestine, Jordan and Iraq.

00:09:34.998 --> 00:09:37.413
As we'll see as we go
into the 1920s, this was

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:39.413
all part of the British
mandate. They carved

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:42.380
it up and a lot of their
decisions have led to

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.933
a lot of what we now see
as the modern Middle East,

00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:47.069
and the French essentially
were in control up

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:51.463
here in Lebanon and Syria as
part of the French mandate.
