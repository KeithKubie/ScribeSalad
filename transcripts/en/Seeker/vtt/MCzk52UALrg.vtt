This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Squarespace.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.340
Are you off balance?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.700
The answer could be in your feet!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.320
Hey Everyone, Crystal here, back for DNews.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.910
Usually when it comes to controlling our balance
the brain and our vestibular system gets the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.170
credit and the glory.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.440
Our eyes, inner ear canal, and cerebellum
all work together to help us orient ourselves

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440
in space.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.320
But our spinal cords are really the unsung
heros when it comes to sensory-motor control

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.070
and reflexive muscle corrections that keep
us upright.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.300
The spinal cord is an oft forgotten but important
part of our central nervous system and is

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.800
frequently described as a collection of nerve
fibers and cells that conduct information

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.180
from our bodies to our brain.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.730
But the thing is, it’s not just an information
superhighway, it is also responsible for processing

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.780
some of that information before our brains
get the message.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780
Dont believe me?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.980
Ever rub your elbow after you bump it?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.010
It takes a little of the pain away right?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.390
Thats because adding additional sensory information
like “my elbow is being rubbed” to the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.530
information about pain being processed by
the spinal cord confuses the “my elbow hurts”

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.479
signal at a processing node.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.060
Because of this, less of the pain signal gets
through the gate to your brain, resulting

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.909
in you experiencing less pain!

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.039
The cells in our spinal cord are also responsible
for some of the reflexive corrections we make

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.530
unconsciously that keep us from falling over,
and scientists at The Salk Institute think

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.060
that the set of neurons they recently discovered
are part of that circuit.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.119
One of the cool things about this newly identified
set of neurons is that they are specific for

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.249
light touch, not touch in general and they
connect both to the spinal cord *and* respond

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.039
to innervation from brain pathways descending
from the cortex and the cerebellum.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.450
The scientists propose that this set of cells
may serve as an integrative node to generate

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.700
posture adjustments and corrective movements
that counteract foot slippage.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.709
They called this special set of neurons “ROR
alpha” because scientists mostly suck at

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.759
naming things, and because those neurons express
a specific identifying receptor called, coincidentally,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.350
ROR alpha.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.539
They compared mice deficient in RORa neurons
to “normal” or “wild type” mice and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.390
they found that deficient mice were were still
able to walk and stand normally on flat ground

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.049
but were less sensitive to stimulations across
their skin or to other sensations like sticky

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.349
tape on their feet.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.600
Researchers saw the biggest difference when
the mice were challenged to tasks requiring

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.890
fine motor control and skills like walking
across an elevated beam.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.590
In head to head competition on these types
of tasks the RORa deficient mice struggled,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.370
and the wild type mice did not.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.180
Researchers attributed this to the animals'
reduced ability to sense when a foot was slipping

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.410
off the edge and respond accordingly with
small adjustments in foot position and balance.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.140
I think it would be so interesting to see
if this newly discovered neurocircuitry is

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.450
stronger in dancers, athletes, or people in
other professions where using your feet and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.819
staying upright is harder than it sounds.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.550
But to answer that question, we’d need to
see some of these experiments repeated with

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.480
humans, not mice, as the model organism.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.599
For now, the next time you’re walking across
a high-wire, balancing on a ledge, or trying

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.890
to look cool in your yoga class, take a second
to appreciate all of the many subtle and reflexive

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.370
corrections your body is making to keep you
upright, and give a little credit to your

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.180
spinal cord for all its hard work

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.200
