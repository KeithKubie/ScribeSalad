WE COMPLETELY DISAGREE ON SO
MANY ISSUES.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:31.597 size:78% position:39%
BUT YOU HAVE THE RESPECT.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.966 size:75% position:38%
HE WAS VERY LOYAL TO HIS
MEMBERS, TO HIS CAUCUS.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.835
IT SEEMS LIKE THE 

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.204
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.941
&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY SAID TO HIM EITHER
YOU SHUT DOWN GOVERNMENT OR YOU

00:00:41.974 --> 00:00:43.176
GIVE UP THE GAVEL.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.579 align:start position:0%
AND HE RESPONSIBLABLY GAVE UP
THE

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.015 align:start position:0%
GAVEL AND KEPT GOVERNMENT
OPEN.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.085 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
OBAMA, WITH THE PRESIDENT.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.152
&gt;&gt; YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start position:0%
DO YOU WINCE WHEN YOU SEE HIM IN
HIS MOM JEANS.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.325 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HIS MOM JEANS?

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:00.827 align:start size:91% position:9%
 YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.462
THEY KIND OF HIKE UP TO HERE AND
THE FLAT FRONT.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.896
&gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.699
LET'S TALK ABOUT IF YOU WOULD
THE UPCOMING ELECTION, A COUPLE

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
OF THINGS.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.168
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.171
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE ALL GOOD
CANDIDATES RUNNING ON THE

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:17.343 align:start position:0%
DEMOCRATIC SIDE ANY ONE OF THEM
WOULD BE A GOOD PRESIDENT.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.680
BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS THE
PERSON WHO WILL BE NOMINATED.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.816
SET IFTHE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT
HAPPENED ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:28.087
OR WOULD YOU STILL BE-- OKAY,
GIRL, I DON'T DON'T AGREE WITH

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.926 align:start position:0%
YOU, BUT YOU KNOW, WE STILL GOT
IT.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.027 align:start position:0%
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.030 align:start position:0%
AS FAR AS THE GOP OF THE
REPUBLICANS, WHO IS THE LEAST

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:39.699 align:start position:0%
CRAZY OVER THERE?

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.534
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A HARD CONTEST.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:47.206
I WOULD NAME SEVERAL BUT I
DON'T WANT TO GET THEM IN

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.274 size:75% position:38%
TROUBLE IN THEIR CAUCUS.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:52.278 align:start size:97% position:3%
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITH CHRIS
CHRISTIE.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:58.951
HE TOUCHED THE BLACK PRESIDENT
AND NOW HE CAN'T BE PRESIDENT.

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:03.990
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE HAS OTHER PROBLEMS.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:10.563
AT THE INAGURATION OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP WOULD YOU WOULD BE 

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.498 align:start size:97% position:3%
PROJECTILE VOMITING OR IN YOUR
MOUTH.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:16.035
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, HE
IS NOT GO TO BE PRESIDENT AND HE

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:16.869
KNOWS THAT.
&gt;&gt; YOU THINK?

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.605
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE HE KNOWS

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.142
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT BOOK SALES
AND LECTURE FEES, I MEAN FOR ALL

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.577 align:start position:0%
OF THEM.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.847 align:start position:0%
MAYBE NOT-- JEB BUSH-- NOT FOR
HIM.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.984
DO YOU HAVE REGRETS N THE HOUSE
OR AS SPEAKER, DO YOU EVER WISH

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:33.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
MAN, I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT
THAT DONE.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.789 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ONE REGRET, IS THAT YOU HAVE
TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF GUN

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.024 align:start position:0%
SAFETY IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:43.029 align:start position:0%
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST HURDLE WITH
PASSING ANYTHING.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:46.332 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING
EVER HAPPENS.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.734 align:start position:0%
IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING TO
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SEE

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:49.735 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:52.004 align:start position:0%
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
STUMBLING BLOCK?

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:54.307 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE NATIONAL RIFLE 
ASSOCIATION AND THE GUN OWNERS

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.341 align:start position:0%
OF AMERICA.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
THEY THINK PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE
AWAY THEIR GUNS.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.712
&gt;&gt; NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE AWAY
THEIR GUNS.  WHAT WE DON'T WANT

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.881 align:start position:0%
IS PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE A
GUN TO HAVE A GUN.

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:06.185
ONE TIME WHEN I WAS IN A CHILD
CARE CENTER IN MY DISTRICT, WE

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:09.488
WERE PLAYING ON THE FLOOR, AND
THIS FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.924 align:start position:0%
AND A BALLOON POPPED.

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.660 align:start position:0%
AND ONE OF THE CHILDREN SAID
DROP.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:16.429 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.ISN'T THAT-- .

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.498
 YEARS OLD.FOUR YEARS OLD, DROP.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.534 size:84% position:42%
SO SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:25.471 align:start size:97% position:3%
IT'S IN THE CULTURE.SO WHAT'S
MORE IMPORTANT.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:29.542 align:start position:0%
POLITICAL SURVIVAL OR THE
SURVIVAL OF CHILDREN IN NEWTON,

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:30.743 align:start position:0%
COLLEGE KIDS IN OREGON.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:35.448
.YOU KNOW THE GAME KEEP IT A
HUNDRED, KEEPING IT 100 PERCENT

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:39.218 align:start size:94% position:6%
REAL.  IF YOU DO, YOU GET A
STICKER.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.353 align:start position:0%
IF NOT A THROW TEA AT YOU
&gt;&gt; CAN I KEEP IT?

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:40.987 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES. OKAY.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.388 align:start size:75% position:25%

QUESTION.

 YOURE IN A HOT AIR BALLOON. 
AND FALLING RIGHT NOW.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.927 align:start position:0%
WHY, BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MUCH
WEIGHT.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.196
THERE ARE THREE OTHER PEOPLE IN
THAT HOT AIR BALLOON AND YOU

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.131
HAVE TO GET RID OF ONE OF THEM.

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.000 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.169 align:start position:0%
ONLY RELATABLE QUESTIONS IN KEEP
IT A HUNDRED WHO DO YOU THROW

00:03:57.202 --> 00:04:00.806 size:78% position:39%
