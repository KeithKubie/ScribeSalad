00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.340
we're going to be doing some rounding,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.800
which you're probably not
familiar with just yet

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.150
but you'll see that it's
pretty straightforward

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.840
and we're going to start by
rounding to the nearest 10.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.930
So the first question is,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.860
what is rounding and
why is it even useful?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.800
Well, let's say that
you have the number 37.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.460
It's a fine number.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.170
But let's say that you
have to do some math

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.270
with the number 37

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.010
and you can do a lot of
math with the number 37.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.670
But let's say you just wanna estimate

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.190
what something might be.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.350
Let's say that if someone
says, hey, I have 37 pickles

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.520
and you have 39 pickles,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.660
roughly, how many do we have together?

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.740
We don't have to have it down

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.630
to the exact number of pickles.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.850
Well then, rounding will
actually be a very useful tool.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.560
But let's just focus on what it means

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.320
to round to the nearest 10.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.830
So when they're talking about
rounding to the nearest 10,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.500
we're gonna be thinking about
the tens place of the number.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.030
So we can see right over here

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.870
in our tens place, we have a three.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.390
And so that three represents three tens.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.660
So the number 37, it's
three tens and seven ones,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.400
so it is more than three tens

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.610
and it's gonna be less than four tens.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.920
So this number is going to
be more than three tens,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.860
I could do it like this.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.540
It's gonna be more than three tens,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.580
which we can represent like
that, three tens and zero ones,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.250
or you might know that as 30,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.950
and it's going to be less than four tens

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.200
or also known as 40.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.840
And so, when you're rounding,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.920
you're either going to
round to the number of tens

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.780
that is right below this number

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.550
or the number of tens
that is right above that.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.950
But how do we know whether 37

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.740
rounded to the nearest 10
is going to be 30 or 40?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.010
Well, to answer that question,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.720
let's first just do it
visually on a number line.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.780
And then we can come up with
some rules for ourselves.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.220
And so, first of all,
let's just count by tens

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.990
and we make sure we include 30 and 40.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.293
So, if we start at zero, 10,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.630
20, actually, let me have
a little bit more space

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.990
'cause I wanna see the interesting things

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.140
that are going to go on.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.003
Zero, 10,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.653
20, 30,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.910
40, that's enough, but
I could just go to 50

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.880
just to complete this number line.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.560
And so, where is 37 on this number line?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.400
Well, it's between 30 and 40,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.460
and if I wanted to make
it a little bit clear,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.000
if I said that this is
35 right over there,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.460
right in between 30 and 40,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.230
then 37 is going to be right about,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.630
right about here.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.790
So, that is 37.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120
And so, when you're
rounding to the nearest 10,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.060
and remember, we're picking

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.660
between three tens and four tens,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.550
you say which 10 is it closest to.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.370
Is it closer to three tens
or is it closer to four tens?

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.740
Well, you can just look at this

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.000
and say, hey, it looks a
lot closer to four tens.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.740
And so in this situation,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.870
37 rounded to the nearest 10

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.790
is going to be 40.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.090
And so, you might ask a question,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.520
well, give me another number.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.800
What if someone said 32

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.500
rounded to the nearest 10?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.960
Well, 32 is going to be right over here.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.410
And then you'd say, all right,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.640
well, that's between
three tens and four tens,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.890
but it's a lot closer to three tens,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.280
so 32 rounded to the
nearest 10 is going to be,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520
is going to be 30.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.140
Now, an interesting question
that you might be wondering

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.320
is what if you're right in between?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.130
What if we wanted to round
35 to the nearest 10?

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.130
35, once again, it's between
three tens and four tens,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.280
between 30 and 40.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.400
Which one do we round to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.270
if we wanna round to the nearest 10?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.470
Well, the rule is, and this
is really just something

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.830
that the society has decided on

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.180
is that if you're right in
the middle, you round up,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.740
so the number 35 is
going to round up to 40.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.560
Even though it's exactly five away

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.000
from each of these numbers,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.960
35, if you're right in between,
is going to round up to 40.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.850
If you're a little bit less than 35,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.340
then you're going to round down to 30.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.410
With that out of the way,
let's do some more examples.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.130
Let's do, actually, let's do an example

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.310
of a three-digit number,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.550
where we're rounding to the nearest 10.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.980
Let's say that we want
to round the number 124

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.343
to the nearest 10.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.090
Well, there's a couple of ways

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.300
that you could think about this.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.430
You could say that this is
100, two tens and four ones.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.660
Or you could even view this
as 12 tens and four ones.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.897
So you could say, hey, this is in between,

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:02.990
12 tens and four ones,
it's greater than 12 tens,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.470
which is 120, and it's less than 13 tens,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.030
which is 130.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.030
These are the two tens that
are closest to this number.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.530
And then to decide which one it rounds to,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.300
you might already be
able to think about it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.370
based on some of the
rules we came up with,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.150
but let me draw it on
a number line for you.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.130
So we draw a number line,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.560
and I'm not going to start at zero,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.260
because we have to get all the way to 130,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.060
so let's just start,
I'll start at a hundred.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.700
So, this is 100, 110,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.373
let me draw the number line,
we're going to have 120,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.480
then we go to 130.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.850
I'll just do 140 here

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.770
just for filling out the number
line that I've drawn so far.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.390
And then I'll draw the
halfway mark, which is 125.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.900
And then, see its halfway,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.490
so maybe a little bit closer to there.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.750
And then 124, we do it in this red color,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.520
124 is right over there.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.690
124.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.410
And so, if we're trying to
pick between 120 and 130,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.410
between 12 tens and 13 tens,
which one is it closer to?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.030
Well, we can see it's
only four away from 120

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.420
while it's six away from
130, so we would round down,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.640
we're going to round down
to 120 in this situation

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.670
if we're rounding to the nearest 10.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.627
If this was 125 or 126

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:36.020
or 127 or 128 or 129, well
then, we would round to 130.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.020
And of course, if it was 130,
we would round it to 130.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.270
Let's do one more example.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.570
And actually, I'm going
to do a one-digit number.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.990
Let's say we wanna round
seven to the nearest 10.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.990
I'll write it out, round
seven to the nearest,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.160
nearest 10.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.360
Pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.390
All right, well, seven
is between what two tens?

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.880
Well, seven is less than one ten,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.090
so it's less than one ten, and
it's greater than zero tens.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.800
So, it's between zero
tens, which is just zero,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.800
and one ten, which is 10, but
which one does it round to?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.763
Well here, once again, we
can draw our number line.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.180
So, we'll do zero and then this is five

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.290
and then this is 10,

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.410
and seven is right about there.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.810
That is where seven is.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.060
And we can either visually see that seven

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.567
is closer to 10 than it is to zero.

00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:40.330
It's only three away from 10

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.110
while it's seven away from zero,

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.000
so you would round up to 10.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.270
Or you can use the rule
that we just thought about.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.270
Seven is greater than or equal to five,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.160
so you round up.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.610
You round to the 10 that
is higher than this number.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.140
If this number was, if in
this ones place, I can say,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.200
if your ones place is between zero,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.350
it's greater than or equal to zero

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.050
but less than five, then you round down.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.630
And you can see that happens
in all of these situations.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.180
If you look at 37, you
look at the ones place

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.170
and your ones place here is
greater than or equal to five,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.130
so you round up.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.520
Here, if your ones
place, it's greater than

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.540
or equal to five, it's five
exactly in that situation,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.580
so it's equal to five,
once again, you round up.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.100
If your ones place is less than five,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.160
well, in this situation, we round down.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.660
If your ones place is less
than five, you round down.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.930
Your ones place, and here,
you only have a ones place,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.423
but it's greater than or
equal to five, we round it up.
