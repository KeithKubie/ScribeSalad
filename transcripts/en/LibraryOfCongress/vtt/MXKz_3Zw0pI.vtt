00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.030
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick:
Well, good afternoon.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.970
I think I know most of
you but for those of you

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.070
who don't know me I'm Bob Patrick.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm the director of the Veterans
History Project here at the Library

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.070
of Congress and we're
actually thrilled today

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460
to be able to sponsor this program.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.470
We always welcome people who
are on the same road with us,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.500
people who have an affinity for
veterans, who interview veterans,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.350
who do creative things
around veterans.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.390
It's always good to welcome someone
on board with us in that way.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.510
Just a little bit about the
Veterans History Project.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.520
The Veterans History Project
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.810
in our 15th year is a Congressional
mandate to collect and preserve

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.380
and make accessible the wartime
memories of America's veterans

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.420
and as I said we've been doing
that for the last 15 years.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.780
We've accumulated an archive of
just short of 100,000 collections

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.310
of veterans from World
War I all the way

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.610
up to the current conflicts
of today.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.900
That is an ongoing process that
has been done through the efforts

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.770
of volunteers literally across the
country, every state in the union,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.610
every congressional district,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.270
everywhere across the states people
have been sending in their stories

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.490
of America's veterans
so we get some hundred

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.200
or so collections every
week that come into us.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.740
We do this primarily through oral
histories of people sitting down

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.030
and interviewing what we call
the veteran in their life

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.080
and it could be someone in their
family, someone in their community,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.070
someone they worship with,
someone they shop with

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.800
or someone they just don't know
but they've become an acquaintance,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.720
and we encourage people to do that.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.600
So whenever I come out to a venue
like this or even run into somebody

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.530
on the street I asked them who
is the veteran in your life

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.510
and each one of us has
a veteran in their life.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.790
It may not be a family member but
it may be what I just talked about,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.110
it's someone that you know
or someone you run into

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.960
or someone that's just
an acquaintance

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.770
through a friend of
a friend or whatever.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.270
And I would encourage you
to think about participating

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.430
in the Veterans History Project.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.080
If you don't know it there is
an information center down here

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.020
on the first floor in
the Madison Building,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.990
Room LM 109, an information center.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.400
We can get more information
about interviewing veterans.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.780
We have our field kit that
we can hand out to you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.430 position:56%
that tells you everything you need
to know about interviewing a veteran

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.310
or collecting materials if a
veteran has passed on things

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.830
like photographs, letters,
diaries and we'll hear a little bit

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.150
about photographs today
and you'll get a sense

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.840
of what treasures those can
be for projects such as ours

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.290
and if you want to
take it a step further,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.910
just another small
advertisement, this is a document

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.860
that was recently published that
is doing veterans oral history

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.840
and we're very proud of
this because this was done

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.320
through the Oral History
Association here in America.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.440
We worked with them,
professional oral historian,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.860
put this book together and it tells
you in a little bit more detail

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.110 position:56%
than what we tell you in our field
kit about how to interview veterans.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.410
This is available.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.340
If you'd like to get it
we'll talk to you later

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.920
about how you can get a copy of it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.200
but it really is taking
it a step further

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.500
and I'm really proud
that we have this now.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.520
So enough about the project,
let's talk about our guest today.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.770
Adam Harrison Levy is a
writer and a freelance

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.320
and documentary film
producer and director

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.760
and as I said he has
interviewed veterans.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.060
He knows veterans.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.630
He's worked for the BBC and
documentaries on from D-Day

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.730
to Berlin and in the
Nuremberg trials as well

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.460
as the photographic gallery
exhibition on Hiroshima.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.070
He is currently treaching
at the School of Visual Arts

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.990
in New York City but
previously has been

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.630
with Wesleyan University
and Yale University.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.690
If you've read the promo to
this particular talk it talks

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.070
about a suitcase full of
photographs of Hiroshima

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.170
and some other veterans
involved in this

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.710
and intertwining this
into nonfiction.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.170
I'll leave it at that and turn
it over to Adam Levy Harrison,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.510
excuse me, let's try this again,
Adam Harrison Levy, excuse me -

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.700
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.590
&gt;&gt; Adam Harrison Levy:
Thank you all for turning

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.520
out on a Friday afternoon.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.180
Thank you Bob and thank you
Monica for inviting me here.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.230
It is an honor definitely and I
guess today just to kind of sketch

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.820
out what to expect I'm going to
talk about some unknown photographs

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.110
from the beaches of D-Day which I
turned up a number of years ago,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.470
I'll talk about that, a little
bit of a kind of philosophy

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.000
and methodology of interviewing
and then a cultural history

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.360 position:56%
of the interview which I have to say
I'm putting together at the moment

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.410 position:56%
and it starts with the 19th
century and moves up to the present.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.860
It's definitely a subjective
history.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.330
It's not the story but it's a story
and no one seems to have written

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.220
about the history of the
interview so I'm keen on them,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.920
and the last part which
Bob mentioned is the story

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.320
of 700 photographs that were found
in a suitcase on a street corner

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.520
in Massachusetts and my a story
of how to figure out what happened

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.940
to those photographs and
how they came to be there.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.240
So -

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.400
hopefully this will work.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.790
Another click?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.290
Okay. So as Bob mentioned I've been
working as a documentary filmmaker

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.300
and one of the things that we do
as researchers obviously is turn

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.440
up interviewees and turn
up documents and this was

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.870
about five years ago and I was
working on this big series with BBC

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.120 position:56%
and it was finished, it was editing,
and the producer called me up

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.580
and said look we need this document
can you go find it and it was

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.140
at the Brown University Library
and I called the archivist there

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.500
and you know I'm sure a lot of you
are archivists, a wonderful breed,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.670 position:56%
know everything in sort of lateral
serendipitous ways and this man said

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.760
to me do you know Manuel Bromberg?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.600
He was a U.S. war artist?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.560
And I kicked myself because I had
been working on this for a year

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.940
and I'd never heard of him and
it was done and filming was done

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.390
and I thought well I have to
go check this U.S. war artist.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.350
I didn't know anything about
the U.S. war artist program.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.280
So I went to visit Manuel Bromberg.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.420
He was in Woodstock, New York, in a
beautiful modern house and a ravine

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.260
that looks out over Woodstock
and I drove up, came to the door

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.220
and he greeted me very kind
of stately, impressive man

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.210
with a big strong brow and
swept back gray hair sort

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.160
of like you'd expect an 80-year-old
artist to look like and I went in

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.660
and it was very important
for interviewing to kind

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.230
of make that initial bond.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.530
We sat down.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.830
His wife brought us tea.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.130
We talked for a little while.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.650
I told him upfront that I
couldn't include him in the film

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.220
but I was very interested
in the story and his work

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.850
as a U.S. war artist
and then we went into --

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.820 position:56%
, his wife cleared the table and we
went into the dining room and I took

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.000 position:56%
out my tape recorder and took out my
notebook and started an interview.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.570
So I think an interview should
feel like it's a conversation

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.300
but it's a conversation
with an agenda

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.570
and that agenda is held
by you, the interviewer.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.600
So ideally that interview and
that agenda is not a rigid set

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.420
of unalterable questions but
something that's more fluid,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.480
a narrative with a through line
like a plot but leaves room

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.990
for free association
and improvisation

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.550
so it's kind of like jazz.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.380
There's a structure but within
that structure there's room to kind

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.650
of pick up on the free
association and improvise

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.120
and two important parts of that
is instinct and improvisation

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.850
and I should be clear that I'm
not a hard news interviewer.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.910
I tried that once and it
was a complete disaster.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.550
My style is to evoke
rather than to provoke

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.640 position:56%
and for me an interview is something
that takes place between people.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.880
It's literally an interview
and I like to think of it

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.060
as a collaboration between
myself and the interviewee

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:44.470 position:56%
so in a way you're sort of helping
the interviewee articulate a version

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.490
of themselves or a
version of their memory

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.580
that maybe perhaps they haven't
articulated before to themselves.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.230
So in that way a good interview
is never impersonal it's personal

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.040
and you become in effect a
partner in their own understanding

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.090
of themselves so it's a skill
that forces you to listen.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.460 position:56%
You have to train yourself literally
almost to get out of the way,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.520
to shift attention
away from yourself

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.360
to focus the conversation
on the interviewee.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.050
So in other words an
interview is a journey

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.320
into the interior landscape
of another person.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.000
At the core you are asking
what is it like to be you?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.900
So the question what is it
like to be you has a history.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.810
As a journalistic genre
the interview evolved

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.110
in the mid-19th century from
verbatim printed court reports

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.890
in newspapers using direct
dialogue but as in August, 1859,

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.550
when a journalist Horace
Greeley [phonetic] traveled

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.090
to Salt Lake City to
interview Brigham Young

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.610
that most historians agree
the first interview took place

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.520
and it was interesting that it was
in a question and answer format

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.880
that we recognize now and it was
quite respectful but also pointed,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.000
especially on polygamy
as you can expect.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.700
Everyone wanted to know about
polygamy with the Mormon religion.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:20.340
And Greeley questioned Young
respectfully and Young replied

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.730
that he had 13 wives and we now
know it's closer probably to 70

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.420
so there's a little bit of as
always in interviews a little bit

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.930
of shading of the truth there
right at the very beginning.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.740
So there's something about
that because in the origin

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.330
of the interview and
the fact that it comes

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.280
from trial court reporting
there is something

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.210
that shadows the whole genre
no matter how empathetic

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.110
or nuanced the interviewer
is because it's part inquiry,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.790
part voyeurism and part cat
and mouse verbal exchange

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.000
so this journeying into someone's
interior landscape is inevitably

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.390
also a probe successful only

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.290
if the interviewer brings
back something meaningful

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.590
from this interior world.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.680
So Saul Bellow, the
writer, understood this

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.710
when he described an
interview as being

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.760
like thumbprints on his jugular.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.180
At its darkest there is an edge of
attack woven into the very form,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.140
an attack aimed at
personal revelation,

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.010
the so-called killer interview
or jugular journalism.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.220
Interestingly there was almost --

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.840
, there was a distrust of the
interview almost simultaneously

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.000
with its origin and here's
a story to illustrate this.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.450
So in 1889 Richard
Kipling undertook a jury

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.920
to interview his literary
hero, Mark Twain.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.630
After relating his difficulties

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.770
of finding Twain's house Kipling
succeeded in convincing Twain

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.770
to sit down for an interview.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.970
They first discussed, and
it's incredibly boring,

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.400
copyright [laughter] if you
can believe it, two writers,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.710
and then Kipling as he says
growing bold and feeling

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:34.050
that I had a few hundred thousand
folk at my back asked Twain

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.770
if he was planning on writing a
sequel to Tom Sawyer [laughter].

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.520
I had a notion of writing
a sequel of Tom Sawyer

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.350
in two ways replied Twain, in one I
would make him rise to great honor

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:56.850
and go to Congress and in the
other I would hang him [laughter].

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.990
Kipling was over awed by Twain.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.910
"I should have ample time
to look back to that meeting

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:08.360
across the graves of days" he
wrote, "He spoke on and I listened,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.130
groveling", but ironically
two years later

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.800
in 1892 Kipling himself
was a subject

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.150
of a request to be interviewed.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.440
According to his wife's
diary two reporters

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.990
from Boston visited
them at their house.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:28.100
Kipling was outraged at
their request and refused.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.450
Interviewing he said "is a
crime, just as much of a crime

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.390
as an offense against my
person, as an assault and just

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.530
as much merits punishment.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.600
It's cowardly and vile.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.010
No respectable man would
ask it much less give it."

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.560
So I think this speaks
to the difference

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.250
between being the journalist
assailant as opposed

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.000 position:56%
to the journalist victim or maybe it
speaks to the hypocrisy of writers.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.080
So the growing popularity
of the interview

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:12.290
through the 19th century was fueled
by the rise of mass education,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:16.260
mass-market publications and
evolving readership with a hunger

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.770 position:56%
for a more intimate
understanding of the public figures.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.900
It was also fueled I would suggest
by the development of realism

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.770
in a novel and an emphasis on
dialogue, scene and character

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.480
and central to all these changes
was the increasing importance

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.850
of women especially in terms
of education and the growth

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.890
of readership in newspapers
and in mass publications

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.770
so the word interview in
the journalistic sense

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.810
of the word first appeared
in the OED in 1869

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.950
and ironically the same year the
nation said the interviewer present

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.410
managed is generally the form of
a joint product of some humbug

00:14:54.410 --> 00:15:00.100
of a hack politician and another
humbug of a newspaper reporter

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.400
but the humbug was catching on.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.540
In Britain where traditionalists
in the press opposed the interview

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.860
as a newfangled American invention

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.570
that lowered reading standards
it was called an epidemic.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.440
In the first six months of 1884 one
newspaper, The Pall Mall Gazette,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.840
had an incredible 79 interviews.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.720
According to its most accomplished
interviewer, W.T. Stead,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.210
interviewing was "the
most interesting method

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.070
of extracting the ideas of
the few for the instruction

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.170
and the entertainment of the many."

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.490
Another distinctive factor

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.760
of the interview is what I
call intimacy construction,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.390
the story of the reporter usually

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.000
in the first person visiting
the politician or the writer

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.420
or the actor and writing
about that encounter

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.160
in an almost novelistic approach
and it wasn't until much later

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.710
that anyone thought of interviewing
the common man and I'm thinking

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.610
of Studs Terkel whose
amazing books as you all know,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.620
I see lots of nodding heads,
The Good War, Working,

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.980
and Division Street, really kind
of broke the genre wide open

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.110
and it remains an incredibly
important tradition,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.110
the Studs Terkel tradition,
and I would call

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.740
that the evocation school rather
than the provocation school

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.320
and it continued through new
journalism in the writings

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.220
of Gay Teleez [phonetic] who
in the early 60s was using sort

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.350
of evocative interviews to
stitch incredible stories

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.200
about Frank Sinatra and
Joe DiMaggio famously

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.730 position:56%
and I would say it's even become --
, it definitely informs what's going

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.610
on here, absolutely, that you're
sitting down with the common folk

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.290
and evoking their stories and
kind of giving them a sense

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.670
of timelessness and taking an
appreciation of those words

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.950
that may be 50 or 60 years ago
wouldn't have been listened to

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.160
and that's certainly what
happens a lot in documentaries.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.850
And I would say that's a
synthesis of oral history

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.200
and a collaborative interview.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.410
So here's Joseph Pulitzer
and in the 19th century

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.440 position:56%
and early 20th century he kind of --

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.590
, you know he's a famous newspaper
innovator and he endorsed a method

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.520 position:56%
of interviewing that stressed
visual description and the evocation

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.400
of a sense of place and
it's been speculated that's

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.830
because he was partially blind
and he appreciated the importance

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:17.410
of detailed description
of interviewees in order

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.910 position:56%
to communicate character so in a
memo to his editors he asked writers

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.150
to "stress the importance of
giving a striking vivid pen sketch

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.110
of the subject", also
a vivid portrait

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.320
of his domestic environment, his
wife, his children, his animals,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.110
etc. and now we take
that for granted

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.390
but this was a complete innovation.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.920
So in the 1920s and 1930s the form
of the interview was solidifying

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.630
into something we would
recognize today essay a cross

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.920
between a New Yorker profile
and a traditional Q&amp;A.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.650 position:56%
For instance there is an astonishing
interview with Al Capone conducted

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:56.040
in 1931 and this is a great
line of character description,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.640 position:56%
"He leaned a bit further back in
his comfortable office chair and lit

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.760
for the 17th time is
Tampa cigar" [laughter].

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.270
So the postwar -- , and in
the post war the influence

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.970
of psychoanalysis I think
gave the interview more depth

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.550
and intensity while
television was kind of sliding

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.790
in the other direction especially
in the late 1950s and began

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.780
to exploit the appeal
of the attack interview

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.170
and most effectively Mike Wallace

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.530
and on YouTube there
is amazing footage

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.960
of him interviewing Frank Lloyd
Wright and it's a grilling,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.340
not like what we see today,
but it's the beginning

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.000
of that really probing, difficult,
put you on the spot interview.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.690
Wait for it, another click?

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.410
You're right.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:57.230
So this is Truman Capote and he
elevated the interview into a form

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.160
of nuanced portraiture and
used manipulative techniques

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.050
to woo his interviewee into
confessional revelations

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.790
as he did spectacularly
with Marlon Brando in 1957

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.170
and I suggest you all read

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.720
that because it's quite striking
what he gets Brando to say.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.680 position:56%
But on the other end of the spectrum

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.780
and with growing popularity was the
celebrity interview as practiced

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.090
by Hollywood magazines in
the 30s and 40s and these

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.980
of course exploited the desire of
the audience to get an insider view

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.200 position:56%
of the elegant glamour and
exquisite romance of Hollywood lives

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.500
and the fact that most of
those interviews were written

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.950
by publicists only intensified
their appeal because it made them

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:42.330 position:56%
as artfully fictitious as the movies
in which the stars appeared in.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.580
So authenticity in
interview was turned inside

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.930
out by the Paris Review whose
interviews starting in '53

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.040
with Faulkner, Hemingway,
[inaudible] were given back

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.440 position:56%
to the writers for
post-interview editing and rewriting

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.710
and the argument was that they
believed, the Paris Review editors,

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.930
that this gave a clear and more
true essence of the interview

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.940 position:56%
than a verbatim transcript
would've done and that's an argument

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.480
that still kind of exists today,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.710 position:56%
whether an edited interview cleverly
edited ethically is a compression

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:20.570
and is a more pungent distillation
of an interviewee's story

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.000
than just a verbatim transcript.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.290
So finally I would
say the apotheosis

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:38.750
of the interview was Jen
Winters 30,000 word interview

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:44.240
with John Lennon that ran in
the 1971 issue of Rolling Stone.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.440
Ramshackle and free-flowing it's a
remarkable portrait of an artist,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.150
witty, cantankerous, opaque
and charming by terms and now

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.750
as I think all of us understand
we're in a splintered landscape.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.070
Openness and spontaneity in
interviews with well-known artists,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.280
actors and writers have all but
disappeared ironically at a time

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.420
when transparency and individuality
are declared to be the hallmarks

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.310
of the digital age and there are
few remaining pockets on radio

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:16.920
and podcasts but the
Facebook post, the selfie

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.620
and the tweet effectively
bypass the interviewer and allow

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.310
for a more curated and controlled
presentation of the self,

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:30.060 position:56%
however for the everyday person
it's a wonderfully liberating moment

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.680
when people can tell their own
stories directly and powerfully

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.470
in ways not even imaginable
10 years ago.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.290
On our cell phones we can interview
ourselves, our families, our lovers

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.900
and strangers and upload the
footage to YouTube or Vimeo

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:50.000
and broadcast our own explorations
of the inner landscape of others.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:04.720
So I returned to Bromberg's
house about four or five times

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.360
and at first as you might have
experienced with veterans he stuck

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.810
to just to the broad
outlines of his war.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.090
He was stationed in England
and his assignment was

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.100
to sketch some of the
soldiers there.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.070
He watched the exercises
in preparation for of D-Day

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.100
at a place called [inaudible].

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.290
He was on the boats that
went over to Normandy.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.520
He was there just after the
invasion and then he would tell me

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.310
about going through Europe partly
with the Third Army and into Paris

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:42.100
but it was very restrained and
I did want to dig in deeper,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.750
I mean I did want to sort
of probe his inner landscape

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.830
and as I kept going back
and going back he loosened

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.220
up a little bit more and on the
third visit I noticed there's

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.570
another structure on the
property and he said oh,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.340
he mentioned that his
daughter lived there

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.510
and on the third visit he said oh
I'm going to go show you my studio

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.040
and so I thought that's where your
daughter lives and he said no,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.610
no it used to be my painting
studio and so we walked out there,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.230
it was cold, and he gave
me a tour of his studio.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.660
He showed me his sketchbooks
that he had sketched,

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.910
he had been sketching the whole
time, I mean that was a part

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.580
of his assignment and literally
as we were leaving the studio

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.650
and I kid you not I said what's
that cardboard box over there?

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.110
And he said oh, those
are my photographs.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.410
And I said photographs?

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.000
And he said yeah, the
photographs I took during the war.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.050
So, these are Bromberg's
photographs many

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.350 position:56%
of which had never been seen before.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.540
"Here I am with all this debris
of war, bodies, burned homes,

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.980
destroyed bunkers and minefields
and hedgerows and orchards.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.960
For an artist this is an
exhilarating subject matter.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.000
It was the biggest subject
matter you could get."

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.730
The journalists that I knew
they were thinking in terms

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.980
of the morning papers, the
deadline, getting the scoop,

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.750
and that's not what the artist
was there to do, make a scoop.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.000
That's why they walked past
all this incredible stuff.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.800
No one was interested
in the non-heroic,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800
that's what I was interested in.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:43.740
I took all of these pictures and
I had no one to send them to.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.790
So I'm interested in how you take
the raw material of an interview

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.190
such as an interview with
a veteran and transform

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.710
that into a narrative based on
facts but with the emotive power

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.000 position:56%
of fiction so here's a test example.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.490
Manuel Bromberg had his orders
folded neatly in his pocket,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.740
two official pieces of paper
both from the War Department.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.040
He was in the Army.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.050
A carbine slung over his shoulder,
standard issue leather boots,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.710 position:56%
a sergeant's five stripes on his arm

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:28.470
but unusually a green
leather sketchpad in his hands

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.080
and a [inaudible] camera
slung from his neck.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.370
Bromberg was an official
U.S. war artist.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.400
His orders were to depict
the impact of war on you

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.500
as an artist, a human being.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.520
The military had shipped
him to London.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.560
He had spent almost a year
there waiting for action.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.450
His assignments had been to
cover the mechanical crews

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:52.070
of the eighth Air Force tending the
B-17s as well as the American GIs

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.310
in the port city of Hull who
were unloading cargo ships.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.690
He had made hundreds of drawings
of the men down on the docks

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.750
as they hauled and lifted.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.950
Out on the airfields he was
captivated by the relationship

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.250
between men and machines.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.430
Bromberg was struggling under
the burden of his mission.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.030
The responsibility of observing
the day to day work of the soldiers

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.630
and then transforming those
observations into art.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.220
In order to aid his memory
he would take a photograph

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.260
to capture the stance of a soldier
against the skyline or the angle

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.000
of the light or the
markings of an airplane.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:45.050
But now Bromberg was standing
on Omaha Beach, D-Day plus six.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.350
"The bodies were floating in.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:50.690
It was a cross between
Dante's Inferno

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.340
and the biggest junkyard
I'd ever seen.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.250
LST landing ships were
bashed in like tin cans.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.590
German pillboxes blasted open.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.930
Empty shells, twisted metal rods,

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.790
chunks of concrete
all littered the sand.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.250
Jeeps and half tracks
everywhere, German POWs penned

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.000
in behind barbed wire like cattle."

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.670
A field hospital had been
set up in an orchard.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.010
Big khaki Army tents like
circus hightops emblazoned

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.710
with medical crosses.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.640
In the preop section of a
tent hung a white curtain

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.730
which marked the entrance to
the operating theater behind.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.990
A doctor greeted Bromberg
and led him on a tour.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.880
The medics had been
performing surgery

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.660
for almost 24 hours straight.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.650
Soldiers lay on stretchers
everywhere even on the grass floor.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.040
The doctor walked briskly

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.430
through the operating theater
to the rear of the tent.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:55.730
He flung back the flap, Bromberg
peeked out expecting the worst.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.560
Look at that said the doctor.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.870
Bromberg looked around confused.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.710
That's right said the
doctor, no arms, no legs.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:08.130
We saved their arms and their legs.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.340
Every minute, every few minutes
a dusty ambulance would pull up.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.260
The wounded were streaming back
from the interior of Normandy

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.550
like sausages coming off the line.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.000
The fighting in the hedgerows was
fierce, bloody and unexpected.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.510
Bromberg was now back
inside the tent gazing

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.250
at a soldier stretched
out under the lamps.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.600
He hated himself for thinking
it but the soldier looked good,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.610
his arm flung back and his torso
vulnerable under the glare.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.000
He took out his sketchbook
and drew furiously.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.110
The soldier's midsection stripped
of his uniform reminded him

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.960
of Greek statues he
used to sketch as a kid

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.380
at the Cleveland Museum of Art.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.800
He tapped his pocket
feeling for his papers.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.110
"Our committee expects you always
to be more than a news gatherer.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.950
Our choice was difficult.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.070
Many of the finest
artists were physically

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.290
and emotionally unsuited
for this work.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.400
His orders stated that
he was to depict the war

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.570
like Goya's famous series of
etchings, The Disasters of War,

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:22.060 position:56%
that's what they actually said, to
depict the war like Goya he thought.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.900
How the hell do they
expect me to do that?

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.970
"I didn't think historically,
the historians had to do that.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.980
I was thinking pictorially,
artistically.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.760
The artist has a whole
different set of problems.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.990
How do I make this thing
really have timelessness?"

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.000
When the nurse moved away he lifted
his camera and took a picture.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:57.890
So that's one experience of working
with an archive and now I'm going

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.890
to move on to a different
experience interestingly

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.600
that also did flow
from a BBC project.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.360
This was a drama documentary
about Hiroshima.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.600
It came out about six
or seven years ago

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.230
and it was very much a drama
documentary not in a cheesy way

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.950
but almost like halfway to a movie
and I was doing background research

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.760
and interviews in America, sort
of background interviews some

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.850
of them did appear
actually for the film.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.910 position:56%
And as often happens, similar story,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.140
in the course of my research
I heard someone sort of --

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.550
, I think it was a historian
who said oh I heard this thing

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.730
with 700 photographs were found
in a suitcase on the street

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.650
in Massachusetts and you know
I don't really know about it

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.840
and it's kind of a mystery
and when the production was

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.530
over I thought well that's
a mystery worth tracking

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.230
down so I literally
got in my car and drove

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.000
up to Watertown, Massachusetts.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.120
So one rainy night in
Watertown, Massachusetts,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.840 position:56%
a man was taking his dog for a walk.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.600 position:56%
On the curb in front of a neighbor's
house he came across a pile

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.970
of trash, old mattresses,
cardboard boxes, a few broken lamps

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.660
and in a heap of garbage he
spotted a battered suitcase.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.570
He bent down and pulled it out.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.790
He turned the suitcase over
and popped open the clasps.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.220
Inside he found a jumble of
black-and-white photographs,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.280 position:56%
most of the bent, broken, water
stained, a few of them hole punched,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.750
and they were images
of a ruined city

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.310
and he snapped the suitcase
closed, tucked it under his arm

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.940
and practically sprinted
home and standing

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:36.500
at his kitchen table he opened the
suitcase again and he was looking

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.690
at something no one
had really seen before,

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:43.400
the effects of the first
use of the atomic bomb.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.920 position:56%
So in a dispassionate and scientific
style the 700 photographs he found

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.510 position:56%
inside the suitcase that evening
depicted a city seared by a new form

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.650
of warfare and now 70 years

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.990
after the bombing their
story can finally be told.

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.280
The mystery.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.380
So the Deluxe Town Diner is a
classic airstream diner decked

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.420
out in high 1950s style
with the ivory

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.440
and turquoise exterior
and those glass bricks.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.350
It's a diner as quintessentially
American as a Twinkie

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.950
and standing inside was a man
wearing brown corduroy trousers,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.900
a dark blue sweater, tortoise
shell glasses and his hair was kind

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.280
of sticking straight up on top.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.660
He kind of looked like a doofie
film professor [laughing] rather

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.390
than a diner owner.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:37.530
His name was Don Levy, no
relation, and he was a connoisseur

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.190
of found objects and
finding the photographs

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.390
that night was obviously the
peak of his trash diving career

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.920
and he didn't know what to do
with them so he stuffed them --

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.420
, they were in terrible
shape as I said,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.020
and he stuffed them into binders.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.570
He put them into plastic sleeves
which you would all kind of groan

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.920
if you saw them and stuffed them
into binders and put the binders

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.070
in his basement and I asked Levy
when I turned up if he'd ever tried

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.930
to discover who owned the
photographs and he said

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.240
that it never really occurred to
him so I proposed that we try.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.630
So we went to the town hall
and looked up all of the names

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:15.140 position:56%
who had owned the house in front of
which the photographs had been found

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.800 position:56%
and we googled the names on the list
and we came up with a phone number

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.480
for a man who had sold the house
in 2000, just around the time

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.570
that Levy had found the suitcase.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.270
So we called him up on the phone

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.560
and literally his voice
shook with shock.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.330
The photographs of Hiroshima?

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.630
You have them?

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.720
I must have thrown them out by
accident when I was moving my stuff

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.070
out of the house or
I left them there

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.080
and the new owners threw them away.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.380
I never would have dumped them.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.390
I've been carrying them
around with me since 1972.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:49.380
So Mark Levitt, the former owner of
the house still lived in Watertown

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.910
so we invited him to come down to
the diner and over blueberry pie

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.540
and coffee we learned some more.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.980
So in 1972 he and a friend had been
hired to clear out the basement

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.750
of a house in Westchester.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.430
They were told to haul the
contents away to a dump

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.070
and Mark Levitt took
the photographs,

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:11.580
his friend really liked the look
of the trunk so he took the trunk.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.450
He, Mark said, he was
haunted by the images.

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.550
He said something about
them overwhelmed me.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.960 position:56%
They don't represent the horror
exactly because there are no bodies.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.150
They're clinical but the power
of them is really intense.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.160
So a few weeks after meeting Levitt
I said look can you get in touch

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.780
with your friend Harlan and he said
I don't know I haven't seen him

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.340
for 20 years, but I
think it was five, six,

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.280
seven days later I got an email
from Harlan Miller, no message

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.790
but there were photographs
attached of a trunk sitting

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:44.070
on a kitchen table sort
of like an eBay photograph

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.180
from different angles
[laughter] and on the front

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:53.670
of the trunk it said Lt.
R.S. Corsbee [phonetic].

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:59.270
So the day after Japan surrendered
Truman commissioned the United

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:04.580
States strategic bombing survey
for the Pacific theater of war.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.370
The mission of the survey was
"to measure precisely the impact

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.190
of the bomb, to put
calipers on it instead

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.600
of describing it in
a mode of terms".

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.170 position:56%
So as part of the overall report the
team included something called the

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.540
physical damage division.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:24.130
It was made up of 150 men including
engineers, ordinance experts,

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:28.120
interpreters, draftsman and
photographers and it was their job

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.580
to examine the physical effects
of the blast on the chimneys,

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.390
walls and reinforced concrete
structures that survived

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:40.410
and to explain and document the
impact, how the metal and concrete

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.360
and wood reacted to
the intense pressure

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.230
of the heat of the atomic bomb.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.300
So soon after receiving this email
of the trunk I spent a few days

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.070
in the archives at the New
York Public Library reading

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.330 position:56%
through the War Department's history
of the strategic bombing survey

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.270
and I confirmed that Corsbee
was actually part of group one

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.200
of the Physical Damage Division
and had arrived in Hiroshima

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.960
on October 8, 1945, and stayed
through the end of November.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.040
So during those autumn months the
members of the division would fan

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.680
out across the city every
day to trace the blast paths,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.260
calibrate the bomb damage and
analyze the physical destruction

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.790
of the city and it was is you
could imagine really tough going.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.670
As late as November members
of the team still came

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:29.120
across human skeletons that
had not yet been cremated

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.350
and John Kenneth Galbraith
actually was one of the members

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:34.000
and he wrote the cities of Japan

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.440
in those dark autumn days was a
manifestation of unspeakable gloom,

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.050
only ashes and gaunt,
freestanding chimneys remained.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.390
So in order to document the
damage, to identify, catalog

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.280
and really embalm Hiroshima for
further analysis seven members

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.970
of the Physical Damage Division
were tasked with the job

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.260
of taking photographs
of the destroyed city.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.870
Trained as an architect Corsbee
was probably one of the draftsman

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.020
but he kept 700 of the work
prints and those were the ones

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.580
that ended up in the suitcase.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.370
So a little bit about Corsbee.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:16.920
Nancy Knight, Robert Corsbee's
granddaughter, was guarded.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.130
Well, she said I'll give you
some background about our family

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.160
but you really have to
talk with my mother.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.970
She's the only one
who survived the fire.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.600
I was only nine at the time.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.040
Fire I asked?

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.340
What fire?

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.790
You'll have to talk to
my mother but I will say

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.780
that I don't have many
memories of my grandfather,

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.400
I was just too young, but I do
remember that he used to sit me

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.390
down on his lap and we would
listen to Madame Butterfly.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.140
Over the fireplace
hung two samurai swords

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.420 position:56%
that he had brought back from Japan.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.660
He joked that if I didn't
learn one of the arias

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.390
by the time I was 18 he was going
to cut my head off [laughter],

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.670
so along with the task of
documenting the devastation

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:07.890
of Hiroshima there was a second
goal, the data was to be compiled

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.170
to be used to help America to
survive a nuclear attack at home.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.110
So here's the paradox.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:18.360
At the moment of America's total
victory there was simultaneously an

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:23.180
awareness of the culture of the
country's future vulnerability

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.610
so the way out of that paradox
lay in the concrete structures

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.260
that had survived the blast.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.610
In the words of The Survey
men arriving at Hiroshima

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:35.290
and Nagasaki had been
constantly impressed by the shells

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.150
of reinforced concrete
buildings that still are rising

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.990
above the rubble of brick and stone
or the ashes of wooden buildings.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.420
The Physical Damage Division
studied those concrete shells

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.430
as if they were blueprints
for the atomic future.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.670 position:56%
So a few years after the war Corsbee
joined the Atomic Energy Commission

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.080
which I'm sure you all know, and he
was a bomb expert and as director

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.590
of the physical effects group
he brought his experiences

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.530
from Hiroshima directly
to bear on the testing

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.290
of the physical infrastructure
that the government was developing

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.590
in order to survive nuclear attack.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.590
In other words he was
one of the first people

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:16.440
to design the U.S. military's
first atomic bomb shelters.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.860
And according to a colleague
who worked with the AEC,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.770
Corsbee was "quite a character, he
was a pretty hard high living guy.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.430
He loved his drinking at night

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.980
and he was very energetic
and a sincere worker.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.770
He did a great job at this thing".

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.590
Corsbee's daughter, Nancy
Mason, was more forthcoming

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.610
with her memories of her father.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.390
I know that he was
traumatized by what he had seen.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.760
He went through a bombed
out school in Hiroshima

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.310
and that got to him I know.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.350
He brought home two burned
schoolbooks and a small sake cup

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.110
that had been blackened
by the blast.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:52.360
I asked Nancy to tell
me a little bit more

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.420
about her father's
work with the AEC.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.520
So he went out west to Nevada
quite a lot she told me

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.180
when I was growing up.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.220 position:56%
He was testing houses to see if
they could withstand nuclear blasts.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.920
It was the time of duck and cover.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.850
When I was in the sixth or
seventh grade he was on TV.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.340
We got out of school early
to watch the footage,

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:14.860 position:56%
to watch that live actually I think,
and they dressed him up in something

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.210
that looked like foil and they
dropped him by helicopter into one

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.670
of those test houses that
they'd blown up in the desert.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.970
You've all seen that footage

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.230
of when the wind rocks
the house back and forth.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.910
He was on the ground for all
of those, not on the ground,

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.290
he was dropped into
those houses afterwards

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.080
and they called him
the 24 carat hero.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.550
So in 1962 Corsbee
left government service

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.980
and joined a private
practice as an architect.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.680
He specialized of course
in designing buildings

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.740
that could withstand
nuclear or natural disasters.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.170
For instance one of his largest
commissions, it's a bit strange,

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.810
was a design of an immense
underground blast shelter

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.520
for the Johnson &amp; Johnson
company because they were wanting

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.540
to protect their herd of milking
cattle in case of a nuclear attack.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:08.730 position:56%
The fire. On the night of January 7,
1967, Corsbee's daughter had a date.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.820
She was newly divorced
and she was planning

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:14.130
on dropping her nine-year-old
daughter off at her father's house

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.570
but at the last minute
her date canceled

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.380
and she decided to stay at home.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.630
Early the next morning
the phone rang.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.980
There had been a fire
at her father's house.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:29.300
Corsbee's house was a nine bedroom
tutor mansion called Homewood

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.350
in Ossining, New York.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:35.150
When Nancy and her daughter arrived
they were confronted by a house

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.490
that was totally devastated.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:42.360
About 200 volunteer firefighters,
four pumper trucks and a hook

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.830
and ladder had been called to
fight the blaze but to no avail.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.130
Robert Corsbee, his wife Evelyn

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.390
and their 22-year-old son
had all died in the blaze.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:54.830
The first assistant fire chief

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.010
at the time was a man named
Richard Apostalico [phonetic].

00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.810
Forty-four years later he
still remembered the fire.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.030
It was one of the worst
I'd ever seen.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.020
Some things you never forget.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.190 position:56%
The house was built like a fortress.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.340
It had extra slate thick
roofs and the windows

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.940
where at least one
quarter of an inch thick.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.160
We had a terrible time doing
what we call ventilation.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.680
That's how you let the gases and
burning fumes out of a building.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.670
It was something unreal.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:30.040
We had pipe poles and we still
couldn't break the glass.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.070 position:56%
As a result of the unusual
construction the house contained the

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.190
fire like a furnace.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:40.540
Apostalico found Mrs.
Corsbee in the foyer

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.150
about 35 feet short
of the front door.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.390
When I got there he told
me I dragged her the rest

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.660
of the way out but it was too late.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.570 position:56%
According to the obituary in the New
York Times the following day she was

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.730
found fully dressed in a
skirt, sweater and a pair

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.750
of high heeled shoes beside her.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.790
Then he tried to find Corsbee.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:04.440
Battling the intense heat and smoke
it took Apostalico 20 to 30 minutes

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.510
until he found him dead
draped over a lounge chair.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.900
He was trying to get
out of a side door.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.820
He was close, about 15 feet
away, but he didn't make it.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:18.610
According to the Times, Corsbee
was also fully dressed including

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:19.910
a necktie.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.130
Because of the intense heat the
firemen had to suspend their search

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.240
and rescue and when they
resumed they found Robert junior

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.640
in his pajamas in an upstairs
bathtub full of water.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.410
He was probably trying to keep away
from the flames said Apostalico

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.420 position:56%
and he had died of smoke inhalation.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.930
So the Corsbees had thrown a party
the night before which according

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.280
to witnesses they had
candles burning.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.320
After everyone had gone home
they probably had a nightcap

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.030
on their living room
sofa and dozed off.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.250
The candles in the living
room must have tipped

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:55.580
over accidentally said Apostalico
or burned down in such a way

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.010
that the drapery in
the room caught fire.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.320
The drapery fell to the ground.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.750
There was tremendous heat.

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:09.120 position:56%
The fire was so hot that in the
kitchen which was 50 to 60 feet away

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.950
from the living room we found the
telephone trailing on the floor

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:14.910
like it was a piece of licorice.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.460
Nancy Mason told me
that the contents

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.610
of the house were entirely
destroyed but down in the basement

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.090
where her father had meticulously
boxed, filed and stored all

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:27.630
of his records, almost
everything survived.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.860
A few days after the fire
still reeling with grief

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.290
and shock Nancy Mason emptied the
contents of her father's house.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:42.200
She cleared everything out of the
basement and she loaded the stuff

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.900
into her basement and she left
them there while she struggled

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.040
to reconfigure and
reconstruct her life.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.500
So some five years later from that
she decided to weed things out

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.510
and she hired Harlan Miller
and Mark Levitt to get rid

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.570
of her father's effects and
drag them all and dump them

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.320
at the local dump and that's

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.940
when Harlan Miller salvaged the
photographs and Mark Levitt -,

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.800
sorry Mark Levitt took
the photographs

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:14.010
and Harlan Miller took the trunk
and Levitt stuffed the photographs

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.600
in an old suitcase which he
eventually brought to his house

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.170
in Watertown and stored in his
basement and when it came time

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:26.220 position:56%
to move he either mistakenly threw
it away or he left it and the people

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.380
who bought the house threw it away.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:33.100
Either way there it was left in
a pile of trash until Don Levy

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.080
out taking his dog for a
walk one night bent down

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.250
and popped open the clasps.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.510
Thank you.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:48.240
[ Applause ]

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.190
&gt;&gt; Robert Patrick: We
have a little bit of time.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:52.490
Questions?

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.980
Okay, anyone have questions
or comments?

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.280
Yes.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.580
&gt;&gt; First off where are the book
collections you were talking

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.050
about [inaudible] has his items?

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.410
&gt;&gt; Adam Harrison Levy:
Yes, so great question.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.150
So Bromberg still has
the photographs.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:13.680
He wants to put them together
in a book and there's talk

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.770
of an exhibition but it's all
very vague and the daughters,

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.460
I mean as you'll know from
-- , daughters are sort of --

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:23.310
, there's contention in the
family so we'll see what happens.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.910
I mean it's been at least
five years but they are there,

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.130
they've been digitized, they're
safe and we'll see what happens.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:33.780 position:56%
As I said there are hundreds, not
as many as the Hiroshima photographs

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.480
and they are an incredible resource

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.780
so hopefully they'll
see the light of day.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.430
I think they will, it's
just a bit of time.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.020
The Hiroshima photographs,
a bit of a different story.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.280 position:56%
After I established the [inaudible]
and I wrote a short article actually

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.470
in The Guardian, ironically
it was the weekend

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.290
that there was the tube bombing
whenever that was, five years ago,

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.290
and so the staff at The Guardian
couldn't make it in and they had

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.930
to shorten the articles,
three people,

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.230
there was like a skeleton
staff and I don't think anyone

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.080
on that day wanted to read
about Hiroshima [laughter],

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.440
so it kind of sunk without
a trace I have to be honest

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.660
but there was a [inaudible]
established

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.590
and there was a circuitous route
but Don Levy was able to sell them,

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.930
I don't know for how much, I
don't think it was a lot of money,

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.950
to the International
Center of Photography

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:16.860
which now has the photographs.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.540
They are online and there's an
exhibition that they mounted

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.350
as a result and they
are in the public domain

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:24.180
because they were taken
by the U.S. military.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.380
These are the contact
prints not the negatives.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.400
And the exhibition has never
traveled much to my chagrin.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.780
I don't know why because
it's an amazing thing

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.660 position:56%
but the ICP itself has changed,
they've just moved locations so it's

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.630
in their archive, it's accessible
and hopefully it will see the light

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.000
of day again but it has been
out in the public realm.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.990
Anything else?

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:48.290
Yes.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:52.180
&gt;&gt; So interviewing [inaudible]
so the artist his role was tasked

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.440 position:56%
to document just like all history
is documented, so was it interesting

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.400 position:56%
to interview him because he already
has a certain language already going

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.380
on that you could only beg
for from a regular Joe citizen

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.880
about their experiences?

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:11.470
So was his interview
different than any others

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.130
or [inaudible], what
was your thoughts?

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:15.110
&gt;&gt; Adam Harrison Levy: Well he
was definitely the U.S. war artist

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:16.500
so he didn't interview anyone.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.930
I mean he hung out with the
troops but he was constantly --

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.180
, I think he was very
burdened by his --

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.920
, I mean you can tell
from his quotes,

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.670
I think he had a breakdown
while he was doing it.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.780
He just could not square the
reality of trying to capture this

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.690
and this pressure being like Goya,
I mean that he kept coming back

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.830 position:56%
to that but to answer your
question obviously he was an artist.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.750 position:56%
He was reflective about his process.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.200
I think he was good at sort of
making links to the common soldier.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.770
I did interview a lot of
people for the D-Day to Berlin.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.140
I would say he's probably
more articulate than most

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.230
because he was introspective and he
was an artist and also because of

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.870
that experience, I mean it
forced him to think more deeply

00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:54.260
about his failure to be honest.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:57.730
Having said that you
know when veterans

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:01.130
and I know you've experienced
this, when they feel --

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.440
, you know it's a cliché
but it's true

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.970
and there's a reason why
it's a cliché they won't open

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.810
up to their friends, they
won't open up to their family,

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.690
they will definitely
talk to their colleagues

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.450
and their fellow combatants

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:16.020
but I also think historians have
an amazing opportunity especially

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.830
at the end of their lives
because they realize they're going

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.930
to pass away and this
is their last chance

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:25.730
and sometimes the most amazing
things are said and secrets

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.430
that have been kept for
40 or 50 years do come

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:33.280
out so that's incredibly meaningful
[inaudible] and it's great

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.230
that you're capturing that because
it is -- , you know, what, two,

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.510
three, four years from now
there's not going to be anyone.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.130
I think this afternoon is going to
be more about the interview process

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:49.660
and what I go through in terms
of the nuts and bolts of how

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.490
to evoke a question or evoke
answers to ask the questions

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:59.520 position:56%
that hopefully evoke the answers,
more like a workshop less of a talk.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.850
Yes John?

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.990
&gt;&gt; You talk about evoking
rather than provoking,

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:09.370
how would you compare and
contrast the experience

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:13.490
of interviewing veterans
with interviewing celebrities

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:14.900
as you've done a bit
of that as well?

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.200
&gt;&gt; Adam Harrison Levy: Yes.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.510
You know celebrities,
most of them have their --

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.290
, as you'd expect they have
their routine down so kind

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:35.580
of clinically sealed that to the
first question is really important,

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:39.820
like with a veteran you can kind
of start off relatively soft

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:43.190
and you probably should do because
they haven't been interviewed

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:47.610
but for like a real hardened movie
star I take a lot of time thinking

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.670
of what that first question is
going to be because you want

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.300
to signal this isn't going
to be just any old interview,

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.940
I'm not repping for PR, I'm trying

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.780 position:56%
to get something that's a little bit
different so I spend a lot of time

00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.320
on those first questions.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:06.030
I think with celebrities
sometimes, I mean this is kind

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.170
of a funny story, it's good
to allow for the tangent.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.670
Tangents are great in interviews
I mean you get a little nervous

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:12.970
if you think.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:14.270
If you do really great research
you can have the confidence

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.980
that you're going to bring it
back to what I call the spine

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.680
of the interview but if you're
interviewing a celebrity sometimes

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.870
they go on a tangent sort of
to test you so here's a --

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.360
, I don't know why I
think of the story.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:29.750
Jeff Daniels, it wasn't BBC, it was
channel 4, it was like 101 films

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.860
to see before you die, it was
like a list program and we were

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.710
to interview him about Dumb and
Dumber [laughter] and this is

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.580
like five years after the film came
out and obviously he has ambitions

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.870
to be more than a Dumb or Dumber
actor and he was on Broadway

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:43.390
and he's gone on obviously.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:46.620
He's a really smart, intelligent
actor and he literally was

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:50.120
in a hotel room, just what you
don't want to do, small hotel room,

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.790
the lights were set up
and literally he came

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:53.260
down the hallway kind of slumping.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.560
You could tell he didn't
want to do it.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.070
He had his publicist kind of
like pulling him by the nose.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.750
He sat down in the chair

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.500
and I didn't have a great
first question I have to admit

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:05.330
and I said can you describe
what you did in Dumb and Dumber

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.630
because we are doing this --

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:10.320
, I mean now this is kind of bold
[laughter], and he kind of looked

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.420
at me like come on buddy I've done
this so many times, forget about it

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.210
and I asked three questions and
I got those sort of no, yes,

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.590
no answers and I knew I was in deep
water and I thought I'm never going

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:24.060
to be able to use this so why not
just ask him a really tangential

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.320
question and I said
what are your hundred

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.660 position:56%
and one films to see before you die?

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.960
And he kind of lit up.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.230 position:56%
He's like oh no once really asked me
that before and he started talking

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.730
about Buster Keaton films
and I was sitting there

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.480
and you know I only had
like 20 minutes and I was

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.130
like sweating thinking
where is this going to go

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:42.160 position:56%
but I thought you know I'll see
where it goes and he started talking

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:46.620
about Buster Keaton and how he
walks and how buildings fall on him

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:49.240
and he has this incredible
physical grace and he's going on

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.230
and I see a little twinkle
in his eye and he said yes

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.780
and when I was walking through
the door in this scene in Dumb

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.770
and Dumber I was thinking
about Buster Keaton

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.820
and I thought that's all I need.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.130
So he did know what he
was doing and so an actor

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.840
or celebrity have the gift
of knowing what you need

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.340
and they can play with
you a little bit.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.990
A veteran might not necessarily
know what the soundbite is

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.390
but the celebrity, a writer, an
actor will know what you need

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:15.010
and they will either tease you
with it or they will give it to you

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.250
so that's a big difference.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.830
Sure, yes?

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:26.030
&gt;&gt; Were there other war artists
and if so where are their works?

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.330
&gt;&gt; Adam Harrison Levy:
Great question.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.790
There are more U.S. war artists.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:33.500
They did not have the
funding or the support

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.440
that the British war artists had

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.240
and actually Bromberg was
really bitter about that.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.870
They were literally when they
were in London they had bunkbeds

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:43.090
and no supplies and he
was really pissed off

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:49.360
because the British counterparts,
Henry Moore, Nash, Sutherland,

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.450
they all had studios and people
would come and visit them

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.590
and they had a whole -- ,
they had the Officers Club

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.700
and they were all taken very
seriously and to Sir Kenneth Clark

00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.320
who went on to write Civilization
was in charge of their unit

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.620
so they were very protected.

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.690
In fact Bromberg would go visit
them and he was embarrassed

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:09.190 position:56%
because he couldn't invite them back
anywhere, there was nowhere to go,

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:10.920
there was no Officers Club.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.020
Having said that, and I
haven't done this research,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.880 position:56%
he said that there was an exhibition
of war art at Westminster Abbey

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.090
and he was there so some of
the American stuff did end

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:23.820
up in Westminster Abbey
with the British war artists

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.700
but it was definitely not
supported as much as the Brits did

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.050 position:56%
and I think the program still -- ,
I mean you probably know, it goes on

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:36.510
and I think there were a number
of artists, right, in the Pacific.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.580
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.880
I don't, I should.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.350
Do you know their names?

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:45.650
And I think there was a book.

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.920
It wasn't actually a very good
book but it was a book of their art

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.330
and to be frank it wasn't
as good as the Brits,

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.680
I mean it really wasn't
which is a shame.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.270
Having said that it
would be interesting

00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:57.500
to find out what survives.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.880
Who knows maybe some of
them also took photographs.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.830
I mean he definitely was
issued with that [inaudible]

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:04.530
and that was a U.S. military
issue which is ironic

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.880
because it's a German camera
[laughter], but go figure.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.380
I don't know how they
got hold of it.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.510
All right, thank you so much.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:16.830
