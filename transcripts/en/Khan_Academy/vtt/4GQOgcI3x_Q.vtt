00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Narrator] This is a chart

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.730
showing estimated population
around the year 1750

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.170
in the British colonies in the New World.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.300
I've arranged this more or
less from north to south

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.910
and you can see that as
you go farther south,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.760
the percentage of the population

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.410
that was enslaved and African
grew greater and greater,

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.940
but one thing to note here is that

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.430
not any one of these colonies

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.620
had zero enslaved people at all,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.150
even New Hampshire, the farthest north

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.590
with the smallest percentage
of enslaved Africans

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.650
had some enslaved people there

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.300
before the American Revolution.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.310
We frequently have the misconception

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.140
that slavery only happened in the south.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.460
In fact, all British colonies
had some amount of slavery

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.390
and all British colonies
had some involvement

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.230
in the institution of slavery,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.880
whether that was bankrolling
it as a financier,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.880
growing food that was intended
for the slave colonies

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.970
in the West Indies that
didn't want to spare

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810
even an acre of land to grow something

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.570
other than sugar, or
shipping enslaved Africans

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.510
by either owning or captaining the boats

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.750
of the middle passage.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.380
In fact, one of the largest ports

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.470
where slaves entered the
North American colonies

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.690
and were sold at auction was
at Newport, Rhode Island.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.770
But despite this, the largest
share of enslaved people

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.200
were in the southern colonies,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.930
which focused on plantation agriculture.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.310
So, Maryland, Virginia,
and then even farther south

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.940
into the British colonies
in the Caribbean.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.580
In some of these southernmost colonies,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.480
you can see that enslaved Africans

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.500
outnumbered white people by sometimes

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.740
quite a considerable amount.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.060
As the enslaved population
in the colonies grew,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.280
colonial governments began
passing more and more

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.160
restrictions on the
lives of enslaved people

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
and began codifying who
was or was not a slave.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.630
For example, if a white
man and an enslaved woman

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.210
had a child together,
would that child be free

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.000
like her father or
enslaved like her mother?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.720
What about the opposite case?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
In Virginia in 1662, the
government passed a law

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.130
specifying that the
children of enslaved women

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.470
would follow the condition
of their mothers.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.450
Other laws prevented
interracial relationships

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.450
and defined enslaved
Africans as chattel slaves,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.120
which means personal property,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.360
and as the personal
property of slave owners,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.090
enslaved people had
little to no legal rights.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.840
So, over the course of the 1600s,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020
slavery became stricter

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.240
and more exclusively defined by race.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.870
The experience of being
enslaved was unimaginably

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.360
physically and emotionally taxing.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.630
Since enslaved people
had no legal protections,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.900
owners could maim or
even kill enslaved people

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.920
with little to no repercussion.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.490
For women, life in slavery also meant

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.520
the constant threat and frequent reality

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.110
of rape at the hands of slave owners.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.350
Religion, dance, music, and family

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.380
helped enslaved people deal with

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.620
the harsh realities of everyday life

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.920
and enslaved people also developed

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.100
both covert means of resisting slavery,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.440
like, for example, breaking tools,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.010
which made it more difficult to work,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.870
or overt means of resisting slavery,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.370
particularly in slave uprisings.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.000
One of these, the Stono Rebellion in 1739

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.910
in South Carolina resulted in the deaths

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.910
of about 42 whites and about 44 blacks.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.900
The South Carolina government
responded to the rebellion

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.260
by making slave codes even harsher.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.020
I wanna finish by just
reiterating how central

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.400
the institution of slavery was

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.680
to not just some, but all
of the English colonies.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.070
In the 19th century, Americans
would refer to slavery

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.240
as the peculiar institution,
meaning not so much

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.170
that it was strange,
but that it was specific

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.400
to the south part of the United States.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.160
But slavery really wasn't
specific to the south part,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.220
it was the bedrock of
the colonial economy,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.070
not just in the south,
but in all the industries

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.000
that contributed to slavery
in the north as well,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.640
those who financed, fed, shipped,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.290
and even bought the products
made by enslaved people

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.800
created the economic prosperity

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.753
of the North American colonies.
