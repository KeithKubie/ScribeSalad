00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:02.711
Okay. I hope you're beginning to find some of

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:06.045
these relationships pretty intuitive. Let's start over here with

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.450
the close ones. You would be 50% related to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.570
your sister and 50% related to your mother. Remember we

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.105
just got done talking a few exercises ago about

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:16.618
how that 50% is not the same kind of 50%.

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:21.870
You're also 25% related to your grandparents and your

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.590
aunts and uncles. Of course this is because an individual

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.030
parent is half related to which of their

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.330
parents. So if you're 50% related to your parent,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.613
half of that would be 25%. Now you're

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:38.080
12.5% related to each of your great-grandparents. As well

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.860
as your granduncles. The siblings of your grandparents.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.180
So I don't know if you're noticing a trend

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.350
here. We've got this set of 50%. Alright? And

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.790
then this set of 25%. And then this set

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.250
of 12.5%. And now we also need to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.880
include first cousins in this. And then we move

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.820
one more out. We would have great-great-grandparents and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.170
what not. And then we'd have our first cousin

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.760
once removed at 6.25%. And our second cousin

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.730
would be 3.125% roughly. Notice that at each extension

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.140
we've essentially cut it in half from 50%. Half

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.610
of that is 25%. Half of that is 12.5%.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.415
Half of that is 6.25%. Half of that is

00:01:18.415 --> 00:01:23.660
3.125%. Now, because of recombination during myosis. These numbers

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.570
are not exact. This is not exactly. We could

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.180
put a little about sign, a little tilde, in

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.400
front of each of these, to represent that you're

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.652
going to have a, on average. A 25%, 12.5%, so

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:38.770
forth and so on. About the only relationship that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.030
you can guarantee you're going to be exactly 50%.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.620
Is the father, and the mother. Everything else has recombination

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
playing a role. And because that doesn't happen the same way

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.420
every time. You can get a little more. A little

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.750
less. From one relative or another. This is just an approximation.
