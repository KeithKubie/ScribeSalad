00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.180
So, taking a look at this snippet of code,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.030
it looks like $(document).click() is taking in some kind of function.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.260
We see function, then a parameter, and

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.590
then these curly braces that are passing in, well, some instructions.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.800
This is similar to regular function syntax,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.610
where we declare a function with the keyword function, set some parameters, and

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.320
then put code inside curly braces.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.930
But this function doesn't seem to have a name.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.600
And that's kind of curious.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.200
So let's go ahead and open up Google.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.450
I typed in JavaScript function without name and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.480
I'm going to take a look at the results.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.950
We came across an article about JavaScript Anonymous Functions.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.190
This seems really useful.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.520
It looks like an anonymous function is one that's declared without a name.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.870
That sounds like what we've got.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.160
So it looks like $(document).click is taking an anonymous function as

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.750
a parameter.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.840
You'll find anonymous functions all over the place in JavaScript.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.990
So I encourage you to check out the resources in the Instructor Notes to learn

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.550
more about them.
