00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.040
But also, more interestingly, has the __data__ property,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.930
which corresponds to an object.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.950
Opening up that object, we see we have the fields of a single row

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.730
from our data file, which we saw earlier, as the .enter selection.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.875
But now instead of corresponding to only __data__ with

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:28.880
the fields, it now is actually bound to a circle.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.070
So the combination of the enter selection with the append,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.750
merges the data from our data file, with the svg circle element.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.350
And this is where the mysterious data of d3's magical data bound lives.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.330
It's simply, a JavaScript object,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.130
attached as a property to the svg node, living in the DOM.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.280
And as we can see here, on the left again is the selection of what

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.460
lives on the page either as HTML or SVG.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.130
Starting with the select of the parent SVG element, which contained in it has

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.460
a SVG circle element, for each row of our data file, worldcup.tsv.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.303
Which d3 binds with it's data function, as we can see here corresponding

00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:26.679
to the link, to a row of our file which was loaded and stored in the data

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:33.130
variable which again is a single row from our worldcup.tsv data file.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.070
So think of these linkages, as the magic data bind.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.240
Everything on the left side, as what's present on the page.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.450
Either as SVG or HTML.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.060
And everything on the right side, as either a JavaScript object, or

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.690
some piece of our data file.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.020
And here, I represent all 836 rows simply by the dotted arrow, which

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.110
means that this extends all the way down, binding every row to every circle.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.300
If any of this was unclear, I encourage you to read through Mike's post on

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.340
the subject, which is contained in the lecture notes.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.240
Or if you want a more complete treatment of the subject, look at the book

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.360
reference in the lecture notes, Virtual Storytelling With D3, by Richie S King,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.880
which inspired this graphic and explanation, of the mysterious databind process.
