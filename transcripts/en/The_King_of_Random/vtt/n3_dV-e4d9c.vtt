00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.659
For this video, I’m going to show you how
to take a few simple ingredients, and make

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.519
mountains and mountains of your own custom
gummy candies, at home.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.200
Start with a box of Jell-O, some corn syrup,
and a few packets of unflavored gelatin. The

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.220
small boxes like this have 4 packets inside,
and for this recipe, you’ll actually only

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.449
need 2 of them.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.590
Get started by measuring out 1/2 cup of very
cold water, then squirt in 1/4 cup of corn

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.980
syrup. Cold water will help the gelatin separate
properly, and the corn syrup is going to give

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.230
our gummies a nice smooth texture.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.590
Now we need the corn syrup fully dissolved,
so give it a good stirring until the water

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.820
turns completely clear. Then go ahead and
pour the sugary liquid into a pot. But don’t

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.760
turn on the stove just yet. I’ll show you
what happens if you do in just a minute.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.350
Go ahead and add both packets of unflavored
gelatin to the pot, then pour in the entire

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.790
packet of Jell-O. 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.180
Now it’s going to take a minute or two for
the gelatin to absorb into the water, but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.710
take your time and be patient so you don’t
make a mess. And keep stirring it slowly,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.620
until you can see all the gelatin is mixed
in.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.580
Alright, it’s time to heat things up, and
turn this sugary soup, into a delicious candy syrup.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.420
Set your stove to medium-low heat, for around
5-10 minutes, making sure to stir the candy

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.399
mix every minute or two, to keep it from burning.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.299
While that’s warming, it’s a good idea
to find something you can use as a candy mold,

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.289
like these ice cube trays, I found at the
LEGO store.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.270
When you see the gelatin has completely liquified,
the syrup is ready for pouring. And you should

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.369
be able to pour it straight into the molds.
But be careful not to spill, because the syrup’s

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.359
extremely hot, and will burn you.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.869
Now if you see little lumps, clumps or bubbles
floating to the top, it’s probably because

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
you didn’t start with cold water, or you
heated up the mixture too fast for the gelatin to fully separate.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.259
But don’t worry. There’s a really easy
way to fix it.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.679
Pour all of the syrup into a tall and narrow,
heat-resistant container, like a large drinking

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.240
glass. As you do, you’ll immediately notice
all the bubbles and gelatin lumps, start rising

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.159
to the top. Let it sit for around 10 minutes
to give it all a good chance to settle and

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.659
cool a bit, and you’ll soon see all the
impurities collect together at the top, and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.069
separate into a layer of gummy foam.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.609
Now check this out. All you have to do is
reach in with a spoon or a spatula and scrape

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.990
this newly formed skin away. Just like that,
you’ve got yourself a beautiful, and impressively

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.469
clean gummy syrup, ready for casting. And
to make the next steps as easy as possible,

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.910
I’m collecting the magical syrup, in a condiment
container.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.220
These kinds of containers are perfect for
filling up your molds. They’re super easy

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.300
to control, and you can squirt the syrup exactly
where you need it, which helps avoid spilling,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.450
or overflowing the molds with too much gummy.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.240
I gave these candies a few hours to cool,
so you can see just how much of a difference

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.060
it makes, to take the extra step and skim
the bubbles off the top, before making your candies.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.890
Alright, let’s see how our gummy mix does
with a much more intricate, and detailed ice

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.690
cube mold, like this one. And you might have
noticed that this time, the syrup, is impressively clear.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.360
5 hours later, we’ve got ourselves a batch
of really cool, LEGO gummy guys. Which apparently,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.320
are balanced enough, that they can stand up
on their own. That’s kind of cool.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.580
Now just for fun, I made a silicone mold from
actual LEGO bricks, and a 2 part silicone

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.740
mix from a special effects supply store..

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.100
Now you should know that when the syrup cools
down, it’s going to shrink a little. So

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.090
to compensate for that, try filling the molds
just a tiny bit higher than the top.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.740
For one finishing touch, I got a clean LEGO
baseplate, and brushed it lightly with vegetable

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.820
oil, then carefully placed it down on top
of the mold. You can see the edges have little

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.630
dimples, to help keep all the studs perfectly
aligned. So all it needs now is something

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.750
like a heavy book to give it some weight,
and hold it in place.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.410
I let these ones cool on the counter for around
6 hours, and you can see that if we carefully

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.300
remove the baseplate now, our little LEGO
gummies, have small divots on the bottom,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.020
which means they’re connectable.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.670
Let’s take one of the bricks out out of
the mold, and take a good look up close. You

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.020
can see there’s a surprising amount of detail
captured in the gummy snack, and they’re

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.110
not sticky at all, but actually quite firm,
and they smell delicious.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.740
You probably also noticed they’re completely
transparent, which puts their level of awesomeness

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.360
on a completely different scale.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.880
Alright let’s take this idea to the next
level with different colors and different flavors.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.420
I tripled the recipes and made 7 different
batches. Then let them cool overnight so they’d

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.760
all be crystal clear. Now if you try doing
this yourself, you might find that getting

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.450
them out of the cups is pretty tricky.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.110
When you do get them out though, you’ll
have a gob of gummy, that way too big to eat

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.610
on it’s own. But that’s ok because what
we’re really after here is the white layer

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.390
of gummy foam at the top.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.600
Now if you’re really careful, you can use
something like a kitchen knife to slowly trim

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.380
the top layer off, which will leave you with
a huge chunk of gummy goodness. And these

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.880
transparent gummy blocks can be re-melted
on medium-low heat, and molded into any shape you want.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.689
I made a candy mountain, of LEGO gummy bricks,
in all kinds of colors, shapes and sizes.

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:22.830
And if you look closely, you can even see
some little gummy guys in there as well.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.669
In keeping with the LEGO theme, I went back
to the store and picked up a bunch of containers,

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.229
just so I could have a unique place, to store
my custom candies.

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.210
Now you could keep all your LEGO gummies separate,
but I ended up mixing all mine together and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.360
filling the containers with all kinds of random
pieces. How awesome is that?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.710
The best part is, if you snap on the lid and
keep them in the fridge, they can stay good

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.439
for up to a month.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.289
Now since the gummies are interlocking, you
might be wondering if you can build things

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.569
with them as well. The answer is yes, as long
as you can resist the temptation to snack

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.030
on them first.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.310
For one last experiment, try finding a handful
of chewable vitamin C tablets, and powderize

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.539
them in a blender for about 30 seconds. I
used 8 tablets, or 4,000 mg for this batch,

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.199
and when you mix the powder into the gummy
syrup, you’ve just made your candies, vitamin

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.930
C enriched. Of course these are a slightly
healthier version, but more importantly, it

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.800
gives them a slightly sour taste, making them
even more delicious, and extremely addictive.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.069
Well now you know how to use a few simple
ingredients to make a bucketful, of colorful

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.909
LEGO gummies. That are stackable, snack-able,
and fun to share.

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.120
By the way, you don’t have to make your
gummies into LEGOs. You can actually make

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.060
any thing you can think of. I converted some
of my left over syrup, into an assortment

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.520
of AA, AAA, and D cell batteries.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.689
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
