in these reviews the first is I'll
 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.270
in these reviews the first is I'll
provide some measure of context I think

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280
provide some measure of context I think
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.990
provide some measure of context I think
that that these events are often

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000
that that these events are often
 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.670

of the events surrounding surrounding
 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.770
of the events surrounding surrounding
the the pandemic and I think that really

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780
the the pandemic and I think that really
 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.599
the the pandemic and I think that really
is it's it's unfair and it leads these

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609
is it's it's unfair and it leads these
 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.789

things are inherently different but

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799

things are inherently different but
Larten for a large way different because

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260
Larten for a large way different because
 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.020
Larten for a large way different because
of the circumstances surrounding the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
of the circumstances surrounding the
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.360
of the circumstances surrounding the
event and the second thing I'll try to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
event and the second thing I'll try to
 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.780
event and the second thing I'll try to
do is communicate the uncertainty that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790
do is communicate the uncertainty that
 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.330
do is communicate the uncertainty that
was taking place at the time the events

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340
was taking place at the time the events
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.300
was taking place at the time the events
unfolded both from what was happening

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310
unfolded both from what was happening
 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.640
unfolded both from what was happening
and also the decisions that had to be

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650
and also the decisions that had to be
 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.180
and also the decisions that had to be
made I think in looking back it's hard

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190
made I think in looking back it's hard
 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.490
made I think in looking back it's hard
to appreciate its really the job of

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
to appreciate its really the job of
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.409
to appreciate its really the job of
historians I think to remove that sense

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419
historians I think to remove that sense
 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.839
historians I think to remove that sense
of uncertainty that was I was taking

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849
of uncertainty that was I was taking
 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.159
of uncertainty that was I was taking
place and to kind of come up with the

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169
place and to kind of come up with the
 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.440
place and to kind of come up with the
truth but as the event is being

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450
truth but as the event is being
 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.450
truth but as the event is being
experienced going forward it often is

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
experienced going forward it often is
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.460
experienced going forward it often is
unclear what's really happening and what

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470
unclear what's really happening and what
 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.550

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
and I think some of this may have been
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.010
and I think some of this may have been
covered in other in other lectures this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020
covered in other in other lectures this
 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.920
covered in other in other lectures this
is a cartoon version of influenza a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930
is a cartoon version of influenza a
 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.220
is a cartoon version of influenza a
virus these are RNA viruses they have

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230
virus these are RNA viruses they have
 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.760
virus these are RNA viruses they have
eight single strand genes and they're

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770
eight single strand genes and they're
 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.250
eight single strand genes and they're
known by the surface proteins

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260
known by the surface proteins
 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.129
known by the surface proteins
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase you can

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase you can
 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.090
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase you can
see the blue bars there are a pictorial

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100
see the blue bars there are a pictorial
 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.650
see the blue bars there are a pictorial
representation of the hemagglutinin

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660
representation of the hemagglutinin
 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.650
representation of the hemagglutinin
antigen this is the the protein that

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660
antigen this is the the protein that
 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.870
antigen this is the the protein that
binds to cells and allows the virus to

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880
binds to cells and allows the virus to
 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.750
binds to cells and allows the virus to
enter the neuraminidase shown as the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760
enter the neuraminidase shown as the
 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.190
enter the neuraminidase shown as the
green blobs here is sort of the the exit

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200
green blobs here is sort of the the exit
 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.080
green blobs here is sort of the the exit
the protein that allows the virus to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090
the protein that allows the virus to
 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.330
the protein that allows the virus to
exit the cell so influence a viruses are

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340
exit the cell so influence a viruses are
 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.629
exit the cell so influence a viruses are
known by their hemagglutinin serogroup

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639
known by their hemagglutinin serogroup
 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.670
known by their hemagglutinin serogroup
and neuraminidase your group and so

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680
and neuraminidase your group and so
 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.360
and neuraminidase your group and so
you'll see numbers like h1n one or h3n2

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370
you'll see numbers like h1n one or h3n2
 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.480
you'll see numbers like h1n one or h3n2
or h5n1 and these are all influenza a

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490
or h5n1 and these are all influenza a
 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.100
or h5n1 and these are all influenza a
viruses next slide there are 16

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110
viruses next slide there are 16
 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.090
viruses next slide there are 16
different hemagglutinin serotypes only

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100
different hemagglutinin serotypes only
 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.210
different hemagglutinin serotypes only
three of those are normally circulate or

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220
three of those are normally circulate or
 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.580
three of those are normally circulate or
circuit have circulated ever in human

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590
circuit have circulated ever in human
 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.029
circuit have circulated ever in human
populations and so seasonal viruses up

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039
populations and so seasonal viruses up
 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.690
populations and so seasonal viruses up
to this point have been either h1 h2 or

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700
to this point have been either h1 h2 or
 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.430
to this point have been either h1 h2 or
h3 and either in one or into but there

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440
h3 and either in one or into but there
 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.260
h3 and either in one or into but there
are a lot of other hemagglutinin and

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270
are a lot of other hemagglutinin and
 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.580
are a lot of other hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase influenza viruses

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590
neuraminidase influenza viruses
 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.500
neuraminidase influenza viruses
influenza a viruses out there these

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510
influenza a viruses out there these
 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.750
influenza a viruses out there these
mostly are these circulating animals

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760
mostly are these circulating animals
 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.360
mostly are these circulating animals
mostly in birds but also pigs horses

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370
mostly in birds but also pigs horses
 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.100
mostly in birds but also pigs horses
dogs and other animals and the the

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110
dogs and other animals and the the
 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.029
dogs and other animals and the the
seasonal viruses have the they naturally

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039
seasonal viruses have the they naturally
 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.250
seasonal viruses have the they naturally
will drift as the immunity and a human

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260
will drift as the immunity and a human
 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.010
will drift as the immunity and a human
population develops to the virus they

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
population develops to the virus they
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.170
population develops to the virus they
will change ever so slightly to evade

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
will change ever so slightly to evade
 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.110
will change ever so slightly to evade
that population immunity so they're

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120
that population immunity so they're
 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.460
that population immunity so they're
changing every every year drifting a

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
changing every every year drifting a
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.900
changing every every year drifting a
little bit

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910
little bit
 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.240
little bit
it this is why seasonal influenza

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250
it this is why seasonal influenza
 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.060
it this is why seasonal influenza
viruses have to change periodically but

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070
viruses have to change periodically but
 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.610
viruses have to change periodically but
influenza a viruses also have the

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620
influenza a viruses also have the
 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.530
influenza a viruses also have the
ability or the occasionally will change

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540
ability or the occasionally will change
 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.830
ability or the occasionally will change
very dramatically so that there's no

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840
very dramatically so that there's no
 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.210
very dramatically so that there's no
immunity in the population and when this

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220
immunity in the population and when this
 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.240
immunity in the population and when this
kind of shift takes place we have the

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250
kind of shift takes place we have the
 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.580
kind of shift takes place we have the
possibility of an influenza a virus

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590
possibility of an influenza a virus
 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.470
possibility of an influenza a virus
causing pandemic next slide so when a

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480
causing pandemic next slide so when a
 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.420
causing pandemic next slide so when a
when a new combination of genetic

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430
when a new combination of genetic
 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.640
when a new combination of genetic
material and an influenza virus makes

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650
material and an influenza virus makes
 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.460
material and an influenza virus makes
itself known the question is does this

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470
itself known the question is does this
 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.520
itself known the question is does this
virus have pandemic potential the

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530
virus have pandemic potential the
 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.520
virus have pandemic potential the
newness of the viruses is a given what

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530
newness of the viruses is a given what
 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.830
newness of the viruses is a given what
that means is that there's no immunity

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840
that means is that there's no immunity
 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.060
that means is that there's no immunity
or very little immunity in the

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070
or very little immunity in the
 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.790
or very little immunity in the
population but the virus also has to

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800
population but the virus also has to
 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.520
population but the virus also has to
have the ability to transmit efficiently

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.530
have the ability to transmit efficiently
 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.260
have the ability to transmit efficiently
from person to person and it has to be

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270
from person to person and it has to be
 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.630
from person to person and it has to be
in a setting where sustained

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:37.640
in a setting where sustained
 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.750
in a setting where sustained
transmission can take place so these

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:40.760
transmission can take place so these
 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.020
transmission can take place so these
characteristics create or identify a

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030
characteristics create or identify a
 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.410
characteristics create or identify a
virus that could cause a pandemic a

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.420
virus that could cause a pandemic a
 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.480
virus that could cause a pandemic a
pandemic of course is a worldwide

among humans there are two things about
this definition that I'd like to point

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.570
this definition that I'd like to point
 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.090
this definition that I'd like to point
out one is that that it doesn't say how

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.100
out one is that that it doesn't say how
 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.790
out one is that that it doesn't say how
bad the infection will be so you can

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800
bad the infection will be so you can
 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.680
bad the infection will be so you can
have a by this definition you could have

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:11.690
have a by this definition you could have
 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.070
have a by this definition you could have
a pandemic with a relatively mild

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080
a pandemic with a relatively mild

disease that's not very severe and the
 

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.240
disease that's not very severe and the
other thing about this definition is

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.250
other thing about this definition is
 

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.180
other thing about this definition is
that is actually backward-looking so

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.190
that is actually backward-looking so
 

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.909
that is actually backward-looking so
that when a new virus emerges this has

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919
that when a new virus emerges this has
 

00:08:24.919 --> 00:08:26.530
that when a new virus emerges this has
all these characteristics you can't say

all these characteristics you can't say
 

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.750
all these characteristics you can't say
that it's a pandemic virus until it's

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:28.760
that it's a pandemic virus until it's
 

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.960
that it's a pandemic virus until it's

into this quadrant be a lot lower level

of severity than the 1918 pandemic but

than any of the other other reference
 

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:44.030
than any of the other other reference
reference seasonal epidemics so from the

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:44.040
reference seasonal epidemics so from the
 

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.400
reference seasonal epidemics so from the
1957 pandemic we had the ability to

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:47.410
1957 pandemic we had the ability to
 

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.510
1957 pandemic we had the ability to
identify the virus and to make vaccine

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520
identify the virus and to make vaccine
 

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.550
identify the virus and to make vaccine
and there's no doubt that that vaccine

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:53.560
and there's no doubt that that vaccine
 

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.490
and there's no doubt that that vaccine
prevented some disease it's hard to know

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.380

exactly I don't think all 40 million

exactly I don't think all 40 million
 

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.150
exactly I don't think all 40 million
doses were used but it's hard to know

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.160
doses were used but it's hard to know
 

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.090
doses were used but it's hard to know
exactly who got those doses and what

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.100
exactly who got those doses and what
 

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.130
exactly who got those doses and what
amount of disease they they prevented I

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140
amount of disease they they prevented I
 

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.950

2007 a traveler returned from China with
pneumonia had been on a poultry farm we

pneumonia had been on a poultry farm we
 

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.760
pneumonia had been on a poultry farm we
thought that this was the beginning of

Pakistan traveled to the US this was at

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.170
Pakistan traveled to the US this was at
 

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.380
Pakistan traveled to the US this was at
a time when it wasn't known that

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:57.390
a time when it wasn't known that
 

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.770

Pakistan had a tribe in one he reported

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780
Pakistan had a tribe in one he reported
 

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.270
Pakistan had a tribe in one he reported
that his brother had died from a tribe

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280
that his brother had died from a tribe
 

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.450
that his brother had died from a tribe
in one he wasn't feeling too well it

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460
in one he wasn't feeling too well it
 

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.940
in one he wasn't feeling too well it
turned out that he also did not have a

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:07.950
turned out that he also did not have a
 

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.310
turned out that he also did not have a
tribe in one but this really was the

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320
tribe in one but this really was the
 

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.260
tribe in one but this really was the
kind of thing that would expect it would

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:12.270
kind of thing that would expect it would
 

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.780
kind of thing that would expect it would
be happening that there'd be a sentinel

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:14.790
be happening that there'd be a sentinel
 

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.040
be happening that there'd be a sentinel
event that we would respond to I'd say

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.050
event that we would respond to I'd say
 

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.910
event that we would respond to I'd say
that a lot of these plans were based on

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920
that a lot of these plans were based on
 

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.810
that a lot of these plans were based on
a there's different ways of calling this

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820
a there's different ways of calling this
 

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.270
a there's different ways of calling this
but it would in the UK they call it a

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280
but it would in the UK they call it a
 

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.780
but it would in the UK they call it a
reasonable worst-case scenario so what

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:31.790
reasonable worst-case scenario so what
 

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.060
reasonable worst-case scenario so what
in the realm of possibility is sort of

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.070
in the realm of possibility is sort of
 

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.360
in the realm of possibility is sort of
still possible but really bad and there

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:38.370
still possible but really bad and there
 

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.060
still possible but really bad and there
was also an assumption that the this

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.070
was also an assumption that the this
 

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.970
was also an assumption that the this
this pandemic would be starting overseas

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980
this pandemic would be starting overseas
 

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.370
this pandemic would be starting overseas
and that there would be time to detect

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380
and that there would be time to detect
 

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.050
and that there would be time to detect
it before it arrived in the united

it before it arrived in the united
 

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.020
it before it arrived in the united
states that we have maybe have a chance

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.030
states that we have maybe have a chance
 

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.640
states that we have maybe have a chance
to contain the outbreak at its source

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:54.650
to contain the outbreak at its source
 

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.590
to contain the outbreak at its source
and that we at least have several weeks

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:57.600
and that we at least have several weeks
 

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.460
and that we at least have several weeks
to prepare within the united states to

significant was going on but these were
all mild cases at the beginning in fact

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:42.490
all mild cases at the beginning in fact
 

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.340
all mild cases at the beginning in fact
several of the cases had recovered

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:44.350
several of the cases had recovered
 

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.300
several of the cases had recovered
before they were diagnosed and then on

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.310
before they were diagnosed and then on
 

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.930
before they were diagnosed and then on
April 23rd that really that was really

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:51.940
April 23rd that really that was really
 

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.700
April 23rd that really that was really
the big news that in autopsy material

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:56.710
the big news that in autopsy material
 

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.390
the big news that in autopsy material
sent from Mexico to Canada and to CDC

the swanton thought related to swine flu
viruses were identified and we had a

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:12.850
viruses were identified and we had a
 

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.190
viruses were identified and we had a
real

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200
 

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.380
so the two different sets of information

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.390
so the two different sets of information
 

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.410
so the two different sets of information
a few very mild cases from the US all

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:20.420
a few very mild cases from the US all
 

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.770
a few very mild cases from the US all
the cases in Mexico have been fatal and

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:22.780
the cases in Mexico have been fatal and
 

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.329
the cases in Mexico have been fatal and
we didn't know if we were missing severe

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:25.339
we didn't know if we were missing severe
 

00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:28.060
we didn't know if we were missing severe
cases or if Mexico was missing mild

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.070
cases or if Mexico was missing mild
 

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.849
cases or if Mexico was missing mild
cases or if there was some combination

00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:30.859
cases or if there was some combination
 

00:39:30.859 --> 00:39:33.220
cases or if there was some combination
or maybe it was it was more developed in

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:33.230
or maybe it was it was more developed in
 

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.670
or maybe it was it was more developed in
a more later in Mexico than in the u.s.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680
a more later in Mexico than in the u.s.
 

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.859
a more later in Mexico than in the u.s.
to some extent these questions I think

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:38.869
to some extent these questions I think
 

00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:45.400
to some extent these questions I think

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.460
throughout the country and really
throughout the world so there was a

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:04.470
throughout the world so there was a
 

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.760
throughout the world so there was a
foundation of knowledge about the about

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:07.770
foundation of knowledge about the about
 

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.120
foundation of knowledge about the about
the disease we vaccinated around 80,000

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:11.130
the disease we vaccinated around 80,000
 

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.110
the disease we vaccinated around 80,000
80 million people and used the something

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:15.120
80 million people and used the something
 

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.500
80 million people and used the something
that had been available in Prior in

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:17.510
that had been available in Prior in
 

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:21.370
that had been available in Prior in
Prior pandemics antiviral drugs that

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:21.380

next slide you'll see that we prevented

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:25.770
next slide you'll see that we prevented
 

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:29.300
next slide you'll see that we prevented
5 to 10 million cases through the use of

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:29.310
5 to 10 million cases through the use of
 

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:34.900
5 to 10 million cases through the use of
vaccine prevented around 30,000

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:34.910
vaccine prevented around 30,000
 

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.750
vaccine prevented around 30,000
hospitalizations with that broad range

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760
hospitalizations with that broad range
 

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.670
hospitalizations with that broad range
and from vaccination alone a thousand to

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680
and from vaccination alone a thousand to
 

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.860
and from vaccination alone a thousand to
1,800 deaths we think about 6 million

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:44.870
1,800 deaths we think about 6 million
 

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.910
1,800 deaths we think about 6 million
antiviral courses of treatment were used

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920
antiviral courses of treatment were used
 

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.490
antiviral courses of treatment were used
preventing between 8,000 and 12,000

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500
preventing between 8,000 and 12,000
 

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.220
preventing between 8,000 and 12,000
hospitalizations and four to six hundred

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:55.230
hospitalizations and four to six hundred
 

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.230
hospitalizations and four to six hundred
deaths and if you look at the title

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240
deaths and if you look at the title
 

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.050
deaths and if you look at the title
that's the some sort of taking the

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060
that's the some sort of taking the
 

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.120
that's the some sort of taking the
lowest estimate of what was accomplished

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:04.130
lowest estimate of what was accomplished
 

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:22.060
lowest estimate of what was accomplished
next slide so so how did we do

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:22.070
 

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.360
do that don't don't we have to show a

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:25.370
do that don't don't we have to show a
 

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.370
do that don't don't we have to show a
certain baseline level of competence

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:27.380
certain baseline level of competence
 

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.140
certain baseline level of competence
yeah well I mean I'd argue that we have

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:29.150
yeah well I mean I'd argue that we have
 

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.200
yeah well I mean I'd argue that we have
shown a baseline level of competence the

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:32.210
shown a baseline level of competence the
 

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:33.730
shown a baseline level of competence the
thing is that when you show a level of

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:33.740
thing is that when you show a level of
 

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.970
thing is that when you show a level of
competence it doesn't become a story it

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:36.980
competence it doesn't become a story it
 

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.070
competence it doesn't become a story it
only becomes a story when they're our

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:39.080
only becomes a story when they're our
 

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.280
only becomes a story when they're our
problems take the h1n1 flu for example

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:42.290
problems take the h1n1 flu for example
 

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:44.110
problems take the h1n1 flu for example
right we jumped on that quickly not some

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:44.120
right we jumped on that quickly not some
 

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.580
right we jumped on that quickly not some
people criticized this for being too

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:45.590
people criticized this for being too
 

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.350
people criticized this for being too
aggressive on it but I think we averted

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:47.360
aggressive on it but I think we averted
 

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.150
aggressive on it but I think we averted
a larger public health disaster and

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160
a larger public health disaster and
 

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.760
a larger public health disaster and
there are many examples that's a fair

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:51.770
there are many examples that's a fair
 

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.830
there are many examples that's a fair
that's absolutely a sharp point we're

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:53.840
that's absolutely a sharp point we're
 

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.130
that's absolutely a sharp point we're
gonna get a commercial so here's what

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:57.140
gonna get a commercial so here's what
 

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.180
gonna get a commercial so here's what
we're going to do because this happens

00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:58.190
we're going to do because this happens
 

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.350
we're going to do because this happens
to me all the time we get a nice

00:46:59.350 --> 00:46:59.360
to me all the time we get a nice
 

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.390
to me all the time we get a nice
interesting conversation and then Comedy

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400
interesting conversation and then Comedy
 

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.710

and so we're going to go to commercial

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:05.600
and so we're going to go to commercial

and so we're going to go to commercial
we'll talk for a little bit longer next

little bit of a different way what we
 

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:18.880
little bit of a different way what we
learned is that the work that we did

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:18.890
learned is that the work that we did
 

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.130
learned is that the work that we did
before the pandemic was very important

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:21.140
before the pandemic was very important
 

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.050

everyday systems bullet what I mean by

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880
everyday systems bullet what I mean by
 

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.460
everyday systems bullet what I mean by
that is that the things that were in use

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:51.470
that is that the things that were in use
 

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:53.920
that is that the things that were in use
all the time for seasonal influenza and

all the time for seasonal influenza and
 

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.890
all the time for seasonal influenza and
routine public health really formed the

countermeasure initiative I think if you

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:56.069
countermeasure initiative I think if you
 

00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:57.470
countermeasure initiative I think if you
read these bullets it might be kind of

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480
read these bullets it might be kind of
 

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.420
read these bullets it might be kind of

actually have to grow the vaccine but we
 

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.660
actually have to grow the vaccine but we
can move to more if growing the vaccine

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:05.670
can move to more if growing the vaccine

but there wasn't a large-scale public

00:54:10.799 --> 00:54:10.809
but there wasn't a large-scale public
 

00:54:10.809 --> 00:54:13.410
but there wasn't a large-scale public
health campaign which is a little bit

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:13.420
health campaign which is a little bit
 

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.259
health campaign which is a little bit
surprising given the most pandemic that

00:54:16.259 --> 00:54:16.269
surprising given the most pandemic that
 

00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:19.609
surprising given the most pandemic that
was most recent that was was so severe

00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619
was most recent that was was so severe
 

00:54:19.619 --> 00:54:22.169
was most recent that was was so severe
and again as I've said earlier maybe

00:54:22.169 --> 00:54:22.179
and again as I've said earlier maybe
 

00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:23.330
and again as I've said earlier maybe
that is the nature of

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:23.340
that is the nature of
 

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.880
that is the nature of
the winds that it passes quickly through

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:25.890
the winds that it passes quickly through
 

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.640
the winds that it passes quickly through
a community most cases or mild even even

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:28.650
a community most cases or mild even even
 

00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:34.910

the sharing of reagents to make sure
 

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.710
the sharing of reagents to make sure
that we had a global picture and the

that we had a global picture and the
 

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.180

and you've seen that there's a lot of

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:53.610
and you've seen that there's a lot of
 

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.130
and you've seen that there's a lot of
work underway to make sure that that

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140
work underway to make sure that that
 

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.330

of us at a little bit higher level I

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.010
of us at a little bit higher level I
 

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.700
of us at a little bit higher level I
think we should expect that for the

think we should expect that for the
 

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:09.470
think we should expect that for the
future as our abilities to respond grow

there's going to be an expectation that

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160
there's going to be an expectation that
 

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.890
there's going to be an expectation that
we're able to respond that may even be

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900
we're able to respond that may even be
 

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.440
we're able to respond that may even be
greater than what we're able to do and

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:15.450
greater than what we're able to do and
 

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:19.040

revolution that's taking place we know
 

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.440
revolution that's taking place we know
that we'll have to do those things that

that we'll have to do those things that
 

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:26.660

also be sure that the next pandemic will

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:39.930
also be sure that the next pandemic will
 

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.430
also be sure that the next pandemic will
be seen even more as a global event that

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440
be seen even more as a global event that

be seen even more as a global event that
even though all these pandemics have

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:44.790
even though all these pandemics have
 

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.670
even though all these pandemics have
been global I think that there would be

00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680
been global I think that there would be
 

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:49.190
been global I think that there would be
a global nature of it that will be

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200
a global nature of it that will be
 

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.290
a global nature of it that will be
greater than what we've seen in the

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300
greater than what we've seen in the
 

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:52.990
greater than what we've seen in the
pandemics that have occurred up to now

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000

committed to find way too much vaccine

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:45.550
committed to find way too much vaccine
 

00:56:45.550 --> 00:57:02.700
committed to find way too much vaccine
that turns out

00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:02.710
 

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:05.800
yeah I think that the the problem with

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:05.810
yeah I think that the the problem with
 

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:11.230
yeah I think that the the problem with
the vaccine production was really the

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240
the vaccine production was really the
 

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.870
the vaccine production was really the
cause of vaccine being purchased that

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880
cause of vaccine being purchased that
 

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.150
cause of vaccine being purchased that
was an administered because by the time

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160
was an administered because by the time
 

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.880
was an administered because by the time
we had the vaccine the demand for it had

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:18.890
we had the vaccine the demand for it had
 

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:22.450
we had the vaccine the demand for it had
declined the decision-making process is

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:22.460
declined the decision-making process is
 

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.920
declined the decision-making process is
such that you have to make the decision

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:23.930
such that you have to make the decision
 

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:27.550
such that you have to make the decision
to buy several months before the vaccine

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:27.560
to buy several months before the vaccine
 

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.460
to buy several months before the vaccine
was actually delivered I think on the

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:30.470
was actually delivered I think on the
 

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:34.900
was actually delivered I think on the
whole the the work that was done was to

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:34.910
whole the the work that was done was to
 

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.630
whole the the work that was done was to
make sure that there wasn't a situation

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640
make sure that there wasn't a situation
 

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.640
make sure that there wasn't a situation
where we could have purchased vaccine

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:39.650
where we could have purchased vaccine
 

00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:41.710
where we could have purchased vaccine
there was demand for it and there was

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720
there was demand for it and there was
 

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.050
there was demand for it and there was
disease that could be prevented so that

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:44.060
disease that could be prevented so that
 

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.360
disease that could be prevented so that
that was that had a lot to do with the

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:46.370
that was that had a lot to do with the
 

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.490
that was that had a lot to do with the
way the decisions were made I would hope

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:48.500
way the decisions were made I would hope
 

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.160
way the decisions were made I would hope
that we would use that same formula for

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:51.170
that we would use that same formula for
 

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:56.530
that we would use that same formula for
the future and that the purchase of

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:56.540
the future and that the purchase of
 

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:00.010
the future and that the purchase of
vaccine was really looking at it in that

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:00.020
vaccine was really looking at it in that
 

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.620
vaccine was really looking at it in that
way I think that we not knowing what was

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:02.630
way I think that we not knowing what was
 

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:04.000
way I think that we not knowing what was
going to happen several months down the

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:04.010
going to happen several months down the
 

00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:06.610
going to happen several months down the
road it was safer to have vaccine rather

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:06.620
road it was safer to have vaccine rather
 

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.700
road it was safer to have vaccine rather

more general question but it pertains to

more general question but it pertains to
 

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:20.670
more general question but it pertains to

as there is when it comes to other

00:59:20.049 --> 00:59:20.059
as there is when it comes to other
 

00:59:20.059 --> 00:59:23.259
as there is when it comes to other
nationals yeah I think there is kind of

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:23.269
nationals yeah I think there is kind of
 

00:59:23.269 --> 00:59:26.049
nationals yeah I think there is kind of
a different construct where the work

00:59:26.049 --> 00:59:26.059
a different construct where the work
 

00:59:26.059 --> 00:59:27.819
a different construct where the work
that we do in public health is done

00:59:27.819 --> 00:59:27.829
that we do in public health is done
 

00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:31.299
that we do in public health is done
collaboratively both within the US and

00:59:31.299 --> 00:59:31.309
collaboratively both within the US and
 

00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:34.930
collaboratively both within the US and
outside of the US we we monitor closely

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:34.940
outside of the US we we monitor closely
 

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.499
outside of the US we we monitor closely
trims and disease and want to know

00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:38.509
trims and disease and want to know
 

00:59:38.509 --> 00:59:40.150
trims and disease and want to know
what's going on wherever it's going on

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160
what's going on wherever it's going on
 

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.120
what's going on wherever it's going on
throughout the world we work to build

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:43.130
throughout the world we work to build
 

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:46.229
throughout the world we work to build
capacity of countries to be able to make

00:59:46.229 --> 00:59:46.239
capacity of countries to be able to make
 

00:59:46.239 --> 00:59:49.450
capacity of countries to be able to make
make diagnoses and determine whether

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:49.460
make diagnoses and determine whether
 

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.670
make diagnoses and determine whether
something is going on so I think the

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680
something is going on so I think the
 

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.829
something is going on so I think the
there is a lot of collaboration that

00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839
there is a lot of collaboration that
 

00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:57.370
there is a lot of collaboration that
goes on we do send teams to try to find

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:57.380
goes on we do send teams to try to find
 

00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.440
goes on we do send teams to try to find
out what's going on in collaboration

00:59:59.440 --> 00:59:59.450
out what's going on in collaboration
 

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.259
out what's going on in collaboration
with different countries and with with

01:00:02.259 --> 01:00:02.269
with different countries and with with
 

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.390
with different countries and with with
state health departments there's

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400
state health departments there's
 

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.099
state health departments there's
probably another piece to the puzzle

01:00:06.099 --> 01:00:06.109
probably another piece to the puzzle
 

01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:11.099
probably another piece to the puzzle
that's that's not in the in the

01:00:11.099 --> 01:00:11.109
that's that's not in the in the
 

01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:13.059
that's that's not in the in the
landscape that you painted that's a

01:00:13.059 --> 01:00:13.069
landscape that you painted that's a
 

01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:15.039
landscape that you painted that's a
little bit different in that the World

01:00:15.039 --> 01:00:15.049
little bit different in that the World
 

01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:17.469
little bit different in that the World
Health Organization is also an important

01:00:17.469 --> 01:00:17.479
Health Organization is also an important
 

01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:19.900
Health Organization is also an important
collaborator in public health and so

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:19.910
collaborator in public health and so
 

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:22.959
collaborator in public health and so
there are lots of people trying to know

01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:22.969
there are lots of people trying to know
 

01:00:22.969 --> 01:00:26.499
there are lots of people trying to know
what's going on I think also there's not

01:00:26.499 --> 01:00:26.509
what's going on I think also there's not
 

01:00:26.509 --> 01:00:29.680
what's going on I think also there's not
the need for secrecy in the way that

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:29.690
the need for secrecy in the way that
 

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:30.940
the need for secrecy in the way that
some of those other areas there are in

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:30.950
some of those other areas there are in
 

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:33.069
some of those other areas there are in
fact it's just the opposite that the

01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079
fact it's just the opposite that the
 

01:00:33.079 --> 01:00:35.680
fact it's just the opposite that the
more people know everything that's going

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:35.690
more people know everything that's going
 

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.170
more people know everything that's going
on the better the better we'll all be so

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:38.180
on the better the better we'll all be so
 

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.969
on the better the better we'll all be so
i think that there's some things that

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:39.979
i think that there's some things that
 

01:00:39.979 --> 01:00:41.380
i think that there's some things that
we're doing that are along the lines of

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:41.390
we're doing that are along the lines of
 

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:42.270
we're doing that are along the lines of
what you're saying

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280
what you're saying
 

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.430
what you're saying
the whole perspective is really

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440
the whole perspective is really
 

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.240
the whole perspective is really
different so would you say stands in

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:47.250
different so would you say stands in
 

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.660
different so would you say stands in
relationships is the efforts so the

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:51.670
relationships is the efforts so the
 

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:56.280
relationships is the efforts so the
question was that so as I my comparison

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:56.290
question was that so as I my comparison
 

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:58.560
question was that so as I my comparison
was ok terrorism not many people die

01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:58.570
was ok terrorism not many people die
 

01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:02.700
was ok terrorism not many people die
every year is would you say the money

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:02.710
every year is would you say the money
 

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:06.320
every year is would you say the money
being spent on the efforts undertaken to

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.330
being spent on the efforts undertaken to
 

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.850
being spent on the efforts undertaken to
take preventive measures and detect

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:08.860
take preventive measures and detect
 

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:13.680
take preventive measures and detect
early are in relation to yes yeah is

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:13.690
early are in relation to yes yeah is
 

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.480
early are in relation to yes yeah is
there one touch yeah I guess the the

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:15.490
there one touch yeah I guess the the
 

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.430
there one touch yeah I guess the the
frame of reference that i have is among

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440
frame of reference that i have is among
 

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.500
frame of reference that i have is among
other among health threats so i think

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:19.510
other among health threats so i think
 

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.030
other among health threats so i think
there's a lot of work being done to

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040
there's a lot of work being done to
 

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.180
there's a lot of work being done to
detect events overseas could more be

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:24.190
detect events overseas could more be
 

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.570
detect events overseas could more be
done for sure I don't know that we can

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:27.580
done for sure I don't know that we can
 

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.150
done for sure I don't know that we can
really make these kind of comparisons

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160
really make these kind of comparisons
 

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.820
really make these kind of comparisons
across these different disciplines to

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:32.830
across these different disciplines to
 

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.340
across these different disciplines to
sort of say you know do cost-benefit

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:35.350
sort of say you know do cost-benefit
 

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:51.289
sort of say you know do cost-benefit
analyses or those kinds of things

01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:51.299
 

01:01:51.299 --> 01:01:54.599
and I was struck by your use of the

01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:54.609
and I was struck by your use of the
 

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:56.400
and I was struck by your use of the
language of sorts the level of social

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.410
language of sorts the level of social
 

01:01:56.410 --> 01:02:01.949
language of sorts the level of social
control within 19 and 57 and they

01:02:01.949 --> 01:02:01.959
control within 19 and 57 and they
 

01:02:01.959 --> 01:02:04.079
control within 19 and 57 and they
currently and I was I'm just interested

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:04.089
currently and I was I'm just interested
 

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:07.769
currently and I was I'm just interested
in sort of how someone who is

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:07.779
in sort of how someone who is
 

01:02:07.779 --> 01:02:10.859
in sort of how someone who is
professionally in cbc and someone coming

01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:10.869
professionally in cbc and someone coming
 

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:12.089
professionally in cbc and someone coming
in from my perspective not with a

01:02:12.089 --> 01:02:12.099
in from my perspective not with a
 

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:14.279
in from my perspective not with a
navigator already training that can sort

01:02:14.279 --> 01:02:14.289
navigator already training that can sort
 

01:02:14.289 --> 01:02:16.559
navigator already training that can sort
of talk about what that means that sort

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:16.569
of talk about what that means that sort
 

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:18.120
of talk about what that means that sort
of level of social control and what's

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:18.130
of level of social control and what's
 

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.849
of level of social control and what's
the concept of that as it pertains to

01:02:20.849 --> 01:02:20.859
the concept of that as it pertains to
 

01:02:20.859 --> 01:02:24.239
the concept of that as it pertains to
the endemic experience and and also the

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:24.249
the endemic experience and and also the
 

01:02:24.249 --> 01:02:27.719
the endemic experience and and also the
sort of public memory of it has to do

01:02:27.719 --> 01:02:27.729
sort of public memory of it has to do
 

01:02:27.729 --> 01:02:31.170
sort of public memory of it has to do
with that yeah no I think that's one of

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:31.180
with that yeah no I think that's one of
 

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.430
with that yeah no I think that's one of
the themes of the talk and I guess based

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440
the themes of the talk and I guess based
 

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.709
the themes of the talk and I guess based
on recent experience what I would say is

01:02:37.709 --> 01:02:37.719
on recent experience what I would say is
 

01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:41.309
on recent experience what I would say is
that there is decreasing ability to do

01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319
that there is decreasing ability to do
 

01:02:41.319 --> 01:02:43.430
that there is decreasing ability to do
anything like that probably a good thing

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440
anything like that probably a good thing
 

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.390
anything like that probably a good thing
but it also creates a certain amount of

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400
but it also creates a certain amount of
 

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.359
but it also creates a certain amount of
chaos and requires a different set of

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:51.369
chaos and requires a different set of
 

01:02:51.369 --> 01:02:53.309
chaos and requires a different set of
skills I think from public health and

01:02:53.309 --> 01:02:53.319
skills I think from public health and
 

01:02:53.319 --> 01:02:55.289
skills I think from public health and
what might have been used or might have

01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:55.299
what might have been used or might have
 

01:02:55.299 --> 01:02:58.259
what might have been used or might have
been available previously which is the

01:02:58.259 --> 01:02:58.269
been available previously which is the
 

01:02:58.269 --> 01:03:00.180
been available previously which is the
risk communication strategy of open

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:00.190
risk communication strategy of open
 

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:02.569
risk communication strategy of open
communication acknowledging uncertainty

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579
communication acknowledging uncertainty
 

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:06.120
communication acknowledging uncertainty
and try to answer people's questions to

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:06.130
and try to answer people's questions to
 

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.219
and try to answer people's questions to
promote a degree of trust that in those

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:08.229
promote a degree of trust that in those
 

01:03:08.229 --> 01:03:11.839
promote a degree of trust that in those
prior instances there are other ways of

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:11.849
prior instances there are other ways of
 

01:03:11.849 --> 01:03:21.299
prior instances there are other ways of
sort of gaining compliance I guess

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:21.309
 

01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:24.609
my question is about bioterrorism and

01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:24.619
my question is about bioterrorism and
 

01:03:24.619 --> 01:03:27.069
my question is about bioterrorism and
how we should kind of prepare for that

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079
how we should kind of prepare for that
 

01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:29.380
how we should kind of prepare for that
kind of situation because you may have

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:29.390
kind of situation because you may have
 

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:31.539
kind of situation because you may have
more than one pathogen going around at a

01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:31.549
more than one pathogen going around at a
 

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:35.819
more than one pathogen going around at a
time obviously and so maybe as a country

01:03:35.819 --> 01:03:35.829
time obviously and so maybe as a country
 

01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:39.130
time obviously and so maybe as a country
that's trying to handle one pan diffic

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:39.140
that's trying to handle one pan diffic
 

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.829
that's trying to handle one pan diffic
at a time should be maybe like divide

01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839
at a time should be maybe like divide
 

01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.960
at a time should be maybe like divide
that and have like the cities' be more

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:43.970
that and have like the cities' be more
 

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:46.569
that and have like the cities' be more
control of focus on other states so they

01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:46.579
control of focus on other states so they
 

01:03:46.579 --> 01:03:50.500
control of focus on other states so they
have more power on their own to joshy

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:50.510
have more power on their own to joshy
 

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:52.150
have more power on their own to joshy
yeah no I think that cities and

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160
yeah no I think that cities and
 

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.190
yeah no I think that cities and
localities have a lot of authority and

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:54.200
localities have a lot of authority and
 

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.359
localities have a lot of authority and
in fact in an even in the that probably

01:03:58.359 --> 01:03:58.369
in fact in an even in the that probably
 

01:03:58.369 --> 01:03:59.980
in fact in an even in the that probably
came out most clearly in the in the

01:03:59.980 --> 01:03:59.990
came out most clearly in the in the
 

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:01.900
came out most clearly in the in the
nineteen eighteen pendant maybe not

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:01.910
nineteen eighteen pendant maybe not
 

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:04.930
nineteen eighteen pendant maybe not
altogether as a positive I think there

01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:04.940
altogether as a positive I think there
 

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.210
altogether as a positive I think there
is a balance between a national view and

01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:09.220
is a balance between a national view and
 

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.650
is a balance between a national view and
global recommendations but those have to

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:11.660
global recommendations but those have to
 

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.200
global recommendations but those have to
be applied locally and so I think there

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:14.210
be applied locally and so I think there
 

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:16.930
be applied locally and so I think there
is appropriately a lot of authority at

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:16.940
is appropriately a lot of authority at
 

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.940
is appropriately a lot of authority at
local health departments and state

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:18.950
local health departments and state
 

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:20.289
local health departments and state
health departments and that's really the

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:20.299
health departments and that's really the
 

01:04:20.299 --> 01:04:22.539
health departments and that's really the
way it ought to be I think one of the

01:04:22.539 --> 01:04:22.549
way it ought to be I think one of the
 

01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:25.390
way it ought to be I think one of the
things in the in the 2009 pandemic is we

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400
things in the in the 2009 pandemic is we
 

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.999
things in the in the 2009 pandemic is we
recognize that you know we were doing

01:04:27.999 --> 01:04:28.009
recognize that you know we were doing
 

01:04:28.009 --> 01:04:32.289
recognize that you know we were doing
these things but the work the real sort

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299
these things but the work the real sort
 

01:04:32.299 --> 01:04:35.920
these things but the work the real sort
of putting shots in arms and collecting

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:35.930
of putting shots in arms and collecting
 

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.859
of putting shots in arms and collecting
specimens happen at the local level so

01:04:38.859 --> 01:04:38.869
specimens happen at the local level so
 

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:40.299
specimens happen at the local level so
really the work that's done on the

01:04:40.299 --> 01:04:40.309
really the work that's done on the
 

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:43.450
really the work that's done on the
ground it's not happening in Atlanta

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:43.460
ground it's not happening in Atlanta
 

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.880

and are prepared for that kind of

01:04:53.319 --> 01:04:53.329
and are prepared for that kind of
 

01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:55.450
and are prepared for that kind of
situation currently well I think there's

01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:55.460
situation currently well I think there's
 

01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.430

I think what we've seen over the past
 

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.890
I think what we've seen over the past

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:15.809
that is regrettable and it would be
better if that weren't the case

exactly how that would be set up it

01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:01.040
exactly how that would be set up it
 

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.309
exactly how that would be set up it
would probably have to be something

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319

somewhat separates from government I
think that the the idea would be that

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:09.069
think that the the idea would be that
 

01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:13.030
think that the the idea would be that
there that these would be products that

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:13.040
there that these would be products that
 

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.680
there that these would be products that
big pharma wouldn't be that interested

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:14.690
big pharma wouldn't be that interested
 

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:18.999
big pharma wouldn't be that interested
in so things that a small company might

01:08:18.999 --> 01:08:19.009
in so things that a small company might
 

01:08:19.009 --> 01:08:20.920
in so things that a small company might
have an idea and have it to a certain

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:20.930
have an idea and have it to a certain
 

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.709
have an idea and have it to a certain
point where it could be taken to the

01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:23.719
point where it could be taken to the
 

01:08:23.719 --> 01:08:27.910
point where it could be taken to the
next level with resources that maybe you

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920
next level with resources that maybe you
 

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.039
next level with resources that maybe you
wouldn't have a market but but there be

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:30.049
wouldn't have a market but but there be
 

01:08:30.049 --> 01:08:32.709
wouldn't have a market but but there be
and so there'd be a need for this kind

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719
and so there'd be a need for this kind
 

01:08:32.719 --> 01:08:36.370
and so there'd be a need for this kind
of ability to take an innovative idea to

01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:36.380
of ability to take an innovative idea to
 

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.790
of ability to take an innovative idea to
the next level I think that the

01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:39.800
the next level I think that the
 

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.790
the next level I think that the
the i think that the points that you're

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:42.800
the i think that the points that you're
 

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.940
the i think that the points that you're
making are important ones and whatever

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:45.950
making are important ones and whatever
 

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:48.730
making are important ones and whatever
is done this shouldn't be just sort of

01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:48.740
is done this shouldn't be just sort of
 

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.200
is done this shouldn't be just sort of
handing money over it's got to be a

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:50.210
handing money over it's got to be a
 

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.720
handing money over it's got to be a
benefit to the government it's really

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:52.730
benefit to the government it's really
 

01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:54.730
benefit to the government it's really
the public to the benefit of the gut of

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:54.740
the public to the benefit of the gut of
 

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:57.430
the public to the benefit of the gut of
the public in a way that wouldn't occur

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440
the public in a way that wouldn't occur
 

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.070
the public in a way that wouldn't occur
without it and so that that's really the

01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080
without it and so that that's really the
 

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.600
without it and so that that's really the
idea that there's some of these these

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:01.610
idea that there's some of these these
 

01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:02.890
idea that there's some of these these
products that are getting to a certain

01:09:02.890 --> 01:09:02.900
products that are getting to a certain
 

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.140
products that are getting to a certain
point but they're you're not able to get

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:05.150
point but they're you're not able to get
 

01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:06.730
point but they're you're not able to get
beyond that and this is another way to

01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:06.740
beyond that and this is another way to
 

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.820
beyond that and this is another way to
try to goose them along but I agree with

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:09.830
try to goose them along but I agree with
 

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.810
try to goose them along but I agree with
you that we things like who's making the

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:13.820
you that we things like who's making the
 

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.690
you that we things like who's making the
money and does these the pose this

01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:16.700
money and does these the pose this
 

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.550
money and does these the pose this
really a benefit to the public or key

01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560
really a benefit to the public or key
 

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:34.670
really a benefit to the public or key
questions

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:34.680
 

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.500
government so I'm wondering to what

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:37.510
government so I'm wondering to what
 

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:40.260
government so I'm wondering to what
extent we're finding small

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:40.270
extent we're finding small
 

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.540
extent we're finding small
pharmaceutical firms developing

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:42.550
pharmaceutical firms developing
 

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:46.230
pharmaceutical firms developing
innovative influenza vaccine just called

01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:46.240
innovative influenza vaccine just called
 

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:48.060
innovative influenza vaccine just called
and I president also interested in this

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:48.070
and I president also interested in this
 

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:51.180
and I president also interested in this
randomized clinical trial that was about

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:51.190
randomized clinical trial that was about
 

01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:56.780
randomized clinical trial that was about
the 900 realized that was the way that

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:56.790
 

01:09:56.790 --> 01:10:01.890
sure sure one of the one of many

01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:01.900
sure sure one of the one of many
 

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.980
sure sure one of the one of many
priorities acted upon in preparing for a

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:04.990
priorities acted upon in preparing for a
 

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:08.010
priorities acted upon in preparing for a
pandemic was to develop a test that

01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:08.020
pandemic was to develop a test that
 

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.070
pandemic was to develop a test that
could be used almost at the bedside but

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080
could be used almost at the bedside but
 

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:14.760
could be used almost at the bedside but
a portable device that a hospital or

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:14.770
a portable device that a hospital or
 

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:17.790
a portable device that a hospital or
doctor's office could buy that could

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800
doctor's office could buy that could
 

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:20.490
doctor's office could buy that could
make a specific diagnosis of influenza

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:20.500
make a specific diagnosis of influenza
 

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:22.650
make a specific diagnosis of influenza
within 30 minutes and so this was a

01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:22.660
within 30 minutes and so this was a
 

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:25.040
within 30 minutes and so this was a
prototype device that was being used

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.050
prototype device that was being used
 

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:29.160
prototype device that was being used
that you know take a clinical specimen

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:29.170
that you know take a clinical specimen
 

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.800
that you know take a clinical specimen
put in the machine 30 minutes later you

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:31.810
put in the machine 30 minutes later you
 

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:35.700
put in the machine 30 minutes later you
get a result the result that that was

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:35.710
get a result the result that that was
 

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:37.140
get a result the result that that was
obtained was that this was there's an

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.150
obtained was that this was there's an
 

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.670
obtained was that this was there's an
influenza by the person was infected

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:38.680
influenza by the person was infected
 

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.310
influenza by the person was infected
with an influenza a virus but it wasn't

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320
with an influenza a virus but it wasn't
 

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.310
with an influenza a virus but it wasn't
like any of the viruses the seasonal

01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320
like any of the viruses the seasonal
 

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.190
like any of the viruses the seasonal
viruses or h5n1 so according to that

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:47.200
viruses or h5n1 so according to that
 

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.800
viruses or h5n1 so according to that
protocol it made its way to CDC and

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:49.810
protocol it made its way to CDC and
 

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.450
protocol it made its way to CDC and
that's how the first case was identified

01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:51.460
that's how the first case was identified
 

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.210
that's how the first case was identified
I have to say that that in that protocol

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:54.220
I have to say that that in that protocol
 

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.570
I have to say that that in that protocol
there was a lot of discussion about

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580
there was a lot of discussion about
 

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.950
there was a lot of discussion about
whether this was the right thing to do

01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960
whether this was the right thing to do
 

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.500
whether this was the right thing to do
because there might be a lot lot of

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:01.510
because there might be a lot lot of
 

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:03.140
because there might be a lot lot of
false positives there'd be a lot of

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:03.150
false positives there'd be a lot of
 

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.820
false positives there'd be a lot of
specimens coming to CDC that would be

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:05.830
specimens coming to CDC that would be
 

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:09.180
specimens coming to CDC that would be
wouldn't be flu but that that's the way

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:09.190
wouldn't be flu but that that's the way
 

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:12.210
wouldn't be flu but that that's the way
that that first case was detected I

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:12.220
that that first case was detected I
 

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:16.800
that that first case was detected I
think so your first question innovation

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:16.810
think so your first question innovation
 

01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.900
think so your first question innovation
is really critical and I think one of

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:18.910
is really critical and I think one of
 

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:22.620
is really critical and I think one of
the challenges is the market for these

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:22.630
the challenges is the market for these
 

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.660
the challenges is the market for these
products that we have we have flu

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:24.670
products that we have we have flu
 

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.320
products that we have we have flu
vaccines now they're very safe there

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:28.330
vaccines now they're very safe there
 

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.120
vaccines now they're very safe there
perhaps not as effective as we would

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.130
perhaps not as effective as we would
 

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:34.200
perhaps not as effective as we would
like them to be but the ability to

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:34.210
like them to be but the ability to
 

01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:35.910
like them to be but the ability to
due to sort of take something from an

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920
due to sort of take something from an
 

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.910
due to sort of take something from an
idea all the way through the process to

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920
idea all the way through the process to
 

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.970
idea all the way through the process to
a competitive marketplace is really huge

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:41.980
a competitive marketplace is really huge
 

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.690
a competitive marketplace is really huge
challenge and and there really are not a

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:45.700
challenge and and there really are not a
 

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.220
challenge and and there really are not a
lot of incentives to do that because

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:47.230
lot of incentives to do that because
 

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.080
lot of incentives to do that because
there is a product that can be sold its

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:49.090
there is a product that can be sold its
 

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:50.700
there is a product that can be sold its
effective and so that really I think

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:50.710
effective and so that really I think
 

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.650
effective and so that really I think
this idea of the strategic investor is

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:52.660
this idea of the strategic investor is
 

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.770
this idea of the strategic investor is
to try to use market forces effectively

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:55.780
to try to use market forces effectively
 

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:59.100
to try to use market forces effectively
to make the right things happen from the

01:11:59.100 --> 01:11:59.110
to make the right things happen from the
 

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:02.990
to make the right things happen from the
public standpoint where the existing

that existing balance is it doesn't
 

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.740
that existing balance is it doesn't
doesn't seem to be getting kind of

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:07.750
doesn't seem to be getting kind of
 

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:12.150
doesn't seem to be getting kind of
