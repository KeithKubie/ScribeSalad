00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, so now we're ready to do a problem with springs.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's imagine that we have this spring pointing horizontally attached to a wall over here

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then over on the right side, we've got this 5 kg block moving at 2 m/s towards the spring.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We can imagine what's going to happen here, the block is going to push against the spring,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
compress it a little bit, and then bounce back.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then I want you to tell me--what is the maximum amount away from the equilibrium point

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that this spring ever gets compressed--so what's the maximum value of Î”x.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, as a hint to solving this problem--keep in mind that the point where this spring

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
will be most compressed is the point where the block's velocity becomes 0.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
All right, keep that in mind and good luck solving the problem.
