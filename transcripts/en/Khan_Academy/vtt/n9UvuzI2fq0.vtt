00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.890
Problem 5.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.640
"At the beginning
of 2010, a landfill

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.140
contained 1,400
tons of solid waste.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.750
The increasing
function W--" so I

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.710
guess W constantly increases--
"the increasing function

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.790
W models the total amount
of solid waste stored

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.210
at the landfill.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.360
Planners estimate that W
will satisfy the differential

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.720
equation." so the derivative
of W with respect to time

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.740
is equal to 1 over 25 times
the quantity W minus 300,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.250
"for the next 20 years.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.890
W is measured in tons.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.580
t is measured in years
from the start of 2010."

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.540
All right, let's get into this.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.370
So part a.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.450
"Use the tangent line
to the graph of W at t

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.890
equals 0 to approximate
the amount of solid waste

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.440
that the landfill contains at
the end of the first 3 months

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.050
of 2010."

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.270
So since time is in years, 3
months would be 1/4 of a year.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.115
So t equals 1/4.

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:01.990
So it seems at first
this is really daunting.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.790
They gave us a
differential equation.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.060
We don't even know what
the actual function W is.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.920
How do we figure out
its tangent line?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.294
But we just have
to kind of think

00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:11.410
about what they're asking.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.370
So regardless of what
W looks like-- so let's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.540
think about it a little bit.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.120
So we don't know yet what
W actually does look like.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.460
But they tell us it's
an increasing function.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.760
So at time 0 it has
1,400 tons in it.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.910
They tell us that right up here.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.227
And that it increases.

00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:31.560
We don't know what the function
actually does look like.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590
But let's say that
that is W. So what

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.105
they're saying in
problem a is use

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:40.240
a tangent line to the
graph at t equals 0.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.650
Let me draw a W a
little bit differently.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.069
So W might look like this.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.110
So what they're saying
is, find the tangent line,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.860
find the slope of that
tangent line at t equals 0.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.370
So there's some slope
right over there.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.750
And then we can use
this slope to create

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.310
a linear approximation
of where we're

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.080
going to be a quarter
of a year from then.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.910
So although we don't
know what W is just yet,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.220
we could take the slope
of this line out--

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.370
so this is our t axis--
to t is equal to 1/4.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.330
And wherever that line takes us
out after a fourth of a year,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.380
that will be at least
a decent approximation.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.290
We're extrapolating forward
from that first point

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.791
and the current slope.

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.290
So we really just have to figure
out the slope of this line,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.110
and just see where that line
is at t is equal to 1/4.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.680
And you say, wait.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.370
How do we know what
the derivative of W

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.772
is at 0 without knowing W?

00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:36.230
And that's where
we can go straight

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.540
to this differential equation.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.706
We could actually rewrite
this differential equation

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:41.540
using slightly
different notation.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.570
This is the derivative
of W with respect to t.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.860
We could write that as W
prime of t is equal to 1

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.960
over 25 times the function
W, which is a function of t,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.635
minus 300.

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:58.010
And when you look
at it this way,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.593
it becomes a little
bit clearer on how

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.400
to figure out what the
derivative of W is at 0.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.770
The slope of that line
literally is just the derivative

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.130
of W evaluated at 0.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.785
So let's literally take
the derivative of W

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.050
and evaluate it at 0.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.920
So we have W prime
of 0 is equal to 1

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.090
over 25 times W of
0, which we know.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.720
We know this is 1,400
tons of solid waste.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.400
This is how much waste
there is at time 0.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.640
Minus 300.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.450
So this right over
here is 1,400.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.550
And so we have W prime
at time equals 0.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.820
So our slope at time equals
0, or our derivative at time

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:48.778
equals 0, is equal to 1 over 25
times 1,400 minus 300 is 1,100.

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:57.050
And 25 goes into
1,100 44 times, right?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.780
It goes four times
into each 100.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.970
We have 11 hundreds here.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.780
So it'll go 44 times.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.820
So it goes 44.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.040
So the slope of that line is 44.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.200
We could say m for slope.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.300
Or actually, let me just
write down the word.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.575
The slope of this line is 44.

00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:18.644
And I just ate some
peanuts or something.

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:19.810
So my voice is a little dry.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.660
So bear with me.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.530
But the slope of
this line is 24.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.847
So how do we use that
to find an approximation

00:04:25.847 --> 00:04:27.930
for the amount of waste
that the landfill contains

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.860
at the end of the
first three months?

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.430
Well, let me zoom
in a little bit.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.040
And actually, my fingers
are all salty, too.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.956
So maybe I don't have a
proper grip on my pen.

00:04:34.956 --> 00:04:37.460
But I'll try my best.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.450
Let me just zoom in
a little bit more.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.220
So we're starting at 1,400 tons.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.840
So this is my W-axis.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.530
This is my time axis.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.950
We're starting at 1,400 tons.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.400
And we are increasing
from there.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.120
They're telling us that it
is an increasing function.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.720
So maybe it looks
something like that.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.190
And then our slope
right over here.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.790
And I don't know,
I haven't drawn W

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.940
exactly that accurately.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480
I'm just guessing what it
might look like at this point.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.410
The tangent line
has a slope of 44.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.320
So that is our tangent line.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.890
And what that's
saying is if we go out

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.920
one unit of time,
which is one year,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.770
then we would have
gone up 44 in tonnage.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.610
So if we use this line as an
approximation, after one year,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.482
at this point, would
have 1,444 tons.

00:05:27.482 --> 00:05:29.440
But we're not trying to
approximate a year out.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.710
We're trying to approximate
1/4 of a year out.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.366
So we're trying to approximate.

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:35.740
So this would be
half a year out.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.500
This is 1/4 of a year out.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.580
We're trying to approximate
that point right over there.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.397
So it's going to be 1,400,
this point right over here.

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:48.480
And we could write down
the equation of this line,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.190
if we like.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.400
We could say this
line-- so we'll

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.500
call this the W approximation,
because this isn't exactly

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.010
our W function-- this is equal
to the slope of our line, 44,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.110
times time, plus
our W intercept,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.410
we could say, or plus our
initial condition, plus 1,400.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.220
So if you put time is
equal to 1/4 in there,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.290
you get it equal to 44.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.030
So let me write it this way.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.530
So our approximate W, at time
is equal to 1/4 of a year,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.840
is equal to 44 times
1/4 plus 1,400.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.200
I'm running out of space.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.410
And my salty hands are having
trouble writing this properly.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:36.510
And so 44 times 1/4, or 44
divided by 4, is 11 plus 1,400.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.740
And so you add them together.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.890
You get 1,411 or 1,411 tons.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.050
This is our approximation.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.440
We just took the slope
from our starting point

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.650
and used that slope
as an approximation.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.670
It probably is not
the exact amount

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.850
of tonnage based on
the actual function W.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.850
But it's an OK approximation.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.360
But that's our first answer
for Part A. 1,411 tons.
