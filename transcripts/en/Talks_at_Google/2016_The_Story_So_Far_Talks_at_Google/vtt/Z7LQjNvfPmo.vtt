00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.800
BORIS DEBIC: Welcome,
everybody, to one more Talks

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.190
at Google event.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.710
It is my extreme pleasure to
welcome today Dr. William J.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.980
Perry.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.870
The occasion is the publication
of his autobiographical book,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.310
"My Journey at the
Nuclear Brink,"

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.900
which also covers
in detail a topic

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.820
that we will discuss
among other topics today,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000
which is one of
nuclear disarmament

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.580
and the security in
general in today's world.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.070
I'm not going to give a lengthy
introduction of Mr. Perry,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.220
because you all know how to
use the Google search engine.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.450
But I will read
from a forward which

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.340
was written by his
colleague, former Secretary

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.670
of State George P. Shultz,
and it is in the book.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.320
Throughout his life
and work, William Perry

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.470
has distinguished himself as
a man of high intelligence,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.140
absolute integrity, rare vision,
remarkable accomplishment,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.790
and an unwavering
sense of humanity.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.870
Evidence of these
attributes is vividly

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.270
apparent in the gripping
stories contained

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.600
in these memoir chronicling
Bill's extraordinary efforts.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.350
I would also like
to mention here,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.550
among all the honors that he
was given throughout life,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.480
probably one of the
most prestigious

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.050
would be the Presidential Medal
of Freedom, the United States

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.220
highest award for a civilian.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.560
And when he was presented
with this award,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.180
President Clinton
said, "Bill Perry

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
may will be recorded as the most
productive, effective Secretary

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.510
of Defense the United
States ever had."

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.580
General John Shalikashvili,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.160
of Staff, offered
this assessment

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.300
of this extraordinary
public servant.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.449
"Yes, he's a man of vast talent.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.000
Yes, he's a man
of enormous energy

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.440
and infectious enthusiasm.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.750
Yes, he's a man of great caring
for those who wear our nation's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.570
uniform and for their families.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.040
But he's first and foremost a
man of unshakable character.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.920
He's a man who will
do what is right,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.220
no matter what the price."

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.520
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Perry to Google.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.796
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.990
So I was originally
planning to do

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.320
the introduction of
your younger years,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.880
because we want to
connect, in this show,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.700
with the younger
audiences and make

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.080
them aware of a grave threat
to our overall security.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.820
But this weekend's
events forced us

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.970
into perhaps yet
another territory

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.590
that you have covered
in your long career.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.650
Can you comment?

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.740
Or do you have any
views on this latest

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.010
of the events, which was
the launch of a rocket

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.340
by North Korea?

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.430
WILLIAM PERRY: Yeah.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.600
I spent a lot of
time in the '90s

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.550
with the main mission of trying
to keep North Korea from going

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.220
nuclear for a lot of reasons.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.760
Well, I failed.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.990
And the consequence
of that failure

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.530
are yet to be played
out, but we see

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.490
some of the consequences,
intermediate consequences.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.310
And they've already had a number
of nuclear tests, at least

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.770
three of which were successful.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.000
And they have been building
missiles for a long time now.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.440
The missiles up to this point
are medium range missiles.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.070
They threaten South Korea.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.010
They threaten Japan.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.635
They do not threaten
the United States.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.060
With their satellite
launch, which

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.540
is no problem in and of
itself, but of course,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.670
to get the satellite into orbit,
you have to use a launcher.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.920
And the launcher is
essentially an ICBM.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.800
So while testing the
satellite, they're

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.140
also testing the early
stages of an ICBM.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.837
If they perfect that, which
they have said they plan to do,

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:46.170
then they will have a missile
that can strike the United

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.070
States as well.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.895
Even so, this is nothing
if the warhead on it

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.370
is high explosive.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.550
The real danger of a
missile is not the missile.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.070
It's the fact that it could
carry a nuclear warhead.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.750
So their nuclear tests are
really of more concern to us

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.000
than the missile tests.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.700
The best judgment
of the people I

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.605
know who are really expert in
the field of nuclear explosions

00:05:09.605 --> 00:05:12.240
and development
of nuclear weapons

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.220
believe that the North
Koreans at this point,

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.620
while they have a
successful nuclear bomb,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.120
do not have one that
could be compact enough

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.730
to be put into a warhead,
that it might take one or two

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.260
more nuclear tests before
they would be able to verify

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.080
that kind of a design.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.100
So we're perhaps
one or two tests,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.850
nuclear tests, away,
and maybe another one

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.720
or two satellite
or ICBM launches

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.340
away from them having a
nuclear ICBM which could

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.270
threaten the United States.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.580
So it begins to be a
serious issue for us.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.270
BORIS DEBIC: Dr. Perry, I
wanted to go back on the track

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.280
that I originally had in mind
for our discussion today.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.920
Can you tell us a little
bit about your younger age,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.770
when you were like
perhaps the younger

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.830
members of our audience.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.480
And specifically,
I've heard that you've

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.260
been in Hiroshima after
the first explosions there.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.529
What were your impressions
at that young age?

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.320
WILLIAM PERRY: Well,
I was actually younger

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.930
then than most of you.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.940
I was 14, when a
young man, a friend

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.170
came rushing into the room
and said, we are at war.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.702
The Japanese have just
bombed Pearl Harbor.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.350
This is one of these epiphany
events, where you remember

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.930
a few decades later
just where you were,

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.020
what you were
thinking, and so on.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.030
What I was thinking at the time,
remember, I was 14 years old,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.190
was that I was afraid the
war was going to be over

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.780
before I could realize
my dream, which

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.630
was to be an Army
Air Corps pilot

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.120
and participate in the war.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.090
That's what a 14-year-old
was thinking of that news.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.300
As it turned out, I was right.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.820
The peace treaty was signed
in September of 1945,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.630
when I turned 18
in October 1945.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.070
So I just missed it.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.970
I did then sign up for
the Army Engineers,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.290
and was assigned to the
army of occupation in Japan.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:31.810
I spent two months in Tokyo, and
then almost a year in Okinawa.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:38.130
What I saw in Tokyo, in Okinawa
changed my view altogether

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:43.220
about the glamor and
the glory of war.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.780
Tokyo, when I was
there, was in ruins.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.980
There was more damage
and more people

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.810
killed than in
Hiroshima, actually,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.320
as a result of thousands
and thousands of fire bombs

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.000
dropped over a
period of two years.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.090
And nothing I had read or
heard prepared before me

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:10.220
for just the shock of walking
through the streets of Tokyo

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.590
and seeing what was left
of this once great city.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.372
When I got to Okinawa just
two months later, Okinawa,

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:19.830
you may not know
the history of it,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.220
but it was the site of the last
great battle of World War II.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.600
To give you some
metric on it, there

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.130
were 100,000 Japanese
soldiers defending Okinawa.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.809
When the battle was
over a few months later,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.130
there were fewer than 10,000.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.140
90% of them, 90,000
Japanese soldiers

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.904
died, not just were wounded,
they died in that battle, 90%.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.320
Either they were
killed in battle,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.940
or they committed suicide.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:02.020
Another 100,000 civilians,
and about 15,000 or 20,000

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.610
Americans.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.300
Most of the American
deaths, by the way,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.140
were the result of
kamikaze attacks,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.270
suicide attacks on our ships.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.730
When I landed, when
our ship landed

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.650
at Naha, which is the
capital of Okinawa,

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.020
there was not a
building left standing.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.670
It was a city about
the size of San Jose.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.230
Nothing was left standing.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:30.140
The people who survived
were living in rubble.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.690
So that was my first exposure
to what war is really like,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.090
not what you read about what
you hear about in speeches.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.060
I saw all those
scenes of destruction,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.010
and then I reflected
on Hiroshima.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:51.110
This is what can be done
with 1,000 pound bombs.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.250
In the case of Tokyo,
thousands of them,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.500
over a two year period, and
with thousands of bombers

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.710
delivering them-- the
same result in Hiroshima,

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:11.220
in an instant, one airplane
and one bomb, just one bomb.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.940
And even at the
tender age of 18,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.160
I understood this
changed everything.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.480
Einstein had already
said that the advent

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.100
of the nuclear bomb,
everything has changed,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.010
except the way we think.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:35.490
But what I saw in Japan,
Tokyo and Okinawa, even at 18,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.580
my thinking did begin to change.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.960
I began to understand
the vast significance

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.950
of the role of nuclear weapons,
how they change everything,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.750
certainly about the way warfare
will ever be waged used again,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.070
and certainly
putting an imperative

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.329
that they must never,
ever be used again.

00:10:58.329 --> 00:11:00.620
BORIS DEBIC: I think this is
probably the perfect place

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:06.910
to roll the video to compare
what today's young people think

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.307
and know about the weapons.

00:11:11.307 --> 00:11:14.590
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.540
-So what do I know
about nuclear weapons?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.510
-I know that nuclear
weapons were invented

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.740
in the mid-20th century.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.230
-There was a big scare
that was the Cold War,

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.050
but nothing bad
happened, luckily.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.420
-After what happened, after
we bombed the Japanese,

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.040
that's the reason
we haven't really

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.873
had a World War, because
everybody's scared.

00:11:43.873 --> 00:11:45.220
I nobody wants to get nuked.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.530
-Literally, all I know
is I don't want one

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.430
to explode near me.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.850
-I hear everything pretty
much dissolves, that is,

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.582
within a certain mile radius.

00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:56.040
-You wouldn't almost
here anything.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.570
You would just see the
light, and it's out.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.290
-Well, I'd be
dead, but let's say

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.850
I were far enough so
that I wouldn't be dead.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.360
I'd probably have
some sort of cancer.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.730
Yay.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.610
-Well, I guess most of the more
detailed knowledge I have came

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.680
from a single book that I read.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.570
-Probably from movies and--

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.560
-Jokes, TV.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.840
-I mean, video games,
"Fallout," playing those a lot.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.380
-In history class, we see
in the history textbooks

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.320
these big mushroom clouds.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.990
Whoa, that's terrifying.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.070
I don't want that.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.639
-I'm interested in physics.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:39.180
Through that, I
pursued a little more

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.180
of the scientific
history of the discovery.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.316
Just a bit, though.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:55.540
-I would like to think--
or I would hope, one.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.049
-I have no idea.

00:12:57.049 --> 00:12:57.590
I don't know.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.173
I would assume in
the couple hundreds,

00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:01.320
but I wouldn't go as
far as to say thousands.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.630
-Either a range
between 2,000 and 4,000

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.580
or 200,000 and its whereabouts.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.160
-300.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.590
-I would guess that the
United States possesses

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.152
10 million nuclear weapons.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.446
-I want to say, like
hundreds of thousands.

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:27.530
But yeah I think
I'm short on that.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.406
We might have more.

00:13:29.406 --> 00:13:30.530
-I actually looked that up.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.360
I think it's over 7,000.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.226
-Whoo.

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:37.230
That makes me feel better.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:45.660
-That's insane that the
US would have 7,000 nukes.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.010
Where are they?

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.080
I would like to know.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.040
-I think that there can't
be a winner, because--

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.880
-No one is a winner
if mass areas

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.480
of the Earth become
uninhabitable, or thousands,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.470
millions of people die.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.200
-I would probably not
feel very victorious

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.020
if I demolished a
group of people.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.940
-We've used nuclear weapons
and relatively little happened

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.570
to us, so that's a
little frightening.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.745
But that's pretty frightening.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.530
-Oh, like ISIS or Al-Qaeda,
or something like that?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.500
-Definitely possible.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.370
I didn't expect 9/11 to
happen in my lifetime either.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.730
-I don't really remember 9/11.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.310
I was like five.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.710
So for people who
have experience,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.740
breaches of national
security, that's

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.770
obviously a bigger concern.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.640
-I say day to day I don't
really worry about terrorists

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.855
sitting on nuclear bombs.

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:01.980
-I mean, if somebody got
their hands on one of ours

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.040
and used it against
us, that's the worst.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.581
They didn't have to
take it anywhere.

00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:06.510
Is already here.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.636
-Odds are not going to happen.

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:10.137
But also, if it
does happen, there's

00:15:10.137 --> 00:15:12.302
no use in worrying about
it, because there's nothing

00:15:12.302 --> 00:15:13.750
I personally can do to stop it.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.680
So I may as well
just live my life.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.860
-Well, it's certainly
possible to have

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.750
a nuclear weapon-free world.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.640
-If the US does it,
it might happen.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.210
But all these other
countries, they see OK,

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.960
you're telling us to
get rid of our nukes,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.100
but you're not getting rid of
your nukes, so why should we?

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.370
-If there are no more nuclear
weapons or ingredients

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.286
to make it, then we're
going to find something

00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:43.800
else just as destructive.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.600
-I don't think
it's very realistic

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.660
that all countries abandon
their nuclear weapons,

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.640
mostly because I have
almost no faith in the US

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.510
complying with
something like that.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.870
-There's no way for it to
happen if we don't dare

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.930
to imagine that it's possible.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.110
And so my answer to
that question is a yes.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.250
And given that I don't
really know that much

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.500
about the state of nuclear
weapons today right now,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.480
I don't know exactly how that
would logistically happen.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.540
But as a lay person
who knows nothing,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.720
I would say yes, hopefully.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.220
Yeah.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.850
BORIS DEBIC: Fast
forward, you've

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.350
had a great
entrepreneurial career,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.570
and then you ended up
working for the government.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.660
And then comes
your first crisis,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.390
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.550
Can you tell us a little
bit about why that moment is

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.392
important for our history?

00:17:00.392 --> 00:17:02.350
WILLIAM PERRY: During
the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.390
I was actually working here
in Silicon Valley at a defense

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.900
electronics company.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.680
And I was called
up, but I was also

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.670
doing some pro bono
consulting for the government

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:20.040
in the field of technical
missiles, technical factors

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.359
about missiles.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.930
And I was called up
one day and asked

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.310
to come back to Washington
for an urgent consulting job.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.937
And I said sure, I'll rearrange
my schedule and fly back,

00:17:33.937 --> 00:17:34.770
see you next Monday.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.190
He said, no, you
don't understand.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.232
I need to see you right away.

00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:41.440
So I got on the red eye,
and flew back to Washington.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.640
The next morning, he
took me into his office,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.330
and to my amazement, showed
me pictures of Soviet missiles

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.276
being deployed in Cuba.

00:17:52.276 --> 00:17:54.250
And that was my
first introduction

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.590
to what came to be called
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.780
And for the next
eight days and nights,

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.670
I worked on a small
team of analysts,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.700
looking at all of the
intelligence information coming

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.220
in to try to determine the
status of those missiles, how

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.070
big were they, how far could
they fly, when were they

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.940
going to be operational?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.550
And that report
went every morning

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.120
on the desk of
President Kennedy, who

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.280
then used that as
one of the factors

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.820
to decide what he should
be doing that day.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.560
I guess my bottom line
is that every day,

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.620
I went into that analysis
center I believed

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.000
would be my last day on Earth.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
That's how close we came
to a nuclear catastrophe

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.910
at that time.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.220
And I still believe
to this day that we

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.420
avoided that nuclear
catastrophe as much by good luck

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.702
as by good management.

00:18:53.702 --> 00:18:55.410
BORIS DEBIC: We have
learned some lessons

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.640
in that particular episode.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.220
And we're talking about
the era of the Cold

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:05.160
War, that big polarization
They deescalated

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.070
in the historical moment, and
people thought that, well, we

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.060
can control these weapons.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.030
But these are extremely
complex systems.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.730
We have here Google
engineers in the audience,

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.382
and we're talking about many,
many components in this system.

00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:23.590
There's a lot of engineering.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.330
There's a lot of communication.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.760
There's a lot of computer
control that goes into that.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.240
Can anybody actually
guarantee the safety

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.050
of such a complex system?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.510
Even if we had the
will to say, oh, we're

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.490
not going to launch
first or whatnot.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.662
I think you had an episode,
which sheds some light on that.

00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:47.870
WILLIAM PERRY: The short
answer to your system is no,

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.610
we cannot guarantee it.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.200
And I've had several
experience in my own life that

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.030
dramatize the point, but
I'll share just one with you.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.560
At this time, I was
in the Pentagon.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.480
I was the Undersecretary
of Defense

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.610
for Research and Engineering.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.360
And I got a call.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.210
This is 1978.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.100
And I got a call one night
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.260
And I picked up the
phone, barely awake,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.070
and the general on the other end
of the line introduced himself,

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.310
the watch officer at the North
American Air Defense Command.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.960
And he said my
computers are showing

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.530
200 ICBMs on the way
from the Soviet Union

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.440
to the United States.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.890
I'll tell you, I
woke up right away.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.840
Talk about a bucket of
cold water in the face.

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:46.310
And one of the first things
I thought, why in the world

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:47.204
is he calling me?

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.620
I was not in the
chain of command.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.749
I was in charge of research and
engineering at the Pentagon.

00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:55.290
He was calling me because he
had already determined, happily,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.540
that it was a false alarm.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.719
And the question
he was asking me is

00:20:59.719 --> 00:21:01.010
what's wrong with our computer?

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.045
What the hell's happening here?

00:21:04.045 --> 00:21:06.420
Well, the short answer is, I
could not over the telephone

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.690
figure out what was
wrong with his computer.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:14.030
It took us two days, two days,
to find out what had happened.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.610
And what had happened
was the Sergeant

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.000
who came in for his new
watch that evening, instead

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.780
of putting the operating
tape into the computer

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.860
had put a training
tape into the computer.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.030
And so what we got was a
very realistic simulation

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.270
of a launch.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.140
It was human error.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.800
No matter how complex
your systems are,

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.210
they're always subject
to human error.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.990
A second one, I
didn't get called

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.656
in the middle of the
night, but I was of

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:52.300
involved in trying to fix the
problem after it happened,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.530
was the watch officer
was seeing two missiles

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.990
on the way, 22 missiles on the
way, 222 missiles on the way.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.330
He figured, really
very wisely, something

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.572
was wrong with his equipment,
which he was right about.

00:22:04.572 --> 00:22:06.280
And it took us a day
or two to figure out

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.790
what was wrong with
it, and how to fix it.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.670
So I was personally familiar
with an example of human error

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:18.000
and an example of
equipment error.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.340
We did not launch,
which is the good news.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.240
The reason we did not launch,
beside the watch officer

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.100
suspecting something was
wrong, which in the second case

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.890
was easy, but in the first
place really pretty hard,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:36.530
was nothing bad was going on
in the world at that time.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.170
And I've always asked myself
on that first case, what if?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.490
What if it had occurred
during a crisis?

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.930
What if it occurred during
the Cuban Missile Crisis?

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.930
What if it had occurred
during the Sinai Crisis,

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.720
which had occurred earlier,
where we were at high alert,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.100
expecting some kind of a launch?

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.320
In that case, would we have
gone ahead and actually launched

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:05.780
our missiles and accidentally
started a nuclear war?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:11.040
So our systems then and now
are subject to those kind

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.870
of errors.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.100
The technical factor
which exacerbates

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.340
that is that one of our
sets of nuclear missiles,

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.950
namely our ICBMs, our
intercontinental missiles,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.520
are subject to being
destroyed in their silos

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.532
if they're not launched.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:38.700
So we if the watch officer
reports to the president

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.250
that his system is showing
a launch underway, an attack

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.280
on the United
States, the president

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.100
has about 10 minutes to
decide whether he should order

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.340
the launch of our ICBMs
so that the missiles will

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:58.145
be gone by the time the strike
occurs, about 10 minutes.

00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.645
And obviously, his
decision is going

00:23:59.645 --> 00:24:02.280
to be heavily influenced
by what's actually going

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.350
on in the world at the time.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:11.180
So besides all this technical
duplication, and triplication,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.330
and so on, besides all
these procedures we have,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.340
there's always the question
of context, context.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.380
What's happening
in the world, which

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.880
will affect the president?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.500
He has about 10
minutes to digest

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.240
that context, plus the
technical information to decide

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.980
what to do.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.220
That was true then.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.020
It is still true today.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.460
By the way, I have
just finished a paper

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:44.020
which I'm about to publish,
in which I recommend

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.380
that as we begin
the revitalization

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:55.240
of our nuclear systems, we
do not rebuild the ICBMs,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.920
precisely because they are
susceptible to that kind

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.470
of a false alarm problem.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.940
I am first to say that
the probability that

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.020
leading to an accidental launch
is very low, but why should we

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.100
accept any probability?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.810
Why not simply
let it go to zero?

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.790
If you can eliminate the
need for a quick launch,

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.740
then you can basically avoid
the problem of a false alarm

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.210
triggering an accidental war.

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:28.290
BORIS DEBIC: Let's take a couple
of questions from the audience.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.990
It's a real privilege.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.660
So you just
mentioned that we are

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.570
considering revitalizing
the next generation

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.660
of our nuclear armament.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.800
How prepared do you think our
politicians and our public

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.700
are to consider this
rearmament question?

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.724
WILLIAM PERRY: The short
answer is not at all.

00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:59.160
All you have to do to listen
to the presidential debates

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.620
is to understand that
serious questions like this

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.492
don't even enter the discussion.

00:26:03.492 --> 00:26:05.950
In fact, I'm just as happy they
don't enter the discussion.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.340
It might create more
noise than information.

00:26:12.674 --> 00:26:14.382
Probably most of you
are not aware of it.

00:26:14.382 --> 00:26:17.710
We are already proceeding
on the rebuilding,

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.300
the recapitalization,
as they call it,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.110
of our nuclear
Cold War arsenal--

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.140
the ICBMs, the SLBM, the
submarines, the bombers,

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.130
the bombs.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.590
We're in the process
of doing that.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.270
The cost will probably
be upwards of $1 trillion

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.000
over the next several decades.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.620
And that is
happening, basically,

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.830
without any public discussion.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.980
We're just doing it.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.447
Now, any given year,
when the appropriations

00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.030
are made to carry
out that plan, there

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.240
will be discussion and
debate in the Congress.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.450
But so far, the
public is not only

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.020
not participating
in that debate,

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.390
they're not even aware
of what's going on.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.640
And what they are not aware
of is pretty much true

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.480
of their representatives
in Congress as well.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.320
A few exceptions, though,
in Congress, but not many.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.820
AUDIENCE: One of
the things that you

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.840
were known for in your
time at the Pentagon

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.100
was modernizing the conventional
technology of our military.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.930
But as you said, we're looking
at now the nuclear side

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.364
of the equation.

00:27:20.364 --> 00:27:21.780
If you were still
at the Pentagon,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.500
and you were in charge
of making recommendations

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.270
about whether we should
and if we should,

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.980
how should we modernize
our nuclear weapons?

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.410
What would you say?

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.090
What do you think that we
should do, if anything?

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:37.500
Assuming that for whatever
reason, immediate,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.837
unilateral disarmament isn't--

00:27:39.837 --> 00:27:41.920
WILLIAM PERRY: In the
interest of full disclosure,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.612
I should tell you
that I participated

00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:46.550
with George Shultz
and Henry Kissinger,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.782
and Sam Nunn in
three or four op-eds

00:27:48.782 --> 00:27:50.740
over the period of the
last six or seven years,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:56.770
recommending we should be moving
toward zero nuclear weapons.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.190
So I'm not a fan
of nuclear weapons.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.300
With the developments in
Russia in the last few years,

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.180
and with Russia
already well embarked

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.100
on rebuilding their
Cold War arsenal,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.520
I don't feel that that's
politically feasible right now.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:18.150
And so my main objective now is
trying to minimize the damage,

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.750
trying to recommend
that we proceed

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.440
in ways in our rebuilding of
the arsenal that are least

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.440
costly and least dangerous.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.660
And on that basis, I've
recommended no ICBMs at all.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.180
Let the ICBM force phase out.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.430
No air launch cruise missile.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.290
Let that phase out.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:40.340
And on the so-called tactical
nuclear bomb, the B61 bomb,

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:47.500
which we're now refreshing,
not to introduce into it

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.690
a low yield.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:54.440
Now why should I be in favor of
a high yield, not a low yield?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.620
It's because the
low yield invites

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:01.410
the commanders to believe
that it's a usable weapon.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:05.160
I want to keep the threshold
of using nuclear weapons very,

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.580
very high so you do not believe
that a nuclear weapon is just

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.420
like a big, conventional
weapon, that there's

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.030
something entirely different,
and you should never use them.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.750
So I do not like
the idea of making

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.300
nuclear bombs more usable,
which lowering the yields does.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.670
So those would be the main
points I would be pressing.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.700
But more importantly, even
as the Secretary of Defense,

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.840
you have something to say
about policy and diplomacy.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.260
I'd be urging the president
to reengage seriously

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.890
with the Russians,
and see if together we

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.250
can agree to stop altogether
this rebuilding of the Cold War

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.850
nuclear arsenal.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:45.940
If we're not successful
in that, though,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.810
then I'm willing to
support a program,

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:52.780
but a much less expensive
and much less dangerous

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.730
program than the one
we are now embarked on.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.500
I would support the
submarine missiles,

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.600
because they have no
possibility of false alarm,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.690
and I would support
building a new bomber,

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.760
because it can be used
for conventional forces

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.400
as the present B-2 is used.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.940
And in this case, it provides
a belt and suspenders

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.320
approach in case something
happens to our submarine force,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.280
which I think is very unlikely.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.030
But to build the ICBM as
the third part of the triad

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.020
is using belt and suspenders
for the belt and suspenders.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.679
I think it's just silly.

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:28.220
BORIS DEBIC: Ideally,
though, I mean,

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.740
if we look at the
world today, it

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.520
seems that two of
the major risks

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.850
are the worsening of the
relations in the Soviet Union,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.220
like the policies that are
happening both around Ukraine

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.700
and Syria recently.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.820
And the other is the
potential for a terrorist,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.300
a non-state actor, to get their
hands on nuclear material.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.610
Do you agree that
those are threats?

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.520
WILLIAM PERRY: I do.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:03.780
The first one could lead to
an accidental war, or a war

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.290
by miscalculation.

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.120
The second, the terrorism could
lead to one bomb going off

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.680
in Washington or San Francisco,
or maybe a couple of bombs.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.930
And we tend to minimize
what that means.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.140
In the preface to my
book, there's a scenario.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.870
It's a hypothetical scenario,
but a very believable,

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.370
very real scenario, that
is based on real facts.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.310
And in this
scenario, a terrorist

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.360
gets one nuclear bomb.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.700
And I describe how
it could happen.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.290
And he sets it off
Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.030
halfway between the White
House and the capitol.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:45.590
The majority of congressmen
are killed in my scenario.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.935
The president and the
vice president are killed.

00:31:47.935 --> 00:31:50.560
The Secretary of Defense and the
chairmen Joint Chiefs of Staff

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.976
were testifying at the Congress
at the time this happened.

00:31:52.976 --> 00:31:54.610
They were killed.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.520
The presidency devolves
to the president pro tem

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.790
of the Senate, who is in Mayo
Clinic in Cleveland being

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.380
treated for pancreatic cancer.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.570
So we have a
constitutional crisis.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.400
The terrorists deliver a
message to our TV stations,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.140
broadcast all over
the country, saying,

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.940
that was the first bomb.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.445
We have five other bombs
planted in five other cities

00:32:19.445 --> 00:32:20.320
in the United States.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.090
They're going to go off
once a weeks from now on.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.920
Stop to imagine what happens to
our cities when that happens,

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.850
which is people streaming
out of the cities.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:36.420
All of our industry shut down,
our economy grinds to a halt.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.477
The country goes into quickly
and total-- this is one bomb.

00:32:39.477 --> 00:32:41.560
He doesn't even have to
have the other five bombs.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.980
He just says he has them.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.570
So one bomb could
cause that kind

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.150
of an absolute and total chaos.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.120
It makes 9/11 look like
a social outing almost.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.630
It's really, really
catastrophic.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.360
But people don't
really think seriously

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.790
about the consequences,
besides the 100,000 people that

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.450
are killed, there are
social, and economic,

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.840
and political
consequences, which

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.930
are really quite profound.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.020
And we're just sitting
here blissfully

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.990
unaware of what could happen.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.550
An accidental nuclear war,
a war by miscalculation,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.200
is not a high
probability at all,

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.780
but this nuclear terrorism
is really quite believable.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:32.820
It takes the terrorists getting
a hold of 20 or 30 kilograms

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.640
of fissile material.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.720
If he has that, the
making of the bomb

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.910
is not that difficult.
We make it difficult.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.730
We want to compress
them to be small enough

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.680
to fit into the warheads
to operate under highly

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.041
stressed conditions.

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:50.290
If all he wants to do with
a bomb is put it in a truck

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.230
and drive it down
Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.910
it's not that difficult to make.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.090
The barrier today, the reason
that hasn't happened today,

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.970
is he doesn't have the 20 or 30
kilograms of fissile material.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.810
The one bit of good
news I have for you

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.260
is that of all the
initiatives of President

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.190
Obama in this field, most of
which I'm very critical of,

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.270
but the one I'm
very supportive of

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.560
is something called the Nuclear
Summit, where he convened

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.290
three times now in
his terms in office

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.670
the 50 heads of
state, all of whom

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.110
are focused on
the question, what

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:27.520
can we do to protect our
fissile material better

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.909
than we are now protecting it?

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:30.870
And there have been significant
improvements in the last four

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.670
or five years.

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.870
The next such meeting, by the
way, comes up in two months,

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:37.070
and it's going to
be in Washington.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.850
And I have high hopes that
will really drive home

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:44.868
this protection message quite a
bit to the ultimate conclusion.

00:34:44.868 --> 00:34:46.409
AUDIENCE: Secretary
Perry, related to

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:50.469
that, I've been impressed that
over the last half century

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.989
plus, the international
community has

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:59.490
done an amazing job of slowing
down nuclear proliferation.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.604
But it also seems
that at some point

00:35:03.604 --> 00:35:05.270
that effort is going
to fail, and you're

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:08.950
going to have a large numbers
of states with nuclear weapons.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:11.040
So is there something
we can do about that?

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.890
WILLIAM PERRY:
Several decades ago,

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.240
most of the nations
of the world signed

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.560
the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, which is in force

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.000
today.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.040
And that is the main reason
that what President Kennedy

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.570
predicted back in
the '60s, namely

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.920
that we'd have 30
nuclear countries

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.860
by the end of the
century, has not happened.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.915
So we owe a lot to the
Nuclear Nonproliferation

00:35:35.915 --> 00:35:37.590
Treaty, nicknamed the NPT.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.180
The NPT is endangered
now for several reasons.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.200
One of which is the two
proliferation threats

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.850
of the last few years, one
of them being North Korea.

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:56.080
And nobody's found a good way
of stopping North Korea yet.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.820
And the other
being of Iran, Iran

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.760
by really an amazing
concerted effort

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.360
of the international
community, we've

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.670
reached an agreement with
Iran, which is highly

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:14.480
criticized in this country
by about 55% of our Congress

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.160
and by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.260
Also, it was highly
criticized, I must say,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.054
by the Iranian
Revolutionary Guard.

00:36:24.054 --> 00:36:26.220
The irony is, of course,
that they're criticizing it

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.810
for entirely different reasons.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.030
The Iranian Revolutionary
Guard is critical,

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.800
because they fear
it will not allow

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.380
Iran to get a nuclear weapon,
which they want to get.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.810
Of course, Netanyahu and 55%
of the members of Congress

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.560
who opposed to it are
opposed because they

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.390
fear it will not stop them from
getting nuclear weapons, which

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.450
they would like to stop.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.240
Of course, they both
cannot be right,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.486
but that is where we stand
right now on that issue.

00:36:53.486 --> 00:36:55.820
The presidential
debates have gotten

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.960
into the state of
the purely ridiculous

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.210
in discussing this with several
of the Republican candidates,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.490
simply saying flatly
the first day in office,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:09.020
they're going to terminate the
nuclear deal with Iran, which

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.990
my Republican friend
George Shultz says

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.430
is just the most ridiculous
statement you could possibly

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.930
make.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.338
What it does is it gives
Iran all the benefits

00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:21.213
without holding them to
any responsibilities.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.460
Because it is a fantasy to
believe that we could now go

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.610
back and renegotiate.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.290
The reason Iran negotiated
in the first place

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.420
was that for once in history,
the international community

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.040
came together in a very
effective series of sanctions.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.720
The sanctions hurt
Iran enough that they

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.190
were willing to sit down and
negotiate a reasonable deal.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.160
The minute the United States
walks out of the deal,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.480
those sanctions go away.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.120
The Europeans would never,
ever support a reimposition

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.180
of the sanctions.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.660
And unilateral
sanctions by the US

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.770
would not have that
much of an effect.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:08.420
So that this is demonstrably
a foolish thing to do.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.290
But it's a continual battle
in the area of trying

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:15.740
to stop proliferation.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.250
If Iran were, in fact,
to get a nuclear weapon,

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.820
there is no doubt that at least
four or five other countries

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.859
in their neighborhood would
follow suit right away.

00:38:24.859 --> 00:38:27.400
Let me say one other thing about
the Nuclear Nonproliferation

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.230
Treaty.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.710
It has two aspects to it.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.840
One of them is the
non-nuclear powers

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.590
agreeing not to build nuclear
weapons, for which they

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.890
get certain benefits,
like nuclear technology

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.300
for their reactors.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.233
The other half of it
is the nuclear powers,

00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:43.816
of which the United
States, of course,

00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:48.714
is one, agreeing to work
towards the decrease

00:38:48.714 --> 00:38:50.130
of the nuclear
weapons, ultimately

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.690
leading to the elimination
of nuclear weapons.

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.450
Demonstrably, the
second part of that

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.720
is not being followed today.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.650
So the United States
and Russia in particular

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.330
are clearly in violation as we
sit here today of the Nuclear

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.240
Nonproliferation Treaty,
and that fact does not

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.306
go unobserved.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:16.110
So what's your view on
China's nuclear policy,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:24.400
especially on their creative use
of some of the ICBM technology?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:32.356
So they have some
anti-missile, anti-ship ICBMs.

00:39:32.356 --> 00:39:38.020
They also have something,
well, that's all.

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:45.040
So what's your view on their
policy, and their technologies?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.980
WILLIAM PERRY: China has had
an ICBM for a good many years.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:56.496
In fact, my first visit to
China, which was 36 years ago,

00:39:56.496 --> 00:39:58.620
I was, at the time, the
Under-secretary of Defense.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.850
They took me out to
the missile test range.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.250
They showed me their
ICBM on its launch pad.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.990
So they at least had an
ICBM for at least 36 years.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:11.337
I, with my own
eyeballs, have seen it.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.790
For many decades since
then, their policy

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.910
was to maintain a
minimal deterrence.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.180
That has a special meaning.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.010
It means just enough
ICBMs to discourage people

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.580
from attacking you, but not
enough to cause trouble,

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.280
not enough to initiate
trouble on your own.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.340
That's technically called
a minimal deterrence,

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.600
and China not only had
that kind of force,

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.740
but they have proclaimed that's
the kind of a force they have.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.560
And so none of us who
have been in this field

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:51.180
have been much concerned about
the Chinese nuclear force

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.860
being a threat to anybody else.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.450
A minimal deterrence
by definition

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.180
means you're not going
to use the force.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.700
It's only there to protect
yourself from being attacked.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.380
In the last five or
six or seven years,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.250
they have been rebuilding
their nuclear forces,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.110
and their ICBM forces, and
their submarine missile forces.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.170
They're obviously moving
beyond the minimal deterrence

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.750
force, which I would
think is not good news.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.061
But we do not know yet how
far beyond they are actually

00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:22.560
moving.

00:41:25.392 --> 00:41:28.960
So that issue remains
unresolved at this point.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.910
I'm hopeful that they're
still staying more or less

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.760
within the minimum
deterrence policy,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760
even though they are
modernizing, and improving,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.796
and strengthening their forces.

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.170
As it stands now,
they represent,

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.860
I think, no threat to
any other country that's

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.710
not trying to threaten them.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:47.250
AUDIENCE: Some people
have said that the border

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.900
between Pakistan and India
is the most dangerous border

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:57.370
in the world, because both
nations have nuclear weapons.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.980
They acquired technology
relatively recently,

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.780
and frankly, both
nations hate each other.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.490
So what steps could
be taken, I suppose,

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.520
to mitigate the risk of
nuclear war in that region.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.020
WILLIAM PERRY: I would
say that today, Pakistan

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.570
represents the greatest
danger in the world

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.587
to a nuclear catastrophe
actually happening.

00:42:25.587 --> 00:42:26.670
I haven't talked about it.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:29.476
I've talked about
nuclear terrorism.

00:42:29.476 --> 00:42:33.220
I've talked about a possible
accidental war between Russia

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.220
and the United States.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.310
But I think more likely
than either of those

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:44.840
would be a regional nuclear
war between India and Pakistan.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.550
And the scenario, it evolved
from just the situation

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.580
you described, the
dispute over Kashmir.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.200
The dispute has gone on now
for decades, no closer today

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.831
to a resolution than it was
when it started decades ago.

00:42:58.831 --> 00:43:00.330
And there have been
three or perhaps

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.890
four conventional wars
between India and Pakistan

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.770
during that time,
all of which Pakistan

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.060
has lost, because they
have smaller country

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.210
and have smaller
military forces.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.840
They have responded to this
inferiority in size and power

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.580
with irregular warfare, in
particular with terrorism.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:26.480
And the Pakistani
government has more or less

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:32.790
supported terror groups to
do their bidding in Kashmir.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:36.360
But sometimes, these terror
groups get off the reservation,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.340
and that happened a few
years ago at a place

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.240
called Mumbai, what we
used to call Bombay.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.960
And there was a very serious
terror attack on Mumbai

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.000
by a group, a
Pakistan terror group,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.960
which the Indian government
was able to identify,

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:58.180
had some connections with
the Pakistani government.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:03.540
India very wisely
showed restraint,

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:09.140
and did not invade Pakistan
when that happened.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.610
The question now is
what happens if there

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:15.714
is another such attack,
a Mumbai 2, so to speak.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.230
Shultz and I have
had several meetings

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.830
at Stanford with
India and Pakistan,

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.770
very senior people from
India and Pakistan,

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.310
discussing this very issue.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:33.850
And it seemed very
clear to both sides

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.752
that if that happened
again, that first

00:44:35.752 --> 00:44:37.960
of all, the Pakistani side
said they couldn't be sure

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.174
their government could prevent
it from happening again.

00:44:41.174 --> 00:44:42.590
They didn't have
that much control

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.450
over these terror groups.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.500
And the Indian government
said if it happened again,

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.490
the Indian government
would feel obliged to have

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:57.720
some sort of a punishment,
which would probably

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.990
be a punitive military
incursion into Pakistan

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.400
by the Indian army.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.820
And which case,
the Pakistani side

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.550
would say if that
happened, the Pakistanis,

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.580
rather than losing to the
superior military force,

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.777
would use something which they
call tactical nuclear weapons.

00:45:15.777 --> 00:45:17.860
Now, I have to tell you,
a tactical nuclear weapon

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.200
is a misnomer.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.740
What it means is
a nuclear weapon

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.790
that can be used by tactical
forces to fight a war,

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.840
not for deterrence.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.990
But it goes off with a bang,
like the Hiroshima bomb.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.770
So don't be misled
by the word tactical.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.790
These are big bombs.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.150
So the Pakistanis
thought their government,

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:40.630
rather than see
itself humiliated

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.050
by having its army
defeated, would

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.150
use a tactical nuclear
bomb within Pakistan

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.686
against the Indian army forces.

00:45:47.686 --> 00:45:50.370
They're hoping that the
Indian government would not

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.834
respond with nuclear weapons.

00:45:51.834 --> 00:45:53.750
The Indians all believe
that if that happened,

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.860
the Indian government
would respond.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.580
So that that's the
definition of how

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.520
a nuclear war, a regional
nuclear war, could get started.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.950
That scenario is
all too plausible.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.480
So for that reason, I would
agree with the assertion

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.950
that the border between
India and Pakistan

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.999
is perhaps the most dangerous
place in the world today.

00:46:14.999 --> 00:46:16.540
The second most
dangerous place would

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.610
be the border between South
Korea and North Korea.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:25.380
BORIS DEBIC: Dr. Perry, I want
to step a little bit from away

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.910
from all the complexities
that you have described today.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.990
I mean, this is very
useful information,

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:36.300
and I am sure that you work with
a lot of current politicians

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.200
in trying to think about
political solutions.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.620
But I also would like to
introduce the work that you

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.110
started doing with
the organization

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:52.980
that you and your daughter
have founded that is trying

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.860
to reach the younger audience.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:01.900
And perhaps you have something
to offer to the normal man who

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.000
is not sitting in Washington DC,
who is going to his every day

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.150
job and whatnot.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:08.380
How can they get involved?

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.290
How can I make a difference?

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:15.120
How can my colleague
make a difference

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:21.795
in trying to diffuse this
very volatile situation?

00:47:21.795 --> 00:47:23.295
WILLIAM PERRY: You
may have inferred

00:47:23.295 --> 00:47:25.003
from what I've already
said that I do not

00:47:25.003 --> 00:47:28.780
have great confidence in the
political forces in Washington

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.630
today or in Moscow today
recognizing and resolving

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:35.860
the very serious
issues that we face.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.420
And I think a large
reason for that

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.880
is because our populace as a
whole does not understand it.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.410
That's why we
conducted this survey.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.160
It's just a random
survey of young people.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.784
What do you know
about nuclear weapons?

00:47:46.784 --> 00:47:50.340
And the answer is abysmal,
abysmal ignorance.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:55.560
And along with the
ignorance, not much concern.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:00.680
So if we're really going to get
sensible policies for dealing

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.360
with the dangers which
we're waving our arms about,

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.110
you can wave your arms
about all you want,

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.485
but you have got
to have policies

00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:10.100
to correct the problems.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.870
We have to find a way
of educating people,

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:17.470
particularly educating
young people, on this issue.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.700
The kids you saw
in that video not

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.460
only didn't know
about the Cold War,

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.850
they didn't even
know about 9/11.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.640
So this is a grossly
uninformed population.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.510
And so we we're setting
out an educational program

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.600
to try to deal
with that problem,

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.630
and an education program
directed primarily

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.770
at young adults.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:47.380
We believe that the
reason our policies are

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:51.650
so inadequate today-- let me
back up and say more directly.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.360
A complete declarative
statement is

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.950
that the danger of a
nuclear catastrophe today

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.450
of one of the kinds
we talked about,

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.830
the danger of a
catastrophe today

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:05.370
is greater than it was
during the Cold War.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.450
It is greater than it
was during the Cold War.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.250
We've documented that
several various ways.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.880
I talk about it in
great detail in my book.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.696
And I'm just writing another
paper now, dealing specifically

00:49:14.696 --> 00:49:16.320
with it, why I believe
that to be true,

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.967
and how I can document it, why
I believe it is an accurate

00:49:18.967 --> 00:49:19.800
way of assessing it.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.970
If it's greater today,
it's also perfectly clear

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.340
that our policies are
not adequate for dealing

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.370
with those dangers.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.960
We're blissfully going
ahead, both we and Russia,

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.430
rebuilding the Cold
War nuclear arsenal.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.940
Never mind the $1 trillion
cost associated with it,

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.980
the dangers associated with
that are very, very real.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:45.500
So we need a program
of education.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.504
You can't rant about policies
if you don't understand

00:49:50.504 --> 00:49:51.420
the underlying issues.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.550
So the first step
is education, and it

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:58.330
has to be some kind
of a mass education.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.950
So sure, I teach a course
at Stanford on this subject.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:03.870
I get a couple hundred
students, which is nice,

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.414
but that doesn't influence
what's going on in the world.

00:50:06.414 --> 00:50:08.330
I had to find a way of
getting the information

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.480
through to hundreds of
thousands of students,

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.260
or even millions
of young people.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.240
And so, obviously, the internet
is the only way to do that.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.090
And we're trying in our
project to put together

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.680
media that can work, that can
be effective over the internet,

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.930
and which will attract young
people to read it and get

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:26.596
engaged with it.

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.580
One of the reasons I'm happy
to talk with this group today

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.600
is we need help with
what we're doing,

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.530
and certainly no one ought
to be better qualified

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:41.060
on how to effectively
use the internet

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.050
to communicate with millions
of people than people here

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:45.747
at Google.

00:50:45.747 --> 00:50:48.080
So we're in our own fumbling
way doing these things now.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.350
We're preparing videos,
of which you saw one.

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.910
You did not see the
video we prepared

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:55.770
on nuclear terrorism,
which actually lays out

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.680
the scenario I described to you
about an attack on Washington.

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.770
BORIS DEBIC: That
video is available

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.067
online on your [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:03.067 --> 00:51:04.400
WILLIAM PERRY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.940
It is certainly
available online.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.850
But it's a powerful
video, which drives home

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:15.530
how real this problem is,
and how serious it is.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:19.860
So we would like very much to
get people interested in this

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.090
by educating them.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.130
And what can they do
once they get educated?

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:30.590
The first thing is to
help educate others, focus

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.970
on specific policy issues.

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:35.690
For example, the
issue of should we

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.440
be rebuilding our ICBM force?

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.560
That's a very concrete,
specific issue.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.560
And you can build up
quite a head of steam

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:49.357
in trying to slow
that process down,

00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:51.190
if you get enough people
concerned about it,

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:54.800
and talking about
it, and debating it.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.890
But it takes masses of people.

00:51:56.890 --> 00:51:59.507
It can't be done with
a classroom of people.

00:51:59.507 --> 00:52:01.590
And again, that means you
have to communicate over

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:04.460
the internet.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.400
One of the things I was hearing
is that knowledge, of course,

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:11.190
is necessary, before
you speak intelligently

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:17.050
about these problems, but
you also must have conviction

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:19.067
that this is a serious problem.

00:52:19.067 --> 00:52:20.525
Not only your future
depends on it,

00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:22.720
but your children's
future depends upon it,

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.950
if you want to do
something about it.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:27.890
I want to end on my
comment here by giving you

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:33.520
a quote from the Irish poet
WB-- William Butler Yates,

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.384
who said something very
meaningful on this problem.

00:52:36.384 --> 00:52:39.860
I'll just quote it
for you exactly.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:49.060
He said, "the best lack
conviction, while the worst are

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.355
full of passionate intensity."

00:52:52.355 --> 00:52:54.730
And that's what I see when I
look out in the world today.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:59.730
I see people ranting and raving
passionately about how vital

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:02.659
it is to be rebuilding all
of our ICBMs and so on,

00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:04.950
and the rest, well, you saw
it in the picture up there.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.480
What can I do?

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.620
That's not a sufficient answer.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.710
If you have the conviction,
you educate yourself.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.370
You help educate other people.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:16.600
You associate yourself with
a group, like our group,

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.790
for example, that is actually
working on the problem,

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:21.520
and help them do it.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.450
There are things you can
do, if you, first of all,

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.990
get the conviction that you
should be doing something,

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.070
and then take the time
to educate yourself

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.660
on what the real issues are.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.330
BORIS DEBIC: Please join
me in thanking Dr. Perry

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.160
for visiting us here at Google.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.201
WILLIAM PERRY: Thank you.

00:53:38.201 --> 00:53:40.210
