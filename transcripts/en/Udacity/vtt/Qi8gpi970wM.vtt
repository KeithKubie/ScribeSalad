00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.390
The famous sickle cell allele that causes sickle cell anemia is a good example

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.620
of a recessive allele that's actually gain-of-function.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.170
Now, it seems that there's a really big

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.160
negative effect, especially when it happens in

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.100
homozygous condition, so why would we find it

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.310
at such high frequencies in the African

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.280
populations if it only has a negative effect?
