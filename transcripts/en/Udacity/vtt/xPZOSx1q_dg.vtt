The process of the browser creating and

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.200
building the document object model can be fairly complicated.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.480
But if we're going to be precise about things,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.890
it happens during the page load as it receives HTML source.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.520
So, even before the page is fully loaded, the browser begins to

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.680
start constructing the document object model one piece at a time.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.210
Other answers I would consider correct, are simply after HTML's been received,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.656
or after the page has been loaded.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:37.040
For part b, while the DOM can be accessed through a variety of different means,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.020
the main answer I was looking for

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.910
is through its JavaScript application programming interface since we're

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.100
going to be working in the browser and with JavaScript in this course.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.520
And in the third part, while you can access the DOM through JavaScript,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.350
as I just mentioned, the DOM itself isn't a programming language,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.950
or JavaScript, but is merely a specification of an interface.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.150
The DOM is also a hierarchical object, and what I mean by this is that it has

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.620
a tree structure and this is due to the nested nature of HTML itself.
