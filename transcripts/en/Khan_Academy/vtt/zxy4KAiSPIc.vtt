00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.695
Use the line segments below
to create a quadrilateral, so

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:07.880
a four-sided figure,
with vertices

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.330
at the following points.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.470
So they give us four
coordinates right over here.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.140
So those have to
be where the sides

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.660
of our quadrilateral intersect.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.940
So one is at the point 0, 9.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.020
So our x-coordinate is 0.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.930
So we're at 0.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.990
And then our y-coordinate, or
our vertical coordinate, is 9.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.690
So we need to have a
vertex right over here.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.005
Now, the next one
is at 0, negative 7.

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:39.770
So let me just put
something here.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.300
We can later rearrange it to
see what actually makes sense.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.950
Then we have 8, negative 7.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.320
So 8, negative 7
Is right over here.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.610
It feels like this
might be the right edge.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.090
So I'll put its other point
right at 8, negative 7.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.375
And then finally, 8 comma 0.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.560
Well, 8 comma 0 Is
right over here.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.469
So it looks like I have a point
on every one of the vertices.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.260
So now I just have to
connect to these two,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.676
and I'll have a
four-sided figure.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:21.690
So let me take this there,
bring this one over.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.000
And let me move this one up,
and then bring this one down.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.010
And there you have it.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.860
I think I've got
my quadrilateral.
