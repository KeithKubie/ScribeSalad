1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,060
Mm Edwards, the ever the contrarian
shows up with an android phone,

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,570
drinking tea against the sun.
Second followed. No rules.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,350
Still Mag and pay me sorta.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,000
You had some French fries or dad brought
that were made with clear the legend.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,850
Jamie, you were there. What did you say?
You guys saw French dryer too. Yeah.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,190
Appeared in my life. Listen
to the MGM steakhouse.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,920
Dan Cooking that fucking those French
fries. If anything other than animal fat.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,120
Guaranteed the two delicious. I
didn't see it. I didn't see it.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,370
Even at McDonald's, you
get McDonald's fries.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,140
Apparently they cook them in some
fucking disgusting fat. Well,

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,290
that's what makes them taste so good.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,220
What does make McDonald's fries
tastes good? They're pretty good,

13
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:47,140
but they're not my
favorite. I don't even know.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,220
I get confused when people say they're
better than in and out. Fries. Oh,

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,770
I like fries. It tastes like
potatoes either in and now.

16
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:58,480
Fries are far superior. I don't
like fries. It tastes like potatoes.

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,210
[inaudible] don't know fries better than
McDonald's. I do personally feel that.

18
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:15,190
You know who I hadn't beef with that
about candy Alexander from a news radio.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,940
She was the first person to like, we went
and got in and out like for the holes,

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,850
the whole group of us. And um, uh,

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,750
she got McDonald's fries.
She went and got McDonald's.

22
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,960
Why'd you get McDonald's fry? She
was like, fuck those bullshit fries,

23
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,850
those in and out fries. I'm like, what?
I didn't understand. They can be okay,

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,570
but they're so hit or miss
that they can miss bad. To me,

25
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,250
they're remarkably consistent.
They always taste like,

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,250
what are we discussing here? Fries or
mocker. It's like a line. Remember mock.

27
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,210
It's still a common Solak
with five guys fries.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,600
Five guys with the King of fries.
Yes. They have two options.

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,040
They have k they're real,

30
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,000
they have the fucking potatoes and bags
sitting in their goddamn store just to

31
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:58,834
let you know, bitch,

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,170
we're using these potatoes and then they
take that bag and shake it in there and

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,650
cut it up. Um, they have Cajun fries
so they, when you have another option,

34
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,210
you got spicy fries that are God damn
delicious. I have to stop by there.

35
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,130
Then you don't have to crack
packets to get your ketchup.

36
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,620
They have a giant tub of the ketchup.

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,180
He squirt that bitch in a nice
Little Cup, a little paper cup.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,320
You can shower and have that catch up.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,580
McDonald's had that homeless
people would be under it.

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,680
Squirt mustard in their mouth.

41
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,660
I'll tell you what man,
since um, Starbucks got in
trouble for being racist. Um,

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,910
there's a lot more homeless
people at Starbucks.

43
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:43,180
Like they understand that they
could just go there. It's really,

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,270
it's really odd. That's so funny.
That's true. Get kicked out.

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,200
They can get kicked out. He's afraid,
dude. It's a, it's 100% different.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
100% different in some spots.

47
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,590
Which ones are you going to
cause the ones in Hollywood,

48
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,100
they know how to handle it for the
most part because they got locks on

49
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,850
everything. I went to a shifty
one in downtown where a,

50
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,860
they didn't even have a bathroom.
Like how do you serve in coffee?

51
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,620
You don't have a bathroom. Coffee
makes you shit and Piss. Yeah,

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,610
this is ridiculous.

53
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,490
But I realized they didn't have a
bathroom cause the homeless people,

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
there was homeless people that had like
this guy had a port and he was charging

55
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,000
all of his devices. He had
everything. He had like a phone,

56
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,900
a fucking iPad and long night ahead of
him to get free electricity there and

57
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,970
they always got like a bag of his stuff.

58
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,630
Like he's got a little camp in the
corner of the Starbucks. I'm like, wow.

59
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,520
On one hand like, hey,

60
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,730
how's the guys supposed to
get some electricity but I
want him to get back up on

61
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,220
his feet. Maybe this is the way to
do it. Maybe it's through that iPad.

62
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,490
[inaudible]. On the other hand I'm
like, Hey, don't get me a disease.

63
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,600
You fucking, I got
Instagram account yesterday,

64
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,560
street people of Los Angeles, which
has got some very interesting content.

65
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,420
Does that a naked person? Yes, it is.

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,090
Naked person just changing on
the strange and on the street.

67
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,670
That was actually in San Francisco I
think I remember checking that post but

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,470
wow, this has got some interesting stuff.

69
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,010
These guys were like cooking underneath
the tree on a lot with like a live grill

70
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,290
right about somewhere. But there's a,
Tommy's in Hollywood, sorry, go ahead.

71
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,540
Thompson home and uh,

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,030
there's always like a bunch of young
homeless people cooking in front of it.

73
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,650
Like there's a bus stop.

74
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,810
They have a lit fire
like caveman, like, like,

75
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
like fear of the walking dead style
campfire like outside of the Tommy's on

76
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:25,300
Hollywood boulevard, like on a daily
basis. How weird. It's just weird that,

77
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:30,100
that's okay. Like if you just wanted to
start a fire on the side of the road,

78
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,660
would that be okay? No. But can you
start a fire to cook apparently.

79
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,060
Can you or did they just not get
busted? Probably need a permit. Yeah.

80
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,060
Would think you need something like a
to be like a grill street vendor type

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,940
permit if you want to sell. What if
you just wanted to give food away?

82
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,790
You can't do that. You can't,
but you can eat it yourself.

83
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:51,200
Mm.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,650
I don't know. Could you offer it to some,

85
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,240
it seems like you could offer
it to somebody like you know,

86
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,650
if they allow you to cook and you and I
were sitting there and were cooking and

87
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,940
said, would you like some and
you said, hey, that looks good.

88
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,250
That should be okay. It's like a donation.

89
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:08,630
You know some places they don't charge
you to get in but they accept a donation.

90
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,490
But if you plan in advance you say, hey,

91
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,220
all of us meet on the corner
of third and Santa Monica.

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,540
I'm going to have a cookout because,
oh no, no, no, no. House, Sun,

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,040
solar. We just setting up right here
on the concrete. Yeah, those do.

94
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,680
People should just go to a
park that has those grills.

95
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,990
Like Griffith Park is not far. Right.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,220
Griffith Park is like people with homes
cooked there. Yeah. You got free grills.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,100
You could just do it up there.
Anybody can cook there. Yeah.

98
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,650
That is one of the nicest
parts of la by the way.

99
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,180
And if people don't know that
is a fucking wildlife area,

100
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,190
that's a legit wildlife area.

101
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,880
There is a real Predator prey fucking law.

102
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:50,210
The jungle thing going down
right now in Griffith Park,

103
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,040
it's mountain lions and deer.

104
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,790
It is going down and
coyotes day and coyotes,

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,600
you are doing all your stuff. It's
a really amazing place, right?

106
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,220
Because here we are. We got past that
Dina and Glendale and Burbank and La,

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,731
you know,

108
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,650
beautiful fucking BMWs driving
by these cool people are jogging.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,830
They got earpods in the
jogging and Griffith Park.

110
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,980
The jogging right near a war zone is a
war zone is rustling sometimes go around

111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,770
the corner and I'm like,
fuck dude, like I'm, I'm on,

112
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,020
I'm stay paying attention a hundred
percent we got a giant framed picture and

113
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,080
headed to the studio of this mountain
lion that was photographed by a camera

114
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,400
trap. You know what a camera trap is?

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,220
They set them up to monitor the numbers
of wildlife and to just try to get an

116
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:44,300
accurate assessment of what's in the
area. So what it is is like a camera.

117
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,163
That's the photo.

118
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,490
It's a camera that operates
on a motion detection.

119
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:53,900
So as this cat, this probably
hundred and 50 pound,

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,140
super muscular grown ass mountain lion
with a fucking collar on his neck.

121
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,080
His name is p 22 that's what it says.

122
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,110
Just say up there just
between 219 pounds as of May.

123
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,550
So it's not quite that big.

124
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,040
So it's still big enough to
kill everyone in this room.

125
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,720
It's in the room with us. We're fucked.
But look how muscular it is. I mean,

126
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:18,470
that is a look at the size of its goddamn
forearms. Those are Franco Colombo,

127
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,490
forearms.

128
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,490
That is a scattershot animal and that
animal lives around where all these people

129
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,950
are jogging. It's really
strange situation.

130
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,510
I'm never going to Griffith park again.

131
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,890
Fuck would peep till I saw
a p one to five. I'm out.

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
Stay at my house, Bro. Look at the
Hollywood sign behind it though.

133
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:45,340
It's so perfect. That's almost like a
fake picture that is so close to me. Yes.

134
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,640
So close to you. I went to the park.

135
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,260
I'm like a block and a half away from
that joint. Do I run with a knife?

136
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Oh yeah, I do.

137
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:57,020
I run with the this fucking
half face blades knife.

138
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,350
It's called the s h p o
s subhuman piece of shit.

139
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,840
That's what the name of the
knife is. Same, same easy cry.

140
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,450
So they caught him here with look
at that. He's got blood and bones.

141
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,380
He's eating something that
must be like a deer leg.

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,210
Fucking a that is madness.

143
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,390
And he's digging a hole in the ground
and stuff it in there to save it.

144
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,600
Fuck man. Because you know what?

145
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,490
The deer around there are
really comfortable. Yeah.
But that could be a kid man.

146
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,410
Right? 100% could be a kid.

147
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,620
But I know why he's there because
the deer in that neighborhood,

148
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,560
like they walk around in the
daytime like their tourist too,

149
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,190
cause there's no hunting around here. So
they're like all comfortable and shit.

150
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,350
I said okay. You'll probably
feed them too. Yeah.

151
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,130
So then now the line that's like, oh,

152
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,790
let me track these motherfuckers over
to this area and I'll just have a feast.

153
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,520
It's a buffet night. Look at
this shit. I'm all in drive.

154
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,110
This is an automobile haul and drive.

155
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,100
There's a grown ass mountain lion with
a collar on that's got a giant deer on

156
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:03,720
the ground. A buck, not
giant. It's probably a hundred
pound deer on the ground.

157
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,340
Dead on the, on the side, on
the side of the city street.

158
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,310
It's a similar situation.
Yeah. Civilization.

159
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,150
And this is a cat that's killing
deer with its face where we live.

160
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,480
And not only that, we know where
it is, we have a collar on it.

161
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,320
We're playing this game. You don't fuck
with us and we won't fuck with you.

162
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
And they won't fuck with
you. For the most part,

163
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,080
the problem comes when they
get old and when they get old,

164
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,630
they get real dangerous
cause they get desperate.

165
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,530
They can't catch a deer anymore. So they
go for the easy, cool. Go for people.

166
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,710
People are easy, right? Yeah
man, your kids are easy.

167
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,880
I'm gonna go hiking with somebody slow
that's move. Go hiking with a small,

168
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,990
slow person. Someone who just doesn't
look like a challenge at all. Hey Man,

169
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,870
survival of the fittest. Go
smoking with someone who's smoking,

170
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,230
you're smoking the meat. It makes
it more attractive. So they're like,

171
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,320
what we eat affects how we taste.
It's got it. Right. So maybe,

172
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,230
maybe like people who are
in really in the junk food,

173
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,550
they'd be more attractive than a sweet
taste to them. Yeah, I bet. Right?

174
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,890
If you just eat candy all day,
I bet you taste delicious.

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,330
The human skittle attack the human
skittle over here. Leave me alone.

176
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,480
That fucking cat is so big, man.

177
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,350
Imagine just seeing the 115 pound cat
in the room with you. You'd be like,

178
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,820
oh Jesus Christ. Like my dog is probably

179
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,000
maybe 75 80 pounds somewhere in
that range. He's not marshal.

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,710
Yeah. And if he wanted to kill
me, he probably could. Right.

181
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,240
I mean, he's a golden retriever. They
don't kill anything other than squirrels.

182
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,640
But if he wanted to, I mean,

183
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,340
I don't know if he had that mentality
really was like crazy. Like,

184
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,580
like 28 days later he got that rage
virus in and he just went after me.

185
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,120
He's got giant ass fucking
teeth. Right? I mean,

186
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:59,121
I assume that I would kick his ass
because he listens to me because I'm his

187
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,100
daddy. You know what I mean?
Like there's no, he's never,

188
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,640
I've had pit bulls that grouch you a
little bit and you gotta Kinda like,

189
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:08,010
hey mother Fucker, I'm the
one who gives you your food,

190
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:10,950
cut the shit and then they'll give you
their Paul and then they're sorry you

191
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,870
played a little game with
them. A little dominance game.

192
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,840
Especially when they're teenagers
and they're like one and a half,

193
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,810
two years old. They'll test you just
to check cause it's natural for them.

194
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,650
It's natural for dogs. Golden's don't
ever do that. He don't grow out anybody.

195
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,820
They're just obedient, worst guard dog
of all time. You come over everybody.

196
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,160
He loves everybody. He
loves you. I love it.

197
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:33,330
He loves people like he's never like,
not, not like he's never met them,

198
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:36,120
but like he can't believe he
hasn't seen them in so long.

199
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,600
It's like a long lost friends.
The long lost friends.

200
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,000
Everyone's a long lost
friend. Hilarious. Everyone.

201
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,030
Everyone is a long lost friends.
What it's like with him,

202
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,950
he's such a love sponge. I would, I
would be jealous if I, if that's my dog,

203
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,050
I'm like, so I'm not special.

204
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,080
Just that motherfucker don't tell
dog jar really friendly dogs.

205
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,950
Every new person is another opportunity
for a new person to love them too.

206
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,590
And so they, they get so
excited to meet people.

207
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:06,810
Smart do when people come over to the
house, he is so hilarious. Everyone,

208
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,720
he loves everybody. Like

209
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,150
I believe it's, you know, like
whenever you met your daughter,

210
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,960
it's like a few years

211
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,930
and he just starts whining
and run around and start

212
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,050
goals. It's hilarious. But if you want
it to you probably kill me. I mean,

213
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,250
if a rat was that big, I would fucking
put my money on the rat on the right.

214
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,630
Right. And dogs, dogs
kill rats all the time.

215
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,720
Even those little dogs like Jack
Russells, those little tiny dogs,

216
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:36,350
those are designed to kill rats.
Hilarious. My ex had a dog, right?

217
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,860
And I was holding the dog and she got
into a car right across the street and

218
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:47,681
moved it and then got out the car and
Wa and the dog acted like he didn't just

219
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,800
see a jump in the car. He acted like
she went away for two days. It was a

220
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:55,860
[inaudible].

221
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,470
I was like, she just went to,

222
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,320
she just moved the car across
you and we watched her do it.

223
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,460
Do you remember when we had a, uh,

224
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,400
Mr. Foster Aaron Foster on the podcast
and he was talking about being able to

225
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:10,760
kill a wolf. We had to fight
one. We had to correct him.

226
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,890
We had to go press stop this. Don't, I
know you're a beast, but come on man.

227
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:18,300
Where people were made
out of like smush. Yeah.

228
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,150
Everything's smushy also song.
Yeah. Something that wants a bite.

229
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:25,520
Your tit like of a wolf.
Decide to bite your tit.

230
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,580
The amount of pain you'd
be in, be unbearable.

231
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:33,080
I know you feel like one of those buns
that they give you at the steak house.

232
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,440
That's what your flesh feels
like. Exactly. Like a steak house.

233
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,800
Been bred fucking Aaron Foster spent
four hours on Twitter explaining why he'd

234
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:47,410
beat a wolf one on one. He's hilarious.
Isn't he doing a podcast now? Yeah,

235
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,160
he's got his own podcast. He started
doing music, which is really good.

236
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,890
You just release some music under,
I think positive. He knows his name.

237
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,020
He's a visionary. He's
a running back. Yeah.

238
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,050
He was running tired to
hit a vegan running back.

239
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,900
He retired young and he's
fucking super smart man.

240
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,880
Just except in control when it comes
to someone when comes to walls,

241
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,010
I think he's trolling a little bit. He's
having a little fun. It's being smart.

242
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,600
Yeah. There's like a wolf
he could get. Not any wolf.

243
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,250
Like there's one out there.
You want it? Oh yeah. Yeah.

244
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,570
He could fuck up an old one.

245
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,440
A declawed one with no teeth or grandma
Woolf old one that doesn't have any

246
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,110
endurance anymore. It
would be a battle though.

247
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,450
Even then before we get too
far off of this, I just,

248
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
there's pictures on the Google
images sent me down this,

249
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:30,020
this is just north of the, uh,
Los Angeles Zoo. So there's a,

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,050
I think this might even be
that same chat we just saw.

251
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:36,530
So this chap cougar has some food.
It's eating. And then next picture,

252
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,160
the bear show up to take
it. And now wait a minute,

253
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:43,040
they're eating the fucking food
instead of the Cougar. Oh my God.

254
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,770
So this is near us to this 30
miles away or probably even closer.

255
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,110
So bare steel, deer from
cougars. This is what happens.

256
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,370
Liberals run a state. Listen
folks, I'm liberal. I'm with you.

257
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,190
I know a lot of you think I'm not.
There's a lot of knuckleheads out there.

258
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,840
That thing going part of
the alt right or something.

259
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,220
I vote left on fucking
everything. But you,

260
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,170
you gotta stop anthropomorphizing
animals. We gotta be careful.

261
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,350
We, I'm on team people. I don't
want these animals to die,

262
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,650
but I also don't want to go out to my
fucking swimming pool and see a bear in

263
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,370
there and they, they have
that in Pasadena. You've
seen that shit in Pasadena.

264
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:23,180
This family went outside and there's a
fucking bear swimming around their pool

265
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,790
or bears and Pasadena.

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,470
Big Ones like 200 pound bear
swimming in this motherfucker's pool.

267
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,460
Do I live here? How do,
how do I know this shit?

268
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,360
Not only that you got to take over, man.
If they decide that this is their spot,

269
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:42,220
look at this shit. Look, there's a few
of them. If you've got the whole family,

270
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,340
my God, how many bears
are in there? Oh my God,

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,970
dude, these are, these things are no joke.

272
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,040
The problem with bears is too,

273
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,070
once they get a spot where they know they
can get food or they can get water or

274
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,020
they can get something, they're
going to come back to that spot.

275
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,590
They get habituated. That's why
they have a real problem with them.

276
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,700
With the people. Yellowstone
used to feed them, you know,

277
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,550
people would pull in and then I
actually did that or was there when that

278
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:13,070
happened when I was a little
kid, I went to Yellowstone.

279
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,940
My parents took me when I was probably
like seven or eight years old and I

280
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,890
remember just thinking, this is so crazy.

281
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,980
You're in your car and the bears
are outside. They were right there.

282
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,560
They don't do it the
same way anymore though.

283
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,140
Now they discourage
human bear interaction.

284
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,940
They just didn't understand
it I think as well.

285
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,160
Which is kinda crazy cause
I were not that long ago.

286
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,430
I was looking at the 1970s I just don't
understand people's like for ferocious

287
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,040
animals, like I don't want to kill him,

288
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,840
but I never want to feed something
that could kill me. Well,

289
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:49,841
I think people have this really distorted
idea of wildlife because of movies.

290
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,650
If you thought about like
what the lion king is,

291
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,210
you would never want aligned to die,
you know, lines noble. I mean, sure,

292
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:03,470
there's a few bad ones, but
overall, the lion king's the,

293
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,630
he's the sweetheart. He's amazing.

294
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,890
You think about Yogi bear and
you think about teddy bears.

295
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:14,180
Kids have teddy bears. I mean,
we have this weird thing.

296
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:17,180
We take polar bears, which is
the most vicious of all bears,

297
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,630
and we have them be our friends
selling us ice cream and Coca-Cola.

298
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,430
They're selling Klondike bars. Yeah.

299
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,410
We cartoon them and then people grow up
watching these cartoons and think, oh,

300
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:31,550
let me go pick this friendly thing
that was drawn. But that's a,

301
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,800
I wish. A ferocious beast. Yeah.

302
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,640
I wish it didn't have a history if
we just thought of it as a thing,

303
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,320
like a wolverine. Right. Wolverines
don't have any, there was no one.

304
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:45,500
No one feels about a wolverine the
same way they think about a bear.

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,630
Cause there was no like cute wolverines.

306
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,330
There's only the ones that see in like a,

307
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,930
you know x men like Wolverine
dudes. This one. Yeah. Yeah.

308
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,120
But he's like a person.
His name's Wolverine.

309
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,110
There's no like cute wolverines cause
they're so fucking for Roche has such a

310
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,560
monster of a little animal. One
Wolverine will fuck up a big bear.

311
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,520
Oh for real dude. They're fucking
ruthless. They chase wolves off food.

312
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,750
How big a wolverine. Not Big
man. 40 pounds. 50 pounds. Jeez.

313
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
They'll fuck up everything.
They fuck up everything.

314
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,150
Everything runs away from them. They're
just ready to die all day, all day,

315
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:21,984
ready to die.

316
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,710
And they're super strong and durable
for a little tiny thing you ever see.

317
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:28,680
You know what a wolverine looks
like and now I think I don't go up.

318
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:31,620
A Wolverine bearing is fancy.
It looks like a fake animal.

319
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,740
So like a super jacked little
giant rat bear thing with fangs.

320
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,610
It's like a super, it's like a
super badger. Badgers are similar.

321
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,920
I know they vicious. Fucking vicious.
That's a wolverine. Jeez Bro.

322
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,650
I mean, look at the teeth on that
thing. Look at its face and that's it.

323
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,950
Smiling. Yeah, that's a good day.

324
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,220
Those motherfuckers are
ready to go to war all day.

325
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,380
Make weird noises. They're terrifying.
Like if that thing wanted to kill you,

326
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,860
you would be fucked. Look at
this closed claws and the teeth.

327
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,130
Now imagine that that thing is hyper
aggressive and it's a Predator and fuck,

328
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,080
that shit is built to survive. Fuck
man. That is a crazy little animal.

329
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,700
They are ferocious and they,

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,620
they are ready to go at all times and
they'll try to get the fuck away from you.

331
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,040
The animal scientific meat
name means the glutton.

332
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,850
That's a pretty apt
description. Four feet tall,

333
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,820
weighing 22 pounds for females
and 40 pounds for males.

334
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,360
This fierce creatures are the
largest members of the weasel family.

335
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,470
They're fucking weasels, bro.
That's vicious weasel still.

336
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,140
They're small compared to some of the
animals that they compete with for food.

337
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,400
But a wolverine has no problem standing
up to wolves or a bear when a meal is on

338
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,530
the line. And that crazy 40 pounds.

339
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,270
The way bears are to us is the
way we are the dogs. You know,

340
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,510
like an 80 pound dog probably. Fuck
you up if you're 150 pound person.

341
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,430
That's how wolverines are. The bears.

342
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,450
40 pound wolverine might fuck up a
200 pound bear bears. Like, damn,

343
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,870
this ain't worth it when I die. I want
to come back as a wolverine. Yeah,

344
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,290
that's a vicious animal. The Caribou,

345
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,720
the hairs and rodents as well as larger
animals like Caribou that are weak or

346
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:19,110
ill, but we'll also scavenge from any
car cause they can get their claws on.

347
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,340
They also eat vegetables and berries.
Frozen meat isn't a deterrent there.

348
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,370
Upper molar that sit
sideways at 90 degrees,

349
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,740
let's them rip into ice covered carcasses.

350
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,210
Their teeth are so sharp and strong
that they can even eat bones. Whoa.

351
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,220
Damn. Once they got food,

352
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:38,250
they often bury it to save for
later mere hours after a meal.

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,480
They'll go on the hunt again.
Ferocious, ferocious little fucks.

354
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,960
Ugliest Shit too. Yeah, so we don't
have a cutie Po, one of those cutie.

355
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
We'd be like to Wolverine.
Hi, Mr Wolverton.

356
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,910
I'm here to help you on
targe with to the forest.

357
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,050
Now they're here to eat your kids.

358
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:59,950
I'm waiting for some woman to bring one
on the plane as a support wolverine.

359
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,830
Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, some
crazy. It's always a woman. Yeah.

360
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,510
And always one that's like over
50 and on all kinds of medication.

361
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,730
If you're a dude and you bring a wolverine
out of playing the beat and beat your

362
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,750
ass, um, has wolverine
ever killed a person?

363
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,830
There's some women that'll
get offended by that.

364
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,950
Why does it have to always be in women?
Is it you? It's not you. Right? Right.

365
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,350
I'm not talking about you.
Alright. Why getting personal? Why?

366
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,200
Why do we hope to be gender
specific? You know what I'm saying?

367
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,080
Like if I'm saying, oh, it's probably a
woman doesn't mean hey, no women, right.

368
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,070
It means it's probably really a
woman, right. Because being honest,

369
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,860
the peacock person, that was a woman,
that was a woman and then the the,

370
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,530
but in the [inaudible],
the defense of women,

371
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,050
a guy got an emotional support alligator.

372
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,770
Recently there was a guy and he's
an idiot. But I hear about that.

373
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,230
I'm wonder how many of those
people, including the peacock lady,

374
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,530
are doing it just for attention because
they know that people will talk about

375
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:56,080
it. I think people that have like,

376
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,610
I'm saw this girl and see
in San Diego, La Jolla,

377
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,140
she came to the restaurant with her
micro pig. That's not real. You know,

378
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
that's not real. They met,
they made those, yeah, coming.

379
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,160
She explained it to me. No,

380
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,250
she adopted a pig and then kept it and
then fed it and then drove some ungodly

381
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:19,630
amount of time, like two days to Texas
to drop it off at a pig sanctuary.

382
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,120
That's how crazy for
animals. Whitney Cummings.

383
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,530
So through Whitney I learned
that pigs are just pigs.

384
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,970
There's no micro pig. It's just a pig
that they don't feed. Oh. For Real.

385
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,700
For Real. So they just
starved it and it just says,

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,900
keeps them on getting big by not
giving it a lot of food in there. Cool.

387
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,080
Pawn it off on a sucker pig.
Exactly. Scotty eat. Exactly.

388
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,980
It's greedy little pig. Yeah. I
mean they're famous for getting fat.

389
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,910
That's what they love to do. So they'll
pawn it off on some person and then,

390
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,140
cause they can't afford not to feed it.
Another person doesn't know any better.

391
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,170
They think they're getting a micro pig.
Oh, it's give me small and cute forever.

392
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,390
Now you're going to have
a thousand pound pig.

393
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,350
If you give you feed it everything and
wants to eat, it's going to keep growing.

394
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,170
It's like, Damn I, how did my pig
grow supposed cause the sole pig,

395
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,660
there's no micro. It's like micro people.

396
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,760
Like if you look at people
from like the civil war day,

397
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:15,040
they were always 125
pounds. Well why was that?

398
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,700
Because they didn't have
any fucking food, man.

399
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,300
The same guy today probably
be 200 pounds. Yeah.

400
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,080
[inaudible] and all that stuff
and everything in it. Oh yeah.

401
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,790
Well even just eating regular food,

402
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,450
just like real meat and potatoes
and vegetables and shit.

403
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:30,820
You're not gonna be 125 pounds.
I was probably starving.

404
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,140
They probably didn't have three meals
a day back in the civil war era and

405
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:39,640
snacks. I read this book
by this, a pool hustler.

406
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,170
It was a McGurty life
of a billiard hustler.

407
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:46,130
I think it was so really interesting

408
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,270
book because it was about a guy who
survive by traveling around on trains,

409
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,070
like a Hobo gambling,

410
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,050
playing pool and billiards in the
depression. But during the depression,

411
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,120
he was talking about
almost starving to death,

412
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,110
like a people who would knock on people's
door and beg for Food and you know,

413
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,330
people would just come out with a
plate of food and give it to them.

414
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:09,140
Like everybody was like on the edge.
People had to really rely on people.

415
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,740
They didn't like rely on people for
food. There was no fucking jobs.

416
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,190
There's a lot of people
back then, you know, we,

417
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,870
we're looking at these homeless
folks and like for the most part,

418
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,940
my opinion is you're looking at,

419
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:23,720
people probably have an undiagnosed or
untreated mental illness. A lot of that.

420
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,210
I think it's a lot. I don't
know what the number is,

421
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,110
but I would think it's a lot.

422
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,640
And then there's also people that make
mistakes down the line and then people

423
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:36,590
that you know had terrible childhoods,
horrible abuse, sexual abuse,

424
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:40,580
violence, the evil parents.
You know, parents die,

425
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:43,240
leave him alone, foster
care, all that kind of shit.

426
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,590
And like it's not their
fault a lot of times.

427
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,190
And then as as humans we should do
something to, to take care of it.

428
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,170
But on the other hand, and we just
don't know who's who out there. Yeah,

429
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,730
exactly. Who's mentally ill, who just
needs help and dimensional people, man,

430
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,780
they need help too. But like how
do you force them to, you know,

431
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,983
how do you force them in it?

432
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,840
Oh, how do you just get them
real help so that because yeah,

433
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,480
the way they do help people with
pills and all that stuff. Some,

434
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,660
some of it works and some of it doesn't
work. [inaudible] you know what I mean?

435
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,380
And some of it's just like creates
a dependency on something. Yeah.

436
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,780
So it's just like the,

437
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,970
the system just from the beginning needs
to be fixed and not just like pills

438
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,104
and,

439
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,680
right. Have you ever been on any
kind of psych medication? No.

440
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,330
Have you ever taken an Adderall? No. Me
Neither. I want on to though. You do.

441
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,740
Jamie gave me a little bit of Adderall
once allegedly. And uh, I didn't take it.

442
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,760
I looked at it and was
like, I don't do it man.

443
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,460
Go and gave it to you cause I haven't
taken it either. I had it for a long time.

444
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,990
I was like, I don't think I'm
going to take it. You want it.

445
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,730
It's just I've, I've known so many people
that do it and they get real weird.

446
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,740
They get weird. And it is a, it's,

447
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,270
it's an amphetamine and
when you take amphetamines,

448
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,120
especially if you don't take
amphetamines responsibly,

449
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,490
really strange things happen.

450
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,430
And one of the things happen
is people get really paranoid.

451
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,740
They get really weird. They get,

452
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,210
they start having delusions of grandeur.

453
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,020
They start thinking that what
they're doing is very important.

454
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:21,200
That a lot of people are out
to take them down. And uh,

455
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:23,510
you see that with people that,
that do too much Adderall,

456
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,720
they don't follow the prescription. They
just start chewing them all day. Whoa.

457
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,240
Things can get real slippery,
like slippery. It's like

458
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,260
a mess slipper. That's how
the hurts because they,

459
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,730
I guess they get immune to it. So they
gotta take extra. Oh yeah, you did.

460
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,700
And then then the more you
take, the worse it gets.

461
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,483
Yeah. Tolerance

462
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,130
is a real for everything.
Yeah. I would assume. I mean,

463
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:50,310
they even have tolerances for
snake venom. You know, the,

464
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,810
one of the things that snake handlers do,

465
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,610
they'll give themselves a
little bit of Adam every day.

466
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,040
Oh mom sells immune to snake venom.
Your body's an amazing adaptable thing,

467
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:02,340
which is why vaccines work.
Right? So why these crazy fucks?

468
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,250
It don't want us to have
vaccines like, listen, you know,

469
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,080
we gotta be real careful with
claiming expertise on this shit.

470
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,320
We gotta be real careful with getting
fucked over by pharmaceutical companies

471
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,510
and big business. We gotta
be real careful of that too.

472
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,770
But we also gotta be real careful of
not listening to these doctors and

473
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,300
researchers that are struggling to
find the ways to cure these horrible

474
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:27,900
infectious diseases. Cause they've got
a lot of them nailed through vaccines.

475
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,870
It's so confusing out there. You can
make an argument for on any team chore,

476
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,990
Anything You can cause. It's tough to
figure out. I know a lot of logical,

477
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,330
intelligent people that,

478
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,370
that think that vaccines cause autism
and I'm not a doctor so I don't know if

479
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:48,100
you know that. Yeah, I think,
I think none of Doctor Ah,

480
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,440
um, puts, uh, I've heard logical,

481
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,330
intelligent people argue that that
vaccines can cause autism. I'm like, man,

482
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:00,180
you're not a scientist.
Like how could you say that?

483
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,740
Cause you saw it in a documentary.

484
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,280
I know it's interesting when you see
something in the documentary that sounds

485
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:08,820
good. You want to relate. It's fact.
I'm as guilty as that as anyone.

486
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:12,240
Probably more guilty than most.
I'm guilty of doing that a lot,

487
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:16,380
but just recognizing that over time I've
gotten to this point where I'm like,

488
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,280
maybe I should just shut the fuck up
about something that I don't actually know

489
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,750
about and try to figure out what it is
instead of saying what it is, what they,

490
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,840
what they do know is that vaccines have
stopped the spread of a fucking bunch of

491
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,450
awful disease. Saved a bunch of plagues,

492
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:38,130
small pox that Lindsay Fitz Harris
woman who's been on the podcast,

493
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:42,840
Jamie, she sent me some image
of a, some people with smallpox,

494
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,140
bunch of stuff about small smallpox is
her riffing just horrific with how it

495
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:50,190
kills you. Her riffing,

496
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,680
they nip that shit in the
bud with vaccines. Maybe.

497
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,980
Maybe they've changed. Maybe,

498
00:28:58,981 --> 00:29:02,490
maybe some vaccines do get people autism.

499
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,330
That's what that guy's back looks
like. Can maybe some vaccines,

500
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,100
vaccines do give some
people autism, but overall,

501
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:14,040
most of the time it helps everybody.

502
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,520
Like there's going to be some things
that affect people differently,

503
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,200
but then that,

504
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:23,220
but that means you can't stop
taking it or giving it to everybody.

505
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,260
That's no constellation happen. Right.

506
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,500
It's no constellation if you get autism
from it or if your child and talk to

507
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,140
them from it. Yeah, but it's
one of those things that's bad.

508
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,950
Everybody grows up without
it. Right. You know,

509
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,450
it's a messy thing about
peanut person, right?

510
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,740
Like this not is not like clean pro.
Like are you pro abortion? Well,

511
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:44,230
I'm pro abortion up to
a point. Right? Right.

512
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,530
When it gets to be like seven
months, it's that seems to, you know,

513
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:49,360
it gets longer in the pregnancy.

514
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,760
That seems like if you're talking about
like the first few days, right? Yeah.

515
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,120
What do you, what is that like
three cells, pro abortion.

516
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:59,920
If I get the girl pregnant,
you know, as far as it takes.

517
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,500
As far as the text. Yeah. It's
um, it's a weird, you know,

518
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:10,420
with many, many, many subjects. There's
like a weird, well, it's not exactly,

519
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,860
well, it's this, you know, if
there's a vaccine court for reason,

520
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,480
vaccines have done damage to people.

521
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,490
People gotten injured from vaccines
where during the injection site something

522
00:30:21,491 --> 00:30:22,324
happened.

523
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,570
Peter Hotez was talking about that
he's a doctor that's a specialist in

524
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:29,740
infectious diseases and vaccines and
he was explaining that there's five

525
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:34,210
environmental factors that they think
were five factors they think contribute to

526
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,610
a child possibly getting autism.

527
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:39,520
They've narrowed it down to these
things with the most current research,

528
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,850
but they're all during the womb. It's,

529
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,150
it's contact with things during the
womb or in the genetics of the mother.

530
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,320
They think that it has something to do
with the developmental process while the

531
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:54,760
child is in vitro in the
woman's body, not after birth.

532
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,610
They don't think it occurs after
birth, but I don't know that.

533
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,511
I mean they could be wrong.

534
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:02,080
Then it could be current and then they
could change that opinion a year from

535
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,620
now. They can find new evidence. That
shit happens all the time. Yeah, exactly.

536
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,980
It really does. It happens all the time,

537
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:13,030
but what we have to do is make sure we
have fucking people that are working on

538
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:13,481
this shit,

539
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:17,230
trying to figure out the
way to stop diseases because
otherwise some Spanish flu

540
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:20,710
type shit comes rolling around all
the bullshit and kill everybody.

541
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,100
That Spanish flu killed
millions and millions of people.

542
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:28,150
The 1920s sound lethal at all. It's
just Spanish flu. It's just like,

543
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,390
how did that kill people?
Sounds like a drink. Yeah.

544
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,370
To bring that full circle back to
downtown la or that typhus outbreaks have

545
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:40,300
happened. Just a couple of [inaudible].
Same thing as typhoid fever I think,

546
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:43,900
but it's a very close to
new one. It's a new one.

547
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,210
It's a new typhoid that they
don't have a fucking vaccine for.

548
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,750
I was down there the other day
just trying to buy donuts downtown.

549
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,640
It's the allure of downtown
has escaped me. Everybody.

550
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,060
Everybody thinks it's amazing with Jamie
and I talked and we've been talking

551
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,390
about this forever, we wanted
to get a loft in downtown,

552
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:05,620
like up high and start filming podcasts
up there because I think that would be

553
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:08,710
the coolest backdrop like for Youtube,

554
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:10,360
like you and me sitting
here and behind us.

555
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,200
You just all building by
sometimes square MTV shit,

556
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,910
whites and shit like that would be an
amazing backdrop for a podcast screen that

557
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:22,480
now be safe. Yeah, can't do that.

558
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:25,540
If I was going to green screen something,
it would be like current events, Shit.

559
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,990
It would be like Melania Trump
slapping dog's hand away. I'd be like,

560
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,810
did you see that shit? Like
that would be what I would,

561
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,010
I wouldn't pretend I'm in the savannas
and a man like behind me is the Cheetah

562
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:39,750
creeping up on me and everybody
sees it like does he know? He know

563
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,700
I'll be sitting in Griffith Park. Behind
me is a mountain lion munched on a leg.

564
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,360
I was meditating in
Griffith Park. Oh Dude.

565
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:52,160
Like one morning and I hear rustling in
the bushes and it was a coyote like just

566
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:56,230
waking up. They bite you. Yeah. And
I was like, I can't do that anymore.

567
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
Close my eyes and Griffith Park.
Yeah. You go camping out there,

568
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,040
they'll bite you. They'll
check that you might be dead.

569
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:03,740
They'll take a bite if you
just lie in there like damn.

570
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:06,550
Maybe he just recently died. Yeah,

571
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,750
they really well they
really well their predators.

572
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,390
That whole thing is so strange. He
people are so strange how we just a,

573
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,370
we think it's cool.

574
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,270
It's cool to be around these
bears and mountain lions and shit.

575
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,590
And we have urban Cairo.

576
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:22,480
These ones that like you'll see
walking down the street at night. Yeah.

577
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,640
My neighbor had two little dogs
and one of them was really old,

578
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,210
so then she had to walk them one at a
time because she saw a coyote one time

579
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,440
coming up on him and she couldn't
handle both of them. So she takes,

580
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,880
or she used to take each dog out
to a walk at night. One at a time.

581
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:46,160
Take a gun. Shit. That fucking rotten
dog right in the face. It's hot.

582
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,950
That's what a coyote is. A dog. Not her
dog. I was talking about the coyote,

583
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:52,920
but actually that's a wolf. It's a
small wolf. It's a small wolf. Yeah.

584
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,920
Coyote is like a particularly
durable and resilient form of Wolf.

585
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,380
So shitty wolf. It's a
really interesting wolf.

586
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,600
There's a great book called Coyote
America by uh, Dan Flores. Um, he,

587
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,230
I learned about him through my friend
Steve and now I think he was his professor

588
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,590
and one of his, um, one of
his courses. Um, but he is a,

589
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,920
a guy who spent an extreme amount of
time studying the history and the science

590
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:23,120
behind coyotes for really,
really interesting book.

591
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,210
But one of the things they found
out is that when you kill a coyote,

592
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,910
they just make more coyotes to them.

593
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,550
Like they know they spread out. Yeah.
They, when they yell out, they'd yell out.

594
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,320
They communicate in a
lot of different ways.

595
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,520
The yell out when they kill something,

596
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,950
sometimes they yell out when they're
trying to figure out where each other's

597
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:43,280
are. And they also yell at like a
roll call. Like, cause you know,

598
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,420
it's hard out there. So they're
like, hey, what's up Jamie?

599
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,300
Jamie, they do that. That's part of what
they're doing. And when one is missing,

600
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,340
they, the female,

601
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,810
there's some sort of a
chemical or biological reaction
and her body makes more

602
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:03,770
puppies. Oh, she says like we're fucking
tonight. Yeah, I didn't hear Jamie.

603
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,340
We're fucking tonight. They
make larger litters fam.

604
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,010
So if a normal litter would be like
four pups, if someone's missing,

605
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:13,160
they'll make six or eight
something along those lines.

606
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,300
And now we can't kill them while they
spread out to in the 17 hundreds and 18

607
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:21,450
hundreds you know when people's first
started going through the west, their,

608
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,710
you know, they were around. But
then when we started killing them,

609
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,210
they spread to the entire country. They
all said they weren't single state.

610
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,960
So they weren't like down this way.
No, no, no. They weren't everywhere.

611
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,370
They're a west animal. They were western
animal. And then they went proud.

612
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,470
They're in New York City.

613
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,380
Oh Shit. For Real. Yes. For Real.

614
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,920
There's coyotes in New York City.

615
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,190
They have little packs of them
running around Times Square.

616
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,120
Get outta here bro. For real dude.

617
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,080
There's little coyotes that are
wandering through central park.

618
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,940
Listen, I get that there's
mountain lions in Griffith Park.

619
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,450
I get that there's cause
urban car, but New York City,

620
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,110
I might've made up the time square part.
Brick best bananas. Definitely York.

621
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:08,220
I'll check. I know they're in
New York cause there was a,

622
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,950
they probably came from upstate.
They've seen them in buildings.

623
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,460
[inaudible] coyotes and
abandoned buildings where
they've decided to make all

624
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:17,940
the cup Nass and abandoned belt. They're
all, they're all over downtown La Fam,

625
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,220
central park, central park, Bam, coyote
motherfucker. Damn Bro on the streets.

626
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,790
Coyote. Okay. On the street.
So I was telling the truth,

627
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,050
they could go to times square
easily everywhere. I've gotta look,

628
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,550
I'm almost like a tour agitating
coyote that has a small wolf.

629
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,730
That's what that is. And there
we've were infected with them.

630
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,910
And here's the thing. This is
what you have to be aware of.

631
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,120
That's the gentleman that, uh, go back.
What is his name? Justin Brown. Yeah.

632
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:46,530
Justin Brown was on the podcast. He
tracks coyotes all throughout downtown La.

633
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,830
He's biology, a wildlife biologist
that works for the state.

634
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,570
Really interesting in downtown La.

635
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,500
So instead of like being at a ranch
outside of Bakersfield and attach a pea

636
00:36:55,501 --> 00:37:00,420
mountains, this guy is a look. There's
a coyote. Same trap. Same camera trap.

637
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:04,260
Got that? Yeah. Get a picture of that
too young James, order that bitch up.

638
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,250
Make a note. Yeah. Look why not. Right.
We should have coyote picture too.

639
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,890
We can't just have a mt line. That's rude.

640
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,020
Let's show all the crazy
shit that's wandering.

641
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,780
See if they got a bear and the
camera trap. Hopefully they got a,

642
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,800
coyotes are so used to being around that.

643
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:25,070
The way they walk down the street
is just like regular. Yeah.

644
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,050
Like no trepidation whatsoever.
Look at that. Just wandering. Yeah.

645
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,060
Yeah. Whistle them. Walk.

646
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,270
I remember in 1994 the first,

647
00:37:35,271 --> 00:37:39,780
it might've been 93 first time I ever
came to La and I was staying at the a

648
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,450
Oakwood gardens or
Oakwood apartments. Yeah,

649
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,520
on Barnum there in Burbank.

650
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,430
They're furnished departments where it's
where you stay when you first come to

651
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:50,510
la. You don't have a spot.

652
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,780
You don't have enough money to get up
and you don't know if the show you're on

653
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:54,770
is ever going to last.

654
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,250
So I stayed at these Oakwood's apartments
and I was driving up the street to the

655
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:00,770
apartment and I saw coyotes. I
was like, what is this dog doing?

656
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:04,760
Just wandered around and I was
like, Oh shit, those are coyotes.

657
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,720
I couldn't believe it. That's fine.

658
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,710
I pulled over and I'm looking out the
window. There's three little wolves.

659
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Isn't it funny how that moment when
something you never seen before,

660
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,540
you see it and it takes you a second
to realize what it is and then you,

661
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,690
the word for what it is comes
to your head right away.

662
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,290
Like you knew it was a coyote even
though you've never really seen a coyote

663
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:31,370
before. I was in denial. He was in
denial. Yeah. I was thinking it was a dog.

664
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,900
Like it was three dogs.

665
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,190
Then I had to pull over
and I'm like, I remember

666
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,140
people telling me they'd seen coyotes,

667
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,570
but I thought it was like
I saw a mountain lion.

668
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,810
Like if some of these I saw a mountain
and you're like Holy Shit you did.

669
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,410
That's pretty rare, right?
Have you ever seen one? No,

670
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:52,280
I've seen to a live. Yeah. See two
live ones like out there. Yeah.

671
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,530
And what happened? One of them ain't
my dog cause when I lived in Colorado,

672
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,780
yeah. And you was right there. No, no, no.

673
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,830
I was this mountain lion was
case in the house I think. Right.

674
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,930
And we saw it in the woods
at one point in time.

675
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:10,000
And then another one I saw in Santa
Barbara in Montecito driving through a

676
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:13,990
neighborhood and saw this
animal run across the car
in front of the lights and I

677
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:17,650
saw its tail and I was like, Holy
Shit, that's a cat. I take it back.

678
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:21,100
I have seen some outlines really,
you know, phase on love. Yeah.

679
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,270
He moves all over the place. But
one time he lived in San Diego,

680
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:29,110
me and Hugh more went to visit him
and we is at his house hanging out.

681
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,980
And then at night he was like, look
out the window in his backyard.

682
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,090
And there was like mountain
lions in his fucking backyard.

683
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:41,710
Yeah. There was like two or three of
them and all I'm thinking is like,

684
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,740
how the fuck are we going
to get to the car? Oh, like,

685
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:50,400
and he was so casual about it
and I was like, wow. Yeah. Yeah.

686
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,050
It's time to move son. Yeah. Um, Jamie,

687
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,920
did you ever see that video from Colorado
where a guy looked out his window?

688
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,020
There was three mountain
lions on his driveway.

689
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,100
He's like super clear iPhone footage
and this guy a or android phone,

690
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,190
I don't know. I want to
use, could be an android.

691
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,810
He was saying this weekend he takes more
shit for using an android phone than

692
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,644
for being a Vegan,

693
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:17,490
for being a black Vegan and
what else can media could be.

694
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:22,620
Yeah, yeah. You get more grief
forever than android phone. Yeah.

695
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,680
It's a weird little battle. Right. It's
like Republican, Democrat type Shit.

696
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,130
Yeah, it is. It is like people with
iPhone really ain't trying to have it,

697
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,770
but it's not just that.
It's like there's teams.

698
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,770
It's like the fucking Orioles were
playing the Yankees. You know,

699
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,300
people get on a Goddamn team and the
iPhones are the Yankees right now.

700
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,410
It's weird. Band phone. The
phone thing is a weird thing.

701
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,420
It's weird that people are so,
they're, they're really like so tribal.

702
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,440
But their tribal with their phone.
Yeah. They made a tribe out of phones.

703
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,240
People could make a tribe out of anything.

704
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,110
[inaudible] and what's really
crazy is the biggest company,

705
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,860
the ones that's the most desirable is
a company that also makes computers and

706
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,580
they, they make their own chip.
They make their own hardware. Right?

707
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,820
Like that's what's really strange
about apple. Like they make everything,

708
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,740
they make the software, they
make the hardware. They the only,

709
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,760
there's only one, you'll have different
models, but there's only an iPhone.

710
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,790
You get an iPhone or XR,
whatever the fuck it is.

711
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,350
X Excess Max. But it's only an iPhone.
That's all you get. You don't get it.

712
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,950
You don't get anything else.
Whereas android you got

713
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,090
of brands. See the so much
variety everybody. Yeah,

714
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,840
but truth rough. Jamie's like
that. But you gotta have,

715
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,980
you gotta be able to deal with that
green when the green light comes in and

716
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,310
protects them. I was
offended by the green bubble.

717
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,740
I have friends that I go up on the
little screen. Even smart people,

718
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:56,270
I'm like, we've got them
on. They fucking green.

719
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,740
But maybe if they're smart and your
bubble comes a green, it means something.

720
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,840
It doesn't look green to
them. That's a thing. Yeah.

721
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:08,420
Mine and is pretty cool looking.
Yeah. All my Texas, when they come in

722
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,410
like they're all, what do they look
like? Is there a show you see a prophecy?

723
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,920
Well, I think mine minor.
Oh, they're blue. Yeah. Blue.

724
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,390
So here's come in blue anyway, so it looks
blue. What? Do you have a note? Yeah,

725
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:27,200
a galaxy note note nine. Yeah.
That's the Shit I have no, those,

726
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,790
that's my other phone. Yeah, he told
me. Yeah. That thing is bad ass. Yeah.

727
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,560
It is a beast of a phone.
That screen is amazing. Yeah.

728
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,660
It's so big and you like you get
the whole screen, there's no cutout.

729
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,550
Yeah. And it goes down the side and shit.

730
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,260
But I got it just in case like I'm on a
flight and I want to watch something on

731
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:47,570
it or just somewhere you want
to watch something on it,

732
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:50,990
you download it and you gotta have a
full screen instead of having like a

733
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,770
getting the iPad on top of that
because people have just too much shit.

734
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,820
Do you ever use the pen though?
That pen is useless to me. Yeah.

735
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,730
I would just like, like signed
the document today. Like yeah,

736
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,170
like Shaundra needed a w nine
signed a w nine form from me.

737
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,820
I just like downloaded it, signed
it and then emailed it back. Wow.

738
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,550
Yeah. I've never used it.
Yeah. Maybe it's just me.

739
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,140
I draw dicks on people's head.
That's a perfect use for it.

740
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:22,490
But I also feel like a rebel when
I use my android phone. I do.

741
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,650
It's hilarious. I feel like a
rebel fucking, I'm crazy man.

742
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,810
Fucking trans out here. Woo.
When do you use your android?

743
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:37,400
Like, like, so you'll have your iPhone.
So when do you need more? More often?

744
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:41,020
I'm transition out of one phone number
to another, which I have to do often. Oh,

745
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:45,170
okay. Yeah. So you have two different
numbers? Yeah. Okay. Getting used to it.

746
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,470
Play. I played with it a lot. They
got a new one that's coming out.

747
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,340
There's a new ones coming out that looks
amazing. Do you have 10? No. 10 yeah,

748
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:56,810
it's coming out like in a couple of
weeks. Yeah. I try to hold on to it.

749
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,770
I don't try to get every new phone.
I try to hold onto it for a minute.

750
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:05,771
So I feel like they didn't rip me off
and then maybe three or two phones later,

751
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,170
then I'll get the other one. But
if I buy every phone, I feel like

752
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,250
I want to be a rebel
within the rebel, you know?

753
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,950
He's saying I'll get some old
shit. Yeah. I got some old shit.

754
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,290
You're not gonna get me like
in this loop. But just buying,

755
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:22,610
buying by comparison. Yeah. That's
in a weird thing. Like that phone,

756
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,480
they could stop right there. That
phone's perfect. Like it does everything.

757
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:30,180
Yeah. What more do I need? They
take some pictures, makes videos,

758
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,950
get on the Internet, ask you questions,

759
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,090
gives me answers, send emails.
What the fuck else do I need?

760
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,910
Don't you don't you don't.

761
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,840
It does everything unless they come up
with some new shit. But if someone said,

762
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,630
Hey Ian, I'll give you $1 million,

763
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:49,560
but you gotta use that phone only for
the rest of your life. What'd you say?

764
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,350
Yes. This one? Yes. That's crazy, right?

765
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,550
Yeah, the breaks. We'll replace
it, but that's your phone forever.

766
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,010
I know it. I know it will slow down.

767
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,990
Well apple phones will slow down because
they engineered them and that made me

768
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:10,470
sick. That almost made me stop
using apple stuff. I was like,

769
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,180
I can't believe that you
guys are attributing this
to battery life that that's

770
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:18,780
in disingenuine. Then they admitted
it, right? Well they admitted it,

771
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:23,100
but they said they did it so that it would
give you more battery life cause your

772
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:26,500
battery degrades over time. So they
engineered it. That is a convenient,

773
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,420
they also must have understood that people
were going to get frustrated with the

774
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:33,750
fact that it's slowed down considerably
and they would give them an incentive to

775
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,630
buy a new phone to say that they
didn't say that like, come on,

776
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,020
you guys are so God damn smart. You make
iPhones. They figured out everything.

777
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:43,710
Yeah, but not that you didn't figure that
out. You figured that out on purpose.

778
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,060
You also are one of the most
successful businesses of all time.

779
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,680
Apple has billions of dollars
cash just sitting there.

780
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,510
They have so much money.
Pablo Escobar buried money.

781
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,280
They got so much money.

782
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,670
Apple is something like how many billions
of dollars is apple has 225 billion.

783
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,850
Apple has so much cash
cash that they could,

784
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,610
they could probably
wipe out half our debt.

785
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,840
This is what they could buy right now
and still have 25 billion leftover.

786
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,130
They could buy Nike, Ferrari, Twitter,

787
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,990
the Manchester United Franchise and
the Manchester United football team and

788
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,390
still have a, how much
left? 25 billion left.

789
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,130
I say football for people like yourself
that are fishing up. Thank you sir.

790
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,690
I didn't say soccer. I appreciate
that. Do they say soccer? Um,

791
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,610
where are you from originally? Uh,
in England? Yeah. No, not in England.

792
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,370
And they know it's football. Yeah.
Only in America they say soccer.

793
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,720
But before that, like where did it,

794
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,660
where did it become football?
Was it always football in Europe?

795
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,570
It was always football. Well
why, why when it came over here,

796
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,150
did it switch over? No idea.

797
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,750
Why didn't they come up with another
name for Pho? We ever kick a foot.

798
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,000
Paul, I think, I think they were
playing football, like the soccer,

799
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:04,834
football,

800
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,350
and then somebody picked up the ball
and started running with it and they

801
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:11,620
started tackling each other. Like
I heard some story like that. Huh?

802
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,580
And then they kind of created
football and it evolved from there.

803
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,310
But then they never changed the name.

804
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,910
Isn't it weird that like football is
called football when the only person who

805
00:47:21,911 --> 00:47:23,910
kicks it is a guy who
can't even play the game,

806
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,350
the least significant person on the team
as far as getting pussy when there's a

807
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:32,350
championship. Yes. It is weird. Yeah.

808
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,840
And you're not allowed
to hit him. Right, right.

809
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:38,200
And you're not allowed to hit him.
Yeah. That's crazy. You can hit him.

810
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:42,790
It's not while he's in motion of his, a
vulnerable person to try to be safe. Oh,

811
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:46,210
so you can't hit them all once. Legs up
in the area. Oh, that's so ridiculous.

812
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,330
What a bitch house rule.
If you blow off the ball,

813
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,310
you have to block the ball
and then you get hit him yet.

814
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,100
But in the crazy that that's football.

815
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,530
It's only one time it gets kicked.
Right. How was that football? Why? Why?

816
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:02,260
What a silly name. Right.
Does it make sense?

817
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,770
But I'm not mad at it. You know,
it's like fine. It's whatever.

818
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,150
Imagine if they called, you know,
baseball, what would they call it?

819
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,590
Foul. If they called it
foul. We're playing foul.

820
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,180
It's something that
happens every now and then.

821
00:48:16,181 --> 00:48:18,610
This game has nothing to do
with running around the basis.

822
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,750
It's about touchdowns. She'd call
it touchdown play. Touchdown it.

823
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,700
Cause it's just, you know, baseball.

824
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,700
It's just like we're trying to
get from base to base. Yeah.

825
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,360
If they call it baseball touchdown.
No, they call it football. Touchdown.

826
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,260
Touchdown. The NTL national
touchdown league. We're going to,

827
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:36,910
we're going to play
touchdown. That's the game.

828
00:48:36,911 --> 00:48:38,110
It's not football with your foot.

829
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:41,470
Doesn't have shit to do with it or an
explanation of why we call it soccer and

830
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,640
it's more confusing than
we care to go through.

831
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,830
When you go back to England,

832
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,890
if you're from England and you
talking about it to people,

833
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,370
do they resent the term soccer? Like
how does that work? Some people do.

834
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:56,950
Like I used to present the
term soccer. Really? Yeah.

835
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,670
But I live here and it's like get
over it. You know what I'm saying?

836
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,570
As a person, I got to get over it cause
it was my favorite sport growing up,

837
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,370
so I just got over it. And then now I
even call it soccer. My podcast is soccer.

838
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:12,320
I don't even say football, but
when I go to England I just, Oh,

839
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,300
just when I'm around
football, soccer people,

840
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,570
I say football, I get
it. Yeah. It's like if I,

841
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,530
if I was talking to someone that they
wanted to talk about pool but they wanted

842
00:49:22,531 --> 00:49:24,580
to call it bumper pool. Okay.

843
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,620
The woman's World Cup,

844
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,120
they won the World Cup and a
United States did for soccer and,

845
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,560
but it's not, you know, it's football
to people like yourself World Cup.

846
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,370
Like how can they call the
world cup soccer to a piece
to one country that gives

847
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:46,150
the least amount of flux about the
sport right now. Weird. That's weird.

848
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:49,570
That's the power of America. That's crazy.
If you really stop to think about it,

849
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:52,170
we made them change the name of
their thing, but we're like, ah,

850
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,230
we're not going to get in there. We'll
call it soccer. Okay. We're a card of it,

851
00:49:56,231 --> 00:49:58,000
but we're calling it this, they call it,

852
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,410
did they call it football in like
Argentina? Yeah. Okay. Everywhere.

853
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,380
Futball you know,

854
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,430
but it's football to start their
pronunciation and spelling of it.

855
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,170
But then Australia, they're the
rebels. The rebels. Oh yeah.

856
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,600
They have their own rules.

857
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,660
They have structure and the rules flip
all they changed the rules for more

858
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:19,390
ruggedness. Yeah. Cause they're too.
You know what? It was over there.

859
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:24,070
They were too used to rugby. Like
those New Zealand savages. Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,650
They're fucking savage. You can't play
that bitch ass game when a helmet,

861
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,220
these guys are running around biting
each other in the Dick and the scrums.

862
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,890
Right. That's the most
rugged game. Anything to win.

863
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,710
That's the game they
should play in America.

864
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,220
All the CTE problems they're having you.
You'd have a little bit of that with,

865
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,760
with anything. Contact Sports,

866
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,750
you're going to get injuries [inaudible]
but I think you'd have less with no

867
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,830
gear. So both those things confuse me.

868
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,640
I don't know the difference between
rugby on Australian rules football and I

869
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:55,670
think in Australia they
play both. Yes. Yes.

870
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,680
I'd be just confused like what is the
difference? Well the ball's different,

871
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,580
right? They both seem like,
what's a rugby ball look like?

872
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,730
Literally look about the
same. Is it? No different.

873
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,850
Not Note at there is slight differences,
but they look about the same.

874
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:14,180
It's like a football with more rounded
edges and it's a little more plump as far

875
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:16,940
as I know. They could be playing with a
round ball. I literally don't even know.

876
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,310
Yeah, I have no idea what a
rug now it's kind of like,

877
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,470
it kind of looks like
an American. That's it.

878
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,730
That's a cross between a basketball and
a football. It's like a fat football.

879
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,590
Yeah. So that's an Australian use football
though. It's similar to a rugby ball.

880
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,770
Okay. So that's not a foot
rugby ball, but it's close.

881
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,010
So there's probably like
football, Australian rules,

882
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:41,930
football and then rugby ball. Right. What
is the rules? What can they do? Yeah.

883
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:43,040
What are they doing different?

884
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,870
It's also sometimes referred to in
the media as the round ballgame.

885
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,680
The world game and international football.

886
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,070
Australian was football referred
to as Australian football. Hmm.

887
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,640
I think that's a little more like fluid.

888
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:02,030
Like the game does stop as much as less
stoppages to kind of just keep going.

889
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:02,451
Okay.

890
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,990
It says it's a little more fluid where
players can pretty much run around where

891
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:09,890
they choose. They still have a
specific end side goal to score,

892
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:11,570
but it's more open in between.

893
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:16,040
Another main differences that the
game is played in 20 minute quarters,

894
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:19,250
not halves. Hmm. I was trying,
I told you a couple while ago,

895
00:52:19,251 --> 00:52:22,610
they're adding three verse
three basketball to the
Olympics coming up and the

896
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:25,730
way that that game is played is so
different than traditional basketball.

897
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,670
Like it's just a running clock.
Once you score you just take it out,

898
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:31,870
throw it background across the line,
go score again, it's very fast paced.

899
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:36,200
So they bring in like pock ball
to the Olympics? I think so.

900
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,910
It apparently it's very popular in Europe.

901
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:40,400
It's not like that big three
basketball that sort of started here.

902
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:41,780
It's not that same basketball,

903
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,530
but it's popular I guess
when will Harris was in here.

904
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:48,560
Will Harris has this a show
called anatomy of a fighter.

905
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:53,770
He's a videographer and he went to
Dagestan to watch Khabib. Norman Madoff,

906
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,630
who's the UFC lightweight champion
who's fucking animal man. He just,

907
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,720
he's one of the rare undefeated top
of the food chain fighters in MMA.

908
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,160
They play a game of basketball in Dagestan
where they don't dribble the ball at

909
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:09,680
all. They just like wrestle
each other to the ground.

910
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,660
And even choke each other and get each
other in armbars and shit so that they're

911
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,510
just practicing Jujitsu. Yeah,
there will look. They don't,

912
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:21,680
they don't dribble it all.
They're basically playing
like ball a football type,

913
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,320
but they're shooting at the basketball
hoop but they throw each other to the

914
00:53:25,321 --> 00:53:28,320
ground. And Khabib, we'll fucking
hip toss dudes cause they,

915
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,690
they have it right next
to the wrestling mats.

916
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,050
So part of what they filmed was he was
in a wrestling match with this dude when

917
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:37,950
they were trying to take a player out.

918
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,730
So he's grabbed a hold of this dude
and when he grabs a hold as dude,

919
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:45,510
he drags him to the ground and get
him it back, gets him in a harm bar,

920
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:47,610
gets them in a rear
naked choke. It's crazy.

921
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,850
Macy guy tap and he doesn't let him
up. Like here it goes, look, look.

922
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:55,680
He grabs them like they're allowed
to do this. The guy slips through,

923
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,230
he gets them, they're
grappling. First of all,

924
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,920
they're grappling on the fucking hardwood
floor, full blast glock grappling.

925
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,900
And then he takes him to the
ground. Like this is serious.

926
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:06,300
This isn't playing around.
He takes the dudes back.

927
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,710
Now they're on the floor again.

928
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,140
They're on the hardwood floor and
he's fucking choking them out.

929
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:13,740
Just kind of McGregor them and then
they keep going and as they keep going,

930
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,160
he's getting the guy in an armbar
later. This is, this is this,

931
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,620
this is basketball for white dudes
that can't dribble. That's all.

932
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:27,180
This is just like how do
we, but I don't know man.

933
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,740
I think this is the most effective
way to use wrestling with basketball.

934
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,240
I think they just wanted to make something
that's like a really hard workout

935
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:38,160
that's very competitive. I think I,

936
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,520
I don't know if other people are doing
this in Europe or if this is just

937
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:44,610
something that Dagestan
figured out, but look,

938
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:48,720
these are some of the most savage
fighters in the UFC. It does look fun.

939
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,870
It looks fun. As far as, yeah, I assume
I should get Khabib on your back.

940
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,310
They just don't have access to a very
good basketball and pump to keep it pumped

941
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:58,320
up on the floor is probably
not good to be dribbled on.

942
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:00,630
So they just figured out a better game
to play instead of dealing with that

943
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,180
fucked up on court. That's a
ridiculous way to think. Jamie.

944
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:05,370
These are world class fighters.
They travel over the world.

945
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:08,550
They have all sorts of gym equipment,
they have mats, they have weights,

946
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,290
they have everything skin on it.

947
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,080
That's a shitty basketball played
with lots of basketballs in my life.

948
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:16,650
You would never even try to dribble that
missing line to another like American

949
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:20,850
football slash Jujitsu. Slash Ben.

950
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,010
A lot of balls to like if you
have a dead spot on a court,

951
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:25,560
you almost don't want to play on it.
But dude, they could get another ball.

952
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:28,710
They all have brand new sneakers
on and leggings and shit.

953
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,290
I mean it's not like DAC stands
in the middle of nowhere.

954
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,110
I don't get goods there. They could, but
they might just like this game better.

955
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,570
They're just like, fuck it. We're playing
this cause we're all better at this.

956
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,580
That I think, I think it helps them.

957
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,180
I'm saying that your leg made you
go one on one with the basket.

958
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,520
Maybe I did not understand
the rules. They make them up.

959
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,830
You said it was like I was swearing
for no reason. Oh, they're there.

960
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,690
Like they're, they're
talking out a dispute. Yeah.

961
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:53,940
How would you argue with Cabebe? You can,

962
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:58,560
that's the top dog as the beast
of the fucking crew. Um, but yeah,

963
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:03,030
which it's weird with what people
that get really into, like cricket,

964
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,960
cricket is one that the Europeans
brought over to India, right.

965
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,750
They brought it to the western days.

966
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,270
They brought it to any country that they
colonize and all those countries love

967
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:14,220
it and they play it. Oh.

968
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,480
So it's a colonization game and
then nowadays you have like,

969
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,710
almost like the equivalent of like world
cups of cricket and all the countries.

970
00:56:22,711 --> 00:56:23,680
Australia is a big

971
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,140
cricket country because they in that,

972
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:31,060
so it's a big thing of west in these and
everything. Strange looking game too.

973
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,520
Right? It's just boring. Takes,

974
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:38,800
takes days to play sometimes
days. Yeah. Days. Yeah.

975
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,190
For a week I think sometimes.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, one game. Yeah.

976
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,050
How many hours a day? Long. Too many.
Oh my God. It's too many, man. I,

977
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:52,300
I, I used to kill me. It was fun
to play in a backyard because it's,

978
00:56:52,301 --> 00:56:55,930
you can just get some sticks and stick
them in the ground and then put one

979
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:59,920
across the top as a wicked. This
is a game I would have no idea.

980
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,940
I couldn't even draw you a picture
of what the stick looks like.

981
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,630
Three sticks, three sticks, three sticks.

982
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:11,740
And then you put like one on top across
the, all of them send out when the,

983
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,190
you're out when the guy who's pitching
or Bolan and you swing in or if you don't

984
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:20,860
swing and it hits the wicked
and they knock over a comp,

985
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:23,710
kinda like bowling sticks,
then you're out. But yeah,

986
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,730
and then you get points that you hit
it. Trying to protect the wicked,

987
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,820
protect the wicked and hit it so far
that you can run from stick to stick.

988
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,830
You and your partner who's
batting at the other end,

989
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,010
and then the most amount of runs you
can get that just adds to the score.

990
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,170
Can I see that? I want to see
that. That sounds so weird.

991
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,250
Pull up a video of dudes playing cricket
like I've ever watched it go. Yeah,

992
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,760
I think I've seen like
highlights on television maybe.

993
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,980
You know it's funny that you never
seen cricket. Not a fucking get no,

994
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:01,670
no chance. I don't know. See I'm
already stunned by their outfits. Yeah.

995
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,900
Got An have nothing on. Some
dudes are covered up in gear.

996
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,860
Those that are that the guys with the
helmets cause the ball is hot as fuck.

997
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:13,320
I got hit by a cricket ball by the
strongest kid in school on time. Oh.

998
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,780
Then as I come down the way they
throw it, this was so weird.

999
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,850
Well I like the guys in the outfield
don't have anything cause I just catch the

1000
00:58:20,851 --> 00:58:22,470
ball bare handed, right?
Yeah. Bare handed. Yeah.

1001
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,970
And I feel like they should have met.
He throws it, he runs at you [inaudible]

1002
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,650
he runs and literally tries
to hit you with the ball.

1003
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,420
That's crazy. And then does it have to
hit the ground first? Is that the deal?

1004
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,530
Yeah, I think, yeah it does. It does.

1005
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,650
From what I remember
because it seems like it,

1006
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,790
but the dude like runs across the
line. This is a bullshit game.

1007
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,860
Some 100% bullshit game. Like, I don't,

1008
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:52,180
I'm not a big fan of baseball.
I used to be like, yeah,

1009
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:56,610
I think it's kind of boring. My wrestling
coach used to say, it's not a sport,

1010
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,670
it's a skills game to skills
game. It's not a sport.

1011
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:02,760
You ever see a baseball path so
fucking tired. He had to push himself.

1012
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:06,570
I had to push coach Murphy
wrestling coach in high school.

1013
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,380
Also the same guy tried to get me to
play football when I weighed 135 pounds.

1014
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,760
Crazy ass all. Yeah, maybe saw some
natural athlete Shit in, you know,

1015
00:59:14,761 --> 00:59:17,940
I just thought it was mean. Oh yeah.
That was mean. I'd been to be good.

1016
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:21,980
Those mean I don't know the wrestler
because you put them in a great

1017
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,700
safety. Probably just fucking
people up. I would get crippled.

1018
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,790
That's what would have happened. The
dude on our team, his name is Bob Baker,

1019
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:33,230
he weighed a good solid 300
pounds, so big. Maybe not,

1020
00:59:33,231 --> 00:59:36,320
maybe I'm exaggerating, but he was two
50 he was our heavyweight and I was like,

1021
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:37,920
how? How is he and me?

1022
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,120
How are we going to play the same
game where he could just run me over?

1023
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,080
What did he want you to play? I Dunno.
We didn't even, just didn't get that far.

1024
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,090
I'm like, you're crazy. I
was already fighting too.

1025
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:50,450
I was doing martial arts and wrestling
at the same time like, look man, I can't,

1026
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:53,960
I don't know. I'm not doing that. I'm
already doing shit. That freaks me out.

1027
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,270
Physical shit scares the
shit out of me all the time.

1028
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,100
I don't want to get scared
by even bigger people.

1029
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,360
At least martial arts and wrestling
was confined to your own weight class.

1030
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:06,170
You know if I had a wrestle
some Badass dude, at least, uh,

1031
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,890
it was my own weight
class, you know? Yeah.

1032
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,890
This is like the weight scale is all over
the place on the football field. Yeah,

1033
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:16,730
man. It's all over the place and the
athleticism is all over the place too.

1034
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,570
You know, you can get a guide
like Hershel Walker and you know,

1035
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:23,390
if you're in high school and there's a
Herschel Walker in high school and he's

1036
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:27,410
on some team that your opposing
good luck, fuck face this,

1037
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:32,570
this people that are just
superior, just superior.

1038
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,580
It's not a damn thing you can do about it.

1039
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:38,990
There are people like that in martial
arts, like when you're all wrestling.

1040
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:43,130
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's things
like that and outliers. You know,

1041
01:00:43,131 --> 01:00:47,990
there's outliers in all sports and a
lot of it has to do with what you did

1042
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:48,824
growing up.

1043
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,870
Sometimes people do things grown up
like a lot of wrestlers turns out like

1044
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:59,020
working on farms as a kid is a great
way for wrestlers to be super strong.

1045
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,880
You know who's who make good restless
cowboys. Oh yeah. Because they, they,

1046
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:08,840
they, you know, they stare at their,
get the cow fucking cow to the ground.

1047
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:11,510
They do it all the time. They practice
on them. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

1048
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,870
We'll also, they're tough cause
you're gonna get banged up a lot.

1049
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:18,050
And then a lot of it is like
mental toughness, you know,

1050
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:20,960
but people who have to cat, like
there's a dude, Matt Hughes,

1051
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:25,070
he was like one of the greatest Walter
wards of all time and he was ungodly

1052
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:29,390
strong dude from Illinois on the
farm on a farm wrestling animals.

1053
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,670
I was at a party one time, right?

1054
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:35,540
I was at a party one time and he was
thrown by these rappers I used to write on

1055
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:38,090
this show. There's this
lounge. So one of the rappers,

1056
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:42,260
master fool dude from Brooklyn was friends
with these cowboy. It's a great name,

1057
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:45,020
master fans. The fool, he
was dope to me. He's like,

1058
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:49,070
he's like the flavor flavor of the,
the up the rappers for that group.

1059
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,590
And he's just like, he's
just talks to everybody.

1060
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:53,390
So he became friends with these cowboys.

1061
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:58,130
They came to visit La for a week and live
in the house with the rappers and you

1062
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,630
know, they were real
cowboys. They're like,

1063
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:01,970
have that last Sue's out on
the set and shit like that.

1064
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,150
So then at the party,

1065
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,250
this black dude with dreads got into a
argument with one of the cowboys and be

1066
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:11,630
like, we're not gonna fight in the house.

1067
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:16,631
So everybody walks around the corner
to the street and in five seconds that

1068
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,190
cowboy had the black dude

1069
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,220
with dreads tied up with his pants,

1070
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,730
just this tucked like twisty tied his body

1071
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,190
and had him on the ground bleeding
Jesus. And then it was like, all right,

1072
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,540
let him up and let's start again.

1073
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,630
And he got up and he just did it to
the black dude again. And I was like,

1074
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:40,350
I'll never fuck with a cowboy
if, if a cowboy is a wrestler,

1075
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,770
like if he knows how to Russel
too. Both of those things. Yes,

1076
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,330
wrestlers are so God damn strong.

1077
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:50,010
You don't realize until they grab you and
then you realize how helpless you are.

1078
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:54,000
So weird feeling. And even if you,
you can wrestle if you'd like.

1079
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,620
I wasn't a good wrestler in high
score, but I made it to the states.

1080
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,230
And, uh, I remember when, uh,

1081
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:04,770
I was wrestling this kid who eventually
became friends with, cause he's,

1082
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:06,450
he used to come to nautilus plus,

1083
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,750
which was a place where I was teaching
taekwondo and we ran into each other when

1084
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:14,070
we were both like 20, like
probably 20 or something like that.

1085
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:17,220
It was really cool. It was a really
nice guy. His name is Murphy too.

1086
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,020
I don't remember his first
name. It might've been,

1087
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,390
that might've been his first name.
A lot of Irish people named Murphy,

1088
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,040
like the most common name
amongst Irish people probably.

1089
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:30,390
But uh, I was like doing pretty
good in like regional shit.

1090
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,850
But this guy got ahold of
me and I was like, fuck.

1091
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,550
She just made me realize like this
is another level of wrestling.

1092
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,400
He had been wrestling all of his life.
I'd only been doing it for a year.

1093
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,780
He just ragdoll on me around. I was
like fuck. And he wasn't even like,

1094
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:45,720
like a champion. Yeah. I
don't think he won the states.

1095
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,690
And then whoever did win the
states didn't win the nationals.

1096
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,820
So it was like there's
this like tears to evals.

1097
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:54,510
And then like a national high school
champion Ain't shit compared to a division

1098
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:58,410
one NCAA Amir, all
American college wrestler,

1099
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:02,940
those college wrestlers are off the chain
and then they ain't shit compared to

1100
01:04:02,941 --> 01:04:06,120
like Jordan burrows. It's not that
they're not shit. I shouldn't,

1101
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,290
I never say that about,

1102
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:11,910
I mean just saying that in comparison
because I admire them almost more than any

1103
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:15,300
other athlete because there's no
professional venue for what they do.

1104
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:19,590
One of the more amazing
things about wrestling is the
go into it knowing there's

1105
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:22,440
no professional sport. There's
no perfect other than, you know,

1106
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,390
pro wrestling is different.
It's, it's entertainment,

1107
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,920
but there's no professional, 135
pound wrestling, 180 pound rep,

1108
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,380
there's not an that. They just love it.

1109
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,600
They just love it and it's the
toughest thing to do physically.

1110
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,800
They're fucking animals.

1111
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,110
But then when you get to the top
of the top of the food chain,

1112
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:39,960
like a multiple time world
champion like Jordan burrows,

1113
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:45,230
he had a wrestling match with Ben Aspirin
and he just ran him over just over.

1114
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,510
And Ben is one of the best
grapplers to ever compete in MMA.

1115
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:52,950
And he was also a two time Olympian.
The rest of them. Yes. And that guy,

1116
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,360
he ran him over and Ben asked her and
runs most people over when he wrestles

1117
01:04:57,361 --> 01:05:01,060
with them. Yeah. Levels, levels, levels.

1118
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:06,330
It's never ends with speaking Avastin.
Is he awake? He's awake. We can talking.

1119
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:09,360
He's a, he handled it
like a champion. Yeah.

1120
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:14,090
He a went on a Ariel Helwani show and
talked about it and just said that, yeah,

1121
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:19,100
it sucks that the guy's a douchebag if
you're feeling like sucks losing to him.

1122
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,920
Uh, you know, I don't like them. He said,
uh, you know, he just, what can he do?

1123
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,330
He's like, he's not going to read
the comments and he's a smart guy.

1124
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,380
He's a very smart guy. But uh,

1125
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,160
he took it like a man to be able to go
and do an interview right after you get

1126
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:36,310
knocked out like that. It's very
admirable, but that's who he is.

1127
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,190
That's how you get to be a guy
who says good or wrestlers.

1128
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:41,860
A guy like Ben Aspirin who
can handle a loss like that.

1129
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,110
The what do you think of
the, I forgot the, I can't,

1130
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,640
I can't pronounce the guy's name. Who
beat him? Jorge Mossville Mazda doll.

1131
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:50,290
What he said after the fight,

1132
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,160
but he said he would smack him if
he saw him at whole foods. I think,

1133
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:58,070
I think it's just a little
too much. You want I, I can't,

1134
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:02,350
I don't know the history. The
history is rough. Excuse me.

1135
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,290
It's like 10 years of them, uh,

1136
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,170
given him a hard time of if
Ben asked her and given miles.

1137
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,310
But all according to
Mossville lot of talking shit,

1138
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,260
which some people think is
friendly in Moundsville street.

1139
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:19,090
Jesus doesn't fuck around. All
right. You want to talk shit.

1140
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,310
You want to talk shit just street Jesus.

1141
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,610
He will fucking make fun of you after we
flat lines here. And that's what I did.

1142
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,980
He flatlined them in five seconds,

1143
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:30,640
made them the fastest Evekeo in UFC
history and then mocked him afterwards and

1144
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:33,640
said he would smack him if he
saw him in whole foods. But see,

1145
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:37,510
we're talking about it. So
Mazda dollars smart. This is a,

1146
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,590
this is amazing marketing
ploy, right? I mean, he's,

1147
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,710
he's become in one fight the most talked
about fighter in the sport because he

1148
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:50,200
did something in the sport that's been
around for a little bit that nobody's

1149
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:52,690
ever done before. Yeah.
Ben Asker was undefeated,

1150
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:57,880
undefeated and Mazda doll comes out flat
lines like that and talk some pretty

1151
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:02,170
vicious shit after the fact and even
mimicked him laying on the floor,

1152
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:07,360
which looks scary the way he
was out. Yeah. Mazda doll.

1153
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,970
We'll say a calls out easy. Conor
McGregor. I want to break his face. Yeah,

1154
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,580
that would be, that's a rough fight.

1155
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:19,810
That's a rough fight for Conor Moz Woodall
was a big fellow too. I mean, he's,

1156
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,750
he really belongs at one 70
that's where he's fighting.

1157
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,760
He fought at one 55 but really tortured
himself to make that weight. All right.

1158
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,813
He's a big guy.

1159
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,720
You're talking about a guy who knocked
out cowboys Serone knocked out Darren

1160
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,630
tail, knocked out Ben Aspirin. I mean,

1161
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,750
he's knocking out big welterweights
big Darren tills a big welterweight.

1162
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:45,820
He's big. He's not a guy
coming up from 155 pounds.

1163
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:49,960
He's never making 0050505155 so yeah.

1164
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:54,961
So he's one way class a heavier and he's
really running into like the last few

1165
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,760
fights. He's, he's coming into his own.

1166
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:01,450
These are really becoming something
special. He had a real close uh,

1167
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,480
decision loss to Wonderboy.

1168
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,150
Wish I could remember
how that fight went down.

1169
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,310
I D I just think it was a decision,

1170
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:11,740
I don't know if it was a split
decision or you now know this decision,

1171
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:13,990
but I think it was just
wonderful outpointed them.

1172
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,050
I don't think there was any
knockdowns or anything Mazda though.

1173
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Yeah that was Mossville but Wonderboy
is a particularly difficult guy to fight

1174
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,350
and especially for three rounds.

1175
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,460
Pedis recently knocked him out but a pet
is just hit him with the perfect punch

1176
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,710
and that can happen to
anybody. And Pedis timed it.

1177
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:33,800
And Pedis is a beast as
wild. Yeah. He's a wild man.

1178
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:37,470
He's a fantastic fighter. Like
losing to him it's like, yeah,

1179
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,070
you lost to one of the best
fighters ever. And he also like,

1180
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:42,980
he's a guy who dropped Tony
Ferguson. I mean pet is knocked out.

1181
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:46,730
Cowboys Serone pet is knocked out.
Joe Lozan with his crazy head chain.

1182
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,840
That is is a monster. This is like, he'll
win one and then lose one. Yeah. Wow.

1183
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,860
It's, it's a crazy division
man. It's filled with murderers.

1184
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,300
Just murder after murder.

1185
01:08:56,301 --> 01:09:01,130
Both divisions 55 and 70 and I think
pedis is probably going to do real good at

1186
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:02,960
70 because he's healthier. You know?

1187
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:06,890
I think he went down to one 45 and it
almost killed him. It was just too much.

1188
01:09:06,891 --> 01:09:10,100
Man. He had nothing in the tank.
And then Max Holloway beat him up.

1189
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:14,570
He lost two a, I think he
lost the Charles only rera.

1190
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,560
I think so. I might be wrong. He
might've caught Charles Olivera.

1191
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:21,890
Hmm. I don't know.

1192
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,020
Pettis has the most legit
crazy look in his eye

1193
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,470
pedis one right. Choked him. Banqueting
choke him. That's right. That's right.

1194
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,790
I'm confused. He lost to someone else at
one 45 who else did he lose it to at 45

1195
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,580
Oh, Barboza was 55 Dustin. Boy,

1196
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:45,440
I don't think that was 55 and he lost
a toe that was 45. He doesn't say what

1197
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,710
he lost the Tony, right? Yes. He lost the,

1198
01:09:49,711 --> 01:09:51,680
Tony broke his hand and the
fight and he hasn't stopped,

1199
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:56,120
but it was a great fight. Wound up
dropping him. Oh, okay. So Charles Oliver,

1200
01:09:56,121 --> 01:10:01,121
Edson Barboza and then Oliveira
think that was thing that was 55.

1201
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:04,980
I think Max Holloway was 45. I
don't know man. I'm not sure though.

1202
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,560
And then he went back up to 55 the
other Dustin Pourri a fight that was,

1203
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:15,050
um, that was, he got injured
and that was at 55 catch weight.

1204
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,530
That fodder. He missed the weight.
Oh, he missed a fight with Max.

1205
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:24,830
So he's trying to get down to 45. So
featherweight debut was against Olivera.

1206
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:30,110
So he submissions Olivera submitted
ovarian is featherweight debut. Okay.

1207
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,540
So he had two fights at that weight and
that weight was torturous for him and he

1208
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:36,000
didn't make it for the
Max Hallway fight. Um,

1209
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:40,010
and then Jim Miller's definitely a 55
pound fight and all the other ones were 55

1210
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:44,220
until he got to Steven Thompson.
And that was the last one. Um,

1211
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,350
wonder boy that was uh, that
was at welterweight. Yeah. Yeah.

1212
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,370
That was an amazing fight. I mean,
so I think sometimes these guys,

1213
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,740
it's just too much,
man. It's just too much.

1214
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:59,390
He beat Michael Cassa says he beat
Cassa and caste is another one.

1215
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,480
He was fighting at 55 and
now he moved up to 70. Yeah.

1216
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:03,710
That ended up being a catch weight fight.

1217
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:06,450
He's guessing missed these
fucking guys, man. They're,

1218
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,340
they're killing themselves.
That weight cutting.

1219
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,350
Imagine if that was the case with
soccer, like before a soccer game,

1220
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,990
everybody had like, you had a certain
amount of guaranteed weight on the field.

1221
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,160
Imagine like Ian, you know, you
are whatever position it is,

1222
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:22,830
you have to cut down to
130 pounds. You'd be like,

1223
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:27,660
fuck the drain your body in a sauna.
And then everybody weighs in that.

1224
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:31,020
Everybody rehydrates and then the next
day you played as grueling ass game.

1225
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,950
That'd be ridiculous. Right?
Fighting is the most tiring thing.

1226
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,320
It would totally compromise
the game, wouldn't it?

1227
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,510
Some magic football
players had to do that.

1228
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,920
Imagine football players only had
like, okay guys, whatever the team is,

1229
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:48,570
it has to weigh 4,000 pounds. That's
it. No more. And so you have to decide,

1230
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,650
hey, you know Bob can't cut lower than
to 60 we checked his body fat Joe,

1231
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:54,600
you're going to have to
get down to one 80 Jamie

1232
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,810
when we were kids playing football we had
to weigh in and that sort of happened.

1233
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,390
We were like yeah cause a,
if you were a certain weight,

1234
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,060
like you had to have stripes on your
helmet and it means you could only play

1235
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:05,910
like on the line. You couldn't be carrying
the ball cause you'd be fucked. Nope.

1236
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:07,890
No kids could tackle
you. Fuck them all up.

1237
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:09,220
So there was like definitely a limit.

1238
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:13,270
And I remember I did have to wear the
trash bag and like cut five pounds or try

1239
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:14,730
to, I don't know fucking
know how much I weighed,

1240
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,730
but it was so I could be a tight end and
catch the ball. Cause I was a little,

1241
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:18,564
I was like on the border,

1242
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:23,560
dude, that was such so bad for
kids. I had a friend in high school,

1243
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,400
my friend Steve and he's all of his
brothers like six one, six, two,

1244
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:30,040
he's like five, six. He never grew.

1245
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,770
And there was because all throughout
high school and junior high school,

1246
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:34,420
he was cutting weight and wrestling. Dan,

1247
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:35,980
I guarantee you it had
something to do with it.

1248
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:41,010
Everyone else's family is tall or is and
he was always tired or his dad is not,

1249
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,000
he's real dad. Oh No, it was brothers
looked just like, Huh, okay. He uh,

1250
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,870
he was always tired. He'd be walking
around the hallways like this. Like uh,

1251
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,120
cause he didn't do wrestling
camps. He would do the whole thing.

1252
01:12:52,121 --> 01:12:56,560
So he's always wrestling who's
always exhausted. Always.

1253
01:12:56,890 --> 01:12:58,210
It's a terrible thing for kids.

1254
01:12:58,211 --> 01:13:02,110
The fact they still have kids do that
is fucking madness. It's madness.

1255
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,010
People didn't know any better.

1256
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,190
My parents didn't even ask me
when I got on the wrestling team,

1257
01:13:06,191 --> 01:13:07,630
they didn't have that. You're
not cutting weight, are you?

1258
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,320
They didn't even ask me. They had no
idea. Did you just listen to the coach?

1259
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,970
Coach tells you to lose
weight. You gotta lose weight.

1260
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,190
Fuck so bad for the body. It's
so bad for your brain too,

1261
01:13:18,191 --> 01:13:21,760
because dehydrates your brain
and then you're in class.

1262
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,760
You're trying to listen in
class and you're fucking,

1263
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,410
it's worse than being hung over.

1264
01:13:26,510 --> 01:13:31,510
That's true because all they tell us to
do now is drink water and stay hydrated,

1265
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,730
and then you're doing something that's,
you can't put anything in your system.

1266
01:13:36,731 --> 01:13:40,520
You're just trying to drain it out. It
doesn't affect you mentally. Yeah. Yeah.

1267
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,440
When you get dehydrated, your brain
works like shit. Right? Like they say,

1268
01:13:44,441 --> 01:13:47,500
that's one of the things that happens
to people in the desert when they start

1269
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:50,680
dying of thirst. They can't think
straight. Right. They don't,

1270
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,170
they don't make good decisions. Yeah.

1271
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:57,130
I've been fatigued like in soccer
practice and you're just like,

1272
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:01,630
you'll be wearing an opposing
player shirt and just from fatigue,

1273
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:06,580
I'll just pass it to you just to not
have to have the responsibility of this

1274
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:09,210
ball. You know what I'm saying? For Real,

1275
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:13,840
like fuck it and I'm trying to make team
at the time and I'm like making just

1276
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:18,790
blatant mistakes. I'm just so tired,
man. Yeah. Fatigue makes cowards of men,

1277
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,080
Vince Lombardi's lawn. Hey
did did that to me in college.

1278
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:23,970
Where are you falling out?

1279
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,470
I'm Greentree at all his stories
at this point in the video.

1280
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:29,770
He said he hadn't had water for like 18
hours and he's still climbing up hill

1281
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:33,910
and needs to find it. Yeah. Great. That's
insane. Well, he had to get rescued.

1282
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:36,310
I don't know if he broke his
arm. I haven't chatted with him,

1283
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:39,100
but he thinks he broke
his arm too. It is a,

1284
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:43,060
if you go to my friend Adam Green
trees, Instagram, Adam. Dot. Green Tree.

1285
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:48,270
He documented this con that he went in
for a thing called the Himalayan tar that

1286
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:52,900
lives in New Zealand and it lives
in these Alpine mountain areas. Oh,

1287
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,520
I don't know what's Alpine mountain
dangerous slippery mountain areas. And uh,

1288
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:02,580
he got stuck out there and they had to
get rescued and fell into the frozen

1289
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:05,710
glacier river and was freezing
to death. Had a climate to his,

1290
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:09,340
a sleeping bag soaking wet.
Yeah. Really dangerous.

1291
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:11,400
Fell thought he broke his arm. Yeah.

1292
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,180
Was worried that he
might have broke his leg.

1293
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,850
Did he pull out his camera and
film half of it too? Probably.

1294
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,880
I don't think he filmed much of
it. He felt filmed some of it,

1295
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,300
but he was having a really hard time and
then he had to get rescued and he had

1296
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:26,800
to go somewhere where the helicopter
could land so they could winch him and

1297
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,200
carry him up and rescue him
and take him to the hospital.

1298
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:33,280
Fucking dangerous shit. There's
a lot of these guys like Adam,

1299
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:38,490
who's a good friend of mine who loves
to go on these like visionquest solo

1300
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:40,294
adventures.

1301
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,490
So he'll go to the mountains and camp
out by himself for 28 days and he films

1302
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:46,940
and it puts it up on Instagram. Right.

1303
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:51,940
We're just talking to himself and true
like hunting elk and he's like mountain

1304
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:55,540
areas. And last year that's
his, uh, his campsite.

1305
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,710
Last year he had a one on one encounter
with a grizzly bear and he had a pistol

1306
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:01,660
with him and he's documenting him,

1307
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:04,590
trying to hold off this mama grizzly
was standing up in the background.

1308
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,050
She made several charges at him and he
didn't even know that the pistol was

1309
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:12,530
jammed. The ammunition was the
wrong size. So the lever like Ci,

1310
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,550
when you cock it, it couldn't, it
couldn't fit another bullet in there.

1311
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,230
So he had a big dummy gun. He's pointing
a gun to Sunday, even read it man.

1312
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,420
So if you pull the trigger,
nothing would have happened.

1313
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,490
So then he realized that
that was a problem when he,

1314
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:28,660
I guess he had tried to fire it a to
make sure it does work or something.

1315
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,700
So then he had to realize
that he had to put,

1316
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:34,150
he could put one bullet in the
chamber, but he couldn't reload.

1317
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:38,080
He could reload musket style.
Yeah, so he had one bullet,

1318
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,250
essentially one bullet,

1319
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:42,940
he the wrong ammo for the pistol and
you only get one shot with one of those

1320
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,540
charts. You don't even get one man.
You know when they're running at you,

1321
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:49,480
you are shitting your pants
and you can't believe it.

1322
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,330
You're going to miss half the
bullets. If you have 10 bullets,

1323
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:53,560
if you hit it once, you're lucky.

1324
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:57,790
It's madness because you're not going to
shoot when it's 10 feet away from you.

1325
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:00,550
You're going to shoot as it's
running towards you and you, you,

1326
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:04,270
I don't think you're going to be able
to hold that position. It's too crazy.

1327
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,570
What is the bear doing when
it's like making charges at him,

1328
01:17:07,571 --> 01:17:10,430
but you're not coming at him trying to
get you to get the fuck away from its

1329
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:14,390
babies. Almost always. Almost always
get the fuck away from my babies.

1330
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,620
It's almost always a woman,

1331
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,280
female bear rather protecting
their code that's there.

1332
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,160
They don't fuck around some
asshole that might be a hunter.

1333
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:26,260
He might be hunting bear. You might
want to shoot my baby. Oh yeah.

1334
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,970
They don't know. Yeah. You
might just be, you know,

1335
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:32,430
they don't think of humans as a good
thing. Humans are dangerous. Right.

1336
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,400
You know, it's not our are fucking
weird. They're predators. Yeah. I'm just,

1337
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:40,310
I'm surprised bears don't attack
humans just more often based on that.

1338
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:44,420
Like how do they distinguish
who's a hunter and who's not.

1339
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,970
They don't think of hunters as
being something they should attack.

1340
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:50,120
They think that they should get the fuck
out of there because when they see guns

1341
01:17:50,121 --> 01:17:53,390
go off and then a bowl of bullet
hits a bear right next to them,

1342
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:57,200
that bear kind of explodes and screams
and agony and falls to the ground.

1343
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:59,690
They just want to get the fuck out of
there and not have it happen to them.

1344
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,090
Right. So if they've seen
that ever in their life,

1345
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,010
they've seen a bear gets shot,

1346
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,410
which if you're in a place
where bears get hunted,

1347
01:18:06,411 --> 01:18:09,290
it's very likely that they have
seen that. They just run away.

1348
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,230
They smell people they run, they want
to get the fuck out of their bears.

1349
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:16,220
Look at humans like predators, only
in places where people hunt parents.

1350
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,840
The problem is when
people don't hunt bears,

1351
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:24,110
bears have zero fear of humans and
then bears wind up killing people.

1352
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:28,250
This is what you see in Yellowstone
because those bears are grizzly bears and

1353
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:33,251
the only place in America where you can
hunt grizzly bears is in Alaska and in

1354
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:34,731
Alaska.

1355
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:38,420
They have a different attitude and
they're starting to open up grizzly bear

1356
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:39,230
seasons.

1357
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:43,880
I think there was one that we're trying
to do in Wyoming and there might've been

1358
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:47,660
one somewhere else where they were
trying to do, they do it in Canada,

1359
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:49,880
but they recently banned
it in British Columbia,

1360
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:53,330
and the reason why they banned it is not
because the people that live near the

1361
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:55,880
grizzly bears, they're
encouraging it because these,

1362
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,400
these things are fairs coming
today and dangerous, right?

1363
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,760
It's the people that live in the
cities are the most people like this,

1364
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:05,210
the biggest population center in
British Columbia, in Vancouver, right?

1365
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:08,780
It's all urban, so that's
the giant mass of people.

1366
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,900
But the people that live like where
my friend Mike Hockridge lives,

1367
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,170
those people don't have a say. And
those are the ones who live with bears,

1368
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:15,730
right?

1369
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:20,630
They have wolves and bears all over
the place up there and the black bears,

1370
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,270
which you can hunt, those
are not even dangerous.

1371
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,670
I mean they're dangerous but not
dangerous compared to grizzlies.

1372
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:27,860
Grizzlies are fucking dangerous

1373
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,380
in those cities making those
decisions from that people,

1374
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,170
even conservative people that are animal
lovers and just don't understand what a

1375
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,060
bear is. They're not kill.

1376
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:41,180
I mean the idea is that they want to
stop trophy hunting cause you see like

1377
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:44,480
Cecil the lion, that kind of
shit. It's disgusting. And it is.

1378
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:48,050
It is a lot in a lot of ways like wanting
to go and just shoot these things just

1379
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,730
to stop them and put them on your walls.

1380
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:51,670
There's a lot of weird
shit to that that I,

1381
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,200
I totally understand your
feelings on it. I get it.

1382
01:19:54,201 --> 01:19:57,200
But the grizzly bear thing
is a different thing.

1383
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,870
There was the people that were raised
on the cartoon and they're like,

1384
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,130
stop killing these cartoons.
Yeah. The cartoon version.

1385
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,140
Not The animal that they saw growing
up today. I have no idea. Well,

1386
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,250
even in Africa,

1387
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:12,210
the exact area where
Cecil the lion was killed,

1388
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,190
they had a recently killed 200
lions because they're lions.

1389
01:20:17,191 --> 01:20:17,311
Yeah.

1390
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:21,540
Because so many lions had survived
because there was no hunting because they

1391
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:25,140
came back, they came back up.
It's a weird, it's not good.

1392
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:28,620
It's not ideal. The situation's
not ideal cause it's so,

1393
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,320
so bizarre and twisted.

1394
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,400
The animals survive because
people pay to kill them.

1395
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:41,390
That's what the African wildlife
model in these encaged areas is.

1396
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:45,720
So they have like 10,000 acres or some
shit like that. They put it in fences.

1397
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:47,730
Right, right. And then
inside those fences,

1398
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:51,060
you have zebras and giraffes and all
these different animals and you can come

1399
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:54,930
over there and pay and you can go
and hunt these animals. That's,

1400
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,810
that's a lot of the
area. So at this guy who,

1401
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:00,360
that Cecil guy who shot that lion,

1402
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:04,320
he paid like $50,000
to go and hunt a lion.

1403
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,250
And there's probably one a
day, two a day, three a day.

1404
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:11,850
So there's hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of dollars of revenue coming in.

1405
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,000
This revenue comes in for these
guys that want to kill lions,

1406
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,170
and what they do is they use it to
raise more lions and they use it to pay

1407
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:20,400
professional hunting.

1408
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,940
These people called professional hunters
are basically game wardens to keep out

1409
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:27,900
poachers and to make sure that
these animals don't get like rhinos,

1410
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:31,010
don't get their horns chopped off and
murdered just just for their horns,

1411
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:33,660
things, elephants for their
tusks, things along those lines.

1412
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:38,150
So they need to hire people to protect
against poaching. Because look,

1413
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,610
in Africa, there's a lot of people that,

1414
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,890
and especially in these areas where
they have these hunting areas,

1415
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,740
these vast rural areas,

1416
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,160
people are extremely poor and
they want animals to just to eat,

1417
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,200
and they're going to call that
poaching and they have to pee.

1418
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:52,200
So then it gets even squirrely
there, right? It's not,

1419
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,800
it's not an ideal situation by
any stretch of the imagination.

1420
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,310
But because no hunters were coming in now
because of all the bad press after the

1421
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:00,300
Cecil the lion shit,

1422
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,720
they had to kill 200 lions
because [inaudible] cause
that many like got born and

1423
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,230
grew up in because they have
a real unnatural situation
over there where they're

1424
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:13,470
breeding these lions and then
they put them in the like some,

1425
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,300
every place does it a different way.

1426
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,450
And some places are free range where
there's no fence at all. That is true.

1427
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:22,080
There's some places that are like that,
but some places it's all fenced in.

1428
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:26,660
The whole thing's fenced in. It's like
a zoo, like a fake wild fake. It's,

1429
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,100
they took the wild and they made it fake.

1430
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:33,510
Just put a fence around the wild and
then they kept introducing food and then

1431
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:37,740
they have lions that they keep in very
specific areas and they feed them and

1432
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:41,430
then they'll transport them to the middle
and then they have the hunter comes

1433
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:44,460
that day and they tell them where the
lion is and the guy goes out there, boom,

1434
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:47,820
shoots the lion. And poses
with the lion. It's perverse.

1435
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,120
It's Kinda been a perverse.
On the other hand,

1436
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,280
these animals that are in there,

1437
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,050
particularly at the antelopes and black
bucks and not knitting now Neil guy and

1438
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,760
all these crazy wild
fucking antlered creatures,

1439
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:06,340
they're in greater numbers than
they've ever been. So it's so twisted.

1440
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:09,970
It's like the numbers are so high because
people want to come in and pay to hunt

1441
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,390
them. Right? But then the numbers
are high so people can hunt them.

1442
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:18,391
It's not like so that they can keep the
whole wildlife ecology free in Rome.

1443
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:22,180
And look how vibrant Africa is now
that we've stepped in with all these

1444
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:24,640
conservation dollars. Not really. No.

1445
01:23:24,641 --> 01:23:28,570
It's fenced in and then people
drive up to a spot, get out, boom,

1446
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:31,390
take a picture to weird.
We fuck up everything.

1447
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:35,450
Great job. It's weird. Great job people.
Yeah, we're the best. I'm reading a,

1448
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:40,630
an explanation of a person that has gone
to this park in Zimbabwe to go see the

1449
01:23:40,821 --> 01:23:45,140
lions and they've done this in the past
and they went back more recently and uh,

1450
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,750
this is hilarious. Read this thing here.

1451
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:51,290
Then our hose gave us
our safety orientation.

1452
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,810
He told us to speak to
the lines in a calm voice,

1453
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,200
approached slowly and to
pet them on their backs.

1454
01:23:57,230 --> 01:24:02,120
Only then our hosts handed out
skinny sticks to each of us.

1455
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,210
He explained that if a lion
approached us in a threatening manner,

1456
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:08,750
we should switch the stick back and
forth in the grass is tracked them

1457
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,173
what?

1458
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:12,560
What will I have to eat you?

1459
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:16,400
There's a Jesus Christ that says that
they thought that they were going to go

1460
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:21,050
see like child baby cubs
in a case. Definitely not.

1461
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:23,330
They're like 18 months old almost,
you know, a little bit older.

1462
01:24:23,331 --> 01:24:26,450
They're probably short of adolescent
lions. Yeah, like this big,

1463
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:30,830
I saw this video like this a try
bound or what part of Africa,

1464
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,570
but like if a cheetah
or like a like a cat,

1465
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,070
like hunts down an animal
and kills it like these,

1466
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,190
these, these people from this tribe,

1467
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:48,460
like they track the hunt and then once
the animal or the cat kills the food,

1468
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:53,100
then they will scare off the the
cat. I saw them take it and it,

1469
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,830
and they have these little sticks. Yeah.

1470
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,130
And then the fucking cheat is
or whatever, runaway from them.

1471
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,640
And I'm like so

1472
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:04,590
crazy. I saw that. I watched a video of
that month. Someone's Instagram. Yeah.

1473
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,270
Well you gotta do what you gotta
do when you're hungry. Yeah.

1474
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,430
You take a chance then. I mean,
unless they have a really good weapon,

1475
01:25:11,431 --> 01:25:14,970
it's hard to get an antelope. You
got to get fucking close. Right.

1476
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:19,260
But a cheetah can just
chase it down. If I'm a,

1477
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:23,790
you would think it's, it's just crazy
that a human could take a Cheetah's food.

1478
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:28,470
Yeah, it is crazy. Yeah. They do it with
lions too. Yeah, they do. With spears,

1479
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:31,380
they, they, they run up on lines
with spears. I've seen that too.

1480
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:35,670
Like female lions, it's roaring at
people where they drag away their food.

1481
01:25:36,190 --> 01:25:40,840
Robin a lion, lion, she
goes back to her, to the,

1482
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,090
to the house and husband's like,
where's the food? I got one

1483
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,120
robbed. Well,

1484
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:48,530
what we do here in cities is
so recent and so unnatural.

1485
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,170
It's not like anything that
anybody else has ever done before.

1486
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,520
In terms of like a human beings
up until about 10,000 years ago,

1487
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:59,750
there's never been shit like this.
Supermarkets and stuff like that. Yeah.

1488
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:04,040
All of it. And no interaction at all
with nature. You, our interaction with

1489
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,690
nature is reserved to, you know,
squirrels, fucking pigeons and shit.

1490
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:12,680
Birds having a dog. Even
fucking pigeons are weird.

1491
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,440
They're brought over here as
food now. They were. Yeah,

1492
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:17,690
and they're everywhere that you
could see. You could eat pigeons.

1493
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,090
They're delicious.
Apparently. I never had one.

1494
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:23,210
I don't think a lot of
people like they look at,

1495
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:27,860
they just don't look at pigeons
as food. No. Yeah. Most people,

1496
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:32,660
yeah. 99% of they have pigeon seasons.
Actually. Maybe they don't have a season.

1497
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,420
Pigeons might be like wild
pigs where they're like a,

1498
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:39,950
they're considered a invasive species.
They're not supposed to be here.

1499
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:42,850
They're not from here. They
brought them over here for squad.

1500
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,360
You ever heard like squad
when people meet squad? Nah.

1501
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,520
The squad was like a fancy word
for a young pigeon. It's like lamb.

1502
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:53,930
Lamb is a fancy word for a young
sheep. How does a pigeon taste you?

1503
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:58,430
Had it never had. Oh I never had
it. No, I had squirrel. How's that?

1504
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:04,970
Um, is if someone told me it was chicken,
I would believe him. Oh for real?

1505
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:09,640
Yeah. I taste a lot like that. Which
is the most cliche shit to say ever.

1506
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,770
It tastes hot chicken. How do
you know if you catch a squirrel?

1507
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,030
If it's rapid on that? If you
cook it, you don't catch anything?

1508
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,310
That's a weird question.
That's a good question.

1509
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:20,900
I don't know the answer to that.

1510
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,690
Maybe rabies would die at a
certain temperature. Right?

1511
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,360
Squirrels are not a well ground squirrels.

1512
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:30,170
I was going to say squirrels are not
um, omnivores. They're herbivores.

1513
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,640
But ground squirrels.

1514
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:36,290
I'm pretty sure eat meat cause I've
seen videos of ground squirrels eating a

1515
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,950
mouse. Right? Oh Dan
fucked up. It seems wrong.

1516
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,870
Anything either mouse is wrong.

1517
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,450
Like when you feed a mouse to
a snake or some shit like that?

1518
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,330
Well it's even more wrong cause
it's holding in his hands.

1519
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:52,040
Dogs and cats that are
currently vaccinated and
kept under observation for 45

1520
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:56,210
days. Oh, what if it, oh, can you
get rabies from eating squirrel.

1521
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:59,570
Small mammals such as squirrels, rats,
mice Hampshire's getting pigs, durables,

1522
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:00,021
chipmunks,

1523
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:04,640
rabbits and hares are almost never found
to be infected with rabies and have not

1524
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:07,790
been known to cause rabies amongst
humans in the United States. Okay,

1525
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:11,820
so rats can't give you rabies.
That's interesting. Rat eating.

1526
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,990
It's about to go up. I saw videos.

1527
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,190
You could y'all biting the head
off of a rat. It's fucking nasty.

1528
01:28:19,191 --> 01:28:21,530
What was biting the head
of a rock guy? A Guy,

1529
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:25,710
man where an Asian man out in the whole
fucking thing at like right off an

1530
01:28:25,711 --> 01:28:28,160
episode of fear factor stuff.
It was raw. It's funny.

1531
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,970
I think it was dead and he didn't see
it move him before, but no, it's funny,

1532
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:36,150
you wouldn't have been able to do fear
factor in certain countries there.

1533
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:41,150
It'd be like, where's the fear, right?
Like where's the, what we eat that.

1534
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,130
I've got a lot of friends
that are Filipinos.

1535
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:46,250
Especially back in when I was doing fear
fights because I was playing a lot of

1536
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:51,250
pool. Some of the best pool players
are Filipinos. It's huge. And Pool,

1537
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:56,420
um, with pool rather. But they were
laughing at me because they serve Balut.

1538
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:00,140
They're like, we love Balut
allude is this weird duck embryo.

1539
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,190
It's like a delicacy.

1540
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,650
The sort of people on fear factor were
terrified of it and these people are

1541
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:08,010
like, no, we pay for that.
We like it. Yeah, it's great.

1542
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:13,200
I look at those people wasting the Balut
or whatever it is. They eat a beacon.

1543
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,910
Everything. Man Balut is weird.
It's an embryo. It's like a little,

1544
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,670
it's like a little baby
duck. It's very strange.

1545
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:24,720
I wonder if you'd even be able
to do fear factor today. I mean,

1546
01:29:24,721 --> 01:29:26,160
I know ludicrous is still doing it,

1547
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:29,280
but they're doing a different
kind of version of it. Right?

1548
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,520
Have you watched one of those
episodes just to check it out now? No.

1549
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:35,890
That's like watching your ex
girlfriend get banged. That's,

1550
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,340
you really want to see bang to badly.

1551
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,220
What'd you want us to watch her get
banged badly. See I was better than,

1552
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:47,130
so it's weird to take over someone's Gig
because if someone did it for so long

1553
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:51,750
and they had a certain style,
how they did it, please pimp my,

1554
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:57,360
my fear factor. Ludicrous.
Right. When like when, um,

1555
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:02,750
who was, who did pimp my ride there
was a, what's his name? [inaudible].

1556
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:05,730
Yeah. Whatever happened to that dude.

1557
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:11,770
I think he's still acting and doing
stuff. Yeah. He was the pimp. My ride guy.

1558
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:14,130
That was a huge show. How the
fuck did that show go away?

1559
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,910
I know what that feels like. Yeah. It
feels like I could just keep going. Yeah.

1560
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,680
Yeah. That's like one of them of pawnshop
shows they never have to end. Yeah.

1561
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:27,420
Just keep punting. Just, yeah. Do it in
different countries. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1562
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,030
Why? Why would they, and pip
maybe exhibit was like done.

1563
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:32,000
I can't deal with these
people in their cars.

1564
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,280
Start making all those other shows.

1565
01:30:33,281 --> 01:30:36,280
There's tons of car shows now and all
those other channels. Pimping Shit. Yeah,

1566
01:30:36,281 --> 01:30:40,870
but that's the best name. Oh yeah.
Pimp my ride. That's the best name.

1567
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:44,560
When you say it's the best, most of
those are undrivable like yeah, I've,

1568
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,860
there's been a lot of like reddit things
where people were like asking for like

1569
01:30:47,861 --> 01:30:49,430
a, have you ever been
on pimp my ride? Look,

1570
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:51,310
tell us about your experience or whatever.

1571
01:30:51,311 --> 01:30:54,460
And like they did so much shit to
those cars that would be like, hey,

1572
01:30:54,461 --> 01:30:55,600
by the way, when this is over,

1573
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,660
go ahead and take half of that shit out
so you can legally drive it down the

1574
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,940
fucking freeway if you
would have it every time.

1575
01:31:00,941 --> 01:31:02,230
But some of the times they had to do that.

1576
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:06,070
If you has one five cars now
from pimp my ride, it'd be huge.

1577
01:31:06,071 --> 01:31:09,010
Collector's item should be like worth
a lot of money if you still kept it.

1578
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,110
I think they started bringing it back.
But yeah, let me see. I use an article.

1579
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:15,820
What really happened in
the cars from pimp my ride?

1580
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:18,923
Um,

1581
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:23,420
I remember definitely remember a couple
of the guys said that they had to stay

1582
01:31:23,421 --> 01:31:25,710
in contact with a few of the like, uh,

1583
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:29,810
in house mechanics because they had
to keep getting something fixed.

1584
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:33,590
I believe that like they had to constantly
drive back to Hollywood or wherever

1585
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:37,950
the fuck it was. Right. That makes
sense. I'm trying to find, well, a lot of

1586
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:42,290
the shows like, um, my buddy bud,
who's been on the podcast before,

1587
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:45,860
he used to have that show,
uh, fuck, what was it called?

1588
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:52,020
What was that show where they would
steal someone's car and rebuild it?

1589
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,350
It would make them think
their, their car was stolen.

1590
01:31:54,351 --> 01:31:59,030
I can't remember his fucking show.
God it, it was chip Foose, chip Foose,

1591
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:03,460
uh, would redesign their car and they
would get this fucking amazing car.

1592
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,400
What the fuck was the
name of that show? But a

1593
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:11,710
bud Brotzmann he used
to have the show rides.

1594
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:15,780
That was a show where they built my
1970 Barracuda and then overhauling

1595
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:19,510
overhauling. That's it. All right.
That's it. Shout out to bud and Adrian,

1596
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,540
who is the host, um, they, uh,

1597
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,380
would take a car and they'd do it in
like a really short amount of time.

1598
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:31,390
And then after it was over, they
would have to like tighten it all up.

1599
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:32,950
And when they do a build a car,

1600
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:36,910
they have a shakedown period where like
they drive it for a few hundred miles to

1601
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:39,220
make sure there's nothing goes
wrong, everything's working right.

1602
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:42,910
It's like this period of time to make
sure that everything's dialed in.

1603
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:45,370
They don't get a chance to
do that in a week. Right.

1604
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:47,410
So that's probably what
they're talking about.

1605
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,510
Yeah. The sub pimp, my ride thing,

1606
01:32:48,511 --> 01:32:51,300
I'm reading through it like some of the
contestants said they had to dumb up

1607
01:32:51,301 --> 01:32:54,840
like they had to completely just play the
game of this as a TV show. Exaggerate.

1608
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,720
Let's dump a bunch of cigarette butts in
your car to make it look shittier than

1609
01:32:57,721 --> 01:33:00,240
it is. Hey, when we show it to you,

1610
01:33:00,570 --> 01:33:02,760
please be fucking happy when you see this.

1611
01:33:02,761 --> 01:33:06,380
We can have a good like reaction for
TV kind of thing. That's disappointing.

1612
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:11,250
Yeah. God Damn it. Pimp my ride. How
dare you. That's every show though. Yeah.

1613
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,150
That's every show. Any
like, like Haitch GTV show.

1614
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:17,680
Oh yeah. Well I just hoarders. Yeah.

1615
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:21,320
We're going to have to hoard your place
up even more probably, right? Yeah.

1616
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:25,430
Like, like preppers. Those people
prep. I make them extra crazy.

1617
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:28,910
I haven't seen purpose. Was that about
people were prepping for the apocalypse?

1618
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:33,350
Oh yeah. Listen,

1619
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:38,180
we know you're crazy, but we're gonna
make you look even crazier. Even down.

1620
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:43,610
Even crazier. Yeah. Oh
Man. Or intervention.

1621
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,020
You know what's interesting to me,

1622
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:50,560
it's typically right wing people who uh,

1623
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:55,010
are in favor of like,
if you think about, uh,

1624
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,810
anytime someone passes a law
that's bad for the environment,

1625
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:03,670
right? If they want to drill in Alaska,
if they want to do something overseas,

1626
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,170
it's usually, I mean it's
might be generalizing,

1627
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:10,040
but usually thought to be
a right wing thing, right?

1628
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:14,780
It's like more concerned for business
than concern for the environment. Right.

1629
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:19,730
People that are on the left of the people
that are always like the tree huggers,

1630
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,140
those are the environmental.

1631
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:23,060
So the people that are like
radical environmentalist,

1632
01:34:23,061 --> 01:34:25,990
you would almost always think of
as being people on the left, right?

1633
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:30,620
But the people that are prepping for
shit going south are almost always on the

1634
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:34,220
right. The right wing people
are the ones who are prepping.

1635
01:34:34,221 --> 01:34:35,570
The world's going to come to an end.

1636
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:39,800
So those are the ones that
carrying bullets and they
fucking digging tunnels in

1637
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:41,390
their backyard. I know what you're doing.

1638
01:34:41,391 --> 01:34:44,480
You know you're destroying the earth
by digging for oil and all that shit.

1639
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:48,650
But it's not them. It's usually the
big wigs, right? Right. The big,

1640
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:53,800
but they're voting and they're in favor
of all those decisions that the big

1641
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:58,310
wigs, yes. Make inadvertently because
the big wigs have themselves to Jesus.

1642
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:02,060
That's what they did. That's what
the wise thing they did to good fat,

1643
01:35:02,061 --> 01:35:05,120
old fashioned family values. Jesus.

1644
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:10,480
They figured a way to connect it to a
thing that everybody can argue against.

1645
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:17,170
The connected right wing ideology with
God and left wing with a portion killing

1646
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:20,510
babies. Right. The line in
the sand has been drawn, Ian,

1647
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,630
if you're prepping for the
end of the world, right.

1648
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:29,380
You got to secretly be hoping
for the end of the world.

1649
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:32,180
Maybe a little bit of end
because you try your shit. Yeah.

1650
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:37,120
Just to try your shit and to
say I wasn't crazy. Right.

1651
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,480
And wasting my time. So you gotta kind
of be rooting for the end of the world.

1652
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:46,160
Like you don't want to, you know,
do all that shit in vain. Right.

1653
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:50,510
You know what I mean? So that's kind of
a weird nest to those type of people.

1654
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,100
That's a good point. You know what I mean?

1655
01:35:52,101 --> 01:35:55,430
Like you started doing comedy and there's
people like you're never gonna make

1656
01:35:55,431 --> 01:35:55,521
it.

1657
01:35:55,521 --> 01:36:00,521
You want to make it to be like you are
wrong and to just the relief of knowing

1658
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:03,350
you are right. Well, I think
that's a problem with cops.

1659
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:07,270
I think cops won't shoot people.
Sometimes they have a gun

1660
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,920
and they almost want someone
to do something fucked up
so they could shoot him.

1661
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:13,400
Not every cop, not every,
not every cop, right?

1662
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,880
But there are certain people
that should not be cops. Right.

1663
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:19,560
Those people that become cops. And
it does happen. And we all know, and,

1664
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:22,830
and I'm on 100% supporter of law
enforcement, but even law enforcement,

1665
01:36:22,831 --> 01:36:25,620
they know it. They don't want to be
surrounded by some weak fuck. Who's, uh,

1666
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,660
who's also a cop, wants to shoot people.

1667
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,960
There's people out there that wanna
shoot people and you give them a gun.

1668
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,360
If you give someone a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

1669
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:35,710
That's amazing. Yeah.

1670
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:39,670
I remember the video and this was
a white cop shooting a white guy,

1671
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:44,360
the Arizona one, I think it was in a
hotel on the hall. Yeah. And that guy,

1672
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:48,060
he's like, how did he become a cop?
How does he not go to jail? Yes.

1673
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:49,560
They let him off the hook for that one.

1674
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:51,120
They always kind of let them off the hook.

1675
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,640
They'll give me a slap on the wrist
and just get them out of there.

1676
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,710
And the instructions,
he was given this guy,

1677
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:59,850
I was telling him to keep your hands away
from your waist because his pants were

1678
01:36:59,851 --> 01:37:02,760
falling down his pants. And the guy
was saying that to him too. Yeah.

1679
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:06,370
And he's just crying and crawling
towards them like, Hey, I was listening.

1680
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:09,860
The guy reaches because his pants fell
down and grabs a hold of his pants to

1681
01:37:09,861 --> 01:37:12,240
pull him up. Like I fills
his backup with bullets. Him,

1682
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:17,490
shoots him in the back on the floor
crawling because guys have no threat.

1683
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,560
Was yelling, making the
situation even more chaotic.

1684
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,920
He's also telling the guy to do
something. Why are you making a move?

1685
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:28,070
Just tell him to lie down.
Put his hands behind his back.

1686
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:32,690
You handcuff him and then now he was
ordering the guy to crawl towards him.

1687
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,950
Yeah. It doesn't even make sense. Did
you see this video earlier this week?

1688
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:41,690
This was from July 1st yes. Yeah.
The guys are crazy. This is crazy.

1689
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:43,640
This is what's called suicide by cop.

1690
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,020
This guy was coming towards this cop
screaming with a knife and the cop was

1691
01:37:48,021 --> 01:37:50,060
begging him to please stop. Please stop.

1692
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:51,770
This is after they already shot up Jamie,

1693
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:56,070
but meanwhile he wants up tackle
in this fucking, this is what's

1694
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,401
crazy.

1695
01:37:56,401 --> 01:38:00,180
This guy's already been shot and he
turns on this cop and tackles him right

1696
01:38:00,181 --> 01:38:01,890
here. Tackles him. Look at this.

1697
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,630
The guys fill with bullets and
the guy's reaching for his gun.

1698
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,270
He gets his back and he takes him
down and then this does not get,

1699
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,580
in my opinion, he doesn't have the knife
anymore, does he? Yeah. I don't know.

1700
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,300
I can't tell what if it's in his hand
right there. It's hard to see. Did you see

1701
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:18,680
video of the black cop walking
towards the guy with the machete?

1702
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:24,620
Yes, I did see that and it just like
walked right into it and just parried and

1703
01:38:24,621 --> 01:38:26,900
flipped him over. Yeah, it was crazy.

1704
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:30,390
That is crazy. I saw another one
that Eddie Bravo sent me of a,

1705
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:33,000
was not a cop one, but two dudes
were having a conversation.

1706
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:36,960
That's God's got his hand behind the back
and he pulls a knife out of his pocket

1707
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:39,390
and the guy doesn't even see and he just
in the middle of the conversation just

1708
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,970
sticks him in the stomach
and the guy's standing there.

1709
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:44,660
He moves back and he's like holding
his stomach. You can't believe it.

1710
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,230
Then the guy comes towards him again,

1711
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:50,340
follows him and the guy who got
stabbed winds up knocking the dude out.

1712
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,120
The guy's coming towards him with the
knife again saying, I'll stab you again.

1713
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:56,790
The guy hits him with a left hook and
rocks him and then hits him with the right

1714
01:38:56,791 --> 01:39:00,000
hand and knocks him out. And he's
a regular dudes, regular dudes.

1715
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:02,790
It looks like regular dudes, but the
dude who got stabbed knew how to fight.

1716
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:07,950
Luckily for him, but he still
might die in the stomach.

1717
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,330
That is fucking very
dangerous, man. Very dangerous.

1718
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,740
You know, what are we talking
about? What are you doing?

1719
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:22,560
Kind of find the video like I
getting stabbed. Let's not so much.

1720
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:25,740
There's just so much. There's
so much to just freak you out.

1721
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:31,330
Yeah. I don't, I don't even look at some
of the bad stuff anymore. A lot of it.

1722
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:36,340
Yeah. Like, like I saw at the beginning
of that video when it came out,

1723
01:39:36,341 --> 01:39:41,110
like last week, I'm like, I ain't watching
this. I was like, turn it off. Yeah.

1724
01:39:41,111 --> 01:39:44,050
You can't watch that. Yeah.
There's so many videos.

1725
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:46,660
You'll get convinced that that's
happening everywhere in the world.

1726
01:39:46,661 --> 01:39:50,710
24 hours a day. It will fuck your
head up. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

1727
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:56,260
God Damn it. It's easy
to get freaked out. Yeah.

1728
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:59,410
I mean there's a lot of
frequent bull shit out there.

1729
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,133
There is.

1730
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:05,680
This is a good spot as I need
to talk about this. Um, we,

1731
01:40:05,681 --> 01:40:09,250
I want to make sure that I clarify
something because there was some,

1732
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:10,330
there was an operation.

1733
01:40:10,331 --> 01:40:14,640
This is a guy who was a
billionaire diamond guy who uh,

1734
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:18,460
wound up getting a dick enlargement
operation and he died because of the

1735
01:40:18,461 --> 01:40:22,920
anesthesia and it was in another
country and we pulled out, we, we,

1736
01:40:22,970 --> 01:40:27,610
we were saying somehow or another it
got connected to this company that does

1737
01:40:27,611 --> 01:40:31,360
that in the United States. It had
nothing phenomena for pneuma. Yeah.

1738
01:40:31,361 --> 01:40:36,361
The article I had said like he was getting
a similar surgery and that this one,

1739
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,610
the one only the [inaudible] only
happens in the u s but he was getting

1740
01:40:39,611 --> 01:40:42,280
something done in Europe. So
it was like different, well,

1741
01:40:42,281 --> 01:40:46,360
they reached out to me to explain, first
of all, the guy died from anesthesia.

1742
01:40:46,361 --> 01:40:48,910
You can get and you could die from
anesthesia from any operation.

1743
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:52,840
Had nothing to do with the, the
penis enlargement operation to use.

1744
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:54,160
The more correct

1745
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,110
term, dick enlargement a,
but he didn't die from that.

1746
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:03,190
And that's just as safe as a getting
your nose fixed or getting your knee

1747
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:05,870
meniscus operated on. Right.
It's just the [inaudible].

1748
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:09,790
Any surgery where you have a anesthesia
carries a certain amount of risk,

1749
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:14,590
but apparently this dick thing works.
They actually can grow your Dick Beggar.

1750
01:41:14,591 --> 01:41:18,580
Now you have a risk in your
life. Well it'll work well.

1751
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:20,680
You're risking your life if
you go to the dentist. Yeah.

1752
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,970
Once you wonder like anytime you get
put under, right. If you, if you,

1753
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:26,650
if anything you're doing with anesthesia,

1754
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:29,860
there's a very small chance
that something could go wrong.

1755
01:41:29,890 --> 01:41:32,160
But I had nothing to do
with this Dick Operation,

1756
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:35,470
so I just wanted to make sure that
people know that if you look this up,

1757
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,600
I don't want anything, any,

1758
01:41:37,601 --> 01:41:42,220
a incorrect assumptions to be out there
and I carry no ill will towards this.

1759
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,710
These people that make this
and apparently it works.

1760
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:48,220
So I just want everybody to know that
it's carry no ill will towards this

1761
01:41:48,221 --> 01:41:52,720
company that makes Dick's
bigger. Apparently. It actually,

1762
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:56,710
it's a weird thing, right?
Like A, for a man to do that.

1763
01:41:56,711 --> 01:42:01,711
There's certain taboos that are involved
in even a admitting that you have an

1764
01:42:02,741 --> 01:42:05,260
issue like a little dick
as a weird thing, right?

1765
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:09,160
Because it's one of the rare things that's
unfortunate that you can make fun of,

1766
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:11,890
right? Like you can't make
fun of a little person, right?

1767
01:42:12,030 --> 01:42:14,710
Like if you make fun of a
person who is a, you know,

1768
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:18,610
you're not supposed to call the images,
right? So let's call them little people.

1769
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:21,700
They make fun of a person who's
a dwarf or a little person.

1770
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:25,270
You're a cruel person, right? But if you
make fun of a guy with a little Dick,

1771
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,060
like how he deserves it or some shit,

1772
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:32,000
that's a weird thing that
women are allowed to do.

1773
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:35,510
Like you're allowed to make fun of
dudes having little decks. We should,

1774
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:38,840
there should be something
in the same vein. Yes.

1775
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:44,270
To protect little girls. What
equal for them from cruelty,

1776
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:48,010
but because if you have a little
pussy, that's fantastic. Yeah.

1777
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:52,130
Everybody's excited about that.
It's not crazy weird situation,

1778
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:57,260
but a big Dick is a sign of a reality.
All right? So we salute you per new ma.

1779
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,840
That's the name of the company.
We salute you for helping men.

1780
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:03,500
I achieve larger decks and I almost
died from anesthesia one time.

1781
01:43:03,501 --> 01:43:07,100
I thought you were going to say from a
different lifetime what happened when I

1782
01:43:07,101 --> 01:43:10,790
was like a teenager. And here's the irony.

1783
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:15,680
I was going in for an operation
that you're supposed to
go in in the morning and

1784
01:43:15,681 --> 01:43:18,830
leave in the afternoon. Oh,
it's just a quick thing.

1785
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:23,990
And then it was literally for
a circumcision. I was like,

1786
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,750
you are getting a circumcision.
Yeah. What were you doing?

1787
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:32,600
I just had sex with this girl.
Like I was a kid like seven,

1788
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,570
like say 18 and uh,

1789
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:41,150
and somehow I'd pull the
skin of my dick back.

1790
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,373
Ah,

1791
01:43:42,620 --> 01:43:47,620
couldn't get it back to clean it and I
couldn't get the skin back right over to

1792
01:43:50,001 --> 01:43:55,001
then I spent like an entire night with
like a roar boner with no skin covering

1793
01:43:59,091 --> 01:44:00,890
it. So I went to the doctor Dan,

1794
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:04,700
he got it back over and he said
you should get a circumcision.

1795
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:09,650
So one time operation is going and you
don't have to worry about this shit

1796
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:12,380
happening again. But it only
happened once, right? Yeah.

1797
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:17,150
But well you were furiously
beaten off though, right? No, no,

1798
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:21,220
no. I just, I pulled the skin back
to clean it. Yeah. Yeah. Officer.

1799
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:26,130
I was cleaning that gun when it shot
my neighbor. No, it's clean. It,

1800
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:28,400
it was, there was shit under there. Yeah.

1801
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:33,460
So then I went in and they gave me the
anesthesia and then when I woke up there

1802
01:44:34,881 --> 01:44:39,881
was like a hose down my throat and people
are frantic around me and it was like

1803
01:44:41,511 --> 01:44:46,120
nighttime. It was way past the time I was
supposed to come back, come to and uh,

1804
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:48,540
the anesthesia gave me pneumonia.

1805
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:53,541
I ended up spending like two or one and
a half to two weeks in the hospital and

1806
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:59,110
the first few days was in intensive
care. Oh yeah. Wow. It was anesthesia.

1807
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:02,930
I did not like wake up. Holy Shit. Yeah.

1808
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:05,930
You almost died getting your
Dick operated on. Yeah. Just,

1809
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:07,850
I was almost that guy then.

1810
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,670
But for the most part, listen,

1811
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:15,790
you talking to someone who's had a bunch
of surgeries? I've had my nose fixed.

1812
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:18,430
I've had my arm broken, my hands.

1813
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:23,710
I've had my knees operated on three
times. I've had three knee surgeries.

1814
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,810
I've been put under quite a
few times. It's mostly safe.

1815
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:32,230
It's really about the anesthesiologist.
Hey Jamie, just somebody at the door,

1816
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:36,430
try it. Try and figure out,
okay. Why is he doing that?

1817
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:42,190
Wandered rallies. He's got a plan.
I have no idea. He's a chair.

1818
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:46,740
They must be hanging out up there
today. People Weird man. He never know.

1819
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:49,420
You know when you'd get an
Uber, do you know that they,

1820
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,670
how much background do they do on an Uber?

1821
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:53,590
So I was trying to explain to when
you're asking me the other day,

1822
01:45:53,591 --> 01:45:57,820
I was like to get the like approval
on your app to be like, yes,

1823
01:45:57,821 --> 01:46:01,300
this car can drive. Uber is one
thing. But once you have that,

1824
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:05,260
anybody you know can be behind that they
don't like scan your face when you're

1825
01:46:05,261 --> 01:46:07,570
in the car every time or anything
like that. It's just, yeah,

1826
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:11,380
I got the Uber Bro. Use it. You
know? So if you and I got an Uber,

1827
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:15,550
like I could drive around and pretend
I'm you, you could get caught. Sure.

1828
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:18,220
But like people definitely do that a
hundred but how many people get caught

1829
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:21,290
driving? No, not fucking
none. Yeah, right, right.

1830
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,520
Whoever saw that comment, rideshare.

1831
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,730
Remember when you were a kid and there
was kid taxis, whoever thought, man,

1832
01:46:27,731 --> 01:46:31,150
I could have my own taxi. These to
have a shit called Gypsy taxis. Right.

1833
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:34,470
And they would arrest those
people in New York? Yes. Yeah.

1834
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,730
They would arrest them for
trying to do the Uber thing.

1835
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:41,080
Why don't they get an Uber? Why would
they be a gypsy cab? Five bucks.

1836
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:42,213
This is before that.

1837
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:47,290
It was a year that I lived in New York
that some insane number of gypsy cab

1838
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:49,770
drivers got murdered.
Insane. Oh, for real.

1839
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:53,310
It was something like 40
plus in a year got murdered.

1840
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:56,700
So it was almost one a week. They
were killing gypsy cab drivers.

1841
01:46:56,701 --> 01:46:59,070
They would rob them and kill
them. Did they have a, that guy,

1842
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,380
I don't know if it was
just one tiles, people.

1843
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:04,770
They were there were just deciding
that these gypsy cab drivers,

1844
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:06,960
I think this was, you know,

1845
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,880
boy we're talking like probably like
1990s, 1992 or some shit like that.

1846
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:16,830
Like there was no, uh, there
was no internet and there was,

1847
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,030
I don't know, people were paying
ever with credit cards, no cash.

1848
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:23,760
It was all cash. So if
you're a gypsy cab driver,

1849
01:47:23,761 --> 01:47:25,370
they saw you as being someone who had a,

1850
01:47:25,371 --> 01:47:28,830
a wad of cash on you and then you can't
report it to the police cause you're a

1851
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:31,590
gypsy cab driver. So you
shouldn't even be doing it. Yeah.

1852
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:34,350
But they would just kill him.
But if you're a criminal, yeah,

1853
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:38,220
it's a great crime.
Yeah. It's a smart crime.

1854
01:47:38,221 --> 01:47:43,080
Like I'm going to rob somebody
that shouldn't be doing
what they're doing for a

1855
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:45,720
living, so they can't really report them.

1856
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:49,570
Report to the police that
I'm robbing you. Yeah.

1857
01:47:49,571 --> 01:47:50,820
But there was shoot them and kill them.

1858
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:52,850
The thing is they would just shoot
him in the head and it should've been,

1859
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,880
it's like they would be considered
like maybe these people were illegals.

1860
01:47:57,090 --> 01:47:59,820
Maybe these people didn't
have a lot of documentation.

1861
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:02,520
Maybe when they killed them it would be
a dead end because they wouldn't know

1862
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:04,800
what to do. Maybe they
were here by themselves.

1863
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:06,690
Maybe they figured the
cops don't care about.

1864
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:09,720
They would definitely figure the
cops don't care and you know,

1865
01:48:09,721 --> 01:48:13,740
because it's cash and because it's
not, it's there's no meter. Right.

1866
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,860
So this is like, there's no
record of everything. Right.

1867
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,560
How many did you find it in a way that
quickly just Google it. There was one,

1868
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:23,130
I found a story from New York Times 1983
there's a weekend where 11 people were

1869
01:48:23,131 --> 01:48:23,640
murdered,

1870
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,910
but the store just has a story of one
guy that was found in the front seat of a

1871
01:48:26,911 --> 01:48:30,000
gypsy cab murdered. Could have
been a shot. Could've been ice.

1872
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:33,980
It was the 1990s it was the
1990s it was definitely why,

1873
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:35,130
why we moved there.

1874
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:40,131
I think I moved to New York in 91 I think
I lived there from 91 I lived back and

1875
01:48:42,931 --> 01:48:47,520
forth in 92 which a story from 1990
a sixth cabeus land in the Bronx,

1876
01:48:47,550 --> 01:48:51,870
but it's New York Times. It was just
paypal thing. Yeah. One was killed.

1877
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,690
Yeah. I think there was a,

1878
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:57,840
there was a long stretch where it
started to become a big deal, but it's,

1879
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:01,140
I mean if there was 40 Wall
Street guys murdered murders,

1880
01:49:01,141 --> 01:49:03,780
Italian two nineties originated

1881
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:10,140
the creation of pirate tax,
kind of the article about it.

1882
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:14,370
It's 19 180 drivers since 1990 180 drivers
have lost their lives while on duty

1883
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,720
in the streets, which averages more
than two per month. Wow. That's crazy.

1884
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:21,210
I don't know if that's regular kid.
I don't know. I don't know either.

1885
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:25,320
It might just be cab drivers, but um,
you know, because Gypsy cab drivers,

1886
01:49:25,321 --> 01:49:27,080
how do you prove that guy
was a gypsy cab driver?

1887
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:30,440
You just got a dead guy in a car with a
bullet in the back of the head and then

1888
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:33,370
you have to ask his friends. Was this
Guy Gypsy cab driving? Maybe it was,

1889
01:49:33,371 --> 01:49:38,220
it was a certain style of car too because
so that passengers could identify it

1890
01:49:38,221 --> 01:49:41,580
as it just a cap so that they could
take it and it's like if you're taking a

1891
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:45,990
gypsy cab, you have limited amount of
money and you don't want to pay a cab,

1892
01:49:45,991 --> 01:49:49,890
but you want to get to where you're going
have to be identifiable. Here it is.

1893
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:52,000
Cabbies risk death. Uh,

1894
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:57,110
daily in New York jungle under siege crime
hours are long and the mortality rate

1895
01:49:57,571 --> 01:49:58,650
high so far this year,

1896
01:49:58,651 --> 01:50:03,630
32 taxi drivers had been killed by
armed robbers posing as customers. Yeah.

1897
01:50:03,631 --> 01:50:07,650
And I think that's just regular taxi
drivers. Yeah. That's a rough Gig, man.

1898
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,500
Yeah. Dope. When we
were living in New York,

1899
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,460
imagine if just now you go there,
it's just Uber's everywhere.

1900
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,230
Everybody's [inaudible].
Everybody's just using their phones,

1901
01:50:17,231 --> 01:50:20,460
standing out like the comedy stores become
a fucking disaster trying to get into

1902
01:50:20,461 --> 01:50:22,760
the parking lot. That's a
pain in the ass and age.

1903
01:50:22,761 --> 01:50:25,100
Just pull up and block the
driveway. They don't give a fucking,

1904
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:29,850
no one stops them and they're just
going in there left and right,

1905
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:33,570
but just blocking everything, dropping
people off, picking people up.

1906
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,990
It's never ending. You can
never get in there. It's weird.

1907
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:41,610
It's like a new thing that no one saw
coming. What could be that like let's,

1908
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:46,590
let's play Gary v here. What's next?
What book? What could, what could we get?

1909
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:49,350
Oh, on the front lines of, for
something like that scooter stuff.

1910
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:52,350
It's crazy. There's like
a one year pilot program,

1911
01:50:52,351 --> 01:50:54,150
I think they're calling
it for Los Angeles County.

1912
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:55,650
That's why they're more
and more have popped up.

1913
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,860
I think they're just sort of saying,
fate, we're going to do a year,

1914
01:50:58,861 --> 01:50:59,551
figure it out.

1915
01:50:59,551 --> 01:51:02,920
No one is going to be like taken down
for doing this for like they were trying

1916
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,890
and Santa Monica to get
rid of them for a minute,

1917
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:08,340
like the bird scooters and whatnot.
They've ramped it up completely.

1918
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:11,010
There's all sorts of electronic
bikes now. There's at least,

1919
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,950
I want to say six or seven different
companies just in Hollywood where I live.

1920
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:17,370
They're just everywhere,
laying all over the sidewalks.

1921
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:20,370
But that's sort of what we're trying
to figure out is how do you leave them

1922
01:51:20,371 --> 01:51:23,760
around? Where are you going to
leave them? Is it successful?

1923
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:25,410
I don't know how much taxes
they're paying and how,

1924
01:51:25,411 --> 01:51:27,090
like how much money the
city gets brought in. But

1925
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:31,500
yeah I don't mind them but it's just
dangerous walking cause I was walking down

1926
01:51:31,501 --> 01:51:34,650
the street one day and I
was about to just, you know,

1927
01:51:34,651 --> 01:51:38,520
you just walk in but you just change a
stride a little bit to go to the right

1928
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,230
and I almost got hit by one and it
was coming fast and I'm like this the

1929
01:51:43,231 --> 01:51:48,150
sidewalk, you know what I mean?
Like you could be serious ass

1930
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,660
Manila is that you're supposed
to be on the street with those.

1931
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,580
It says do not ride this on the sidewalk,

1932
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:58,960
but it is 100% not safe to be on the
streets of La on those cause people are

1933
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,960
getting run over and healthy.
I don't know if anybody's died,

1934
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,930
but like downtown La, somebody
driving 50 miles an hour,

1935
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:07,090
ran over someone on a
sidewalk or on a scooter.

1936
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:10,690
Like why the fuck you driving
so fast downtown also?

1937
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:13,630
Well, this people that are crazy
hit and runs happen anyway.

1938
01:52:13,690 --> 01:52:16,360
They happen all over the place and
then there's assholes. You know?

1939
01:52:16,361 --> 01:52:19,330
People are gonna shoot. Cab drivers are
going to run over scooter drivers. Yeah.

1940
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:20,920
[inaudible] everywhere though.

1941
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:24,400
It's weird to see them and they've started
a band them in certain places. Right.

1942
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,390
Some neighborhoods have
tried like West Hollywood.

1943
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,270
You kinda can't like them anywhere.
But I think there's cities,

1944
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:34,330
the West Hollywood city. Yeah.
But I mean outside of California,

1945
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,750
I mean other cities have just said
no more. Yeah. You Know Vegas,

1946
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:41,650
you can't no fucking way because you have
them Vegas. Most drunk people, right?

1947
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:45,190
Yeah. Oh my God. Drunk people
on scooters. If he was drunk,

1948
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:48,650
drunk people on scooters and drunk people
driving while you were on a scooter.

1949
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:53,930
Yeah. Let's fuck plus
weed now. Weed. Yeah.

1950
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:57,400
How good was Vegas? It was a
good time. It was just fun.

1951
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,280
He just had me thinking about what could
be next door. Yeah. What could be next?

1952
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:04,910
Like if we didn't see scooters
coming, we didn't see Uber coming.

1953
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:08,900
What would be the next? What do we,
what do we need? What do we need?

1954
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:13,070
We need protection from the ocean. The
ocean's going to rise up and take us.

1955
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:16,430
That's good. We're melting the
ice caps. It's going to fucking,

1956
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:18,500
we're going to have to
move to Tucson boats.

1957
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,280
They're making more subways
here right now. Yeah.

1958
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:23,030
They're going to fill up
with water. What a good name.

1959
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,890
I have one in Beverly Hills.
There's going to be canals, canals.

1960
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:30,180
We'll use those for the
toilet. Your 20, 90. Yeah.

1961
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:34,620
We're going to throw our shit down
those tubes. Like I wonder, man,

1962
01:53:34,710 --> 01:53:38,930
there were some shit that I was reading
today about the ice caps melting at an

1963
01:53:38,931 --> 01:53:42,680
accelerated rate. It's always,
it's never good news. Whenever the,

1964
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:45,620
it's like ice cap melting news.
Like, Hey, and we just found out, uh,

1965
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:49,470
we actually have more ice than we
thought. We're good. All right.

1966
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,980
Don't worry about it. What does
that mean? Vegas can get water now?

1967
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,240
No Vegas gets their water figured.

1968
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:57,500
They figured out there's so much
money in Vegas, they just steal it.

1969
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:00,830
What do they get it from a
hole in the ground. No ideas.

1970
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:02,120
Is there a well out there?

1971
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:05,570
All I know that got good water pressure
in every hotel I've ever been in.

1972
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:09,980
It's wonderful. Look, that's a human
ingenuity. They build it more shit. Yeah.

1973
01:54:09,981 --> 01:54:13,760
And if the uh, ice cabs do melt,
it'll just bring it closer to Vegas.

1974
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,810
Vegas or use it. Yeah. The water
will be like real close. Yeah.

1975
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:21,140
I mean we just move inside to the middle.

1976
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:23,000
It's like this is what people
have been doing forever.

1977
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,790
This idea that you're supposed to be
able to keep your fucking house on the

1978
01:54:25,791 --> 01:54:29,780
water in Santa Monica
sitting crazy, you know?

1979
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:35,170
Yeah. You build a house where the beach
is, your front yard is so nuts distinct.

1980
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,890
Those cliffs were always there.

1981
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,340
This shit was different decades before.

1982
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:42,700
So keep on thinking it's going to
be like that all the time. Yeah.

1983
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:47,630
If you buy like a seaside house in like
Marina del Ray or someone really nice,

1984
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,000
you're making a gamble like over the next,

1985
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:53,210
I'm only going to be alive for
40 more years over those years.

1986
01:54:53,211 --> 01:54:57,170
I'm going to let's, let's hope that
this water stays over there. Exactly.

1987
01:54:57,171 --> 01:55:01,610
Stays put as hope Mother Nature
does what I want it to do.

1988
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,990
Yeah. I just,

1989
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm going to spend $7 million on this
fucking house with literally no backyard.

1990
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:11,270
It's just ocean and I'm just
going to hope it stays like this.

1991
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:15,530
I just can't wait till my credit becomes
beach front property and then I could

1992
01:55:15,531 --> 01:55:16,364
sell it.

1993
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:20,900
I've rented space at a beach house a
couple of years ago when I'm my kitchen.

1994
01:55:20,901 --> 01:55:25,901
I was getting my kitchen fixed and we
rented this house in Malibu on the water.

1995
01:55:26,661 --> 01:55:30,340
It was beautiful man. You would
wake up, you eat breakfast, damn.

1996
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:33,710
Just be sitting there staring out over
the water and the water would literally

1997
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:36,230
come almost underneath the balcony.

1998
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:40,540
So it looked like you were sitting in
water like you were floating and while we

1999
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,010
were on a boat, I was like, wow,
this is so beautiful. It's so,

2000
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:47,580
it makes you feel so good. Yeah. Does
being by the ocean, but what a gamble.

2001
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,350
Yeah. Even though it's the best,

2002
01:55:49,351 --> 01:55:52,740
like you sound like that's the
ultimate infinity pool. Yeah.

2003
01:55:52,910 --> 01:55:56,790
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. I don't mind.

2004
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:01,970
Like la Jolla, you have the condo
right by the beach and, and,

2005
01:56:02,050 --> 01:56:04,980
and you go to sleep at night. You
can hear the ocean, you wake up.

2006
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:09,900
But then I'd be like, what if is this
is the night, this is the night where,

2007
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,310
you know what I'm saying? Yeah.

2008
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:16,260
Just taste the building down and
rushes it out to the mountains.

2009
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:21,960
Let me know this happen so
many times in history. Yeah.

2010
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:26,520
All it takes is a earthquake
or an asteroid hits the ocean.

2011
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:28,980
Oh yeah, yeah. Oh my God.

2012
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:32,520
If an asteroid hit the ocean and
we wouldn't even be safe here,

2013
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:35,940
we wouldn't be safe. We'd probably
wouldn't be safe in Arizona.

2014
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,820
It would go deep in Arizona.

2015
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:41,700
Asteroid hit the fucking ocean
just outside of Malibu. Boom.

2016
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:45,960
Just a big one. Everybody
in the Midwest be laughing.

2017
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:49,530
They'd be laughing our asses off. We had
the best property all the time. Yeah,

2018
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:53,640
so we had a duck. Hurricanes,
they have the scariest shit.

2019
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:56,190
I think a tornadoes are
the scariest shit. Yeah.

2020
01:56:56,191 --> 01:56:59,970
Those things are so random and they
happen every year. Right? Every year.

2021
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:03,510
It's not like earthquakes happen
every year or hurricane you can track,

2022
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:07,200
you know it's coming. You can prepare.
You could just leave a tornado.

2023
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:11,460
It's just like, did you show up?
Hey Man, I'm here. Yeah. Yeah.

2024
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:12,900
That's the scariest. Yeah,

2025
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:17,040
but that's just something that
people deal with when they, you see,

2026
01:57:17,041 --> 01:57:20,170
they wipe out entire
towns, they wipe, they,

2027
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:22,140
they took towns off the map.

2028
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:26,700
I feel like they just always
aim for the small towns. Why?

2029
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:30,840
I think it has to do with
the, with agriculture,

2030
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:32,040
if I'm right,

2031
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:36,840
I think it has to do with like flat
areas and the type of weather that they

2032
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:37,231
have.

2033
01:57:37,231 --> 01:57:40,140
And I don't think they'd take place in
areas where there's a lot of trees and

2034
01:57:40,141 --> 01:57:42,120
forests. Is that true?

2035
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:47,100
It's more like they don't really happen
in cities because the heat structure and

2036
01:57:47,190 --> 01:57:47,990
that creates like a,

2037
01:57:47,990 --> 01:57:51,660
where the pressure of air pressure starts
cause it's a caught cold air pressure

2038
01:57:51,661 --> 01:57:55,920
system that kind of starts swirling
because of the artificial concrete. Yeah.

2039
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,620
All those creates tornadoes
almost protect the bulb.

2040
01:57:58,621 --> 01:58:01,530
It does happen in cities from time
to time or like on the outskirts.

2041
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:04,230
But like it's very rare to see
when roll through a downtown.

2042
01:58:04,231 --> 01:58:07,440
But does one ever go through
like Colorado on the mountain?

2043
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:09,270
Look in one up right here. That's
why as you were saying trees,

2044
01:58:09,271 --> 01:58:12,880
I got video of one, like just ripping
trees up in Texas, so like mm.

2045
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,920
But it does mostly the Hash
for sure. I'm flatland. Yeah.

2046
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:22,410
Yeah. Well Texas, uh, Texas
is a lot of crazy wind.

2047
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,110
It's so close to Oklahoma.
Oklahoma's like tornado alley.

2048
01:58:25,111 --> 01:58:28,430
So you were around there. There was
one that was on t v though. That

2049
01:58:28,430 --> 01:58:30,020
was mad.

2050
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:35,310
It was hitting this area where they had
these oil trucks and it was carrying the

2051
01:58:35,311 --> 01:58:39,120
semi trucks in the air. I don't know
if there were oil trucks there. Semis,

2052
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:40,670
like can't like, you know,

2053
01:58:40,671 --> 01:58:43,420
like a 16 wheeler like fucking
sure hugging like that.

2054
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:48,540
It was flying in a circle in the
sky. Like a fucking newspaper. Yeah.

2055
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:50,680
News. A page from a newspaper
gets caught in the wind.

2056
01:58:50,681 --> 01:58:52,270
So I was flying around this,

2057
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:55,930
this fucking tornado was
carrying trucks like that

2058
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:02,180
in this video. This is a Missouri
earlier this year. Hmm. I don't see,

2059
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:05,920
I don't see any evidence. That's
fair. Honestly. New stuff. Okay. Yeah,

2060
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:09,250
but there's a video of the, that's
it right there. That's the video.

2061
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:13,330
This is a video where you see, look
at this, why you see the trucks.

2062
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:14,740
As they get closer,

2063
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:19,870
you can see inside the fucking thing
that is a truck flying in a circle.

2064
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:24,790
If this is the same video.
Sorry, I don't know if that's it.

2065
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,300
No, that's, that's the
seminar after lands. I mean,

2066
01:59:28,301 --> 01:59:29,440
that might not have even been it,

2067
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:33,370
but it was one where it was probably
so many fucking tornado videos,

2068
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:38,371
but it was one where these trucks were
literally flying around in a circle like

2069
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:44,131
it was carrying this gigantic semi and
just floating it in the air like a paper

2070
01:59:44,531 --> 01:59:48,350
airplane. Was it from twists or
though, was it some fake footage? No,

2071
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:51,810
it was real. It was real. Some news
footage from television. He was like,

2072
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:53,890
then it's hard to catch that because
all of these are just already on the

2073
01:59:53,891 --> 01:59:57,610
ground. Yeah, no, it was in it from a
distance. There was some news footage.

2074
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:01,540
Anyway, just fucking rambling.

2075
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,420
Speaking around, but Ian Ned,

2076
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,670
what is that? Somebody
special? When's it coming out?

2077
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:11,590
A Friday at midnight on
comedy central. Oh Shit.

2078
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:14,020
Why did you decide to do it in that
style? It's kind of interesting.

2079
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:18,340
He did it like a Ted talk because
there's so many specials out there.

2080
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,230
And I get to do my material
when I do it that way,

2081
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:28,320
but I had a little twist and an extra
layer to it that'll make people be more

2082
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:33,640
interested in it than if I was just
going to do like just a regular stand up.

2083
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:37,210
That's why you clever bastard
once in a while I got an idea.

2084
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,980
You know what I'm saying?
And you got the microphone,

2085
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:42,280
a regular microphone just sitting on
the stool in case you change your mind.

2086
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:47,340
Well, the last bit I use the Mike
[inaudible] noticed that. Yeah. Good.

2087
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:52,360
Yeah. The last bit I do with the
Mike. What is in your hand? Uh,

2088
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:55,130
the clicker because,

2089
02:00:55,131 --> 02:00:58,430
because some of the topics
put on the screen, like,

2090
02:00:58,431 --> 02:01:00,980
just like a tech talk he
taught you click the thing,

2091
02:01:01,390 --> 02:01:04,850
that picture represents what
you're talking about and
then you keep on going. I,

2092
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:09,470
I've seen people do that
before, um, with, uh, with,

2093
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,760
with Ted talks and I've always thought
that'd be a good thing with comp. Yeah.

2094
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:17,570
Because like even when you look at
your standup, you take on a topic,

2095
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,960
you dissect it and you give people
an alternate view of that topic,

2096
02:01:23,511 --> 02:01:27,860
just like a tech tone and then you move
on to the next one. So like comics,

2097
02:01:27,861 --> 02:01:30,080
like you and me and other people,

2098
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:35,030
it's a perfect format for our standup.
Yeah. Are you doing that when you do,

2099
02:01:35,180 --> 02:01:37,400
when you headline we do headline Gig. Nah,

2100
02:01:37,580 --> 02:01:41,570
maybe you should maybe I about
doing that. Yeah, I did. Yeah,

2101
02:01:41,571 --> 02:01:46,500
I did thought about it at one point
in time, but I'm too lazy. Yeah. Yeah.

2102
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:48,980
Like I don't have merits or
anything so I don't bring it merge.

2103
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:53,030
I don't want to have to make sure they
have a screen on transport one and all

2104
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:56,030
that shit. Then that strategy,
it gets cumbersome. Well,

2105
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:58,640
I heard that Kevin Hart at one
point in time had pyrotechnics,

2106
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:01,120
like he would hit a punchline but

2107
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:07,460
20 flips off flames that shoot through
this guy and arenas and I'm like, man,

2108
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:11,870
that's when that's you add to the
standup, right. It's like props,

2109
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:16,310
but way better. Right? Like, I
feel like props are the rare,

2110
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:20,330
one of the rare things where you can't
do them anymore cause Cara top owns that.

2111
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,530
Whereas when I was a kid, man,
there was prop comedians. Yeah,

2112
02:02:24,531 --> 02:02:27,590
there was a lot of them. Right.
Jamie, you don't know about anything.

2113
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,280
I just remember a lot of ventriloquists
and some people that were doing little

2114
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:35,390
prop things, but yet no one
really had that truck full of,

2115
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:40,580
it'd be the comic that show up to
the mic with a briefcase. Yeah.

2116
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,300
And then afterwards he has to gather
his stuff. Like a stripper. Yeah,

2117
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:48,620
they have to his duffle bag
have everything in there. Yeah.

2118
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:53,390
It was a guy that was a,
he was really funny man.

2119
02:02:53,391 --> 02:02:56,780
A guy in Boston that used to do
that. Fuck, I'm blanking on his name,

2120
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:01,430
but he had glasses and he had
a real similar kind of act,

2121
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,410
but it was kind of like science based.

2122
02:03:03,411 --> 02:03:07,880
He had a bunch of weird shit that he
would show Alex Zerbe. Nope. Okay. No,

2123
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:12,230
it was a long time ago. You ever
seen chips? Cooney chips, Cooney.

2124
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:15,260
I've heard the name. Yeah,
he, he had props. But he,

2125
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:17,570
he was a fake magician really.

2126
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:22,220
So like I remember the name of that
Tupperware that's expanded. Yeah.

2127
02:03:22,600 --> 02:03:27,410
Like that was one of his friends was
just all was, but he was funny, like,

2128
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:30,530
you know, and then pull
it out. That's the trick.

2129
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:32,870
And this keep going onto
the next goofy thing.

2130
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:35,820
There was a guy named Lenny
Schulz and he, uh, he remember,

2131
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:38,680
remember crazy Lenny. Yeah. He
had a bunch of problems. Yeah.

2132
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:42,170
I watched a Steve Burns documentary on
the amazing Jonathan that he's just put

2133
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:45,260
out. It was really good, wasn't it?
Yeah. I liked as a younger kid, I love,

2134
02:03:45,261 --> 02:03:48,110
I liked him just because of
a zany crazy shit he did.

2135
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:52,190
But watching the documentary
was awesome. So what is it? Yes.

2136
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:56,420
Shout out to Steve Burn. What does it
basically about? Like he lived in excess,

2137
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:56,710
right?

2138
02:03:56,710 --> 02:04:00,800
It's definitely about that sort of like
his rise and maybe I would say fall,

2139
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:04,640
but then sort of how he came back and
was died. There's a lot of to about this.

2140
02:04:04,641 --> 02:04:09,080
A Fan that became his manager and sorta
he helped him and guided him along and

2141
02:04:09,081 --> 02:04:13,970
apprenticed him a little bit and just
about the relationship and one footage

2142
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:17,930
together. It was just interesting.
It's an interesting guy. Wow.

2143
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:22,700
Yeah. Those guys from the
fucking eighties went hard, man.

2144
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:26,600
That was the Kinison era. You know, if
you wanted to be a wild man, you haven't

2145
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,410
figured out how to snort coke
on stage. He's just like fall,

2146
02:04:31,411 --> 02:04:33,830
make a joke about it. It was
supposed to be fake coke,

2147
02:04:33,831 --> 02:04:38,580
but he's really saying I'm really doing
it like a lot. So he made a bit. Yeah.

2148
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:43,110
Huh. That was not a prop.
That's real shit. Yo.

2149
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:45,780
I bet people have done a lot
of weasley shit like that.

2150
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:50,700
Like just put something into their act.
They'll pull something off, you know,

2151
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:54,500
like I would think like it's a,

2152
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,740
one of the core things about comedy is
also one of the weird things that it's so

2153
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:01,140
open ended like the club, just

2154
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:04,110
like you get booked to the
Bray Improv. Right, right.

2155
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:07,600
You show up like what's up being, how
are you man, you know, and you're like,

2156
02:05:07,601 --> 02:05:10,240
Hey, this is my opening act. They,
they shake hands, everybody's cool.

2157
02:05:10,630 --> 02:05:12,940
They don't even ask you what
you're going to talk about. Right.

2158
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:16,780
They got everybody sitting there.
People paid money, they've sold tickets,

2159
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:17,773
they sold drinks,

2160
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:21,880
and they have not a clue as to what
you're going to discuss and you just go up

2161
02:05:21,881 --> 02:05:23,260
there and say whatever the fuck you want.

2162
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:25,370
America love it. Crazy. Yeah.

2163
02:05:25,940 --> 02:05:30,940
What a weird way to make a living and
then you'd do the same thing for like a TV

2164
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:34,370
show or something. You have to
type it out. Yeah, send it to them.

2165
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:37,250
They've got to look at it. That's a
beautiful thing to do with Netflix.

2166
02:05:37,790 --> 02:05:41,600
Netflix didn't say shit. They
just said, hey, we want to do,

2167
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:44,720
we want to do a special with you. I said,
great. All right, let's do it. I said,

2168
02:05:44,721 --> 02:05:45,300
okay, let's

2169
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:49,920
do it. It was that easy. We did it and
they said, okay, great. You did it.

2170
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:51,720
We like it. We'll put it up. Boom.

2171
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:55,870
I had to send comedy central
or a proof of concept,

2172
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:58,960
like I got to shoot the
set, like in a small club,

2173
02:05:59,530 --> 02:06:03,280
sent it to them and they're
like, all right, okay. Oh yeah.

2174
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,140
Well the good news is
they approved, right.

2175
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:10,930
It's on TV and a special
is always in my opinion,

2176
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:14,890
really just an advertisement to get
people to come see you. Exactly right.

2177
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:18,700
So I'm glad the advertisements out. Oh
yeah. Cause me to, I've said it before.

2178
02:06:18,701 --> 02:06:21,340
I'll say it again. Why are you here?
You one of the best comics in the world.

2179
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,960
The shore. It's like, it's so
many times people come up to me,

2180
02:06:26,230 --> 02:06:29,920
Rogan was talking about you like I
don't even have to be on the show.

2181
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:32,430
Like they were like
Rogan's talking about you.

2182
02:06:32,990 --> 02:06:36,520
It's so like people will come up to come
to a show because you just spoke about

2183
02:06:36,521 --> 02:06:37,354
me. But it's true.

2184
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,990
You and I had been friends for 20 what?

2185
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:46,180
28 years or some shit. Something
crazy. So long fucking time.

2186
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:49,120
But you've always been one of the
best comics in the world, you know?

2187
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:53,080
And I think right now your new
Shit, man, that you're doing this.

2188
02:06:53,081 --> 02:06:56,860
Not even the special. I was crying
this weekend in Vegas, that new thing.

2189
02:06:57,070 --> 02:07:01,270
I want to say what it is, but God
damn, it's good. It's really good man.

2190
02:07:01,271 --> 02:07:02,590
I love that. You know,

2191
02:07:02,591 --> 02:07:06,790
I love the transition between when someone
does a special to writing and working

2192
02:07:06,791 --> 02:07:11,791
on new stuff because then you just get
this new angles and and having to write

2193
02:07:12,521 --> 02:07:13,560
shit. That's like,

2194
02:07:13,570 --> 02:07:16,750
I've been trying to tell this to Bobby
Lee who was another guy that is one of

2195
02:07:16,751 --> 02:07:20,650
the best comics in the world and it's
fucking shame that Bobby Lee doesn't have

2196
02:07:20,651 --> 02:07:24,400
a special and he doesn't, you know, it's
like he's thing is like, well no, no,

2197
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:27,370
I won't be able to use that
in my mat material. Like yeah,

2198
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:28,750
but you'll write better stuff.

2199
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:32,580
Yeah. You'd be forced to. I think
he shooting a special though. Yes,

2200
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:36,190
he's talking about it. Yeah. Cause
he's, he asked me who directed mine,

2201
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,470
so I was like, oh wait a minute,
is Bobby about to shoot a special?

2202
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:43,740
But he'll see how what you've seen and
what I'm seeing now that how great it is

2203
02:07:47,231 --> 02:07:51,840
to like come up with a new set of
material with all their fillings.

2204
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:57,100
It's very terrifying. Yeah. I've had
some, uh, some amazing medio cassettes.

2205
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:02,710
Jesus. I feel bad. I love when
you first tried out new stuff.

2206
02:08:02,711 --> 02:08:05,800
It's like you don't know.
Yeah. You just don't know.

2207
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:08,350
And then you said something the
other day when we was in Vegas,

2208
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:13,030
he was talking to Allie like we was all
in the back after the show about how you

2209
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:17,560
had a joke that was new. It was working.
You wrote it, it's new, it's working.

2210
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,990
And then you broke it
by over fixing it. Yeah.

2211
02:08:20,050 --> 02:08:21,340
Then you have to take shit back out.

2212
02:08:21,341 --> 02:08:24,790
And that's happened to me during
this new set of material too.

2213
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:27,370
I started a joke, created it,

2214
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:30,490
and then broke it by
over doing stuff to it.

2215
02:08:30,491 --> 02:08:35,200
And then I have to like figure out what
part that I put in there that threw it

2216
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:38,800
off and take it out and fix it back. Well,

2217
02:08:38,801 --> 02:08:42,670
it's always interesting to talk to someone
that's really just a few years in a

2218
02:08:42,671 --> 02:08:46,470
comedy because then you got to go over
your own process and think about it more.

2219
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:49,990
Yeah. The one of the things
that happens in Jujitsu is

2220
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:53,420
in Jujitsu you get better when
you teach. It's a real strange,

2221
02:08:53,421 --> 02:08:56,960
like a lot of guys that wind up
getting a job teaching Jujitsu to like

2222
02:08:56,961 --> 02:09:01,070
beginners, they're Jujitsu jumps,
the jumps up several notches.

2223
02:09:01,071 --> 02:09:03,830
It's really interesting and I think
sometimes that happens with comedy.

2224
02:09:03,831 --> 02:09:06,500
So when we're dealing with selling
like Allie out to Allie Makowski,

2225
02:09:06,890 --> 02:09:09,800
our friend Alex, she's only been
doing comedy for what, four years?

2226
02:09:09,801 --> 02:09:13,400
Around somewhere around four or five
years and she's just coming into her own

2227
02:09:13,640 --> 02:09:15,230
and she's, what was she, 22.

2228
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:20,350
All right. 22 or 23. 22 or 23.
Very funny. Very promising.

2229
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:22,940
And uh, she, he was

2230
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:28,040
going to come down and watch us because
she came to San Diego to watch when Tony

2231
02:09:28,701 --> 02:09:32,600
and Andrew and I did that, uh, that
giant arena down there because she's,

2232
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:36,680
because she opens up for me all the time
at the Improv. And the comedy store.

2233
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:41,210
She's getting to be around all these
assassins and she's getting to see it from

2234
02:09:41,211 --> 02:09:45,380
the outside. But that was her
first time opening and I was like,

2235
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:46,980
it's cause she said she was going
to come down and watch. I said,

2236
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:49,250
you want to do a set? And she was like,
I was secretly hoping you would ask.

2237
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,460
I said all right, come on, can
we do this up? So she opened,

2238
02:09:52,461 --> 02:09:55,610
she did 10 minutes in front of,
you know, it's like 1200 people.

2239
02:09:55,611 --> 02:09:59,340
It's a lot of people for her first
big show in Vegas on a Friday night.

2240
02:09:59,341 --> 02:10:02,820
And she murdered and she did good.
She did great. Yeah, super relaxed.

2241
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:07,250
But when you talking to someone who's
a up and coming like that, I love that.

2242
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:12,050
I love, I love talking to like,
Hey Suze, hey Suze trio or like a,

2243
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:12,621
you know,

2244
02:10:12,621 --> 02:10:16,760
a Frank Castillo or any of these young
guys coming up because you get a chance

2245
02:10:16,761 --> 02:10:20,630
to talk to them about how you
formulate stuff and compare notes.

2246
02:10:20,631 --> 02:10:23,500
And sometimes they have interesting
ways that they deal with,

2247
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:24,920
cause I never considered, you know,

2248
02:10:24,921 --> 02:10:28,150
and sometimes people have interesting
ways of thinking about their mentality to

2249
02:10:28,190 --> 02:10:30,530
think about and when they go
walk their dog, they'll play,

2250
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:33,410
they're set in their ear or they'll,
you know, when they go on hikes,

2251
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:36,950
they'll just go on a hike and think about
one joke and try to work the joke out

2252
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:37,784
while they're hiking.

2253
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:39,640
You could have done that. Yeah.

2254
02:10:40,210 --> 02:10:42,430
I've learned a lot from by
talking to younger comics too,

2255
02:10:42,431 --> 02:10:43,720
so I get that completely.

2256
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:44,710
You also,

2257
02:10:44,710 --> 02:10:48,270
the thing that's happening to you right
now is a thing that happens to them

2258
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:52,170
except the fact that you're
far more skilled at it is
like they're trying to put

2259
02:10:52,171 --> 02:10:54,960
together an act. But you've
already done it many, many times.

2260
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:57,780
You've already put out specials and
records so that when you're doing this,

2261
02:10:57,781 --> 02:11:00,120
it's like you know how to write jokes.
You're always writing new jokes.

2262
02:11:00,121 --> 02:11:01,860
You've been doing comedy
forever, but it's still,

2263
02:11:01,861 --> 02:11:06,210
you're starting from jump when you
start from zero, from ground zero like,

2264
02:11:06,211 --> 02:11:09,000
and then you try to put together an act
that you hope people want to pay to see

2265
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:10,213
that as a dare.

2266
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:11,810
Yeah, it's terrifying. Yeah.

2267
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:16,130
And then there was a part of it in this
new set of material that I was doing

2268
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:20,900
wrong. Like, like just this
style of joke that I was writing.

2269
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:25,980
I just felt off like even when some of
the bits were working and then I was in

2270
02:11:26,151 --> 02:11:31,010
Atlanta a few weeks ago and then it
just hit me what I was doing wrong.

2271
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:35,750
I was the laughing skull. Yeah.
I was the one laughing. So yeah,

2272
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:39,890
it's a dope ass club to help little room
and it's a great room to go headline.

2273
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:45,160
And when you're like got new material
that you'd need to just work out.

2274
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:50,910
Yeah. I say about those rooms like the
belly room and like the laughing's call,

2275
02:11:50,911 --> 02:11:54,370
like that's where you find out
what's bullshit. Yeah. And I,

2276
02:11:54,570 --> 02:11:57,260
and I found out what was
pool of Shit for sure.

2277
02:11:57,980 --> 02:12:01,670
Sometimes you can like song and dance
your way through the 300 seat room.

2278
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:05,480
Check them like enough people start
laughing to get the other people laughing

2279
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:05,800
but,

2280
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:09,760
and then you'll kind of go along with it
and with your delivery and you can kind

2281
02:12:09,761 --> 02:12:13,400
of make funny out of it, but there's
no momentum with 70 people. Yeah.

2282
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:16,670
You have to like really make them
laugh. It's gotta be real. Yeah.

2283
02:12:16,820 --> 02:12:20,090
Was 70 people you got, you know,

2284
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:24,070
I did a Jeremiah walk-in show,
stand up on the spot on Tuesday.

2285
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:28,860
That's the best example of that because
you're also there yelling out subjects,

2286
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,501
you know,

2287
02:12:29,501 --> 02:12:34,501
and so you just get to and you find
out and find and but that also like

2288
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:35,890
constructing a new set.

2289
02:12:35,891 --> 02:12:39,880
What's interesting about it is that you
get a chance to figure something out and

2290
02:12:39,881 --> 02:12:40,780
make it real.

2291
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:45,610
What like Bobby Lee's doing right now
is working with tried and true material.

2292
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:49,690
Tried and proven. He kills every
night. He knows it's going to kill.

2293
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,440
If it didn't kill, he'd be stunned. Right.
He'd be like, what? This is my shit.

2294
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:55,900
I've been killing with this for four
years. He knows what he's doing.

2295
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:57,940
He's just a funny machine.

2296
02:12:58,490 --> 02:13:01,690
So like, I don't even know how
to describe it just is just him.

2297
02:13:01,691 --> 02:13:03,880
He's just a funny ass fucking, yeah.

2298
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,670
So funny. And people don't,
not enough people know.

2299
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,640
Cause most people know them from
podcasts and that helps for sure.

2300
02:13:09,641 --> 02:13:11,530
And from television shows
that helps for sure.

2301
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:15,020
But that needs to be something people
could see of his stand up. Yeah. So we're,

2302
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:19,060
we're getting them, he's listening.
It's like he's a slow, but he'll listen.

2303
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:22,120
Take a little time. He listens. It's
getting in there. It's getting in there.

2304
02:13:22,121 --> 02:13:25,900
It's too good. It's still good. The
other ones, Owen Smith. Yeah. Yes. Oh,

2305
02:13:25,901 --> 02:13:30,640
and Smith good to good. Has
his own style. Fucking funny.

2306
02:13:30,700 --> 02:13:34,920
He's a, yeah man. He's a
top flight headliner. Yeah.

2307
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:38,650
Like a good headliner. Like a top
of the food chain headlines. Yeah.

2308
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:42,870
Like if someone told me Owen Smith was
selling out arenas, I'd be like, good.

2309
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:45,900
It should have been happened in
a long time. Exactly. You know,

2310
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:50,490
and as much as Kevin Hart or
fucking fill in the blank,

2311
02:13:50,491 --> 02:13:55,380
whoever can sell out giant ass places
and Smith's material is as good as it.

2312
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,500
The songs in those places. A
hundred percent hundred percent.

2313
02:13:58,501 --> 02:14:01,320
And sometimes these
guys, they just don't do,

2314
02:14:01,950 --> 02:14:05,790
they don't do enough a road
work or they don't do enough.

2315
02:14:06,290 --> 02:14:10,680
They'd got writing jobs or something
takes them off the path where people don't

2316
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:15,270
necessarily see, they do a lot of
acting. It's all different little paths.

2317
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:20,290
It kind of deviate you away from, from
stand up. Right. And I think I went back,

2318
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,780
went down that path when I was on fear
factor. Oh yeah. It was on fear factor.

2319
02:14:23,810 --> 02:14:25,470
I didn't really tour much, you know,

2320
02:14:25,471 --> 02:14:29,430
it was mostly just being around la cause
it was, we're filming so much film,

2321
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:33,540
so many episodes. And you guys traveled
a lot to different places. Yeah. Yeah.

2322
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:37,350
That shit is exhausting,
man. Exhausting. Yeah.

2323
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:40,080
And it was exhausting too
because you'd be filming all day,

2324
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:44,130
you'd be out in the heat and then
you would come back and you know,

2325
02:14:44,131 --> 02:14:46,560
after that I would do standup
at night and I was just like,

2326
02:14:46,561 --> 02:14:48,780
I'm just going to just do
the store and then go home.

2327
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:52,350
I wasn't going to travel anywhere
I a little bit, but not much.

2328
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:57,570
So it's like things can be good where
it's like it's great to have a good Gig,

2329
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:58,650
but things,

2330
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:02,100
those things can be bad
cause it ultimately takes
you away from your standup.

2331
02:15:02,510 --> 02:15:04,410
You know what I mean? Lucy
Kay said that to me once.

2332
02:15:04,411 --> 02:15:09,411
He was in the period after he stopped
doing his show and he just stopped doing

2333
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:11,850
it for awhile and I said,

2334
02:15:11,851 --> 02:15:15,340
I haven't done anything other than
stand up for a year. And I said, well,

2335
02:15:15,590 --> 02:15:16,620
wouldn't, what made you do that? He goes,

2336
02:15:16,621 --> 02:15:18,900
I just wanted to really
concentrate on standup. He said,

2337
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:22,890
I don't think you could be at your best
while you do other things. He goes,

2338
02:15:22,891 --> 02:15:23,910
I think you could be good,

2339
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:28,170
but I think at your best you really have
to just do standup. I think he's right.

2340
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:29,093
Oh he's right.

2341
02:15:29,190 --> 02:15:34,190
Even if you don't do much in that day
and if you just write one line or one tag

2342
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,550
or something as just,

2343
02:15:35,730 --> 02:15:40,590
it just counts so much towards the whole
thing and by the end of the year where

2344
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:44,100
you, where you end up is going to be
way further than you would have been.

2345
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:46,860
I think it's not an even formula though,

2346
02:15:46,861 --> 02:15:51,060
because I do think that there's some
value in taking some time and doing things

2347
02:15:51,061 --> 02:15:54,720
as well. There's like there's
value in like vacations,

2348
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:59,350
there's value in experiences and then
there's also you have to do a lot of stand

2349
02:15:59,351 --> 02:16:03,300
up. This is like both things are
true because if you only do stand up,

2350
02:16:03,301 --> 02:16:06,240
one of the things that does happen is
guys lose their point of references

2351
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,880
because their whole life
revolves around traveling.

2352
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:13,140
So you get a lot of airplane jokes
and it revolves around drinking.

2353
02:16:13,141 --> 02:16:15,720
Cause people drink at clubs. You
don't have enough experiences.

2354
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:20,010
You gotta live a little yes, yes. To
put it on the paper. Yeah. On stage.

2355
02:16:20,310 --> 02:16:23,940
You gotta live a little. I think that's
a, that's something that gets missed,

2356
02:16:23,941 --> 02:16:25,770
but it's like, it's not a perfect formula.

2357
02:16:25,771 --> 02:16:30,220
It's also like how much enthusiasm do
you have? Like sometimes more enthusiasm,

2358
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:31,053
like when you have,

2359
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:34,210
you feel good about it when you take
time off and it makes you better. Right.

2360
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,010
It's just hard to know. It's just like
an athlete. Like, like in England,

2361
02:16:39,011 --> 02:16:43,420
the soccer season is over, right? So
the soccer players go on vacation,

2362
02:16:43,690 --> 02:16:47,620
but while they're on vacation,
you gotta get in a month or so.

2363
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:51,520
You've got to get back to
training in a month or so.

2364
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:55,600
But you can't go back
to camp out of shape.

2365
02:16:55,690 --> 02:17:00,130
So there's a point where you have to
be with a trainer while you're kind of

2366
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:03,880
offered a season getting in shape
so that when you go to camp,

2367
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:07,510
your not out of shape and you
losing your spot on it. Is this,

2368
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:11,470
this or this is a delicate
balance of everything. Yeah,

2369
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:14,890
that makes sense. And also so
insanely competitive, right?

2370
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:17,740
There's so many people lined up,
but you take your spot. Yeah,

2371
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:21,670
you can't get fat when you're on vacation.
So it's comedies like when you, uh,

2372
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:27,000
shoot a special and then the guy that
couldn't follow you is killing because he

2373
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:33,871
still has his material that he's been
had and you're like not doing as good

2374
02:17:34,121 --> 02:17:36,460
because you're working
on shit. It kind of,

2375
02:17:36,820 --> 02:17:40,060
it kind of fucks with me a little
bit. Yeah. You know what I mean?

2376
02:17:40,061 --> 02:17:43,150
Just to competitiveness offshore.
And then I said, hey man,

2377
02:17:43,151 --> 02:17:47,870
this is just a natural order. Things
just keep doing what you're doing and,

2378
02:17:48,060 --> 02:17:50,500
and everything is going to be
fine. You would figure it out.

2379
02:17:50,501 --> 02:17:52,720
You're growing again. There's
nothing wrong with that.

2380
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:57,190
Whenever new bits come to life and
they start to really work, I go, okay,

2381
02:17:57,580 --> 02:18:00,700
this just trusting the process. This
is what happens. You trust the process,

2382
02:18:00,701 --> 02:18:03,840
keep grinding, but you have to
do that. If there is no, if,

2383
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:07,810
if you don't put in that time, if you
just decide, oh, I need a new act,

2384
02:18:07,811 --> 02:18:12,460
but you don't work on it, it's not going
to just show up. Uh, seems you have to,

2385
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:15,670
you have to make that process
is a real thing. Right.

2386
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:18,340
And there's going to be
subsets. Just a care man

2387
02:18:20,640 --> 02:18:23,260
for sure. Like, yeah, like yeah,

2388
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:28,500
you take one old joke on stage
and there's butter it add to it.

2389
02:18:29,831 --> 02:18:30,430
Yeah,

2390
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:34,480
but one thing is true for sure for me
who sent when someone like you is writing

2391
02:18:34,481 --> 02:18:37,300
new stuff and that new stuff
kills like this past weekend.

2392
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:41,290
That makes me excited about
writing new shit. I go, oh my God,

2393
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:43,510
there it's out there. I've got to
find it. I got to find the bits.

2394
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:47,550
They're out there. Look, he just
found two giant juicy giant drinks.

2395
02:18:47,630 --> 02:18:50,950
It's like someone come back from a
fishing trip. Oh good. The guys that tuna,

2396
02:18:50,951 --> 02:18:54,100
I'm calling toner Fisher. It's
out there. It's out there.

2397
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:56,410
There's gold in San Francisco.
Yeah, let's go dig it.

2398
02:18:56,650 --> 02:19:00,160
It's cold in them there hills. But I
always see you go find new material,

2399
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,050
so it's always good. Like,

2400
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:06,520
like we both had new shit this weekend
and we're enthusiastic about it and

2401
02:19:06,521 --> 02:19:07,390
excited about it.

2402
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:12,160
So it adds a different level to just
going out to do a show that we would

2403
02:19:12,161 --> 02:19:12,994
normally do.

2404
02:19:13,390 --> 02:19:17,560
We get to talk about it afterwards with
the excitement of how new the material

2405
02:19:17,561 --> 02:19:20,440
is and how it's coming
along and it just, that's,

2406
02:19:20,710 --> 02:19:23,390
that's a level of fun right there.
You don't experience unless you're,

2407
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:26,560
you're out there writing and growing.
Yeah. There's no other way around it.

2408
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:28,340
And I think a metaphor

2409
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:29,173
for life.

2410
02:19:29,330 --> 02:19:32,900
I think the people that get stagnant in
life things cause you're not taking any

2411
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:36,080
chances. You're not doing anything new.
You're not growing. Yeah. You've got to,

2412
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:38,180
I mean, and artistically with stand up,

2413
02:19:38,181 --> 02:19:41,570
it's one of the rare art forms
where you cannot do the old stuff.

2414
02:19:41,810 --> 02:19:45,290
They don't want, I mean, maybe if Jim
Gaffigan people want to hear hot pockets,

2415
02:19:45,470 --> 02:19:47,450
but they also want to
hear an hour, a new shit.

2416
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:50,390
You maybe if you're Bert Kreischer,
they want to hear the machine story.

2417
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,880
He says they get mad if you don't.
He doesn't tell the machines,

2418
02:19:52,881 --> 02:19:54,870
tells the machine store,
take his shirt off. They,

2419
02:19:55,240 --> 02:19:58,730
he's mad at his clothes when he starts
taking his pants off and then just puts

2420
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:03,290
him back on. I'm like, Hey, fucking
pants off while you pants on, bro.

2421
02:20:03,350 --> 02:20:07,790
How dare you. It's free. That'd
be his new shirt, party and pants.

2422
02:20:07,790 --> 02:20:12,730
Free Party with no pants or partying
pants. Free Party and pants. Pants.

2423
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:15,050
Yeah, Bert Kreischer. There you go.

2424
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:18,650
That's maybe a new special party
and pants free. Just you fas.

2425
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:22,470
Fuck with boxer shorts. They're
talking shit about sober October wise.

2426
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:26,390
It'd be way better tidy white. Go
all in. Yeah, but boxer shorts,

2427
02:20:26,450 --> 02:20:30,300
when he moves funny, his dick hole will
open up a little bit and get a peer.

2428
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:34,230
Mr Speedos. Well, how about just speedos?

2429
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:39,440
How about Bert onstage of speedos on
speedos? Don't seem like a comfort move.

2430
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,340
Seems like a bad decision.

2431
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:45,260
That's not someone who really wants
their Dick to be caressed and cradled

2432
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:48,730
details are like you're punishing
your deck. Fucking took your,

2433
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:53,510
it's like a tent in a storm and nail it
down. Punishing it or showing it off,

2434
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:58,400
right? Yeah. If you got to hog.
Yeah. Penis enlargement by speedos.

2435
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:59,840
Yeah, just put a,

2436
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:03,500
just take your circumcised Dick and
pull it all the way down so it's a full

2437
02:21:03,501 --> 02:21:07,400
erection. Hey Man. And then put a ring,

2438
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:10,840
a rubber ring around the base of the
balls to contract all the blood or

2439
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:13,460
constrict all the blood. Yeah.

2440
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,470
That's a weird thing that someone figured
that out, right? Cock rings. Yeah.

2441
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:19,790
Hmm. How do I, uh, how
do I stay hard here?

2442
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:24,080
It's gotta be a way to put a rubber
band. The praise your Dick. Try our grow.

2443
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:27,650
Yeah. Yikes. Yeah.

2444
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,570
That's the one thing that
if they do ever come up, I,

2445
02:21:31,571 --> 02:21:32,900
I used to have a bit about that.

2446
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:37,960
If they ever come up with a pill for how
to look a boner or a a dick enlargement

2447
02:21:38,690 --> 02:21:41,870
pill, that actually works.
It'd be 30 seconds later.

2448
02:21:41,871 --> 02:21:46,640
The first dude would die of an
overdose. Oh yeah. Just take one.

2449
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:50,240
You're going to find out how many,
give me a stroke. How Big One.

2450
02:21:50,241 --> 02:21:53,090
The one that Jesus
Christ, y'all had a hole.

2451
02:21:53,150 --> 02:21:58,100
There was a whole sequence where women
would evolve because people just don't

2452
02:21:58,101 --> 02:21:58,650
have sex,

2453
02:21:58,650 --> 02:22:01,880
but the dicks would get bigger and then
Ryan would develop these flying Squirrel

2454
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:02,810
pussies.

2455
02:22:02,810 --> 02:22:05,990
They would just jump off cliffs to get
away from dudes who were chasing after

2456
02:22:06,110 --> 02:22:09,530
them with their big dicks and
shopping carts, Solaris grow wings.

2457
02:22:09,531 --> 02:22:13,970
Why are women growing wings?
Just to fit so people could make,

2458
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:17,150
yeah. Yeah. If you could grow a big, like,

2459
02:22:17,360 --> 02:22:21,560
have you ever watched a porn and said,
that's just too much. Yeah. Yeah.

2460
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:25,230
It's like this comes a certain point in
time where like how big do you want your

2461
02:22:25,231 --> 02:22:26,800
arms, right? Yes.

2462
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:30,180
You want a big arm or do you want an
arm where the bicep touches your fingers

2463
02:22:30,181 --> 02:22:33,420
when you go like this? Right. Do you
want that? Oh, you can't even move. Yeah.

2464
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:36,790
That's crazy. It's too big. Yeah.
Right. Does that mean send me,

2465
02:22:36,791 --> 02:22:39,450
you can never do this. You just
do anything like this now. Yeah.

2466
02:22:39,451 --> 02:22:41,790
You probably can't even walk.
Yeah. You're just too heavy.

2467
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:44,970
You probably waddling everywhere you go.
You weigh 600 pounds and you're five,

2468
02:22:44,971 --> 02:22:49,140
eight. How the fuck are you doing that
right? There is a, there's too much.

2469
02:22:49,170 --> 02:22:51,660
You can get too much. Yeah,
you can get too much dick,

2470
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:57,540
but I bet it's like you get too
much. Those girls who get, uh,

2471
02:22:57,660 --> 02:23:01,620
body dysmorphia with their
breast size. Some girls go crazy,

2472
02:23:01,621 --> 02:23:05,640
like they have triple e's and they need
them an f, they get nuts. It's crazy.

2473
02:23:05,641 --> 02:23:07,320
They don't see it like
the way you're saying it.

2474
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:12,070
That's how it happens with
anorexics bodybuilders. Yeah.

2475
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:14,460
And this God Damn Bananas.

2476
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:19,440
It is the Dick things to
weird one. Right. Yeah.

2477
02:23:19,441 --> 02:23:20,011
That will definitely,

2478
02:23:20,011 --> 02:23:25,011
it's definitely gonna happen since women
overdo it with their breast size and

2479
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:30,660
like you say, they can't see
how weird it looks. Yeah.

2480
02:23:30,661 --> 02:23:31,860
It's a normal thing with humans.

2481
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:36,750
If you've seen those guys that inject
their muscles with oil and it makes their

2482
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:41,580
muscles swell up like balloons, it looks
so fake, but they don't see it there.

2483
02:23:41,970 --> 02:23:43,510
It's body dysmorphia. Yeah.

2484
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:46,830
The thing that an anorexic gets when
they don't recognize that they're there

2485
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:47,933
look like a skeleton.

2486
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:51,990
When was at the airport in Vegas
and waiting for your pool thing.

2487
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:57,260
There was this chick and she had like a
weird but poor girl and it wasn't real

2488
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,960
and you could tell only she didn't
know that it didn't look real.

2489
02:24:04,050 --> 02:24:05,670
She probably thought it
looked amazing. Right? Yeah.

2490
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,520
She's walking around with like
button every confidence that yeah,

2491
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:15,000
people get strange because the butt thing
is treated differently than the boob

2492
02:24:15,001 --> 02:24:19,650
thing. Like a woman with really
large fake breasts is still hot.

2493
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:24,210
Yes. But a woman with really large
fake butts like come on. Yeah.

2494
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:28,170
That's comes off crazier.
Yeah. And Fake Lips.

2495
02:24:28,550 --> 02:24:31,860
So another one. That's crazy
too. Yeah, and we have rules.

2496
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:37,050
It's weird. Yeah. Fake Lips. It's like,

2497
02:24:37,860 --> 02:24:38,970
what am I supposed to do?

2498
02:24:38,971 --> 02:24:42,770
Just pretend this is not happening in
front of me right now. Well it's also,

2499
02:24:42,900 --> 02:24:45,920
it fucks with your, apparently we have an,

2500
02:24:46,170 --> 02:24:50,010
when we see a certain person when
see people's faces, we have a,

2501
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:54,330
an expectation where things are going
to be based on where things are. Right.

2502
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:57,750
It's all like the Fibonacci
sequence, like the golden ratio,

2503
02:24:57,751 --> 02:25:00,840
the way your face is designed
like, like Ari Shaffir.

2504
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:04,050
If RSU figure had a tiny nose, you'd
be like, what is wrong with your face?

2505
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:06,240
Your face is big nose.

2506
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:10,290
This is like how your style of face is
supposed to come with that style or no.

2507
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:14,140
If it doesn't, it's weird. But then you
look at a guy like Greg Fitzsimmons,

2508
02:25:14,330 --> 02:25:17,010
his little nose, you know, if he
had Ari's nose, you'd be like,

2509
02:25:17,011 --> 02:25:21,600
what is that nose doing on your face?
It's crazy. It's like you fuck with that.

2510
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:24,070
When you do something to make something

2511
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:28,090
bigger or wider or you know
with, with your face, you know,

2512
02:25:28,091 --> 02:25:29,890
people get tattoos and different things.

2513
02:25:29,891 --> 02:25:32,980
I suppose people start in
large in areas of their face.

2514
02:25:32,981 --> 02:25:36,520
You just like getting
big ears, big of noses.

2515
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:41,290
Who would have big ears come into
frame Dumbo ears thing. Well,

2516
02:25:41,291 --> 02:25:43,200
how about those holes
where people stretch,

2517
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:47,170
they do those ages and they pull their
fucking ear hole out. The put the,

2518
02:25:47,190 --> 02:25:49,240
that earring hole at the bottom.

2519
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:52,840
Make it giant like a hoop that's bananas.

2520
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:55,060
Like what are you doing
to your ears? Yeah.

2521
02:25:55,810 --> 02:25:59,950
Like I don't want to fuck up the chance
of me not be able to hear some shit.

2522
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:03,010
I don't think he does.
I don't think it's just,

2523
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:08,110
I'm not doing anything personally
close to anything that I need.

2524
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:12,640
I need this for what I need this for.
I'm not going to do anything to it.

2525
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,010
That might jeopardize it in any way.

2526
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:17,530
I always feel like that
about cauliflower here too.

2527
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:19,850
They go to all the years
that I did Jujitsu,

2528
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:22,740
I don't have cauliflower here because
I always wore ear guards, right?

2529
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:26,590
It's like if you fuck with
the shape of your ear,

2530
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:28,720
it fucks with the way sound goes in there.

2531
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:34,330
Like take your ear and then talk, go
blah, blah, blah. Now put your tip,

2532
02:26:34,331 --> 02:26:38,230
the tips of your fingers on the top of
your ear and then fold them down. La, la,

2533
02:26:38,231 --> 02:26:42,120
la, la, la, la, la. It changes
the way sounds changes.

2534
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:45,860
Sound like this helps sound. These
are speakers. These are bows, right?

2535
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:48,850
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You
fucking with your boat, your bows,

2536
02:26:49,660 --> 02:26:50,351
it's the shape.

2537
02:26:50,351 --> 02:26:54,700
Nature figured out a shape to collect
all that sound and get it inside your ear

2538
02:26:54,701 --> 02:26:58,270
holes, but when you're outside
of your ears like a rock,

2539
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,120
like a lot of these wrestlers
or Jujitsu guys, they have,

2540
02:27:01,330 --> 02:27:04,850
it's all calcified so that
with that cauliflower ear on,

2541
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:08,440
if you ever touched a call for a year,
it's like a rock under the surface.

2542
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:13,180
Calcium rock. That's what it's
like because the, it's what it is.

2543
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:14,530
It's the break in the skin.

2544
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:19,560
It swells up because it bleeds and then
that blood calcifies and hardens and the

2545
02:27:21,401 --> 02:27:26,320
only way to fix my friend
Brett had his fixed, um, Brent,

2546
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:31,060
um, Brent, my friend Brent had affected,
they had a cut his ear like a fish.

2547
02:27:31,061 --> 02:27:35,490
They had a full plant and then they had
to open it up and scrape out all the

2548
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:37,960
hard tissue and then
sew it back up together.

2549
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:42,670
And he couldn't do Jujitsu forever
because if he did Jujitsu again after the

2550
02:27:42,671 --> 02:27:45,960
operation, it would break open and
start bleeding again. Pam? Yeah.

2551
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:48,760
I was looking for a picture
where a guy gets this part.

2552
02:27:49,270 --> 02:27:52,090
I've seen people with a plug in a
hole on the inner part here. Oh,

2553
02:27:52,091 --> 02:27:56,620
I've seen that. Yeah. But this
guy took it to a whole spot home,

2554
02:27:58,020 --> 02:28:01,260
knows he'd sit, oh my God,

2555
02:28:03,180 --> 02:28:06,550
that definitely had flux with
his hearing. 100% oh yeah, 100%.

2556
02:28:06,610 --> 02:28:11,610
He's got a giant gage hole in the bottom
and a medium gauge hole in the top.

2557
02:28:12,041 --> 02:28:16,150
And then big ones on his
nostrils where his nostrils,

2558
02:28:16,151 --> 02:28:18,520
he has like the bottom hole
where his nostrils are.

2559
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:23,330
And then the above the nostros get
to holes. We can see the Septum,

2560
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:27,170
the opened up the side of his nostril,
quarter size hole easily. Right.

2561
02:28:27,171 --> 02:28:30,650
I can't say that dude's real
happy. I just don't see it.

2562
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:35,540
I don't understand that look. But Hey,
hey man, what are you going to do?

2563
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:42,410
Ian Edwards will be with me
with Dave Chappelle Coma,

2564
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:46,070
Washington and then Salt Lake
City Salt Lake City the next day,

2565
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:50,390
which is August 3rd tickets
just went on sale. Um,

2566
02:28:50,450 --> 02:28:53,540
I don't think so. I think
they're on sale on Friday. Yeah,

2567
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:56,030
but they went on presale.
The Way Dave does it,

2568
02:28:56,031 --> 02:29:00,950
you have to register as a
legit fan, like a human being.

2569
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:03,290
They have to make sure that
you're not a ticket agency.

2570
02:29:03,460 --> 02:29:06,500
This scalp on these tickets and buying
them up in mass and then selling them

2571
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:08,440
back. So Ian Edwards, it would have to be,

2572
02:29:08,441 --> 02:29:10,070
you have to show your
driver's license or something.

2573
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:13,790
I don't know how they verify it,
but, and then once you register,

2574
02:29:13,791 --> 02:29:17,660
then you could buy the tickets and
it's for those people for a while.

2575
02:29:17,661 --> 02:29:19,040
And then after that,

2576
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:21,530
then it's opened up to the general
public or the thing on Saturday.

2577
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:25,370
Something like that. But a,
Ian's going to be with me.

2578
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:29,150
Don L I don't know Rollins. Yeah. I
don't know if that's been announced,

2579
02:29:29,151 --> 02:29:31,220
but I just announced it. Donald
Rollins going to be there too.

2580
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:33,810
I'm fucking pumped. We're going to
have some fast going to be crazy.

2581
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:36,260
That was going to be wild. That's
going to be fucking crazy, bro.

2582
02:29:37,070 --> 02:29:39,740
This weekend was crazy. That weekend
is going to be fucking great.

2583
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:44,540
Tacoma sold out in a day. 20,000
people. It's going to be nuts. No sleep.

2584
02:29:44,690 --> 02:29:47,180
I'm not expecting any sleep. No,
we're going to have some fun.

2585
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:51,620
It's going to be crazy. All right,
so, uh, tell people you're special.

2586
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:54,740
