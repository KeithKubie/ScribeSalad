00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.500
NARRATOR: For decades, Russia
was the center

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.960
of a global communist powerhouse
until, almost overnight,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.380
it fully embraced capitalism.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.040
COMMERCIAL NARRATOR:
[speaking russian]

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.790
NARRATOR: By the
1980s, the Soviet

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.000
Union was experiencing a period
of increased economic distress.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.080
Corruption and a
lack of a free market

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.210
were crippling a country that
had been under communist rule

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.880
for the last 60-plus years.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.250
General secretary of the
Communist Party Mikhail

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
Gorbachev advocated
for two new initiatives

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880
to modernize the Soviet Union.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.330
Glasnost, an increase in
bureaucratic transparency,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.710
also allowed citizens to
voice their opposition

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.920
against the government
more freely.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.750
Perestroika, a
restructuring of the USSR's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.080
political and economic
systems, freed

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.830
up some government control of
pricing and state monopolies.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.250
While these unfolded, Boris
Yeltsin, an anticorruption

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.580
crusader and a former
Gorbachev ally,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.540
emerged as Gorbachev's
chief critic.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.750
BORIS YELTSIN:
[speaking russian]

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.710
NARRATOR: Glasnost
and perestroika

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.460
proved to be too much change
in a too short amount of time

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580
for the precarious nation.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.710
Gorbachev resigned on
Christmas Day, 1991,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.040
handing over the
reins to Yeltsin.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.750
The Soviet Union formally
dissolved the following day.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.790
At the behest of
Western advisors,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.790
Yeltsin quickly
imposed a variety

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.920
of policies meant to
dramatically shift

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.420
Russia towards capitalism.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.830
This shock therapy,
as it became known,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.920
deregulated the prices of
goods, opened up the country

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.580
to imports, and privatized many
industries that had once been

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.580
controlled by the government.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.500
However, these efforts fared
even worse than Gorbachev's.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.750
[speaking russian]

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.250
INTERPRETER: The
government's to blame,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.500
and so we have to stand
here selling our clothes.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.330
NARRATOR: Hyperinflation
took hold.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
The value of the
ruble plummeted.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.580
Unemployment doubled, and
industrial output was halved.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.420
But it was the
hasty privatization

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420
of formerly state-held
corporations

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.790
that had the longest-lasting
negative consequences.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.830
The government offered
the public vouchers

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.620
to buy shares in
these companies,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.170
but they were mostly snatched
up by wealthy Russians

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.120
with mountains of cash.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540
This gave rise to
a new oligarchy,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.380
a handful of tycoons
that controlled

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.210
Russia's most important
industries and a large portion

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.540
of its wealth.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.380
The seven most powerful
of these oligarchs

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.290
became known as the
[russian] or seven bankers.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.880
They claimed to have direct
influence over the highest

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.460
levels of politics, including
Yeltsin himself, while also

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.880
controlling the majority
of Russia's banks,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.330
oil, gas, mining,
and media operations.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.330
Corruption and organized crime
were allowed to proliferate,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.960
and Yeltsin's tenure was
riddled with the very problems

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.790
he had promised to remove.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.790
By 1998, the Russian government
was failing to repay its loans,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.040
sometimes to the very
oligarchs running

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.880
the government in the shadows.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.750
All of this turmoil
significantly

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.670
eroded the public's faith
in their new government.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.500
The Russian people yearned
for a strong leader

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.750
to take them into
the 21st century.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.250
Now Boris Yeltsin who
succeeded in making history

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.920
yet again by being the first
ever Russian leader to step

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.420
down voluntarily
rather than die or be

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.880
forcibly removed from office.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.710
NARRATOR: When he resigned
on New Year's Eve, 1999,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.040
Boris Yeltsin named his prime
minister, Vladimir Putin,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.380
as acting president.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.710
Putin has been Russia's
leader ever since,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.710
through four presidential
terms with a return

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.210
to the office of prime
minister in between.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.920
At first, Putin instituted
liberal policies

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.620
that pushed the
country even further

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620
towards free-market capitalism.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.290
He built up Russia's
cash and gold reserves,

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.920
introduced a flat-rate income
tax, lowered business taxes,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.880
and reduced regulation.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.120
The life of the average Russian
finally began to improve,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.120
and Russia's GDP reversed
its downward trend.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.880
But Putin's free market
wasn't truly free.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.960
It was a hybrid approach that
combined the Soviet-era idea

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.540
of state-owned corporations
with the oligarchy

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.540
that took shape
under Yeltsin, what

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.250
many called crony capitalism.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.290
The Russian government began
to retake control in industries

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.250
it had privatized less
than 15 years earlier--

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.210
energy, media,
banking, aviation,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.790
and construction, among others.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.460
Putin pushed out many of the
oligarchs that had prospered

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.500
under Yeltsin, handing control
of these new, partially

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.290
state-controlled corporations to
a new generation of oligarchs,

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.460
his own inner circle
of former KGB officials

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.830
and political boosters who
helped Putin's rise to power.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.960
He allowed these
oligarchs to thrive

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.120
under a grand bargain of sorts.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.920
The oligarchs could
retain their wealth

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.620
as long as they
supported Putin's

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.330
increasingly authoritarian grip
over the Russian government.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.960
A few oligarchs have fallen
out of favor with Putin,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.460
forcing them to flee
into exile and resulting

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.830
in several suspicious deaths.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.670
MAN: The family is still
suspicious of the view

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.880
that Mr. Berezovsky
took his own life.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.460
NARRATOR: Today, the
majority of Russia's economy

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.830
is controlled by
state corporations,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.170
which are in turn controlled
by this class of oligarchs.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.210
But the country's
economic performance

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.000
has been a mixed bag.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.710
The economy is overly reliant
on volatile oil and gas exports.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.540
Blatant corruption permeates
every level of government,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.290
and sanctions are
always a threat

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.000
due to Vladimir
Putin's aggressive

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.460
and sometimes illegal
geopolitical activities.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.880
Putin's capitalism largely
benefits the Russian people,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.040
but it has definitely
worked out very

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.040
well for the hand-selected few.
