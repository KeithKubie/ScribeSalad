00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.150
TODD KERPELMAN: Hey
there, everybody.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.240
Todd Kerpelman here at
the Accessibility section

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.200
of the Sandbox.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.602
And I am joined by Patrick
Clary, who is a product

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:17.560
manager here at Google.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.160
Hi, Patrick.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.390
PATRICK CLARY: Hi,
how's it going?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.015
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
going pretty well.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.567
So tell us what's going on here
at the Accessibility Sandbox.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:24.400
PATRICK CLARY: Yeah.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.490
So in the Sandbox, we're
doing various things.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.010
We're showing demos of Liftware.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.920
We're showing off some of our
wheelchair accessible transit

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.870
directions we have
in Google Maps.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.080
We're showing off our automated
captioning for YouTube.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.867
We're doing accessibility
design reviews over here.

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:43.450
And we're also showing a brand
new product, which we announced

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.129
yesterday, called Lookout.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:45.920
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.753
And what is Lookout?

00:00:46.753 --> 00:00:47.830
Tell me more about that.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.830
PATRICK CLARY: So Lookout
is a product for users

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.070
who are blind and low vision.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.780
And the goal is to
help them become

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.505
aware of physical objects in the
space around them, for example,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:01:00.190
people that might be present,
a text in their environment,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.867
and also physical
objects or products.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:05.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Can we see a
demo of Lookout, telling us

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.302
what's in our environment?

00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:07.760
PATRICK CLARY:
Yeah, let's do that.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.820
So I have the app here.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.450
And I'll go ahead
and select the icon.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.270
And then for this, I'll
select an experimental mode

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.820
because that's
kind of fun, right?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.090
And we'll see what it shows.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.090
SPEAKER 3: (ON PHONE)
Drink with text NB18 NOND.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.541
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.540
PATRICK CLARY: So it
detected some text on that,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.340
and it read it out.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.010
As you can see, it
said Murphy, which is

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.415
the brand of wine we have here.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:33.540
Let me point it at this
glass and see what it does.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.020
SPEAKER 3: (ON PHONE)
Wine glass at 12 o'clock.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.610
TODD KERPELMAN: So what else
can you do with Lookout?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.235
PATRICK CLARY: Well,
what's interesting

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.200
about Lookout is it's
designed to basically be worn.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.660
So we can put it in
a lanyard like this.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.880
And this allows the user
to be hands-free and just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.690
engage in their activity.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.000
And there's controls
that facilitate this.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.310
So for example, if I want
to start recognition,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.120
I can knock on the device.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.817
And then if I want
to pause recognition,

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:02.775
I can cover the camera.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.450
There we go.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.490
TODD KERPELMAN: And if
I'm interested in trying

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.380
Lookout, where would
I be able to get it?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.350
PATRICK CLARY: Yeah, So we'll be
rolling out to trusted testers

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.540
pretty soon here.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.250
And you can go to
google.com/accessibility

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.590
to sign up for a
trusted tester spot.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.600
And then later this
year, we'll be pushing it

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.870
to the Play Store.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.870
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so be on the lookout.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.190
Ha, see what I did there?

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.630
I said look.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.790
Be on the lookout for
Lookout coming soon

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.127
to a Play Store near you.

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:32.960
Thank you, very much,
Patrick, for the tour.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.335
PATRICK CLARY:
Yeah, my pleasure.

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:37.572
