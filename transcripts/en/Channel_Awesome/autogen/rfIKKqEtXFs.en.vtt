00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:23.870 align:start position:0%
first half more than the second but it's
 

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.290 align:start position:0%
first half more than the second but it's
still<00:20:24.230><c> like</c><00:20:24.590><c> I</c><00:20:24.680><c> said</c><00:20:24.860><c> nothing</c><00:20:25.370><c> nothing</c><00:20:26.180><c> is</c>

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:44.210 align:start position:0%
it I think the 3d is just as good and
 

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.580 align:start position:0%
it I think the 3d is just as good and
there's<00:20:44.360><c> much</c><00:20:44.600><c> more</c><00:20:44.630><c> of</c><00:20:44.930><c> the</c><00:20:44.990><c> flying</c><00:20:45.260><c> scenes</c>

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
there's much more of the flying scenes
 

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's much more of the flying scenes
and<00:20:45.860><c> I</c><00:20:46.190><c> probably</c><00:20:46.400><c> won't</c><00:20:46.670><c> go</c><00:20:46.880><c> see</c><00:20:47.030><c> it</c><00:20:47.150><c> again</c><00:20:47.210><c> an</c>

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
