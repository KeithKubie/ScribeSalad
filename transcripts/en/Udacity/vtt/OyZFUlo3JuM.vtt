00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here are our equations again for the mean and the variance.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
They should now look very familiar.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The problem with that is they require two passes through the data.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, I have to go through all the data and compute the mean.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I do this by summing up all the data and dividing it by the total number of data items.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For that, I maintain two things.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I maintain the total number of data items, which I increment every time I see a new item.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I maintain the sum of all Xᵢs, which I can easily add up as I go through the data.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Once I've done this, I know µ, and then I can finally plug it in here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but now I have to go through the data again and compute this guy,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
so we can finally get to my covariance.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, I want to teach you a trick now for which we don't maintain this guy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but instead maintain just this guy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The nice thing about this is if you maintain these three things you only need a single pass.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
To see, as we go through the data, we can maintain the number of data items that we have.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We can maintain the sum over here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We can maintain the sum of the data themselves.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
You can maintain simultaneously the sum of the square of the data items,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but it's not obvious that from these three things alone

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you can figure out what σ² is.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's play a game.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The way the game works is that I put a number of mathematical expressions here on the  right side.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'll start the derivation and leave little gaps and ask you to pick one of those

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and plug it into the equation.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You can only use each of those ones but you won't use all of them, just a subset.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Let me do the first step by hand and rewrite σ² by factoring out the square.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I can rewrite this by multiplying things out.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So, help me. What do you think goes in the middle?

00:01:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Which of those expressions?
