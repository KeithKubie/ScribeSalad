Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. Radiolab. Today is our animal minds animal mind, right? Do, do, can, can one animal really know what's going on in another animal's head? Yeah. Like really? No, really. No

Speaker 2:          00:14          thanks her kidneys. So we were thinking about that whale story that we heard before the break.

Speaker 1:          00:19          Yup. You know, where the DIYers make the whale and they were sure that we always saying thanks, literally saying thanks. Thanks for helping me out. Okay. That is their opinion. But we wanted to know like what can you actually scientifically say about that kind of exchange and that question. Let us introduce yourself. Like, so this guy, uh, my name is Patrick Hoff. I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, although actually the truth is he's really from someplace like Geneva. He's from, he's a Swiss from the French part of Switzerland. Right. We came to him because he may have found a way of separating the animals, of knowing which animals can genuinely have human emotions and which can't. It's, it starts, it starts in 1995 we were studying the anatomy of the human cingulate cortex. It's part of the brains right here, Kenny, between your eyes, but down and a student in my lab, Estonian still named scheme. She was looking at some brains and she saw something, ah, these very slender of bipolar on the run. I've never seen a neuron like that. Maybe it's abnormal to probably pathological, just to be sure. She got some slides of other human brains looked in the same place.

Speaker 3:          01:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:34          and we, there was again, started to see them again and we were very pleased. They, okay. We have discovered a new cell type, whew. Something that is unique to human, but then they went to the library and discovered that some guy whose name is a Constanta Fun Economo [inaudible] Romanian Guy [inaudible] it's seen these cells 70 years ago and you named them spindle cells because of their shape. Oh, that must've been a very sad day for us to know. No, no, it's now they believe that these little brain cells may be a key to how humans relate to one another. And whether or not other creatures can relate to us in the same way. Right. Is it possible to, for us to see a spin they'll sell at? Yeah. I wait, can we can show you a spinels of Patrick half took us down the hall. Yep. Chad went first and parked him in front of a big

Speaker 2:          02:31          microscope. Yeah, fine sense. Again, look at it. Will it be obvious to me? I'm looking at crossing the middle of the field. You can see a series of tall, slender and making me dizzy. One, two, three, four, five. Is that the spindles? Yep. Oh, they're everywhere. Yeah. Aw, you want to see them? [inaudible] I mean, yeah, you hold them mind. Oh yeah. There's like a, there's a whole troop of them when they're long and skinny and purple. It's funny cause the normal brain cells, which you can also see in there are like dot, dot, dot. But these ones are do like little purple bananas, like a team of Purple Banana and the thing that makes these cells so interesting, she mean to hit off in this direction. Yeah. According to Patrick Hoffman is that, you know, in the normal brain cells they just talk to their neighbors. But these ones because they're so

Speaker 1:          03:19          a long, they seem to be yelling across a beat. A distance. Exactly. We know that the cells send an action at some distance. Okay. Hello?

Speaker 3:          03:31          Uh,

Speaker 1:          03:31          it's across the valley. Yeah, it's across the valley. Exactly. It's projecting the projecting what and from where to where. Well, Patrick Hoff doesn't entirely know, but he says he can make a pretty good guess based on, well, if you look at the microscope

Speaker 2:          03:49          noticing things. Yeah. Yeah. So, so here, here, the top of the spindle points toward the surface of the brain or the job he says seems to shoot up boards. Those more modern parts of the brain that involve high Yoda cognition. Yeah. Language, abstract thinking. Whereas the bottom of the spindle seems to shoot down deep down lower centers in the brain towards those older parts of our brain that involve feelings, emotions, instinct.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Wow. Perhaps this is what Patrick off things, the desales are a kind of network, a really important one. It allows the different parts of our inner selves to connect.

Speaker 4:          04:27          Like you've got the parts of us down here that feel things can now communicate with the parts of us up here that think things. This is an oversimplification of course, but the point, the larger point is that this is exactly what happens when you look into the eyes of another human being

Speaker 3:          04:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          04:44          because it begins with a kind of thought, your eyes seem sad, but then that thought within you travels a great distance and connects with the feeling of sadness that you feel sad too. I mean it's the basis of a kind of a m.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Exactly, exactly. You know, I, I see you happy, you know, so, so that I feel good about it and you know, and consider those times. I mean not just empty where like your thoughts and feelings are in conflict and if you've got to really talk to one another, like for example, when you kicked in front of me at the microphone yet again, and I hate you, but I know that I have to work with you. So I, I, I sit on that feeling, I just sit on my, it's going down to the bottom of my brain. But I say, take taking that, see that's the best part of your spindle situation is that it's not just the thoughts, connected feelings with its thoughts can sometimes suppress feelings. Yeah. I think that's the idea is that humans in social interactions can rely on these hardwired emotions in the same way other animals might be able to.

Speaker 1:          05:45          That's [inaudible] science writer, a regular radio lab contributor and a guy we often call to help us make sense of things. Um, you know, we can like a dog just hump every other dog and see what happens. We've been Scott to flirt and be funny and you know, buy a couple of drinks and that, that, that was, you guys have to cut back. Cause I just, I am so astonished. Wow. We gotta use that. Um, I just, I just turned into a frat boy. So, but the point being that our social interactions are very complicated and that, and we can't rely, it's much tougher for humans to rely on simply these hardwired primitive instincts you get into the job of spindle cells is to simply broadcast

Speaker 5:          06:30          content to the rest of the brain because without our whole brain involved, we never be able to navigate the social world and make any kind of connection. Right. So if spindle cells then allow us to talk gently and emotionally to one another. The question is, this is the question for our hour. What about introduced species is an intra or Inter Intra in Charlotte? [inaudible] yeah, that's inside I think across species is what you mean. Does any other animal have spindle cells?

Speaker 1:          07:01          We're taking the end as it happens. So we, I'm taking you to my cold room just down the hall from his office. It's professor Hoff has a freezer a way. High Stone. The specimens are very big door to full of brains, so it's going to get through the cooler here.

Speaker 3:          07:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:18          all different kinds with brains of volume species. The CETACEANS are over there. We have the great apes around whale wall. That's the way the wall, yeah, he's got dozens and dozens of rains and buckets in new jars and it keeps them all organized. Well, each category of species has its own shelf. You have more apes down there with the gorillas and orangutans.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Ah, it was really cold there. So what they did was they took a bunch of those brains off the shelf and walked him down the hall to the lab and put little pieces of them under a microscope. They didn't expect to find any of those bizarro neurons, any of these other creatures. Cause he was pretty sure this is something that is unique to human. But one day we will looking at the brain of the Humpback Whale and we stumble on spindle cells, plenty of spindle cells. Well, so what was that? Did you, were you surprised? And I was there say, okay, this is fascinating. You weren't expecting that. I wasn't that. I told expecting that. But on the other hand, here we have the humpback whale, which is a very social animals. They, they, they fall clans, they, they communicates the males, they have a song, they hunt together, they develop punting strategies, which requires perfect coordination of many whales. So they have to act together to do that.

Speaker 2:          09:00          Now if acting together is the key you and having complex social structures, well then these things shouldn't just be limited to whales. And in fact, over the years half and other scientists have found spindle sales in chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, gorillas. Which begs the question

Speaker 3:          09:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:21          like if we want to have an experience with another creature and now not just at the zoo, but a real shared experience, do those creatures need to have these things? Do you think the existence of spenders so creates more of a possibility of having that cross species sharing moment? I think so.

Speaker 3:          09:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          09:42          if we assume that these cells have zilch on influence on, uh, the sociability of the species, it is very likely that you would experience something of that kind with a species that has, then I doubt you would get a very good experience if you were trying to do this with the Hyena.

Speaker 5:          10:05          So maybe what we see when we look into, you know, the sad eyes of a blue whale or when we look into the eyes of an elephant cradling a baby elephant, which are just the cutest things on earth. Maybe what we recognize is is is that same flavor promotion, that same inner life, a feeling maybe and it's the big, maybe maybe that in our life requires spindle cells,

Speaker 1:          10:36          but how big is that? Maybe it means a sounds like a really maybe, maybe. I mean, yeah, it's important that this is all just a, I think this is still very theoretical and in fact if you asked people like Clive Lynn, the fellow who who, who poopooed our our whale, thank you from before as Clive, like could you look at an animal and find something in the animal that says yes, if he has that he's got feeling

Speaker 6:          11:01          well wrong. I don't for a moment imagine that there's going to be a type of nerve cell or a type of structure in the brain, which is going to be such an acid test of whether an animal has a particular psychological capacity that we could then find that kind of neuron and say, well now we know without having to look at the behavior of the animal. Now we know that this species has this or that psychological ability.

Speaker 1:          11:26          Well, let me ask the question a different way. I mean, do you think spindle cells are no spindle cells? Let's just toss them out for a second. Do you think there are a category of creatures that are more likely to have empathic experiences with us? Would you draw lines between beings?

Speaker 6:          11:41          Well, the thing that I would, the thing I would emphasize if we are looking for empathy between different species is their um, developmental experiences to make his point. Clive told us about this experiment. This is, let's take a chimp with all the spindle cells inside the chimp brain there, but the champion who room and in front of the champ, let's put two cups face down. Now, one of the cups has a grape, something delicious under it, and the chimp doesn't know where the grape is. Could be under cup a or Cup B. So what you the experiment do you simply point to the cup that has the grape? Like that's the one. That one right there. I know the animal has to do is to go to the cup. That's pointed to it seems simple enough. But chimps, Clive says, chimps find this stunningly difficult to understand.

Speaker 6:          12:30          Get this wrong. What do you mean? I mean, they just look at you pointing and they look into, you're pointing and they look and you're pointing and they just go, wow. Whereas dogs who don't have spindle cells, most pet dogs get this from the get go. The dogs can do this and chimps can't. Yeah, they quite spontaneously recognized that you should go where they, where they point. And Clive says, the explanation here is not the dogs have some special cell in their brain. It's simply because, because they grow up in our households if they grow up with us. Right. To test this idea. He did the same study, the pointing one. Yep. Except this time with some wolves because wolves are the animals from which dogs are descended but they haven't lived in human households obviously and normally like the chimps, wolves totally screw up the porting tests that we've done some tests on some wolves that were hand reared by human beings and are very friendly to human beings and we find that those wolves behave just like the dogs, that they are just as good at following the human pointing to find the food.

Speaker 6:          13:32          Really. Did you have to train them or no? We did not train them while they just picked it up, but these are exceptional bulbs in so far as they were reared by human beings. They were bottle fed when they were wee babies because there are things that go on earlier in our development that are crucial and that include learning who are your, who are your kind, what do, who am I, what am I? And you learn that in a critical period in your early life by looking around you and seeing who you're interacting with. Pretty much every dog you might meet has learned to accept humans as social companions. And that's because it was reared in a human home. And because evolution has prepared it with a relatively slow development so that it's pretty easy to tame a dog. The Wolf on the other hand, it goes through its childhood and adolescence in the blink of an eye and the course of just a handful of weeks.

Speaker 6:          14:23          And so it's actually extremely difficult to successfully hand rear a wolf because you have so little time available to you and you have to invest 24 hours a day, seven days a week during that brief period that a wolf is open to the possibility of learning who its companions might be. That's really interesting. You know, one of the pieces of the interpretation that I find intriguing, and I'm gonna, I'm gonna run by you, is that, oh, that's so interesting. I'm now sitting here thinking, boy, if I could raise a whale with a baby bottle, then I would know whether the will was saying thank you to me because I would have learned, it's not like I have to learn, but whale would have learned human. Wow, that's right. I mean, of course, this is completely hypothetical. The whales are really bad example to choose, but my guess would be if you bottle fed or whale, you would get a whale that might plausibly do something like a behavior that expresses things. That is such a hard mental image to conjure. Well, that's right. That's right. Bottle feeding. Oh, well, yeah. Well, because we have to keep rising to the surface for 21 years to breathe before I actually get to the experiment. There are a number of drawbacks to that experience.

Speaker 6:          15:33          Radiolab will continue in a moment. As soon as I come up to breath.
