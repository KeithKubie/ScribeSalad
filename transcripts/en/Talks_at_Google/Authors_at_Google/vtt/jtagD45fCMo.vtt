RACHEL WHETSTONE: So I
wanted to introduce Arianna,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.596
who I've met a couple of
times, who I admire enormously

00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:11.970
for being an amazing journalist,
an amazing entrepreneur,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.880
and an incredibly warm person.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.050
And every time I meet her,
I feel very, very happy,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.340
which is a lovely
gift to give people.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.210
And I actually read her
book at the weekend.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.370
And it got me at a moment,
actually, when I was quite low.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.790
I was feeling quite
stressed out about work.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.860
I was very frustrated
with my inability

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.580
to be present when
I was at home and be

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.430
a good mother and a good wife.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.600
And I felt a really
shitty mother, actually.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.680
And so the opening--
the introduction

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.910
in the first chapter,
actually-- really made me cry,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.493
but really made me
think about my life

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:48.540
in a very different way.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.260
And I think it's a kind of path
that Arianna's been through.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.870
So I actually really
think everyone

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.230
would love to hear from her.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.646
How she went through
that journey.

00:00:55.646 --> 00:00:57.830
And how she manages
now to be more present,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.447
and to be with the
people she loves.

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:01.655
And not to be distracted by
all the other things that

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:05.420
are going on in her
life, which are many.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.930
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Thank
you so much, Rachel.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.380
And thank you all
for being here.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.250
Can you all hear me?

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.210
Because we have to deal
with my Greek accent.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.210
So that's a beautiful
introduction.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.660
Because what I'm
hoping to do with

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.680
the book is to open
up conversations

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.070
like that, where we can be
more personal, intimate,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.680
and vulnerable with each other.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.510
And where we can look at how
we can build a path forward

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.530
for our lives that is
more sustainable and less

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
fueled by burnout, sleep
deprivation, exhaustion.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.600
And how I got on this
path, as Rachel alluded to,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.540
is because of my rude
awakening, my wake-up call,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050
which happened on April 6, 2007.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.200
And that's how I
start the book with,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.750
when I collapsed from
exhaustion, burnout, and sleep

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.600
deprivation, hit my
head on the way down,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
and broke my cheek bone, got
four stitches on my right eye.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.741
And as I was going from doctor's
office to doctor's office,

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.949
while they were trying to
find out if I had something

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.770
seriously wrong with me, like
a brain tumor, heart disease.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.920
And they discovered
that I didn't

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.970
have anything medically
wrong with me.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.670
But I discovered that I
had just about everything

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.690
wrong with the way I
was leading my life.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.390
And so I started asking
the big questions

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.010
that I had asked in college,
that my compatriots, all

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.940
the Greek philosophers, used to
ask, like, what is a good life?

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.390
And Socrates famously said
that the unexamined life is not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.210
worth living.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.960
And I started asking
these questions

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.440
from the starting point
of what is success.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.540
Because I feel that is a great
starting point for our culture.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.150
Because at some
point, by default,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.080
we began defining success
as just two metrics--

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.540
money and power.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.750
And this is like trying to
sit on a two-legged stool.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.680
Sooner or later, you fall off.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.080
And that's when I came
up with a third metric,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.050
without which we cannot thrive.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.550
And the third metric
consists of four elements

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.370
that have become the four
sections of the book.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.020
The first is our
well-being and our health.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.290
If we sacrifice our health
in the course of attaining

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.500
our ambitions at work, it's
a really Pyrrhic victory.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.480
And we pay a very heavy price.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.370
And we look around at
all the casualties.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.940
And we women, if I can
address the women in the room,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.490
really cannot afford to do that.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.220
Because the data-- I
know Googlers love data,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.530
and I have 55 pages of
scientific footnotes,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.246
because I knew I was
coming to speak to you.

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:01.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.100
The data is unequivocal,
that women in stressful jobs,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.120
which is everybody
in this room, have

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.060
a 40% greater risk
of heart disease

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.580
and a 60% greater
risk of diabetes.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.130
Because we can internalize
stress differently than men.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.910
And so I'm kind of
calling, in the book,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.670
for the third
women's revolution.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.830
The first one being
getting us the vote,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.350
the second being getting us
equal access to every field,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.610
and the top of every field.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.640
And the third one
being women saying,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.950
we don't want just to be
at the top of the world,

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.020
we want to change the world.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.720
Because the way
the world has been

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.410
designed by men--
I'm not blaming

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.910
the particular men in this
room, but men generally--

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.340
is not working.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.780
All men in this
room are excluded

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.240
from any comments I'm
going to make about men.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.380
But men have created
the world of workplace

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.510
to basically treat sleep
deprivation as a virility

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.597
symbol.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.430
I mean, I had dinner
recently with a guy who

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.240
bragged that he had
only gotten four hours

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.199
sleep the night before.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.073
And I didn't say it,
but I thought to myself,

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:14.590
you know what, if
you'd gotten five

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.986
this dinner would have been
a lot more interesting.

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:20.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.040
And now you have unequivocal
scientific evidence

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.100
of the importance of sleep
and the dangers of sleep

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.980
deprivation, including
killing brain cells.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.650
There's an article
in "Forbes" today

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.560
about how a lot of the
failure of the tech

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.110
startups here in Silicon Valley
can be attributed to the sleep

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.550
deprivation of the
founders and the delusion

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.330
that if they just
work 24/7, that's

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.790
how they're going to succeed.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.680
So that is the central
delusion of our time.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.180
And I think it
would be fantastic

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.060
if you as Googlers can sort
of experiment with another way

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.780
of doing things and
demonstrate to the world

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.950
that this delusion is
really, literally hurting us.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.930
And I thought back
to-- I thought of that,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.060
actually, after I wrote the
book, so it's not in the book.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.240
But I thought of how
before Copernicus,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.400
the general assumption
that everybody accepted

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.960
was that the Earth
was flat, right?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.380
They accepted that mindlessly.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.600
Because then [INAUDIBLE] better.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.520
I think the equivalent of
the pre-Copernican flat Earth

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.210
assumption in our
society is the delusion

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.050
that in order to succeed,
achieve, accomplish, change

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.740
the world, you have to be
plugged in all the time.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.700
And really that's
a demonstration

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.670
of your commitment, of your
seriousness about this.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.860
And anything else is
basically slacking off

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.710
and wanting to chill
out under a mango tree.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.080
And the scientific
evidence against that

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.300
is conclusive, especially
in the last few years.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.930
So all we need to
do now is to A.,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.140
read the evidence and B., a
much more important-- take,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:15.890
actually, tiny, microscopic
steps in our lives to change.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.070
And when I say microscopic,
I have three steps

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.610
at the end of each
section, as you

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.740
know, Rachel, which are really
small and manageable and tiny.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.960
Because I really think that
if we can experiment-- again,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.970
that's the other thing
you like to do, right?

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.290
If you can experiment with that,
you will get your own proof.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.150
You don't have to trust
me, or even the science.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.810
You will get your proof and
you'll get it very quickly.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.520
RACHEL WHETSTONE: It's
interesting on the sleep--

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.049
I remember after the birth of
my first child, which I didn't

00:07:49.049 --> 00:07:50.590
find a terribly
enjoyable experience.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.990
Not so much the birth,
but the after bit.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.310
Some object that didn't
do what I wanted it to do.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.990
Didn't respond in the ways--

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.290
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: You
couldn't talk, right?

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.800
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Exactly.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.758
And I was so overtired.

00:07:58.758 --> 00:08:01.156
And being overtired made
it much, much worse.

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:02.530
And when things
go wrong at work,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.225
it's normally because
you're overtired.

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:07.660
I also have a husband
who's a bit eccentric,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.564
in that he refuses to have
any kind of phone, at all.

00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:12.230
And so he actually
never looks at email.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.660
He looks at email for
about 1/2 an hour a day.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.000
And he's much more productive
and efficient than anyone

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.590
else I know.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.360
Because he doesn't
actually just sit

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.814
there like a gerbil on
a wheel, just responding

00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:22.730
to the emails that come
in and then generating

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.650
more and more emails.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.990
He actually decides what he
wants to do in the morning,

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.906
he goes and does it, and
by the end of the day

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.524
he's normally done it.

00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:31.190
It's also profoundly
selfish, because it

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.720
means no one in his
family can get a hold him,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.570
or interfere with him,
or do anything else.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.270
But it's been very
interesting to me,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.820
because I just wouldn't have
the self-control to do that.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.140
Because actually, when
I'm not with my computer,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.069
I feel very tense.

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:45.360
And after I get off an airplane
and I open my computer,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.140
I can feel the sort
of-- [DEEP BREATH] phew,

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.560
I'm back with my
addiction again.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.940
It's very interesting.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.430
And I literally don't
have the self-control.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.280
So I think it really would
be great to hear from you two

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.926
or three of the small steps that
really started getting you back

00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.300
to a state where you didn't
feel that you were constantly

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.685
needing to be connected.

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:05.935
I mean, when you realized
that you had a problem, what

00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:08.740
were the first one or two
little things that you did,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.032
that maybe some of us in this
room could start copying?

00:09:11.032 --> 00:09:12.739
Because the notion of
completely changing

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:13.910
your life seems very scary.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.439
But I think the notion of the
tiny steps is really great.

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:17.730
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.010
And first of all, like
in AA, acknowledging

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.950
that you have a problem
is the first step.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.400
Acknowledging that our lives
have become unmanageable

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.400
and we need some higher power
to help us, wherever we find it,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.650
is incredibly important.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:40.870
For me, the microscopic step I
took, which at the time seemed,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.310
actually, pretty
big, was at night,

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.030
to charge my smartphones
, iPads, all devices,

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.460
outside my bedroom.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.950
How many people here sleep
with their smartphones

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.040
beside them, or with them?

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.200
Wow.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.320
This is definitely
the biggest percentage

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.508
of any group I've spoken to.

00:10:01.508 --> 00:10:04.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.060
Wow.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.105
So this is great.

00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:07.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:13.797
Because you can actually get
immediate results by simply--

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:14.880
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Tonight.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.046
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Tonight.

00:10:16.046 --> 00:10:16.560
Tonight.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.390
And then can you
please write about it?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.430
On your own blog,
Facebook, Google+,

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.510
and "The Huffington Post."

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.020
And I will give you
my email address,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.500
to make it super easy to
bypass "The Huffington Post"

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.567
bureaucracy.

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:33.900
It's Arianna@huffingtonpost.com.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.440
And seriously, I
would love to hear

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.370
what happens to you if you
charge your devices outside.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.800
Because what my experience
and the science show,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.250
is that if you wake up in
the middle of the night

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.110
to go to the bathroom,
whatever, you're

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.399
going to be tempted to
look at your data, right?

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.690
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Who's
tempted to look at their phones

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.814
in the middle of the night?

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:04.962
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Quite a lot.

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:05.840
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Quite a lot.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.465
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
And if you do that,

00:11:07.465 --> 00:11:09.390
your sleep, when you
go back to sleep,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.312
is not going to be as
recharging, regenerating,

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.770
and the kind of sleep that you
want to have so that you can

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:20.290
wake up ready to take on the
day and face all the challenges

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.880
and obstacles that
come your way.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.780
And you probably have two
objections to what I'm saying.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.330
And you may have
more that we can

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.240
discuss when we go to questions.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.330
But one of them is,
I need my smartphone

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.780
to wake me up in
the morning, right?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.490
OK, Pottery Barn has these
great vintage alarm clocks.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.490
They look really pretty.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.970
They cost $32.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.980
I gave them to all my
friends for Christmas.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.740
Excuse number two-- maybe
you're in a job where

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.450
something terrible or
fantastic may happen

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:57.080
in the middle of the night, and
they need to reach you, right?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.630
Really cheap, old-fashioned
phones without data.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.820
Just it rings, if
something happens.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.145
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.145 --> 00:12:07.500
I have one of those.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.450
So try it.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.445
A small, microscopic step.

00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:12.153
RACHEL WHETSTONE:
Actually, funny enough,

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:14.699
I took that step
about six months ago.

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:16.490
Because sometimes people
do have to ring me

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.615
in the middle of the night.

00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:20.605
In fact, someone rang me in the
middle of the night on Monday.

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.188
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Was it legitimate?

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:24.850
RACHEL WHETSTONE: It was
very legitimate, yes.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.300
But I'm even more old
fashioned in that I

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.990
have a landline in my house.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.730
Which everyone sort of looks
at-- shock, horror-- of what

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.840
is that thing sitting in
the corner of your kitchen?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.215
But it is brilliant, because
it means that I can actually

00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:37.320
be contacted, without
being contacted by email.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.140
Which I think is fabulous.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.940
So I did do that.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.536
And it did make me
feel much better.

00:12:41.536 --> 00:12:42.910
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
That's great.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.810
RACHEL WHETSTONE: And
I also found, actually,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.570
if I didn't look at my
smartphone before I got

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.750
the children up and
took them to school,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.989
then I didn't have all this--
[DEEP BREATH]-- the emails,

00:12:51.989 --> 00:12:54.030
and seeing all the things
that I should be doing.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.940
It actually meant I could give
my kids breakfast and have

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.820
an enjoyable time taking
them to school, I found.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.394
For any mothers,
fathers in the room,

00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:01.560
it was a really good way
of being present in the car

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.140
with my kids.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.200
It actually made
a huge difference.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.300
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Rachel, that's fantastic.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.450
I didn't dare suggest
the second step.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.830
I though it might be too much.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.730
But that is actually
the companion piece.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.520
Don't start-- because
most people literally

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.300
open their eyes and
grab their phones.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.110
And there is no entry ritual.

00:13:23.745 --> 00:13:25.120
RACHEL WHETSTONE:
And one thing I

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.020
was reading about in
your book-- there's

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.210
a lovely section about
happiness and love.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.100
And that happiness
really is love,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.560
and there's a lot of
research that shows that.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.370
How do you think about
love in a work context?

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.620
I think in a home context,
it's very easy for everyone

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.890
to understand that.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.610
But if you think about
being happy at work,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.020
and love being an
important part of that,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.420
is that love of
doing your work well?

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.380
Is it the fulfillment
that comes from creating

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.780
something beautiful?

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.410
How do you think about that
in the context of your work?

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.243
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
That's a great question.

00:13:56.243 --> 00:13:59.250
I think there are a few
different entry points,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.980
depending on your personality.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.040
And one entry point
is bringing joy back

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.340
into our everyday lives.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:15.680
Because so many of us-- and I
speak as a complete culprit,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.580
as a certifiable type A,
workaholic, driven personality.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.320
Who basically felt my
job was about getting it

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.820
all down, getting it done in
time, getting it accomplished.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.690
And joy?

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.170
Who has time for joy?

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.880
And now, I feel
that-- not at all.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.720
When I'm not joyful, I
look at what happened.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.636
I don't mean joyful
like there are

00:14:42.636 --> 00:14:44.370
no challenges,
problems, et cetera.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.390
I mean when I'm not like, hey,
this is great, I'm blessed.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.020
I'm doing something I love.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.210
I'm grateful.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.730
When I don't have that
feeling, I know I'm off.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.300
I need to course correct.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.850
So joy, kind of really checking
in, seeing how am I doing?

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.120
Am I-- you don't even
have to check in,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.495
because you know when you
are in the flow, in the joy,

00:15:08.495 --> 00:15:09.770
and when you're not.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:16.140
The second one is-- and this
is one of the microscopic steps

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.540
at the end of the
giving section.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:22.500
So just quickly, it's well-being
and health, wisdom, wonder,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.510
and giving.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:28.430
So one of the microscopic
steps that is a great way

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.910
to bring love into the workplace
is making a personal connection

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.430
with people that
otherwise, at work,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.530
you might tend to take
for granted or pass by.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.910
It could be the cleaning crew.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.010
It could be somebody
serving lunch.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:46.830
Very often, we're just too
busy to interact, right?

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.740
We're either buried in our
smartphones or in our thoughts.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.780
And I think that really
changes the experience at work.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.210
And also, another
thing is-- and I

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:03.930
think, from the Googlers I know,
you're really good at that--

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.760
is to really tap
into our creativity,

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.100
even though this is
not part of our job.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.390
There are people who love--
it's one of the things

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.090
that our cultural, I
think, has suppressed--

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.910
every child is creative.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.950
They sing, they draw.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.200
Then at some point, if
we can't make a living

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.610
through our creative
love, we drop it.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.276
But in fact, it's just great
to maintain it in some way.

00:16:32.276 --> 00:16:33.650
Now it's happening
more and more.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.890
I have examples in the book
of people who love to sing.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:41.810
They were never able
or willing to even try

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.710
to make their living that way.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.340
But they now find
ways to practice.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.500
Some of them have joined what
they call threshold choirs.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.682
And they go to hospices and sing
to the terminally ill people,

00:16:53.682 --> 00:16:55.140
because their
hearing is apparently

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.280
the last sense that goes.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.750
Or cooking.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.210
They love to cook,
and they prepare

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.020
meals for people who are
in homeless shelters.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.540
Or surprise people with
their birthday celebrations.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.310
So there's just
incredible creativity

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.849
that is buried in people.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:18.460
And when we tap into it, we
can make it part of our giving.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.420
And here the science
is absolutely amazing,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.740
that we are actually
wired for giving.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:34.790
So when we give, all the
biological inflammation markers

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.870
and the precursors
of disease go down.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.040
And when we're simply engaged in
self-gratification, they go up.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.710
Obviously life is a
mixture, unless we

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.050
have a lot of
Mother Teresas here.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.620
And so it's important to
remember that actually giving

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.120
is a shortcut to happiness.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.250
And Richard Davidson, at

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.265
has an amazing amount
of research about that.

00:17:57.265 --> 00:17:59.140
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Yeah,
I was very interested

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.780
reading "The Giving Book,"
because it reminded me

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.655
of a conversation I had
a couple of weeks ago

00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:04.364
when I was down
in San Francisco.

00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:06.280
And there's obviously a
lot of debate going on

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.160
about technology companies
in San Francisco and the role

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.760
that we play in society.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.850
And there was a
subset of people who

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.670
I was talking to who really
believe that their product is

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.110
their gift to society.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.160
And I said, yes, that's
a good starting point,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.660
to have a product that's
great for society.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.950
But it's probably
not sufficient,

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.116
and it's probably not going
to be seen as sufficient

00:18:28.116 --> 00:18:30.450
by the community in San
Francisco, who expect people

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.130
to be present and
part of the community

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.360
and not just their products.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.090
And so I thought that that was
an interesting observation.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.970
In the giving, I think that
the notion of public service

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.430
has become massively
undervalued.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.130
You touch on that
in this section.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.970
And I think all the
partisanship in politics

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.490
and and things makes
that very hard.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.820
The old-fashioned
public service--

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.330
that my parents
probably think about

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.090
and many people's parents
would think about--

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.600
seems to be terribly,
terribly different

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.975
from how people think about
public service, and politics,

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:02.370
and those kinds of things today.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.250
And I'm interested--
you've obviously

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.270
dealt with lots of people who
do public service-- you could

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.020
argue that journalism
is a public service.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.660
How do you think
about public service?

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.590
And what do you think we're
getting wrong at the moment,

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.000
that people don't want to
stand up and do that stuff,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.401
in some of the more traditional
ways that they used to?

00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:20.400
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes,
I think a lot about it.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.680
Because I've always been
fascinated by politics, and you

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.610
spend a lot of time
around politics.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.490
And something has
happened where people

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.750
have lost hope that good,
major, big things are

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.870
going to happen
through politics.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.470
And I think that we need to
recapture that spirit, where A,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.500
we don't demonize people
that we disagree with.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:51.175
And B, can take it to the next
level-- I know your husband

00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:56.342
works with David Cameron, and I
quote what David Cameron said.

00:19:56.342 --> 00:19:58.550
He said, actually, two
important things, one of which

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.340
was really
misunderstood, which I

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.550
thought was really important,
about compassionate capitalism.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.920
That whole element.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.490
For me, it's very
important not just

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.820
to delegate our
compassion to government.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.490
Government has its
role, but to also

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.620
take some responsibility
ourselves.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.570
And the other thing was about
the national happiness index--

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.700
that it's not just about
the gross national product.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.760
How do you measure well-being?

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.440
How do you measure a country's
human capital, basically?

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.740
And we have
staggering statistics

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.900
of dysfunctionality here.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.330
We have, in the States, 3/4
of our health care costs

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.050
are for preventable, chronic
stress related diseases.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.110
We have an epidemic of
increasing addiction,

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:51.370
depression, and all the
criteria of lives that are not

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:57.030
sustainable without some
kind of chemical crutch.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.170
And that's why I feel
that right now, we

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.030
are at the tipping point,
where a lot of people

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:07.950
realize that fundamental
changes have to happen.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.440
Starting at the individual
level, but a lot of companies--

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.110
Google included--
are recognizing

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.560
that the well-being
of their employees

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:23.450
is not separate from the
bottom line of the company.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.950
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Yeah, I find
that the way that governments

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.880
don't try and measure
happiness at all--

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.250
it's always very focused
on the economic side.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.227
Because actually, the
measurement of happiness

00:21:32.227 --> 00:21:34.060
would, in some ways,
get at the demands that

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.350
are put on the state by all
the failures in the system.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.770
The people who are sick who
didn't need to get sick.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.839
The people who become addicted
and all those kinds of things.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:44.880
And because we don't
measure any of those things,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.870
the demands on the state get
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:52.289
And then you just end up with
a fairly pointless debate

00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:54.830
between the right and the left
about how big the state should

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.330
be.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.950
Rather than thinking, if we
put less demands on the state,

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.190
then different
consequences would happen.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.237
And I find that really
not well thought through.

00:22:03.237 --> 00:22:05.070
I thought the other
thing in your book which

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.190
was fascinating, which is true
from a lot of the statistics,

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.436
is that religion
makes people happy.

00:22:10.436 --> 00:22:12.310
There's some very clear
statistical evidence,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.370
if you track happiness, that
people who believe in a creed

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.154
are happier.

00:22:17.154 --> 00:22:18.820
But I thought you
made the lovely point,

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.250
is that because so many of
us reject religion now--

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.340
we live in a very
secular society-- we also

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.744
reject spiritualism.

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:27.660
And that's a big mistake,
because spiritualism

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.010
is an enormous part of
well-being and joy and about

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.740
future learning.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.710
And I was really interested
in your thoughts on that.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.751
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes,
and it's very different.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.010
I was at LinkedIn, and I
had lunch with Reid Hoffman,

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.130
before I came here.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:46.890
And he said, I call
myself a mystical atheist.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:52.630
And I think a lot of people
who would say they're atheists,

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.200
when you really
scratch the surface,

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.040
they have a sense of
spirituality or mysticism

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.960
or wonder at the
mystery of life.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.435
But they don't believe
in a particular creed.

00:23:02.435 --> 00:23:05.110
And for me, really
what matters--

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.310
and that's what my
wonder section is about--

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:12.220
is to have that sense
that there is something

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.980
amazing and
mysterious about life.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.510
That we haven't
figured it all out,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.410
and the journey of exploring
it-- it's fascinating.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:24.940
I'm personally much more
interested in an inner space

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.915
project than an
outer space project.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.990
And I've always been
very interested in that,

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.370
ever since I was a kid.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.990
That's why I have a whole
section on coincidences.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.480
Because I find that even my most
militantly atheistic friends

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.100
love coincidences,
because they're

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.890
like this kind of miracles
that the universe seems

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.080
to perform anonymously.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.420
And you can't
exactly explain them,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.170
and you don't need to draw
grand conclusions from them.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.490
But they're almost
like a little reminder

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.130
that we're living in
an incredibly amazing,

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.870
mysterious place.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.770
And we forget that when
we shrink ourselves

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.080
down to our to-do list.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.890
That's really, for
me, the worst thing.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.950
If we completely
identify ourselves

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.770
with our jobs--
however magnificent

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.160
our jobs may be--
we are missing out

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:30.190
on the fullness and the grandeur
of what a human being is.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.800
And also, I think we make bad
decisions about our lives.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.060
I was talking to Ellen.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.930
I just did her
show last weekend.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.560
And we're talking about the
fact that if she had really

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.780
believed, in 2008
when she came out,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.910
that the most important thing
in her life, who she was,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.810
what defined her, was to be a
successful sitcom host, then

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.210
she would never have come out.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.820
Because coming out was important
to her as an individual.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:06.270
She didn't want to live with
the shame and the fear of being

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.260
found out, of not owning
up to who she was.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.290
But when she did come out,
her sitcom was canceled,

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.570
and the phone did not
ring for three years.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.210
After that, of course, she
did thrive, in every sense

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.220
of the word.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.920
But she had to take that risk.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.700
And she wouldn't
have taken it, as she

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.950
said, if she didn't think there
was something more in life

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:33.525
than the job.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.490
RACHEL WHETSTONE: That's
a rather amazing story.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.292
The last thing I wanted to
ask before throwing open

00:25:41.292 --> 00:25:43.000
to questions, if anyone
wants to come up,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.730
was-- Larry spoke at TED
last week, actually--

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.400
and this was about the
wisdom and knowledge section.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.270
And it became very clear
to me, in listening

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.500
to what he was saying and
talking to him in advance,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.465
that search is really a
crucial part of who he is.

00:25:57.465 --> 00:25:58.840
Because he's very
curious, and he

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.180
wants to understand
about the world.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.480
And he wants to understand
how you can improve things,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.730
how you can create a
self-driving car, how you could

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.945
create bicycles that
were more efficient.

00:26:06.945 --> 00:26:08.570
And that search is
a huge part of that.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.210
He has this thought,
why is it like that,

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.432
why does it work like that?

00:26:12.432 --> 00:26:14.515
And then he goes and
searches, searches on YouTube

00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:15.530
and searches on Google.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.029
And he finds all
the experts, and he

00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:18.434
finds all the information.

00:26:18.434 --> 00:26:20.850
And so I just thought that was
such an interesting insight

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:22.320
as to Google.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.670
And it got me from
Google and search

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.030
to your section about wisdom,
and your point about discovery

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.440
and being open to new ideas.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.860
And all those kinds of
things, which I guess you

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.140
get to do a lot in
your job, anyway.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.490
How do you keep yourself
on a constant course

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.880
of wondering and getting
wiser about things?

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.630
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well I feel that's one

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.140
of my favorite things to do.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.770
And I also love what
Meng is doing here,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.390
with "Search Inside Yourself."

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.230
And I actually just
joined his board.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.063
Meng, are you there?

00:26:53.063 --> 00:26:58.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.430
And I'm really looking forward
to working with Meng on this.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:08.080
Because for me, that
that's the search

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.850
that interests me the most.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.720
But whatever it is that
interests you the most,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.420
pursuing it always leaves
open amazing possibilities.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.730
And that's what I love.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.310
But what makes it really hard to
wonder and notice these things

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:30.790
is our obsession with
multitasking and avoiding

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.217
any kind of pauses and
space in our lives.

00:27:34.217 --> 00:27:36.050
And as I've been traveling
around the world,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:42.480
as "The Huffington Post" is
launching across the globe,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.910
I'm just amazed by how
ancient wisdom has always

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.530
incorporated pauses.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.260
I was in Japan when
we launched there.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.470
They have the actual
concept of-- ma,

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.550
is their word, which
literally means "space."

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:03.840
And creating spaces in life
is an incredible regeneration

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.000
tool.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.190
And I now have included
these spaces in my life.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.200
I deliberately do that.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.840
RACHEL WHETSTONE: How do
you-- I don't understand

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.380
how you write a
book, how you launch

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.210
your company all around
the world, how you're still

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.869
an active journalist, how you
can give everyone your email.

00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:17.910
And I'm sure if I email--

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.409
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:19.420
--you'll respond.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.872
So I find it amazing how you
can create pauses in your life.

00:28:22.872 --> 00:28:24.580
And that you're not
constantly exhausted.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.538
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Here's
what is interesting.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.710
Well first of all,
I prioritize sleep.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.840
And that means saying no
to things you want to do.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.800
It's not easy.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.390
RACHEL WHETSTONE: No, it's hard.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.180
I think the hardest thing.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.680
Yeah.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.315
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Last night
Sheryl Sandberg Interviewed me

00:28:40.315 --> 00:28:42.520
at the San Francisco
Symphony Hall.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.620
And then I had to sign books.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.000
And I would have loved to
go and have dinner with her,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.940
but I went to bed.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:56.220
Because if I had
gone out to dinner

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.280
and hadn't gotten my
at least seven hours

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.450
sleep that I need, and had
to get up early to do TV,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.870
I would not be enjoying
being here with you now.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.340
And I'm really enjoying
it, and I'm 100% present.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.390
And I'm not tired.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.570
And I hate being tired
more than I hate anything.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.700
And I've had so many people come
up to me in the last two days--

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.200
the book just came
out two days ago,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.180
as I've been talking
about-- I had two women who

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.800
came to me yesterday and said
the same thing, they said,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.130
I don't remember the last
time I was not tired.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.280
RACHEL WHETSTONE:
I feel that a lot.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.910
Who else feels
that in this room?

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.035
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Rachel,
I have to become your--

00:29:33.035 --> 00:29:35.040
Who feels the last time
that they weren't tired?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.240
Maybe not that many of
us, but I certainly do.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.282
Jacob does, because he spends
too much time on an airplane.

00:29:41.282 --> 00:29:43.740
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Can I become
your third metric sponsor?

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.810
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Yes, please.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:46.740
I'll email you once a week,
and I know that you'll--

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.158
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I did
Karen May-- you know Karen?

00:29:48.158 --> 00:29:49.034
RACHEL WHETSTONE: There's Karen.

00:29:49.034 --> 00:29:50.742
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Karen, where are you?

00:29:50.742 --> 00:29:53.296
Karen and I bonded at Wisdom
2.0 and we had dinner together.

00:29:53.296 --> 00:29:54.670
KAREN MAY: You're
my sleep coach.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.120
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And
now I'm her sleep coach.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:59.545 --> 00:30:00.920
RACHEL WHETSTONE:
So when did you

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.490
discover that you
hate being tired?

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.680
When did you get the
cause and effect?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.610
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
I'm a bad case,

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.740
because I only got
it after I collapsed.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.490
RACHEL WHETSTONE: And
that made you really

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.209
understand that you
just need to sleep?

00:30:13.209 --> 00:30:15.000
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
That was the first time

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.730
I realized that I really--
I was one of those cases--

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.920
until my collapse, I
literally was not even aware

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.340
that I was tired all the time.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.561
Except that all my friends
knew that if we stopped

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.310
talking for a minute,
I would fall asleep.

00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:36.260
I would fall asleep
instantly, because I

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.810
had such a deficit of sleep
that I was operating under.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.700
I'm a bad case.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.910
If I can change, anybody can.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.720
That's basically
why I am giving you

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.950
all these examples of
how bad of a case I was.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.600
RACHEL WHETSTONE: And for the
mothers-- parents in the room.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.540
Let's be gender neutral.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.310
You obviously have children,
and you've obviously

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:01.620
had to work at being
present with them.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.880
And what are the
tricks that you've

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.422
learned to put-- I'm not
thinking about "The Huffington

00:31:06.422 --> 00:31:08.380
Post" now, I'm not thinking
about these things.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.327
I'm thinking about
family and other people.

00:31:11.327 --> 00:31:12.910
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well first of all,

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.880
let me just say that
when I look back,

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.760
I was always there
for my children.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.980
I didn't miss things.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.160
For a lot of my life, as I was
a writer, before "The Huffington

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.880
Post," I worked from home.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.520
So they could walk in
at any time, et cetera.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.350
I was always fully available.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.380
But when I look back, I
would often be with them,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.230
but not be with them mentality.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.610
And that's a big problem.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:48.340
So now, since my wake
up call, I really

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.760
have been there with them.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.680
And they're now 22 and 24.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.710
So I definitely missed
times, when I was only

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.120
physically present with them.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.436
And the experience is so
dramatically different.

00:32:00.436 --> 00:32:02.436
RACHEL WHETSTONE: I know,
I had that last night.

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:06.950
I was reading a story to
my son, "The Famous Five."

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.480
And I realized that I'd read
an entire chapter to him

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.190
out loud where I had been
writing a blog post in my head.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.190
And I couldn't remember a single
thing that was in the chapter.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:21.775
It was extraordinary, how one
can just not be present at all.

00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:23.900
And what was interesting
is after I put him to bed,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.100
I then couldn't actually
remember a single thing

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.730
of the blog post that I'd
been doing in my brain.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.867
So I'd ended up failing
at both things miserably.

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:30.700
Although I don't think
he noticed, actually.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.760
But I certainly noticed.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.860
And that's why I think phones
and things can be so bad.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.062
Because when you have
them with your kids,

00:32:39.062 --> 00:32:40.020
you want to be present.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.340
And just a little bit
of looking at an email,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.750
or looking at a text message,
just gets you straight--

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.760
thinking about the other thing--

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.250
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Exactly.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.950
RACHEL WHETSTONE: --rather
than being focused with them.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.050
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: But
you know, honestly Rachel,

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.850
I can't say enough
about how important it

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.850
is that you're
talking about that.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.130
Or that we are having
this conversation.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.640
Because that's what
we haven't had.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.130
And having this
conversation, and saying

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.780
what it is that we
are experiencing,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.220
is going to make
all the difference.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.850
RACHEL WHETSTONE: Someone
else wants to share.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.702
AUDIENCE: Hi welcome.
[SPEAKING GREEK]

00:33:14.702 --> 00:33:16.660
RACHEL WHETSTONE: This
is going to be in Greek.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.730
AUDIENCE: [SPEAKING GREEK]
I had a quick question.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.460
It was more geared
around diversity.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.190
As a fellow Greek
and a woman, I'm

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:31.042
sure you've been quite
diverse in your space.

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:33.500
And I was wondering, what are
some of the challenges you've

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.810
faced in the business world?

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:39.192
Or perhaps how you use
diversity as an advantage?

00:33:39.192 --> 00:33:41.150
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well
some of the challenges

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.420
I faced were inside my head.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:50.410
Because for a long time, I had
a huge problem with my accent.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:52.860
It was the bane of my existence.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.060
I tried to change it.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.650
Actually, my ex-husband
gave me the most passive

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.800
aggressive gift one birthday.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.610
He gave me a dialect coach to
follow me around for two weeks.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.639
And not just any dialect
coach, but Jessica Drake,

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:12.590
who's a famous Hollywood
dialect coach who

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.550
trained Tom Hanks
in "Forrest Gump."

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.949
And she would walk around
with me and give me notes.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.949
Including-- my children
were young at the time--

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:26.739
she would put diphthong
symbols on the Dr. Seuss books.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:29.710
So when I would be reading to
them I would be practicing.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:33.270
And by the end of two weeks,
I was completely paralyzed.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.929
I knew what I was
doing wrong, but I

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.820
couldn't fix it and
have a normal life.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.330
And also, soon after that
I divorced my husband.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:41.925
Not because of
the dialect coach.

00:34:41.925 --> 00:34:45.739
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:50.170
So I'm saying that--
obviously, every company

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:52.330
needs to pay attention
to diversity,

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.440
for the sake of creativity,
culture, and everything.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.100
But also, we need to
realize how much of what

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.490
happens with us immigrants,
outsiders, is in our heads.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.234
And one of my favorite quotes
in my book is from Montaigne.

00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:13.400
He said, there were many
terrible things in my life,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.938
but most of them never happened.

00:35:16.938 --> 00:35:17.829
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:19.745
RACHEL WHETSTONE: I think
there's another one.

00:35:22.939 --> 00:35:23.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.854
I'm one of the
perpetually tired,

00:35:24.854 --> 00:35:26.710
so hopefully this is coherent.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.630
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering-- I love

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.320
the metaphor of the two-legged
stool and the third metric

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.750
being the third leg.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.420
How do you feel your book,
and your overall philosophy,

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.490
applies to those who don't even
have access to the first two

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.020
legs?

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.830
When you think about different
socioeconomic classes--

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:47.520
like a single parent
working three jobs--

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.530
where does "Thrive"
fit into that?

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.640
And what can we do,
as the privileged few,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.290
honestly, to expand
that beyond just

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.069
Google and the corporate world?

00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:58.360
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.140
Great question.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.910
I have a whole section
in the book about that.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.620
Because I feel
everything I'm saying,

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.390
and all the tips and
practice in the book,

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:14.620
are ultimately about building
our own human resources

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.570
and our own resilience.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.130
And recognizing that
whatever our circumstances,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.130
whether we're at the top
of the world struggling

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.340
with all the demands of
success or struggling

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.270
to put food on the table,
we all have a place in us--

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.330
all of us, just by virtue
of being alive-- that

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:37.690
is a center of strength,
wisdom, joy, and peace.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.800
We all have it.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.220
We would not be alive
if we didn't have it.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.530
Most of the time we
don't live there.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.430
But we all have it,
and it's up to us

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.340
how quickly we can
get back to it.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.080
So that's why I even include
in the book people who

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.280
are in extreme circumstances,
like in concentration camps.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.170
Like Viktor Frankl who talked
about people in concentration

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:03.110
camps who somehow were able
to tap into that center

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:07.780
and therefore have
the ultimate freedom,

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.430
which is to choose your own
attitude and your own way

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.630
of thinking and responding.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.650
And also, I have
studies-- there's

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:20.440
a famous study done in
Illinois, when the Bell phone

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.660
company downsized dramatically.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.340
Like 50% of the employees
lost their jobs.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.730
And they followed everybody
who lost their job.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.170
And they saw that 2/3 of them
were kind of destroyed by it.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:40.550
They became alcoholics,
depressed, got divorced.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.260
1/3 of them thrived.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.610
Not only did they
survive the downsizing,

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.820
but they went on to start
their own companies,

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.570
go to bigger and better jobs.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:59.170
So how we respond to bad things
happening in our lives, even

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:02.250
terrible things
happening, is a function

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.370
of how resilient we are.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.760
And how much we have developed
our own human capital.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.690
RACHEL WHETSTONE: I though
Frankl's book was amazing,

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.010
about how some people
got broken by it,

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.775
and some people were able to
move beyond it and through it.

00:38:18.775 --> 00:38:21.240
It's really amazing.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.770
My question, I think, is in
the same vein as the last one.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.040
And I'm wondering how
you feel your life may

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.980
have been different if
you'd had this perspective

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.370
and mentality when you were
18 years old, versus now.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.020
And if, for some
reason, it meant

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.090
you may not have been at
the top of your game--

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.250
but still a successful
journalist in some regard,

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.159
maybe differently than you are
now-- would that have been OK?

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.242
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: So I
have to get up and answer

00:38:47.242 --> 00:38:50.130
this question, because it's
the most important question.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.550
And I really think this
is the key to where

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:56.230
the thriving, as a
movement, as a way of living

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.590
our lives differently,
works or not.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.990
And I totally understand why
you're asking this question.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.100
Because when you
look around, you

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.030
see that the
majority of people we

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:12.990
know about who are
successful are workaholics.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.600
So you look around
and you say, hey

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.020
they succeeded because they
worked around the clock.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.320
And they were always
available, et cetera.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.210
But there is no
correlation, that's

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.671
what I'm here to tell you.

00:39:23.671 --> 00:39:26.410
And again, I was having this
conversation with Oprah,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.200
one of the super
successful people we know.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.590
And I just taped Super
Soul Sunday with her,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.590
which is airing on Mother's Day.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:38.300
And we both agreed
that if Oprah had not

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.640
worked as hard as she did,
including, as she said,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.020
often going to bed at
night with her clothes

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.540
on because she was too
tired to take them off,

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.450
she would still be Oprah.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.470
But she would have had a
much better time of it.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.990
Because what makes
her Oprah is not

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.130
that she worked
around the clock,

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:01.250
but all the great gifts
and talents and abilities

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.280
to connect with people.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.440
These are hers.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.330
It's not a function
of how hard she works.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.280
And what makes me me is
whatever talents I have,

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.630
and what makes Rachel
Rachel are her talents.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:18.650
And what makes you you are
your talents and gifts.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:20.900
Whatever is our
unique personality,

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.980
that's what makes us us.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.000
I'm not for a minute suggesting
we're not going to work hard.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.950
I work hard now.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.430
I'm suggesting working
stupidly, and not regenerating,

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.285
and not renewing
ourselves, which

00:40:33.285 --> 00:40:35.460
only make us better at work.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:41.630
And I think the ultimate
evidence here is in sports.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.650
Because sports is
all about winning.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.770
Nothing else matters, right?

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.070
And now sports is
ahead of business

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:53.320
in incorporating all
these thriving measures.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.710
And sleep, and meditation,
and yoga, and pauses.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:03.080
And you saw, probably, the
LeBron James meditation video

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.700
that went crazy viral.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.150
And another way to
explain that is,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.800
I was watching an interview
that Charlie Rose did

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.940
with Andy Murray, the
great tennis player.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.330
And they talked about
how when you're really

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:21.522
recharged on the court--
do you play tennis?

00:41:21.522 --> 00:41:23.230
RACHEL WHETSTONE: No,
I'm terrible at it,

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:25.330
but I do sometimes play, yes.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.570
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well
for those who play tennis,

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.550
whether good or bad,
you know that when

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.630
you're really recharged
and feel good,

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:37.070
the ball is coming at you
almost in slow motion.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.920
So you have time
to deal with it,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.920
to decide what
you're going to do,

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.830
where you're going
to hit it, et cetera.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.100
And I feel it's a great
metaphor for life.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.942
I know that when I'm exhausted,
its as though everything

00:41:47.942 --> 00:41:50.150
is coming at me this way,
and I have to deal with it,

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.608
and I don't know
where I'm looking,

00:41:51.608 --> 00:41:53.900
and it's like an onslaught.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.080
And so this is
like the key thing

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.000
that we need to disentangle.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.460
The fact that more
successful people we know,

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.721
or perhaps every
successful person we know,

00:42:07.721 --> 00:42:10.910
has worked around the clock.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.310
With the assumption,
therefore, that that's

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.450
the only way to succeed.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.190
That's the kind of
disentangling that has

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.030
to happen in our
brains, and I think

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.440
the way to do it is through
experimenting and collecting

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.844
data.

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:27.786
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:27.786 --> 00:42:29.452
RACHEL WHETSTONE:
It's also, presumably,

00:42:29.452 --> 00:42:30.670
about phases in your life.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.545
I mean, presumably, when
you were starting up

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:35.150
"The Huffington Post," that
was a very intense phase.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.730
And now you know more
how to do the job,

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.880
there are ways in which
you can pause and do things

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.380
differently.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.880
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Right, but also,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.770
even when you have the
most intense phases,

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:48.420
then you can have a pause,
regenerate, and then have

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.070
another intense phase.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:53.380
I think it's the lack of
pauses and opportunities

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.027
to regenerate and
renew ourselves

00:42:55.027 --> 00:42:56.610
that's the problem,
not the intensity.

00:42:59.322 --> 00:43:01.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Arianna, for coming.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.238
So I've been dying to ask
this question, since you're

00:43:03.238 --> 00:43:04.160
giving practical tips.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.570
One of the problems this
entire room suffers from

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.140
is the volume of information
we deal with, especially email.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.510
So I want to ask a question
about email hygiene,

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.740
as to how you do it.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.780
Now you take the opposite
attack, as Rachel mentioned.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.360
You stand up at
conferences and say,

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.670
email me at
arianna@huffingtonpost.com.

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:21.920
And you did it at Wisdom 2.0.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.420
Since we test
everything at Google--

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.000
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And I got
an amazing amounts of email.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.660
AUDIENCE: So I emailed you.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:27.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.750
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
And I responded, right?

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:29.730
AUDIENCE: You
responded immediately,

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:30.110
connected me to the editor--

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.720
RACHEL WHETSTONE: You're
a very effective router.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.471
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:43:32.471 --> 00:43:34.470
And I went on to become
a blogger at Huffington,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.120
and you responded
every single time.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.170
And I have no idea
how you do it.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.630
I just want to
know, specifically,

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.960
do you have 10 people
scanning your email

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.920
and answering for you?

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.690
Or do you actually look
at every single email?

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:48.320
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: I
do have people scanning,

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.370
but I look at every email.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.060
I don't look at
them in real time.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:54.970
That's the key.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.410
The key is what you
said about your husband.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:44:01.775
The problem is when we allow
email to just constantly

00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:04.402
intrude into what we're doing.

00:44:04.402 --> 00:44:06.360
If you think of it, it
would be the equivalent,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.660
before email, if every
time a letter came,

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.680
the postman rang the
bell and you got up

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.290
and you went out and got
the letter and opened it.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.470
And then you went back
to what you were doing.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.420
It doesn't make any sense.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.675
So changing our email
protocol is absolutely key.

00:44:25.675 --> 00:44:27.820
At "The Huffington
Post," for example,

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.770
we have new email rules.

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:33.730
Which is that, unless you're on
the night shift or the weekend

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.720
shift-- we're a 24/7
media operation,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.232
so there are a lot of people
on this shift-- they are not

00:44:39.232 --> 00:44:43.040
expected to answer
work email after hours.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.360
If there is an emergency
and we need to reach you,

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.960
we'll text you, we'll
call you, we'll find you.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.970
And that makes a big
difference, because I

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.630
think what's hard for people
is the expectation that they

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.790
have to be always on.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.530
And even Goldman Sachs,
now, told its analysts

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.380
that they don't have
to work weekends,

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.680
which is a radical point.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.650
But it shows that there's
something happening,

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.420
that it's in the
air, that they're

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.610
going to be more effective.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.520
And fewer of them will
commit suicide, too.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.710
Right now there's
a spate of suicides

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.350
in the finance industry.

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:19.184
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:19.184 --> 00:45:21.724
RACHEL WHETSTONE: I think there
should be a rule that there's

00:45:21.724 --> 00:45:23.130
no such thing as
an urgent email.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.680
If you want to get hold
of someone, you ring them.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.700
Because otherwise
you're expecting people

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.770
to walk around like
this the whole time

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:31.784
to catch the urgent email,
which is very unrelaxing.

00:45:31.784 --> 00:45:32.700
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.610
Thank you for being here.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.390
You've had a unique journey.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.310
You've been successful
in a time when

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:43.890
we've got great political
and economic polarization.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:47.670
You've been successful
on the right and the left

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.100
and certainly economically.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:56.710
And this newest work, "Thrive,"
going from the ethic of work

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.632
harder to be successful
to try to be happier.

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:02.840
There aren't many people
who've made that transition.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.030
And I'm often stumped by
people who are diametrically

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.070
opposed to me
philosophically, being

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.720
on the other end
of the spectrum.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.960
Can you say something about the
major philosophical transitions

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.110
you've made in your life?

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:23.620
And how we might bring
others along, as well?

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.410
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So philosophically,

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.870
ever since I can
remember, I've always

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:38.370
been really interested in
these big questions-- what

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.930
is the purpose of life,
what is the meaning of life,

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.250
why are we here?

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:44.330
I never considered
that these questions

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.760
had to stop when
we're in college.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.450
I always love these
conversations.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:58.630
And I fell in love with a
man, when we lived in London,

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.950
because he was always writing
about these questions.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.450
And he was twice my age and
half my size, but I didn't care.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.950
And I was with him
for seven years,

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.663
and it was all about
these conversations.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:17.905
And I find that the difference
was that these conversations

00:47:17.905 --> 00:47:21.010
had remained
intellectual for me,

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.180
and now I tried to apply them.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:28.740
I tried to apply the
wisdom, and loved the fact

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.600
that so much of
the ancient wisdom

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.520
I have studied-- whether it's
Buddhism, or Christianity,

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:40.170
or mystical Sufism--
basically says the same thing.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.020
Which is that life is shaped
from the inside out, period.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.259
And I love, now, to be
putting this into practice.

00:47:48.259 --> 00:47:49.300
So that's the difference.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.020
The difference is now that
I'm applying these things

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.076
that before I just used to have
as fascinating conversations.

00:48:03.804 --> 00:48:04.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, Arianna.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.490
Thanks for coming.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.740
So you talk about pauses and
building them into your life.

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.680
And I, two and a 1/2 years
ago, took a three-month break

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.530
from Google for an unpaid leave.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.090
So I'm wondering,
what is your take,

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:19.400
so we can help
companies figure out

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.280
how to build in these pauses
that ultimately make people

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.560
more effective, more
visible, and just

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.320
having more energy overall?

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.840
Because I feel like that's
one of my main messages

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.830
that I want to be
sharing with people,

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.490
as I've learned a lot from that.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:37.656
And I want to help, from
the corporate level,

00:48:37.656 --> 00:48:38.780
other companies understand.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.904
I would love to hear what
you have to say about it.

00:48:40.904 --> 00:48:43.360
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well
that is the key-- sharing

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.920
your experience.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:51.000
Because we need more role models
of doing things differently.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.710
At LinkedIn where
I was before, I

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:56.260
was talking to the
general counsel.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:02.630
And Erica, who's one of the
more successful women lawyers,

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.630
was talking about
how she started

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.190
integrating pauses in her life.

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.930
She would go hiking
over the weekend

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.040
and see how incredible
space is created

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.990
in her and in her responses.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.460
And then she started
doing it on Fridays.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.170
And then she went on a call--
she had an important conference

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:20.670
call.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.380
But she still went on her hike.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.880
And she said there she was
on the conference call,

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.650
and suddenly she
saw a mountain lion.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.250
And she was talking about
how, for the first time,

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.750
she noticed that there
were black squirrels.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.540
And that is amazing,
because she always

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:40.520
thought that
squirrels were gray.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.140
And in her office
she has this picture

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.490
of a squirrel, which is
like her kind of totem,

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:50.480
about, remember to look at
the color of the squirrel.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:57.360
So I think hearing these
stories, among women and men

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.230
who are successful, making
room in their lives for pauses

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:06.680
and space, is very reinforcing.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.630
And that's one of the
things I want to do.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.110
And that's why I always
want to ask you all

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.530
to write about these things.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.670
Because when you write about
taking a sabbatical for three

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.370
months, and the world
did not collapse.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:21.127
And you're back, and
your job, or another job,

00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:22.890
was still there.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:27.720
It just takes a lot of the
fear out of these pauses.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.640
And I think companies
are beginning

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.930
to realize that if you have
a good employee that you want

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:38.460
to keep, allowing them
to take a sabbatical

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.154
is just in the
interest of everybody.

00:50:40.154 --> 00:50:41.820
AUDIENCE: Well that's
great, because I'm

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.820
writing a book about it.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.850
And it's called "Pause."

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.615
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Oh, fantastic.

00:50:44.615 --> 00:50:45.530
Well let us know.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:47.375
We'd love to help promote it.

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:56.710
AUDIENCE: So I've been
at Google for nine years.

00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:00.090
And just to your point
about being a role model,

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.330
I thought I'd send you an
email while I was sitting

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:03.830
in the front row,
but decided, maybe

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.170
I'll get up here and say it.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.447
We talk all about
working around the clock.

00:51:09.447 --> 00:51:10.905
I've been at Google
for nine years,

00:51:10.905 --> 00:51:14.750
and I don't work
around the clock.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.260
I don't check my
email, I don't respond

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.450
to email in the evenings.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:22.156
And I think I've done
fairly well at Google.

00:51:22.156 --> 00:51:23.780
So I'm standing up
here, telling people

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.060
that you can do it at Google.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.500
You don't have to be
connected to your email.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:33.506
You don't have to respond
to everything in real time.

00:51:33.506 --> 00:51:35.130
But it's hard to say
it, because you're

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.650
in a company where
everyone does it.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:41.350
And so you kind of stand
out as the anomaly.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:42.850
So I think we have
to figure out how

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.140
to make this a safe
environment, in Google

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.140
and the corporate world.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:49.180
To talk about it, to say,
you can be successful.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.000
You can do great things
by taking pauses,

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.950
by doing things that you're
more interested in doing

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:59.220
on weekends than doing
a document or an email.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:03.072
But it takes people to stand
up and start talking about it,

00:52:03.072 --> 00:52:04.030
before that can happen.

00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:05.321
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:52:05.321 --> 00:52:07.610
Until we get to a critical mass.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:12.820
And so everybody who stands up,
as you did now, and says that

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.440
is bringing us closer
to the critical mass.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.705
And also being aware of
companies and individuals who

00:52:19.705 --> 00:52:25.490
are doing it, like the
Boston Consulting Group.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:29.850
They have what they call
a red zone report, where

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.860
if consultants are
billing too many hours,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.900
they consider them at
risk of depression,

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.700
health problems, et cetera.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.110
So they issue a red zone
report and talk to them.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:46.510
So I have a lot of those
examples that it is happening.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.850
Just us talking about
it is accelerating

00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.360
the shift that's
already happening.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.230
This is a global shift.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:58.070
And it's happening partly
because we are recognizing ,

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.960
more and more, the
price we are paying.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.700
And partly because
more and more people

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.290
are beginning to
live differently,

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:08.730
make different choices,
themselves or their companies

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:13.450
and seeing that this has
a great positive impact.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.070
Let me give you an example.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:18.910
Mark Bertolini, the CEO of
Aetna, the third largest health

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:22.020
insurance company, had a
terrible skiing accident,

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.650
broke his neck, spent a year
hooked on narcotics, barely

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:27.830
able to function,
And then discovered

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:31.050
what he called his cocktail,
of yoga, meditation,

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:34.725
and acupuncture,
which saved him.

00:53:34.725 --> 00:53:37.900
It had such a positive
transformative impact on him,

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:39.920
that he made them
available as benefits

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.890
to his 49,000 employees.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:45.100
And then he brought
in Duke University

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.940
to study the cost benefit.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.760
And they found a 7% reduction
in health care costs

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.830
and a 69-minute improvement
in productivity every day.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:59.120
So you see, here we're
talking about data.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.010
It's not his opinion, it's
not California new-agey,

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.280
flaky stuff.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.340
It's proof.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.070
And that's how we're going
to get a critical mass.

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.730
Thank you for telling us.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:19.060
RACHEL WHETSTONE: And
I think, on that note,

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.400
we are out of time.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.800
But thank you so much
for coming and sharing

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.740
your advice with us.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.430
And really, really good
luck with your book talk.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.240
Thank you so much.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.704
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Thank you so much.

00:54:27.704 --> 00:54:29.560
Thank you, thank you.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:50.080
