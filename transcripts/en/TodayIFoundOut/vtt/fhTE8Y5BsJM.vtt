00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.810
Medical science has advanced an astounding
amount in the last 50 years or so and we can

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.980
do things today that a half a century ago
even in that era’s science fiction would

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.690
have been considered science fiction.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.460
By the same token though, there were things
done in the 1950s and 1960s that people today

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.079
are still skeptical actually happened, like
all those experiments that resulted in a bunch

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.809
of two headed dogs.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.079
Said experiments were conducted by one, Vladimir
Demikhov, a Soviet scientist who is noted

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.890
as being a pioneer in the field of organ transplantation.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.860
Dr. Demikhov was responsible for, amongst
other things, pioneering the use of immuno-suppressants

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.289
in organ transplants and designing the “first
mechanical cardiac-assist device”, essentially

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.420
the precursor to modern artificial hearts.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.500
With this latter device, Demikhov was able
to take over the cardiac function of a dog

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.420
for around five hours, an experiment notable
for being “the first ever in which circulation

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.060
was maintained in an animal whose heart had
been excised”.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.250
Prior to Demikhov, this was a feat that many
believed to be impossible.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.750
Demikhov is also known to have performed the
first heart transplant in 1946, in this instance

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.759
on a dog; this was a full 21 years before
the first human transplant took place and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.760
was a major step towards the latter ever happening.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.899
It has been noted that Demikhov was a genius
whose “successes heralded the era of modern

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.770
heart and lung transplantation”.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
Despite this glowing praise in some circles,
his contributions have largely been overlooked

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.400
outside of the medical community due to the
infamy of his later, more audacious experiments.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.380
This brings us back to the two headed dogs.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.570
Sometime in the early 1950s, spurred on by
the success of his experiments involving the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.750
transplantation of organs in dogs, including
several experiments in which he’d managed

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
to successfully transplant multiple organs
of the same type into the same animal, Demikhov

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.269
began toying with the idea of transplanting
the most valuable organ of all- the brain.

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.960
Demikhov is said have been inspired by the
work of his peer, Dr Sergei Brukhonenko, another

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.950
Soviet medical pioneer known for inventing
a machine capable of artificially simulating

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.110
the functionality of the heart and lungs,
albeit on a temporary basis.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.530
Like Demikhov, the work of Brukhonenko is
largely overlooked due to an experiment involving

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.530
dogs.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.290
In Brukhonenko’s case, he infamously kept
the decapitated heads of several dogs alive

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.569
using the aforementioned machine for a number
of hours, proving that it was possible to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.129
keep the brain alive and functional after
almost unthinkable trauma.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.550
Footage of these experiments appears in a
documentary released in 1940 aptly titled

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.959
“Experiments in the Revival of Organisms”.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.069
However, the veracity of this footage, which
shows a decapitated dog’s head connected

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.170
to a heart lung machine blinking and responding
to various stimuli, has been the topic of

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.280
heated debate for many years and even to this
day, there’s no agreement on whether it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.909
actually shows what it claims.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.319
To be clear, Brukhonenko’s experiments on
reanimation are well documented and there’s

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.180
little doubt they actually took place as he
claimed.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.049
However, there is some uncertainty about whether
the particular documentary actually shows

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.540
real experiments or whether it was a reenactment
of sorts after the fact for propaganda purposes.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.180
Getting back to Demikhov, his idea was as
simple as it was shocking.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.629
He would prove that the brain, like any other
organ, could be successfully transplanted

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.170
by cutting the head off a dog, keeping it
alive using the same technology as Brukhonenko

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.890
had done, and then transplanting it onto the
body of another dog.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.010
All in all, it’s recorded that Demikhov
performed this experiment “over 24 times”

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.299
with varying degrees of success- success in
this context meaning that the subjects survived

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.709
the ordeal and even displayed some awareness
of their surroundings and the ability to respond

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.969
to stimuli.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:14.239
After successful transplants, the dogs typically
died days later as a result of immune responses.

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.269
Of course, scientists being good scientists,
many were skeptical that Demikhov could actually

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.419
perform such a procedure successfully- they
wanted direct proof.

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.100
So to silence the skeptics, Demikhov invited
LIFE magazine to document and photograph one

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.150
of his experiments in 1959.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.330
The resulting article, titled “Russia Two-Headed
Dog” documented the entire transplant procedure

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.930
including the preliminary preparations, during
which Demikhov introduced the journalist writing

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.340
the article to the two dogs he was about to
sew together, Shavka, a small 9 year old female,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.520
and Brodyaga, a large stray of which little
was known.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.889
two-headed-dog2Demikhov then further “endeared”
himself to any potential readers by saying

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.840
that Brodyaga was Russian for “Tramp”
and that he personally felt the dog was quite

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.800
lucky since “two heads are better than one”.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.710
Prior to the actual operation, Demikhov also
introduced the interviewing journalist to

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.210
a dog called Palma, which he revealed had
two hearts thanks to an operation he performed

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.970
on the animal a few days earlier.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.160
The article culminated in Shavka’s head
and fore legs being successfully grafted onto

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.460
Brodyaga’s body.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.610
The operation was such a success, in fact,
that Shavka’s decapitated head was even

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.340
able to lap a few mouthfuls of water from
a bowl with some assistance, something Demikhov

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.840
did purely for the cameras present as Shavka’s
throat was not attached to Brodyaga’s stomach,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.360
meaning it couldn’t gain any nourishment
from food or water via normal means.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.979
In the end, the two dogs survived for four
days before dying from complications of the

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.490
surgery, which came as a surprise to Demikhov
who revealed that some of his previous subjects

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.009
had survived for as long as 29 days.

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.930
two-headed-dog-1Despite the potential implications
of Demikhov’s research, this particular

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.280
bit of his life’s work was largely dismissed
by the wider scientific community with the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.560
exception of a few scientists, most notably
American neuroscientist Dr. Robert White,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.470
who infamously and successfully repeated the
experiment using rhesus monkeys in the 1970s.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.290
While the two experiments were basically the
same and set out to prove the same point-

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.040
that a full head transplant was possible-
there were a number of differences.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.099
Beyond the fact that a monkey head transplant
is much closer to the procedure needed for

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.780
a human head transplant, which is the end
goal of this research, Demikhov had attached

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.349
the head of one dog to the body of another,
still living dog, while White went one step

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.590
further and transplanted the head of one monkey
onto a headless monkey body.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.229
Doing this meant that, with the exception
of the spinal cord, every major artery and

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.860
even the windpipe and throat could be connected
successfully to the new host body, allowing

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.949
for more or less normal body function, other
than the typical issues associated with paralysis.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.379
What’s more, the transplanted monkey head
retained full awareness of its surroundings

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.689
to such an extent that literally the first
thing it did upon regaining consciousness

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.699
was bite the finger of a medical assistant.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.380
With these results in hand, White concluded
that performing the same surgery on a human

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.750
would soon be possible and that the person
would not only potentially survive, but suffer

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.430
few ill effects other than the obvious (then)
irreversible damage to their spinal cord,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.000
something that wouldn’t be an issue for
terminal quadriplegics, who White felt would

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.180
be the best candidates for such a procedure.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.760
However, he also stated,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.230
Whether such dramatic procedures will ever
be justified in the human area must wait not

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.099
only upon the continued advance of medical
science but more appropriately the moral and

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.860
social justification of such procedural undertakings.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.819
Others have also taken up the research area
despite the ethical controversy, citing the

00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:41.569
massive benefit such procedures would provide
to countless individuals, such as those with

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:46.090
terminal cancer, severe muscular atrophy,
paralysis from the neck down, people with

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.689
multiple organ failure, etc.- essentially,
anyone who has an otherwise fully functional

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:56.289
brain, but whose life support systems (in
sum comprising their body) are failing in

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:00.009
some way, which ultimately would cause the
premature death of the brain.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.790
head-transplantAs to the current state of
this brand of research, Italian neurosurgeon

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.919
Sergio Canavero states that he expects the
technology will be ready as soon as 2017 to

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:08.919
perform a successful human head transplant.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:09.919
He even has a candidate lined up for the procedure,
Valery Spiridonov (pictured right), who suffers

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:10.919
from Werdnig–Hoffmann disease and whose
health is declining significantly as he ages.

00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:11.919
For Spiridonov, there will come a time when
his only hope of survival is transplanting

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:12.919
his head to a donated body, at which point
even a slim chance of success in such a surgery

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:13.919
is preferable to the alternative.

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:17.900
Not satisfied to leave the head transplanted
individual paralyzed, Dr. Canavero even managed

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.409
to re-knit the spinal cord of a rat after
severing it, allowing the animal to eventually

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:24.009
regain control of its body.

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:29.039
German researchers in 2014 also reported similar
success repairing a severed spinal cord in

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.139
a rat using a similar technique.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.610
Said Canavero, “This experiment is an important
piece of our puzzle because now we know for

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.180
sure that it is possible for a spinal cord
to grow back together.”

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.070
Beyond Dr. Canavero, arguably the world leader
in head transplants is one Dr. Ren Xiaoping

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.500
of China who has led a team that has made
significant advancements in the procedures

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.500
in this arena.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.590
Dr. Canavero recently commented on Dr. Xiaoping’s
work, “I can tell you that within the last

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.430
18 months, about 1,000 similar surgeries were
performed in China, and I can say that this

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.240
very rat (the one with the repaired spinal
cord) is not the best sample.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.990
We will say more as soon as the information
is published in the scientific magazines,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.800
because until then it is restricted by copyright.”

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.890
As for Dr. Xioaping, he noted of the ethics
of the procedure that back when things like

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.850
human heart transplants were first becoming
a real possibility, there was just as much

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.130
controversy surrounding if this area of research,
let alone applying it to a human procedure,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.200
was morally acceptable or not, and that “many
people say a head transplant is not ethical.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.690
But what is the essence of a person?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.990
A person is the brain, not the body.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.740
The body is just an organ.”

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.790
Essentially, the body is just a magnificent
life support system.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.279
For some, theirs fails resulting in an otherwise
healthy brain that might have lived many more

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:40.130
years dying as well.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:45.160
Beyond practicing procedures on cadavers,
presently Dr. Xioaping and his team have successfully

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.980
transplanted numerous heads of rats and other
animals onto new host bodies, including transplanting

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.650
monkey heads, which, as previously noted,
is a relatively similar procedure to transplanting

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.650
a human head.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.860
Dr. Xioaping reported that (currently) a monkey
head transplant takes approximately 20 hours

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.810
to complete and he expects a human head transplant
to take an additional 10-20 hours.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.760
However, before Dr. Xioaping is willing to
try the procedure on an otherwise terminal

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.170
human patient, he stated that advancements
still need to be made to ensure an extremely

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.300
high probability of success.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.700
Towards this end, he and his team are working
on improving methods to cut the spinal cord

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.700
cleanly enough to allow for a high probability
of reconnecting to the spinal cord in the

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.982
new body, advancements in suppressing organ
rejection, and ability to better maintain

00:10:26.982 --> 00:10:30.810
blood pressure to the brain throughout the
procedure to ensure no brain damage.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.820
Despite the technical obstacles remaining
and some amount of public opposition to such

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.300
human procedures, even if they ultimately
are life saving for many with otherwise terminal

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.970
conditions, Dr. Xioaping posited in March
of 2016,

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.500
We are getting closer and closer to our goal
of a human head transplant.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500
I don’t have a timetable.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500
It is very complex work.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:14:09.529
We can’t say it will happen tomorrow – but
I am not ruling out next year.
