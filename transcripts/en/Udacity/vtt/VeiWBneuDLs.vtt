00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.560
So now we know a little bit more about where these letters come from and how

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.510
they're organized, it's time to learn how they

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.330
make up the code to build a human.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.250
&gt;&gt; Great. I think you're ready for the

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.790
next lesson, where we're going to learn how the information

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.910
from this human genome is actually transcribed and translated

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.530
into the proteins that make up who we are.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.730
&gt;&gt; See you next lesson.
