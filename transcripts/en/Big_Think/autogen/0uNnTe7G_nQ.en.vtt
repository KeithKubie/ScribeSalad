obviously a very modern condition
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.860
obviously a very modern condition
because writing is a very modern

thousands of years so dyslexia is modern

thousands of years so dyslexia is modern

thousands of years so dyslexia is modern
in terms of thousands of years and you

in terms of thousands of years and you

know language was always about sound and

never an inability but the lessened
