00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
I don't believe that in a moral and wealthy America, people should be too poor to live.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.580
How are you feeling?
Can you put it into words?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.160
Nope. I cannot put this into words.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.600
You are from the Bronx, born and raised. You actually represent and live in the community that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.740
you hope to represent in Congress, when
we see all too often Congress members

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
not even living in their district, like
your opponent. What does it mean for you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100
to have effective representation like that?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800
There's been so many, especially

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.890
working-class people in the Bronx that
are so excited. I went to my bodega last

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.809
night and people were just excited and
clapping. I think it just means a lot to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.120
be seen and to feel seen and to feel
like one of you, a representative from

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
your community that cares, that stays
there, has a voice in what's going on.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.579
Most of your fundraising was small
donations and you refused to take

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.660
corporate PAC money. Why was that so
important to you?

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.900
I wanted to be a 100%

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.700
accountable representative to my
community. I believe that the role of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.610
money in politics is really degrading
our democracy and hurting our ability to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.930
have effective government. There's a lot
you can do without money. You can knock

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.590
on your neighbor's door without money.
You can make phone calls without money.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280
And that's just what we did for a really,
really long time.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.960
As this race goes on to the midterms, do you see a scenario where you're going to have to start taking

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460
corporate money? And would you do it?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.200
I won't. I am totally fine working

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.600
with political organizations, but the
line that I want to draw is pretending

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.460
that I am neutral in policymaking when
I'm taking money from

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.540
one side that has a vested, for-profit interest.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.420
You're running on a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.760
"Medicare-for-All," free public college, a
federal jobs guarantee. Which is the top

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.700
priority for you and how are you going to
pay for this?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.580
That's always a question,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.620
"How are you gonna pay for it?" War is very expensive too and we never ask about that.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.660
We only ask how we're gonna pay for
things when we're talking about taking care of people.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.040
The GOP tax cut costs the United States

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.180
$400 billion. You know what you could have done with

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.060
$400 billion? You could have forgiven
every single federal student loan debt

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.330
in America. That's what you could have
done with $400 billion. We want

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.650
improved and expanded "Medicare for all." We want tuiton-free public colleges

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.510
and trade schools. We want a green new
deal to address climate change. I'm an

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.360
idealist in my goals, I'm an idealist in
my vision, and I'm very pragmatic about

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.750
how I get there. I don't believe that in
a moral and wealthy America, people

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.569
should be too poor to live. I find that
to be an unacceptable state â€“ that you can be

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.680
too poor to see a doctor, that you can be
too poor to send your child to the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.420
school that actually gives them options
for their future. And I want to live in a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:13.560
society that does not fail people's most
basic needs to live. And so that for me, it's about dignity.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.140
You call for the abolishment of ICE, and I think a lot of people forget that ICE hasn't really

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.799
been around all that long. It was born
out of the so-called War on Terror. It's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.520
been around since 2003, only. But what do you see as a replacement for ICE?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.480
I think that immigration should be safe. I think that we should grant people a safe and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.670
documented rite of passage. Republicans
try all these scare tactics and they go,

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.489
"Oh, open borders!" Because they're trying to incite fear. But what we really

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.530
need to do is demilitarize a lot of
what's going on in terms of the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.069
detention of people, which has been
happening for a very long time, by the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.250
way. And so I think that when we
talk about replacing it with a system,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
when you talk about really having a
system that is safe, that documents

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.629
people effectively, that is also not
rooted in the discrimination that our

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.629
immigration system was initially built
on. The first immigration law in the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.620
United States was the Chinese Exclusion
Act. The first law about immigration in

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.150
the United States was, "How do we exclude a specific type of people?" And our

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.859
immigration system has really kind of
evolved from that initial root,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.000
and I don't think it necessarily has to
be that way.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.280
Days before your election you left New York and you went down to the southern border to protest these

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.780
family separations that we're seeing and
you said the moral character of our nation is on the line.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.430
Right now, the nation that we are living in is a

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.979
country that, an administration,
that has committed international human

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.820
rights abuses by separating children from their parents.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.520
That is being done in our name. Once something that extreme happens, we have to act immediately.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.040
Do you see any parallels between the Muslim ban and what's going on on the border right now?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.270
Absolutely, absolutely. What the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.150
administration is doing is racializing
the fight over immigration and that is

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.960
kind of stoking an increased sense of
bigotry in the country. And so there's

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.420
absolutely a connection. And that is why
I think we have to be in solidarity with each other.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.580
You've been outspoken in your
support for Palestinian human rights,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.750
which some would say is political
suicide for a New York politician, very

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.400
uncommon for someone in Congress or
running for Congress. You called Israel's

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.140
response to peaceful protesters in Gaza a "massacre" in a tweet. Why was it so easy for you to see it that way?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.200
It's just not about nationality. It's about people who

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.220
are unarmed who are killed.
If 60 people were shot and killed in

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.080
Ferguson, if 60 people were shot and
killed in Puerto Rico, if 60 people were

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.740
shot and killed in the South Bronx. It's tragic. It's tragic.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.830
You're speaking directly to
working class folks. Do you think your

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.060
message and yourself appeals to Trump supporters?

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:20.440
Just because I may be aghast at the way that somebody voted, doesn't mean that I'm going to permanently

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.890
dismiss them. I'm a woman of color that
comes from a working-class, sometimes

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.020
even poor background depending on the
year. And a vote for Donald Trump, a lot

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.520
of times I could take it as a personal
rebuke of everything that I am,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.720
but I just cannot give in to that
because I still believe that there's a

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.000
lot of people that could be won over on
that agenda, on my agenda.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.700
Do you think we can talk about class without talking about race,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.640
and talk about race without talking about class?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.270
No, no. There's this
false notion that you can separate these

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.580
two issues, there's a false notion that
you have to pick one or another, and it

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.590
is patently false. This is the United
States of America. We have to confront

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.520
our history. We founded our nation on an
economic system of slavery. That has

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.650
evolved to Jim Crow laws. It evolved
into mass incarceration. There is no

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.820
economic issue in the United States that
does not have racial implications and

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.449
vice versa. You look at issues like
immigration, you look at issues like

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:29.729
criminal justice reform, private prisons.
They all have economic implications. And

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:35.520
the idea of saying, "Oh, we need to talk
about class and not race," is to also

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:44.040
erase the identity of many people. It's not like only one class, creed, religion of person is working class.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.400
So it's clearly a dark time for a lot of people

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:50.610
in the country, especially young
progressives who have just been seeing

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.720
you know a lot of doom and gloom since
Donald Trump was elected president.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.160
What do you say to young people to give
them hope and to get them engaged?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:06.659
Wherever there is a fight, there is hope.
When people stop fighting, that is when

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.560
hope ends. And I think that's what we proved on

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.540
Tuesday, that no matter the odds, change
is possible in America and that our

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.040
nation is never beyond repair.
