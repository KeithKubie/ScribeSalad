00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
The stereotype that men are smarter than women has a long history,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.000
but in the battle of the sexes, who actually has the superior intellect when it comes down to it?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.420
Are boys smarter than girls?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.960
Early studies show that male brains are 8 to 13 percent larger in volume than female brains,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
however this has been since attributed to differences in body size.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.140
Women's brains have more gyrofication or brain folding, and as a result,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.880
a greater cortical surface area.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.380
Besides, bigger isn't always better.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.560
Sperm whales, elephants and dolphins all have larger brains than humans,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.160
and while they are smart, their cognitive abilities are less than our own.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.020
There are other structural differences, though,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.140
like males having more connections within hemispheres,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.740
while women have more connections between hemispheres.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.400
But overall, MRI brain imaging shows significant overlap in the physical structure between the sexes.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.000
After studying 14 hundred brains and comparing the sexes,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.980
researchers found that mostly all men and woman show

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.580
a mosaic of female and male typical structures in the brain.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.020
This study also evaluted gender stereotypical behaviours.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.620
Like how video games are often considered male behaviour while scrapbooking is female

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.480
and the results found that 0.1% of test subjects displayed only male or only female typical behaviours.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.080
Tests on intelligence find similar results with major IQ studies showing

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460
neglible, or no sex differences in general intelligence

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.220
but do show women having stronger verbal abilities while men show stronger visual-spatial abilities.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.460
Interestingly, studies show more male variance in tests with their scores being both the worst and the best.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.940
One meta analysis of 22 studies did fiund men to be 3.3 to 5.5 IQ points above women but

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.220
this study has been called into question by academics who found the methodology flawed.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
In academic performance of language, math and science,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.920
women consistently received better grade in 70% of nations.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.460
But on SAT testing in the U.S. men scored 33 points higher in math and science.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
Other tests like the Program for International Student Assessment showed both sexes performing equally

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.500
in several countries with girls performing better in some like Iceland suggesting cultural and environmental differences

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
and not necessarily biological differences at play.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.860
But research has found that stereotypes about womens performance actually impact how well they do.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.600
When told that a particular math test had significant gender differences,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.700
women performed significantly worse than their male peers.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.760
While women who were told there was no difference, scored the same.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720
This phenomenom is known as the stereotype threat.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.460
Even google search data shows that parents 2.5 times more likely to

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.080
search is my son gifted than is my daughter gifted?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.500
Despite 11% more girls in gifted programs in America.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.860
And girls pick up on these bias as early as 6 years old.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.620
When told a story at age 5 about a person who is really really smart

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.000
both boys and girls associate intelligence with there own gender

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.400
but by age 6 both girls and boys picked a male character as the smartest.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.480
In a similar experiment kids were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really really smart

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.640
and again at age 5 both sexes wanted to play but by age 6, girls had decided these games weren't for them.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.240
and though women do strive to work in STEM fields studies show they face barriers.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.620
In a double blind study science faculty from research universities

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.400
rated applications for a lab manager position.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.540
What they didn't know is that the applications were randomly assigned either male or female names.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.400
As a result, faculty perceived the male applicant names to be significantly more competent,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.740
hireable and deserving of mentoring even though the applications with female names were identical.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.020
Males were also offered higher starting salaries, an average of 30,000 versus the females 26,000.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.120
Though these studies produce a sobering reality research does point to growing equality

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.280
between the sexes with passing decades and education

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.980
and in spite of these barriers women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.980
Rosalind Franklin allowed us to understand our own DNA,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.860
Katherine Johnson helped Apollo 11 land on the moon

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.880
and this year Maryam Mirzakhani is the first women to win a Nobel prize for mathematics.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.020
Fellow mathematician Izabella Laba said

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.240
"Mirzakhan's selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.880
mathematical research at the same level of men.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.820
I have never had any doubt about that in the first place..

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.120
What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.380
and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of reconizing excellence in women's work."

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.620
To learn more we asked the women at ASAP Science to speak personally about their experiences growing up

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.080
and give insight about how they navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.
