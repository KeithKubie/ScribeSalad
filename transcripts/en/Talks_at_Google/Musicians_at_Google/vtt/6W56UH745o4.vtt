MALE SPEAKER: Everyone please
welcome to the stage a man

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.450
who, for decades, has redefined
the boundaries of

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.680
music and pushed the limits
of the human voice.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.050
Here to perform from his new
album, "Spirityouall," 10 time

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.629

We are going to play
a few more pieces.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.460
And then we're going to open the
floor to questions, if you

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.192
have any, or to ask any of these
members in this band.

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:41.720
There were six of us
this morning, but

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.200
there's three of us now.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.480
They took different cars.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.680
Who knows where they are?

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.060
Right.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.970

to play, Gil?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.430

I liked her a lot.

came up with it.

00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:44.230
What is the name?

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.410
Google.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.675

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.780
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Goo ga, daddy.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.210
Is that-- was it from
a little kid?

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.910
MALE SPEAKER: Similar
to a word with a one

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.785
with a bunch of zeros.

00:24:58.785 --> 00:25:00.370
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I
figured that.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.400
We, kind of, figured
that one out.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.540
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
just a big number.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.140
BOBBY MCFERRIN: It's
just a big number.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.944

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.880
Yes.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.390
Yeah, so if you guys have any
questions for Bobby, there's

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:16.190
microphones on either side,
so please line up.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.870
This is recorded for the
YouTube, so we need you on mic

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.620
to get you recorded.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.430
So this album, I've been
listening to this, and it's

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.795
been incredible.

00:25:24.795 --> 00:25:26.175
BOBBY MCFERRIN: And you noticed
we only played a

00:25:26.175 --> 00:25:26.505
couple pieces.

00:25:26.505 --> 00:25:27.550
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I know.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.330
I was wanting more.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.780
I was itching for it.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.790
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, we
just didn't go there.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.125
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:34.590
Well, buy the album.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.340
Yes.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.380
So "Spirityouall," the name of
the album, honors the legacy

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.040
of your father, which was
a very talented man.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.270
Correct?

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.880
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yes, he was
extremely talented.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.880
He was the first African
American to sign a contract

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.760
with the Metropolitan
Opera back in 1955.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.270
I remember seeing his
debut in '56.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.340
I was six years old, and it was
"Rigoletto." And he had to

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.410
where this hump on his back and
this long crooked nose.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.830
And so at the intermission my
sister and I went backstage.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:11.197
And we saw this man and we
thought, wait, is this dad?

00:26:11.197 --> 00:26:12.111
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:14.175
BOBBY MCFERRIN: You know because
he had this hump on

00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:15.340
his back and crooked
nose and stuff.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.010
My sister wouldn't get
anywhere near him.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:17.270
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.800
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Nowhere close.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.435
She just would refuse to go into
the dressing because she

00:26:21.435 --> 00:26:23.274
was convinced that that
was not papa.

00:26:23.274 --> 00:26:24.138
You know?

00:26:24.138 --> 00:26:25.786
MALE SPEAKER: There was
no way it could be.

00:26:25.786 --> 00:26:27.350
And your mother too, right?

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.490
BOBBY MCFERRIN: They met
in church choir.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.220
My mom was my dad's accompanist
for a while.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.420
She was also a voice teacher.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.200
Both my parents were
voice teachers.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.890
MALE SPEAKER: So I read
somewhere that you would hide

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.130
under the piano during
her voice lessons.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.600
BOBBY MCFERRIN: During
his lessons.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.370
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it was
she was teaching him.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.800
BOBBY MCFERRIN: No, no,
no, no, no, no,no.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.780
[GIBBERISH]

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.540
Let's start over again.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.620
[GIBBERISH]

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:52.410
MALE SPEAKER: [GIBBERISH]

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.270
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [GIBBERISH]

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.000
Take it all back.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.455
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:26:54.455 --> 00:26:57.276
BOBBY MCFERRIN: My father
was teaching.

00:26:57.276 --> 00:26:59.690
And so I would hide under the
piano when he was giving

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.660
lessons to his voice students.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.860
So I picked up a lot of stuff.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.460
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.560
BOBBY MCFERRIN: He was
a good teacher.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.840
He was a great teacher.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.630
Not a lot of politically correct
things like when

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.660
somebody does something and
they say, oh, that was

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.790
wonderful, but you can try
working on this or on that.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.366
My dad wasn't like, oh,
that was wonderful.

00:27:20.366 --> 00:27:20.760
No.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.650
He was never that way.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.030
He would say that wasn't good.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.210
BOBBY MCFERRIN: He would just
be honest from the get go.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.450
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that's
the best way to be.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.020
BOBBY MCFERRIN: That's
the best way to be.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.130
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.710
And he was also the
voice of who?

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.840
For Sidney Poitier, right?

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.630
BOBBY MCFERRIN: That's right.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.780
In the movie "Porgy
and Bess." 1958.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.870
It's, kind of, hard
to come by.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.680
It's difficult to get
a copy of it.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.760
I don't think you can.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.360
I don't think the Gershwin
estate--

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.830
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sure
we could Google it.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.650
BOBBY MCFERRIN: You
could probably.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:17.415

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.910
I said that?

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:20.000
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.253
It was in writing.

00:28:21.253 --> 00:28:22.000
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Oh yeah?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.430
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.700
So why not just beat box it from
the top of the tallest

00:28:25.925 --> 00:28:27.270

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.962
Pick yourself up.

00:28:56.962 --> 00:28:58.710
Dust yourself off.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.610
And start all over again.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:03.070
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.066
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:09.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:09.046 --> 00:29:10.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.685
MALE SPEAKER: So the album--

00:29:11.685 --> 00:29:15.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.152 --> 00:29:16.690
MALE SPEAKER: We'll skip
that question.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.108
BOBBY MCFERRIN: All right.

00:29:17.108 --> 00:29:18.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:18.362 --> 00:29:20.400
MALE SPEAKER: So this is the
first album you produced

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.840
centered around your
faith, correct?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.710
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, it
certainly involves it, yeah,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.990
because I grew up in
a Christian home.

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:33.592
My grandmother was a really,
really strict Catholic.

00:29:33.592 --> 00:29:35.350
You know, fish on Friday's.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.840
Mass every day.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.700
She got up every morning,
around four, an prayed.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.470
I think where I am is because
of her prayers.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.680
And then I sang in the
children's choir in church.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.790
I was an acolyte or
an alter boy.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.720
I did that.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.420
When I was about 16, I thought
of entering a monastic order

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.390
because I was really into--

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.640
I'm still very much into--

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.430
quiet.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.690
I mean, it might not
seem like it.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.230
But when I'm at home I
have a house in the

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.130
word, and I like quiet.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.140
And I meditate a lot, and walk
my dog, and help my wife in

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.720
the kitchen with slicing up
vegetables for cooking or

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.150
whatever she needs.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.770
Stuff like that.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.990
I like quiet activities because
when I'm on stage I

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.560
get a little loose.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.330
But it's the only time that I'm
really, kind of, a little

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:30.280
nutty and goofy is when I'm
here doing my tunes and

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.320
singing my songs.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.450
MALE SPEAKER: Doing
your tunes.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.850
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [SINGING]

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.353
Oh, yes.

00:30:35.353 --> 00:30:36.335
MALE SPEAKER: What was that?

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:36.826
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [SINGING]

00:30:36.826 --> 00:30:37.530
Oh, yes.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.213
MALE SPEAKER: One more time.

00:30:38.213 --> 00:30:38.556
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [SINGING]

00:30:38.556 --> 00:30:39.345
Oh, yes.

00:30:39.345 --> 00:30:40.680
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.910
So it's centered around
your faith.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.230
Is this the first album you've
done that's been more of a

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.970
religious undertone?

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.020
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yes, it is.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.710
And I wanted to do it because
I've been thinking about this

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.410
project for, at least,
20 years.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.660
It went through all kinds of--

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.570
what's the word when it's
like permutating--

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:57.980
AUDIENCE: Metamorphosis.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.840
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Metamorphosis,
yeah.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.160
It's gone through all
kinds of things.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.010
And in the beginning, I wasn't
sure, exactly, what I wanted

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.600
"Spirityouall" to be.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.750
But then about two years ago, I
thought maybe if I took some

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.310
of the spirituals that
my father sang.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.200
He recorded an album of
spirituals, in 1957, on the

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.140
Riverside label called "Deep
River." And so I used that as

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.290
a basis for this album.

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:25.820
I didn't want to do it like my
dad because his was very--

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.140
well, not classical but he had
a classical trained voice.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.810
I wanted to do something that
was a little more folksy and

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.596
jazzy and blue-grassy and
country and whatever.

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:38.650
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
the bluegrass.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.580
Yeah, I wanted to
touch on that.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.240
I come from a tiny little town
in North Carolina where

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.020
bluegrass is the big thing.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.962
So where did you get your
bluegrass influence from?

00:31:47.962 --> 00:31:49.590
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well,
I've heard some.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.920
Mostly, I think, in films.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.640
Maybe a few recordings
in the past.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.820
I've always been attracted
to it.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.180
We were in Ireland about three
years ago, and we played in a

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.830
little town called Limerick.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.890
And they were having
a reception for me.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.280
So I'm supposed to walk in and
shake hands with all these

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.220
guests, have my picture taken,
sign autographs,

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.430
and stuff like that.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.630
And when I walked through the
door, there was a band playing

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:12.410
in the corner.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.310
And they were playing
genuine Irish music.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.690
I mean, the old traditional
stuff with the pipes, and the

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.420
violin, the fiddle, and all that
kind of stuff, which is

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.290
where our bluegrass
music comes.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.030
So I, sort of, gravitated
over there.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.010
Set in a chair and just hung
out with the band while all

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.830
these people are waiting for
me to have my picture taken

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.560
with them and stuff like that.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.250
And I completely ignored them.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.950
I couldn't help myself because
the music was so inviting.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.990
And it really pulled me
into their center.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.680
I just was stuck there.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.990
I set down and I could not
believe what I was hearing

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.760
because it was such
beautiful music.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:51.570
I love the plain, simple rhythms
of the American heart.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.550
I love jazz.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.310
I love Bluegrass.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:57.550
Anything that's come out of
the soil, even though

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.820
Bluegrass really is
from Ireland.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.080
[IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.520
And I tried so hard to talk
like an Irishman.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.940
But they wouldn't let
me because they said

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.980
it's not that good.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.400
You know?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.660

BOBBY MCFERRIN: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:08.505
But I tried.

00:33:08.505 --> 00:33:12.580
You know, the secret to
it, I think, is if you

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.990
don't move your lips.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:15.580
MALE SPEAKER: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.470
You just got to talk like
this [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.560
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.730
You smile like that, right.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.610
And you start to talk.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.830
And that's the best way that
I can think of doing it.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.775
But it's not that
good, you know.

00:33:23.775 --> 00:33:24.920

MALE SPEAKER: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:25.395 --> 00:33:27.720
When I get into me Irish accent,
I always have to start

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.260
going tar, tar, tar, tar.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:29.500
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.060
Tar, tar,tar, tar.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.200
MALE SPEAKER: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.840
It just helps it out
a little bit.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.200
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [IRISH ACCENT]

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.690
Ah, right.

a question over here.

AUDIENCE: I hope
you don't mind,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.870
but I have two questions.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.100
BOBBY MCFERRIN: What?!

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:41.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.765
BOBBY MCFERRIN: OK.

00:33:42.765 --> 00:33:46.220
AUDIENCE: The first is I've seen
a number of musicians who

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.800
sing as they play, which
I always thought

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.940
was fascinating listening.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.660
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Sing
as they play.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.420
AUDIENCE: That they know their
instrument so well that

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.080
they're singing along with their
playing, doing a solo.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.500
But you were playing while
you're singing.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.820
What instrument are you
playing on that mic?

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.235
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Oh, this?

00:34:02.235 --> 00:34:04.760
You know, I played clarinet
when I was 10.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.889
And I have a feeling that this
was a carry-over of it.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.850
And it gives me a tactile
connection to the notes.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:11.435
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:34:11.435 --> 00:34:14.270
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [SINGING NOTES]

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.570
You know?

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.734
[SINGING NOTES]

00:34:18.734 --> 00:34:20.610
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
very consistent.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.514
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Thank you.

00:34:22.514 --> 00:34:24.429
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
tell what it was.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:25.790
It could be keyboards or--

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.159
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Recorder.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:28.780
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.100
Second question is, there was,
at least, two times this

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.520
afternoon where you started
singing something, and after a

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.149
short time your keyboardist
started playing.

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.800
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.900
AUDIENCE: So which is it?

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.810
Are you starting in the correct
key because you've got

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:46.650
perfect pitch?

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.060
Or is he picking up the
key you're singing in?

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.392
BOBBY MCFERRIN: He's picking up
the key that I'm singing.

00:34:51.724 --> 00:34:52.659
BOBBY MCFERRIN: He's
got good ears.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.449
I have imperfect peach.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:54.704
Peach.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:55.730

peach.

peaches?

peach in my head too.

to think about that.

I was wondering what you sound
like when your stuffed up, and

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.750
if they're any sounds you can
make only when you're stuffed

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.551
up that you wished you had?

BOBBY MCFERRIN:
[STUFFED UP VOICE]

00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:30.140
I've never attempted to sing
anything when I'm on stage.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.680
I couldn't possibly do this.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.170
I'd have to stop.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:32.660

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.305
BOBBY MCFERRIN:
[STUFFED UP VOICE]

00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:34.000
But I could try.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.740
I could say, ladies and
gentleman, this is the best I

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.930
can do for tonight.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:38.422
So I'll--

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:46.870
AUDIENCE: Sounds about right.

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:47.760
BOBBY MCFERRIN: The

[LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.928 --> 00:35:52.860
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.250
BOBBY MCFERRIN: You only have
one question, right?

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:54.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.942
BOBBY MCFERRIN: OK.

00:35:55.942 --> 00:35:58.930
MALE SPEAKER: What if you have
a drummer who keeps sneezing?

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.062
LOUIS CATO: That happens
sometimes.

00:36:00.062 --> 00:36:01.745
MALE SPEAKER: You keep hitting
your head on the symbols?

00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:03.554
LOUIS CATO: That also happens.

00:36:03.554 --> 00:36:06.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, I want to
thank you for coming.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.590
I been listening to
you my whole life.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.290
My question is sort of random.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.820
It's about your multi-tonal
stuff that you do.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.310
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Multi tonal.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:20.010
AUDIENCE: Like when you sing
harmony with yourself, I just

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.435
have to say, it's bad-ass.

00:36:21.435 --> 00:36:23.290
It's so cool.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:28.180
And my question is how
did you discover that

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.000
you could do that?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.220
And what was your inspiration?

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.380
And how can I do that?

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.270
BOBBY MCFERRIN: OK,
let me tell you.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.000
I worked on my technique for
six years before I did my

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.540
first solo concert.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.820
I practiced, at least,
two hours a day.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.270
I took a tape recorder with
me everywhere I went.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:49.600
I purposely stayed away from
listening to other singers, on

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.100
purpose, because I'm very
impressionable.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.630
I was afraid that, if I found a
singer that I liked, I would

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.300
latch on to their technique
and I'd never find myself.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.060
So I did a few things.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.640
I practiced for six years.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.290
I recognized, also, that what
I wanted to do involved more

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:06.450
than singing notes.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.750
You had to sing character.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.800
You had sing color.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.740
You had to sing language.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.020
And so I started experimenting,
not only with

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.660
the notes, but the texture
of the notes.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.910
The approach of the notes.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.310
The dynamics of the notes.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.480
The weight of the notes.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.790
All that stuff had
to go into it.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.690
I could see myself
onstage alone.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.460
I couldn't hear anything
initially, but as I started to

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.810
sing a lot and practice a lot,
creating all kinds of

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.500
exercises, and singing
intervals of tenths.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.200
Working on my chest voice
and my head voice.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:36.440
[SINGING]

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.300
Chest.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.090
Head.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.508
Chest.

00:37:38.508 --> 00:37:39.344
Head.

00:37:39.344 --> 00:37:39.762
Chest.

00:37:39.762 --> 00:37:40.600
Head.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.930
Things like that.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.140
So it just involved a
lot of singing over

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.200
and over and over.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.240
Just all the time.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.460
Singing two records.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.950
You know, instrumentalists.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.740
Singing over changes.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.192
Changes meaning chord changes.

00:37:54.192 --> 00:37:55.990
That's it.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.800
Being a character.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.470
Having fun.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.800
Just giving yourself permission
to sing and sound

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.065
like anything.

00:38:02.065 --> 00:38:03.845
You know?

00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:06.380
AUDIENCE: And what about the
two notes at once thing?

BOBBY MCFERRIN:

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.890

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.445
It's no secret.

00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:23.700

I wish I could come
hum and whistle.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.930
I can't.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:37.980
I know someone who can whistle
and hum in counterpoint.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.350
And she has a sister who
can do the same thing.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:47.020

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.830

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.980
So touching back, talking about
when you were starting

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.180
to sing, you had a band when
you where 14, right?

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.870
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I lived
in Los Angeles.

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.370
I had a band called The
Fascinations when I was 14.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.120
I've been a working musician
since I was 14.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.130
I'm 63, so what is that?

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.970
Is that 50 years, almost 50
years, working as a musician.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.470
And I had a band called
The Fascinations.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.370
We played the top 40 stuff
that was on the

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.220

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.730

piano at that point.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.340

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.580
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I was a

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.610
MALE SPEAKER: So what
was in the band?

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.520
You guys had the piano.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.030
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Piano, guitar,
lead guitar, rhythm guitar,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.480
drums, and lead singer.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.620

Yes?

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:58.600
Let me tell you.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.980
The answer to that is no
because, by the time you heard

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:10.245
the tune, I had sung it
500 trillion times.

00:41:10.245 --> 00:41:12.485

00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:14.620
AUDIENCE: So how do you keep
making it new and magical?

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.180
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I don't sing
it anymore in concert.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.250
I haven't sung it all the way
through in at least 20 years.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.100
It was probably like 1988,
1989, something like that

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.550
because I got, basically, tired
of singing the song.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:34.500
Now the blessing is, nowadays,
I go on YouTube and I'll find

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.760

to go check it out?

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.030
I do.

I do, governor.

MALE SPEAKER: OK, so going
on to the future.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.010
Well, before I go there, let's
take this question over here.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.220
BOBBY MCFERRIN:
[DEEP MOVIE PREVIEW VOICE]

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.630
In a world where time
travel exists--

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.795
MALE SPEAKER: You can do that!

of that skill.

00:43:10.192 --> 00:43:12.780
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well,
just try it.

See, you've got to have
two elements.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.860
The first one is in a world.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.620

00:43:39.282 --> 00:43:40.532
MALE SPEAKER: Question please.

00:43:43.126 --> 00:43:45.630
AUDIENCE: It is such a treat
to hear you in person.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.340
Thank you so much for coming.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.320
I just want to tell you that
your album, "Circle Songs," is

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.080
something that, for years, I've
always turned to if I

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.810
needed some spiritual
uplifting.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.180
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah, thanks.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.010
AUDIENCE: So I want to thank
you, in person, for that one.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.140
BOBBY MCFERRIN: You're
very welcome.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.900
AUDIENCE: Also, my hometown
is Saint Paul, Minnesota.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.485
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Sure.

00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:05.110
AUDIENCE: And I was wondering
how you enjoyed working there

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.090
when you were working
with them?

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.670
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I loved it
because, when they hired me, I

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.410
was a brand new conductor.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.610
I had no clue what to
do with the Saint

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:15.155
Paul Chamber Orchestra.

00:44:15.155 --> 00:44:17.160
I didn't know how to rehearse.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.910
I hadn't settled on any kind
of stick technique, of any

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.030
kind, to lead the orchestra.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.790
Hand technique.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:26.050
So they were very, very
patient with me.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.230
They hired me with no
understanding of what they

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.510
were getting into.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.685
And I worked with them for six
seasons or seven seasons, one

00:44:32.685 --> 00:44:35.140
or the other, and they were
my first teachers.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.620
And this is a revelation.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:40.590
I'm spending a lot of time
trying to be a conductor.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.050
So I figured you had to
talk like a conductor.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.870
Clarinets on bar 92.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.580
A little bit more diminuendo
at the end of the phrase.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.115
Blah, blah, blah.

00:44:49.115 --> 00:44:52.290
And finally, I just
wasn't getting it.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.375
And, dadgum it, the woodwind
section comes to me one day in

00:44:56.375 --> 00:44:56.845
my dresser room.

00:44:56.845 --> 00:45:02.558
And they said, why don't
you just sing to us?

00:45:02.558 --> 00:45:03.980
Duh, you know?

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.970
What a revelation that was.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.420
And so from then on, when I
wanted something from a

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.290
particular section of the
orchestra, I'd sing it.

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:13.050
And that would give them
all the information.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.110
The flexibility of the phrase.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.640
The dynamics of the phrase.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.610
How long the phrase went.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.760
How long it lasted.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.460
And that was a revelation
for me.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:22.940
And I don't know why
didn't think of it.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.500
I mean, I'm a singer,
after all.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.300
Instead of trying to sound very
conductorial they said,

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.950
just sing to us.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:29.960
We'll get it.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.502
But just sing.

00:45:31.502 --> 00:45:32.004
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:32.004 --> 00:45:32.050
That's beautiful.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:32.500
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I loved it.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.681
I had a great time.

[SINGING SHORT TUNE]

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:39.270
AUDIENCE: I have a little bit
more of a technical question.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:46.820
I am very impressed with the
effects you do in your voice.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.380
But I can't help but notice that
I believe there's some

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.340
reverb going on or some delay.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.750
Is this just my mind playing
tricks on me?

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:56.720
BOBBY MCFERRIN: No,
it depends.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.180
Sometimes there's
a little delay,

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.220
depending on what I'm doing.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.270
Ive been working with
the sound man, Danny

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.350
Vicari for 25 years.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.180
He knows me really,
really well.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.660
So he'll just, maybe, put a
little delay on something.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.170
No, you're not hearing
anything.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.060
You're not hearing anything.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.930
You're not hearing anything.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.670
You're not hearing anything.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.120
You know.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:16.570
You know.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.446
You know.

00:46:17.446 --> 00:46:18.300
You know.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.120
AUDIENCE: I couldn't tell.

[LAUGHTER]

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.560
AUDIENCE: So in that case, I'll
grab a second question.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.860
So I always felt that voice is
a very natural kind of thing.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.200
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.180
AUDIENCE: And at least right
now, ever since '70s and '80s

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:39.190
delays, going digital, I feel
that they mess up a lot of it.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:40.450
They take a lot of neutrality.

BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.740
Boo.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what's
your opinion on that?

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.140
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I don't
like a lot of it.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.510
I don't like manipulating
of the voices a lot.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:57.140
I think it's an excuse for
not being talented.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.780
A lot of singers rely
on it to help them

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.130
sing in tune or whatever.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.490
I don't really want
to get into it.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.330
It's a waste of time for me.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.370
I don't explore it.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.600
I knew at the beginning that I
didn't want to use any effects

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.890
doing solo concerts because I
was afraid that if I got in

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.990
trouble doing an improv, and
it wasn't working, that I'd

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:23.250
bail myself out by clicking a
switch and bringing up some

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.390
kind of an effect.

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.760
I didn't want to do that, so
I stayed away from it.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.840
I like to do everything
organically.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.390
MALE SPEAKER: Have you ever got
in trouble in a concert?

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.066
BOBBY MCFERRIN: No.

00:47:31.066 --> 00:47:32.560

you're all set.

[LAUGHTER]

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.390
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, you
know, it's improv.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:37.345
If you mess up, you don't really
mess up in improv.

00:47:37.345 --> 00:47:38.850
MALE SPEAKER: Just do it again,
and it sounds like you

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:39.490
did it on purpose.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:40.070
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Do it again.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:41.140
Sounds like you did
it on purpose.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.450
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.740
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Or maybe what
you messed up took you

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.470
someplace that you hadn't
intended on going.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.893
And you find something that you
would not have found if

00:47:48.893 --> 00:47:51.755
you had stuck with your
original intent.

00:47:51.755 --> 00:47:53.520
MALE SPEAKER: So how long have
you been playing with these

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.400
two fellows?

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.920
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, Gil and I
have been playing together,

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.670
off and on, for a few years.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.360
Maybe, five or six or
something like that.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.800
Maybe even longer.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.490
Seven or eight.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:03.230
Whatever.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:07.290
And Louis since, maybe, April.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.290
LOUIS CATO: End of
March, yeah.

BOBBY MCFERRIN: End of March.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.190
Beginning of April.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.330
MALE SPEAKER: You're
very tight.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.780
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah, I should
also say that there's three

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.320
other members of the band who
weren't here today because I

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:20.910
don't know.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:22.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.630
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I guess they
thought there wasn't enough

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.210
space on stage for everyone.

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.820
But we have three additional
players.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.650
Bass, acoustic bass, and
two guitar players.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:34.640
One guy plays it's pedal
steel, slide, mandolin,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.540
fiddle, and acoustic.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.390
And then the other guy plays
acoustic and electric guitar.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.710
And then with Cato playing
guitar, sometimes we have

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:45.050
three guitars playing.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:49.320
So including myself, it's
a six member band.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.440
Six piece band.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:50.650
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:54.860
So how much time do you spend
rehearsing improvisation?

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.580
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Now?

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.300
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.190
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well,
every day.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.690
I don't know how much time,
but I sing every day.

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.490
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:02.160
I mean, not you.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.500
But I mean as a whole band
because you guys have to know.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.290
You start learning each
other, and you

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.620
learn about each other.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.680
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah, but
they have great ears.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.440
If I take off and start to
improvise and come out with

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:16.090
some really off the wall place
that I want to go, they pick

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.020
it up really quickly.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.095
MALE SPEAKER: Was that part
of the audition process?

00:49:19.095 --> 00:49:20.160
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Probably.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.045
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:21.920
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.110
MALE SPEAKER: Just give them a
beat, and see if they can make

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:23.710
it sound good?

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:24.865
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Yeah, sure.

00:49:24.865 --> 00:49:26.400
MALE SPEAKER: That's not bad.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.255
Question.

00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:28.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.880
This might be a bit of
a broad question.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.950
But I was wondering if you could
tell us about a time

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.580
when there was some vocal effect
that really gave you

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:38.860
difficulty in learning how to do
it and, ultimately, getting

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.475
it the way you wanted
it to sound.

00:49:40.475 --> 00:49:46.450
BOBBY MCFERRIN: No, my approach
was never to listen

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.200
to a sound and try
to imitate it.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.780
I never went for that.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.090
AUDIENCE: You just made them
all up from scratch.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:55.650
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I would just
make them all up on the spot.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.490
I'd give myself different
exercises to play.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:00.710
Like, say, for two
minutes, I'm only

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.020
going to sing one note.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.550
So how many different
ways can I sing it?

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.250
Things like that.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:11.590
I would give myself all kinds of
musical challenges to face.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:11.970
That's all.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.290
But I never would listen
to a sound.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.200
A lot of people say, well, you
sound just like a trumpet.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.120
Well, I never studied
the trumpet.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.890
I never listened to the trumpet
and tried to emulate

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.660
it or imitate it.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.090
Imitate it.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.080
I never tried to do that.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.020
It was always just trying,
getting things out of me or

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.725
from the inside out.

00:50:29.725 --> 00:50:31.520
AUDIENCE: It sounds like there's
all sorts of sound

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.420
effects that you can do.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.720
You must have learned
how to make the

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.215
car sound, for instance.

00:50:35.215 --> 00:50:37.860
That's, certainly, imitating
something.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.326
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, I use
what I hear, basically.

00:50:42.326 --> 00:50:43.200
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:43.880
BOBBY MCFERRIN: [SINGING]

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.950
You're welcome.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:46.540
Thank you.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.590
MALE SPEAKER: So I guess we're
running low on time here.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:54.480
To wrap it all up, here you are
now, and you've come so

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.320
far in your career.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.420
Where do you see
yourself going?

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.982
What's the next step?

00:50:58.982 --> 00:51:01.740
BOBBY MCFERRIN: I don't
really know.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.680
I'd like to write more.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.740
I put some new equipment in my
studio in my house, recently,

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.672
and I hope to get to it when I
have a nice span of time that

00:51:12.672 --> 00:51:14.320
I can devote to it.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.040
I have a hard time writing
when I'm traveling.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.950
That's one thing.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.370
And that's probably it.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:27.315
Right now, I'm just into playing
with these guys.

00:51:27.315 --> 00:51:29.160
MALE SPEAKER: Have you ever
thought about collaborating

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.995
with your children at all
because they're also very

00:51:30.995 --> 00:51:31.340
musical, right?

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.100
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Well, I have.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.010
In fact, my daughter sings
in this band when

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:35.190
she's got a free day.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.950
She's got a band of her own.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.820
And when she's not working
with them, she joins us.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.680
And then my oldest son,
Taylor McFerrin--

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.920
you can, probably,
find him online.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.670
He does a lot of things--

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.730
we've worked together
a few times.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:52.080
We did two dates in Paris and
two dates in London a few

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.630
years back.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.530
2007, I think.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.010
And then my middle
child's an actor.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.300
And he's out on auditions
all the time.

00:52:02.046 --> 00:52:03.920
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I appreciate
you coming in.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.000
BOBBY MCFERRIN: Oh, yeah.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.710
My pleasure.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.240
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so everybody

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.440
Play music all access.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.390
It's been incredible.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:23.490
So thank you very much.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:24.759
Give him another round
of applause.
