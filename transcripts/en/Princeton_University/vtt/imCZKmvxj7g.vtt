00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
"...and rival Declan Farmer...he shoots and it's in!" All those years of hard work coming together

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
and you're getting to hold your gold
medal and you know hear the National

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
Anthem and sing it along with your
teammates and it's really a special

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.789
moment. All those things that happen
right after you win is you know pretty

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.010
incredible. "...and Farmer's done it again."
This time we hope to repeat what we did

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.119
in Sochi. We hope to win a gold medal
again, we know that's not going to be an

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.449
easy thing to accomplish at all
considering how tough the competition is

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.829
there's you know a lot of good sled
hockey teams in the world but you know

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
we've been working really hard. We've had
a good start to our season. We have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.590
great chemistry you know on and off the
ice.
