00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:02.976
Duncan Watts is one of the world experts in analyzing

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:05.369
social networks and learning about what’s going on

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:08.537
inside of that. He has been a professor at Columbia

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:12.748
University and also a network scientist at Yahoo

00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:14.879
Research. And most recently, he has moved to

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.824
Microsoft Research in New York City. We weren’t able

00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:20.058
to get video footage of our conversation together but I

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:22.671
think you’ll find it interesting anyway.

00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:24.895
What are some of the factors that have contributed to

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:27.999
the explosion of interest in social network analysis?

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.202
So what’s changed recently really just in the last few

00:00:32.202 --> 00:00:39.731
years is that with web data, it’s finally possible.

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:45.546
some instances to see precisely how information

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.561
spreads from one individual to another. I wrote this

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.219
book called Six Degrees almost ten years ago now, it

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.419
was published in2003 one of the messages that I tried

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.554
to convey in that book was that what we now call

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:03.861
network science is both in theory and also in practice a

00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:08.646
multi-disciplinary endeavor. The origins of what we

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:11.740
think of this network science now really began in the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.963
social sciences. There was an enormous input of

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:21.248
physicists into this field in the late 1990s and then as

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:27.215
the web continued to evolve and you see the computer

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:30.497
scientists get more and more involved because they

00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:36.121
are probably the best equipped to handle very large

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:36.857
data sets.

00:01:36.857 --> 00:01:38.791
Many people are interested in this question of who did

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.471
you so replicate the success of Facebook and the best

00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.060
of our scientific understanding is that, you sort of can’t

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.712
really. There is a lot of very sort of specific algorithms

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:58.477
that network analysts use, everything from very simple

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:03.611
breadth first search algorithms to community detection

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.232
algorithms.

00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:11.510
Often where challenges lie at least in the recent years

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.332
has been implementation, particularly scaling issues;

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:18.735
pretty much everything these days is done using

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:23.021
MapReduce, right. So I think that if you want to work

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:26.916
with very large scale network data then some

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:31.283
familiarity with the MapReduce framework and

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:35.965
whichever implementation I guess on these days is

00:02:35.965 --> 00:02:38.634
going to be extremely valuable and there’s been some

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:42.134
interesting theoretical work showing how algorithms

00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:44.730
like breadth first search can be converted into a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.352
MapReduce parallel framework and that’s actually

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:51.444
generated a great deal of recent progress.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:53.221
Can you tell us a little bit about the idea of

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.903
community detection?

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:57.201
You want to assign everybody in the network to a

00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:02.459
community such that the communities you choose

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.418
have the property that most of the links are within the

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.818
communities not across the communities, one of the

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:14.873
methods that was developed Jack Hoffman at

00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:23.149
Microsoft but when he was at Columbia, he where you

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:32.239
are starting with a network and you are assigning –

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.458
you start to some sort of prior assumption about how

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.671
many communities around the network and then you

00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:41.833
sort of make a guess about who goes into which

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.756
community and then you measure the relative

00:03:44.756 --> 00:03:49.692
densities of internal versus external links and then

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:53.757
you shuffle back and forth making various random

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:58.466
changes, so try to optimize the allocation of people

00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:02.321
to communities in order to get this sort of

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.000
maximization of modularity.
