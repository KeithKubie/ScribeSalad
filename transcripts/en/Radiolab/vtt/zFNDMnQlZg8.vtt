00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Well, I'm Jad Aboumrad. This is radio lab.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.100
Our program today is about tying all the different flavors of time in here with

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.200
me too, shall we say? Taste those flavors.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.030
Is Robert Krulwich corresponding for ABC News at Nightline? Yeah. Hi Robert.

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.910
We've been talking about clocks for the last 20 minutes and if you took all the

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.010
clock counting 20 minutes exactly. If you took away all the clocks,

7
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.800
we've been talking about the bird clock and the spice clock and the clock on the

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:30.030
wall and then you had to talk about time without mentioning a clock.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.760
What are we left with? How would you do?

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.730
That's actually a pretty tough question. What is climb? Essentially,

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.150
I have a neighbor, uh, Brian Green is a bestselling author,

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.190
elegant universe fabric of the cosmos.

13
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:44.700
Most recently professor of math at Columbia, professor of Physics at Columbia,

14
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:49.350
pretty much does Columbia. I asked him your question. I asked him what his time,

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.840
<v 1>if you, if you really pushed me and said, what is time?</v>

16
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:55.960
I'd say time is that which allows us to see that something has changed.

17
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.660
When you see the second hand in your clock going around,

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.830
it's changing position and that's the simplest version of a change corresponding

19
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:04.480
to time elapsing.

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.901
<v 0>Okay, Robert,</v>

21
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.100
I'm looking at the clock here on the wall and watching these second hand and

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.600
he's changing positions just as he says.

23
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.860
Can I imagine all the clocks in the world agree on what a second is,

24
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:21.570
but what if we were to take the clocks away? Is there, I mean I would still,

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.830
I still in my bones believe that that somewhere there's a clock ticking that

26
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.460
says what a second is the same

27
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.100
<v 1>in Mars. Yeah, right.</v>

28
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Everybody thinks that because it's so sensible that time is universally the same

29
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:39.640
for everyone. Now, here's the big secret. Apparently that's not true.

30
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.620
Time is not universal and this is,

31
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.200
Brian is part of Einstein's theory of relativity.

32
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.660
When we move relative to each other,

33
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.080
a very basic lesson of relativity is that our watches will tick off time at

34
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.180
different rates. If you have a good watch,

35
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.920
I don't know what a good watch day is, a donut on one,

36
00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:00.160
but if you had a Rolex watch, I never have owned a watch,

37
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.590
but however you've never owned a walker on to watch.

38
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.070
I never liked the idea of a time piece sort of taking away on my arm.

39
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:08.410
It really always bothered me. But anyway,

40
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.880
if you had a Rolex and I had a Rolex say and we synchronize them perfectly,

41
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.360
then we move relative to one another and then we rejoin and compare our watches.

42
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.500
They will not agree.

43
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.850
<v 2>Well, to demonstrate what Brian was talking about,</v>

44
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:26.650
we are now in the central park.

45
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:29.950
We've got the area entirely roped off because we are going to demonstrate one of

46
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:34.870
Einstein's famous thought experiments which suggests that the subject and if you

47
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:36.900
will, I would be the subject, Chad, by all means, et cetera.

48
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.950
You must take a trip at an extraordinarily high speed that's required here.

49
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:45.180
So if you could help me by giving me whatever you've got over there. Sure.

50
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.570
A here is a jet pack. Turbocharged Chet van. Put It on back. Yeah.

51
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.310
Okay. Now take these rollerblades. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'll put one right.

52
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:58.660
One around foot, right foot. And when you left on the left, Jake,

53
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.950
set target speed.

54
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.951
Dial on your jet pack to 669 million miles an hour with a little fast,

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.040
hundred and 69 million miles an hour.

56
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.010
What time does your watch say? A five 24 so in his mind we're synchronized now.

57
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.970
Exactly synchronized when it gets a five 25 in three, two, one.

58
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.100
Push the red button, hitting the red button. And

59
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.420
<v 3>I am [inaudible]. I skipped actually going by on this side. I see.</v>

60
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.190
I love the one coming up over there. Oh,

61
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.860
[inaudible] going by there now by the way,

62
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.300
my watch is absolutely perfectly. I'm having a lovely fire

63
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.240
coming in now. Coming closer,

64
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.430
coming closer and

65
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.760
<v 2>landed. That was very racing. Now Robert. Yes. Look at your watch.</v>

66
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.770
All right. What time does it say it's his, uh, five 26 what times on your watch?

67
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.720
Five 33 that's a seven minute difference. Is your watch broken? Does mine?

68
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.070
No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, time for you is different than time for me.

69
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.383
You mean literally?

70
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.831
<v 1>Literally.</v>

71
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.831
It's not that my watch somehow was shucking up and wasn't functioning properly.

72
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:21.550
No time itself is not some universal concept.

73
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.720
Time is held by the individual, by the Observer.

74
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.770
So that if I am moving relative to you, time for me,

75
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.650
a lapse is at a different rate than it does for you.

76
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.740
So relativity says that time and speed are mysteriously coupled.

77
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.750
So the, when I go fast, my time goes slow,

78
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.600
which explains why are watches don't agree exactly.

79
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.130
So this whole notion that we all have the time kind of applies the same to

80
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:50.230
everybody on earth and Mars, Jupiter,

81
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:53.710
the entire cosmos that we can see is totally wrong.

82
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.880
But let me ask you this. When you were rushing through space before,

83
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.510
your time was apparently going slower, but did you feel slower?

84
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.870
If I looked at my watch, everything was perfectly normal to me.

85
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.070
My clock was ticking perfectly normal for me. So it was mine in central park.

86
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:09.950
So what is [inaudible]

87
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.160
<v 2>if somehow you could appeared in on me up there in outer space, going real,</v>

88
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:15.994
real fast,

89
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.210
I would have seemed slower to not only would my watch be ticking slower for you.

90
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.613
Everything about,

91
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.370
<v 5>I mean [inaudible]</v>

92
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.140
<v 6>Oh [inaudible].</v>

93
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.810
<v 1>So what do you do with this information? What do you mean? Well,</v>

94
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.220
physics teaches us that if I'm say running down the street and my time is

95
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:53.500
ticking infinitesimally slower than

96
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.200
<v 2>that guy's time over there. Why? Because he's standing still</v>

97
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 1>here and you're running right? But you're in different time capsules kind of.</v>

98
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.550
Apparently so, and I know this is what science tells me, right?

99
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.750
But my common sense tells me that that is completely wrong.

100
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.060
Nothing in my experience tells me this is the case.

101
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.890
This is like one of the great conundrums.

102
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:17.690
It seems to me that what you learned in science is so different what you feel in

103
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.560
your regular life.

104
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.730
How do you live between those two worlds or what you know and what you feel are

105
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.380
so different? Brian, do you learn to trust your mind over your senses?

106
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.940
Is that what you do? Well,

107
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.450
I learned to trust my senses,

108
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.560
but see them within a much larger framework.

109
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.030
I love to walk down the street and imagine that because I'm walking,

110
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.090
I'm kind of shattering the f the time around me.

111
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.830
I'm causing time to elapse at a different rate than it would if I were standing

112
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:53.270
still. I love that idea. It's not that I don't trust experience.

113
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.760
You're hitting time square and you're wandering to, you think, oh boy,

114
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.450
I am really changing the universe of all these other people. Well,

115
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.240
I really considered a totally personal, so I'm not changing their tone.

116
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.690
I'm changing. I'm changing the rate at which time elapses for me.

117
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.340
So I have power. So when you run to catch a bus, you think, hey,

118
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:12.890
I got to get on this bus. Also, I'm slowing down time for myself.

119
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.450
I do sometimes, not always, but it's there. And you know,

120
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.910
when I look at the tabletop, I,

121
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.760
I delight in the fact that I can,

122
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:27.050
in my mind picture the atoms and molecules and the interactions between them and

123
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:28.970
the mostly empty space that's in there.

124
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:31.190
And that when my hand touches the table Top,

125
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.420
I see the electrons in the outer surface of my hand pushing against the

126
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.990
electrons in the outer surface of the table. I'm not really touching the table.

127
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.390
My hand never comes into contact with the table.

128
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.030
What's happening as the electrons are getting really close together and they're

129
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.020
repelling each other.

130
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.770
And I love the fact that I'm in essence deforming the surface of the table by

131
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:53.360
making my electrons come really close to it. That enriches my experience.

132
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:56.270
It doesn't do share this with others. Rarely.

133
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.553
<v 7>Uh,</v>

134
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.370
<v 9>no. I listening to [inaudible]</v>

135
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.370
<v 1>public radio [inaudible]</v>

136
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.043
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

137
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.020
<v 0>this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

138
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.560
We're talking about time today and here with me to help you do that is Robert

139
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.700
Watch ABC News and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

140
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.900
Blah is my specialty, which is are from Brian Green physicist.

141
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:42.230
Tell us about a frankly troubling idea that there is no such thing as a standard

142
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.600
time, which I'm still having trouble believing frankly. In any case,

143
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:48.680
it makes me think of this.

144
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.160
Do you know when you see a tortoise wandering through the garden door and he's

145
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:56.990
going so slow and then you see a hummingbird whiz by film,

146
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.430
really they're moving in different tempos,

147
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.330
but perhaps they're also experiencing entirely different universes of time.

148
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.340
Do you ever wonder about that? I think everybody wonders that, but of course,

149
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.440
unless you are a hummingbird or a tortoise,

150
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.830
you can never really know whether what's going on in your head is different.

151
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.230
True. But Oliver Sacks, the neurologist we met before,

152
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.350
he found a different tempo,

153
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:22.800
radically different tempos in human beings. Really a,

154
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.930
he's a neurologist and you worked at a hospital in the Bronx,

155
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.760
still does at Beth Abraham where he once had patients who seem so slow.

156
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.770
They were almost frozen. He told me about one of those patients named Myron v

157
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.270
<v 10>for long periods of the day. Milan would be apparently emotionless,</v>

158
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.090
although when I looked at him,

159
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.120
I would see his frozen finger in different positions in which his right hand

160
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.150
would be raised.

161
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.160
A lot of these patients would be frozen and odd positions,

162
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.990
which I'm illustrating now, but

163
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.330
poses hand in the air, but just stuck, stuck in stuff.

164
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.410
People would be stuck in audit posers. I,

165
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.230
I thought mound was one of those and I, and I commented on this,

166
00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:16.231
that I had often seen him stuck in these are frozen posers and he got indignant

167
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:19.840
and said, what do you mean photos and posers? He said,

168
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:24.460
I was just wiping my nose. And I said, I said, Yo, yeah, joking,

169
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.740
putting me on. And he said, I'm not. And I, and he was,

170
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.120
he was as puzzled by what I said as I was by what he had said.

171
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.190
But then after he had told me this, I thought, well, hell, you know, I'm,

172
00:10:39.191 --> 00:10:43.360
I must watch this and I must record it now. He said he was just what?

173
00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:46.000
He was just wiping his nose as I was just wiping my nose.

174
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.940
Okay. Now that's something that takes me about two seconds. Exactly.

175
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.720
Whereas apparently this movement of the arm, if this is what he was doing,

176
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.100
was taking about two hours.

177
00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.530
So I took a series of photographs at intervals of a few minutes,

178
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:06.690
each of still Myron and his, I'm gently going up,

179
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.610
apparently still mountain. How many photographs?

180
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.580
I had about 20 photographs or so in two hours.

181
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.480
And then I put them together in, uh, in the fall.

182
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.950
And then the whole flip pack, you know, the way one used to do is a kid.

183
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.250
And then when couldn't fact see with us that the 20 or so photos covering two

184
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:31.531
hours in fact showed the smooth movement to wipe his nose and movement,

185
00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:36.790
which normally takes two seconds. But which in him was taking two hours,

186
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.450
although this left opened the profound parcel of how come he was not only taking

187
00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:46.480
two hours to do so, but didn't realize he was taking two hours to do.

188
00:11:46.481 --> 00:11:50.320
So the movement, which to us was glacially slow,

189
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.400
was not slow to him. It was normal. Did you ever show

190
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.590
<v 0>Myron the pictures that you had made and didn't, did you say,</v>

191
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:04.500
so Myron, look at this, it took you two hours to do this. I mean,

192
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.040
if you did that and then what did he say?

193
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.160
<v 10>Um, uh, he was astonished and that's too mild a word. He was thunderstruck</v>

194
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.220
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

195
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.120
<v 0>wow.</v>

196
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.980
So Myron had no idea that he was experiencing the world slower than the rest of

197
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:21.640
us.

198
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.840
Not into all of our staple all the pictures into a flip book and go and spit up

199
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:30.400
time and then Myron can see what it was he was doing. But you know,

200
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.150
does a turtle know that he's processing slowly?

201
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:37.360
Does a hummingbird know that it's processing fast? I don't. I don't think so.

202
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.890
Huh. But he, in this case,

203
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:43.891
we now know that this is a human being absorbing and performing a drastically

204
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:46.150
different tempos from the rest of humanity.

205
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.320
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

206
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.670
<v 0>Oliver has another patient did it, likes to talk about her name is Hester. Why?</v>

207
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.240
<v 10>Um, Hesta, she would have the opposite of the sledding or glaciation.</v>

208
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.160
She would move with extreme speed and a, this came out very,

209
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:08.161
very clearly sometimes when I had these students play ball with Hesta.

210
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.330
And does that mean they catch? Yeah, they'll play catch. I'm sorry.

211
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:15.970
Is that the log word for ball? Bruce?

212
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:20.230
One of the striking things when people are Parkinsonian is when people may

213
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:24.850
appear unable to initiate any action they can reciprocate.

214
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.000
And if you suddenly throw a ball to someone of parkinsonism,

215
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.330
even if they appear absolutely frozen, they will catch it.

216
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.940
And often I would demonstrate this to the students.

217
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.560
I would usually have seven or eight students and we would usually sit in a

218
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:40.720
semicircle around the patient's.

219
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.490
So hesta would be in her chair with a semicircle of students facing her.

220
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.631
And she was,

221
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:51.631
she was so quick and the ball came back and hit the student on his throwing

222
00:13:51.971 --> 00:13:53.980
hands. Wow. So the guy

223
00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.300
<v 0>throws the bullet Hestia,</v>

224
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:59.700
she catches the ball and throws it back before he's even put his hand back in

225
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:03.720
place. Just so how many times faster is Hester moving than the student?

226
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.900
<v 10>Um, well let me put it in general terms.</v>

227
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.070
Her reaction time is a 10th of a second or less.

228
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.780
And usually the best reaction times have Olympic athletes is about a seventh of

229
00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:19.230
a second. Anyhow, the ball came back very,

230
00:14:19.231 --> 00:14:24.150
very fast and I would say to Hesta, slow down, you're too quick for them.

231
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:29.220
Why do to count up to 10 pause before you throw the ball back. Count up to 10.

232
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.950
She's still in her very speedy mode. Okay. Okay.

233
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.620
And the ball would come back scarcely slower.

234
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.670
And I would say I asked you to count up to 10 and a voice,

235
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:41.610
which I really can't imitate, but this is the crushed voice.

236
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.060
The technical term is a Femia better speech. Uh,

237
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.660
and the crushed voice of extreme parkinsonism. She will say,

238
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.030
I di Di di Di Dicon Hopson I can't speak quick enough for that.

239
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.960
And her brain, was she thinking that she was giving normal speech? Yeah,

240
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.170
cause she was no more conscious of her speed than mountain was of his slowness.

241
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.993
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

242
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.290
<v 0>Huh. So Myron has somehow slipped into whale timer,</v>

243
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.210
turtle time because of the disease which sent Hester in the opposite direction

244
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.500
into a kind of hummingbird tempo. Do you think there's a limit to this?

245
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.600
How fast she can go or how slowly they must be like some kind of physical

246
00:15:24.601 --> 00:15:28.530
limits? If she wanted to say 20,000 words in a second,

247
00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:31.490
I could even get her brain to do so. Her mouth wouldn't work that fast.

248
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.640
Her tongue wouldn't work that fast. So there's constraints like gravity, energy,

249
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.350
the nature of your body. So there we are at about the rest of us. Uh,

250
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.680
what kind of range is available to you or I

251
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.310
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

252
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.310
<v 10>I am not sure that such a radical slowing speedings occur in the west of us</v>

253
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.470
except perhaps in very unusual circumstances,

254
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.790
perhaps in sports and perhaps in situations of, of mortal danger.

255
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.770
People who are in the zone,

256
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.600
they may give descriptions of what appears to be a baseball comes towards one at

257
00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:12.490
a hundred miles an hour, but some batters they call it batters. Yeah,

258
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.760
okay. Um, but people at bat, okay.

259
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.910
But people at Bat may say that the board seem to come to them more slowly and

260
00:16:21.101 --> 00:16:23.990
they could see the seams on the ball. [inaudible]

261
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.010
<v 0>in the zone. Robert, I just so happen to have something here,</v>

262
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.380
which is a perfect illustration of what he's talking about.

263
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.360
[inaudible] except it's not baseball has to do with track tracks. Good.

264
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:35.883
Here's the short extra.

265
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.800
<v 2>When I'm up, they call my name, I step up on the runway.</v>

266
00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:45.450
Usually it's just relax.

267
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.910
You are the best plant and I don't think anything else after that.

268
00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.530
<v 12>I want that adrenaline coming when he says when take your mark,</v>

269
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.330
cause I only got 10 seconds at one 90 seconds at that point, you know.

270
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.150
But if this pump and pump and pump and pump and then they say take your mark

271
00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:03.984
when I'm exhausted.

272
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.400
You know once I get numb blocks it's like I don't want to be exhausted.

273
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.630
I want to be on fire at that moon. So I'm like I'm ready. I'm ready.

274
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.310
Tim's just 52 degrees,

275
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.190
50 degrees out here and bod is warmed up sitting in the blahs and like the colon

276
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.670
, even in any phrasing, me don't,

277
00:17:20.671 --> 00:17:24.270
I don't even feel no cold cause I got so much adrenaline going through my body.

278
00:17:24.271 --> 00:17:27.060
I'm just ready to put it to him today. Put everybody

279
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.163
<v 2>and if you're not ready,</v>

280
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.480
it doesn't matter at this point because you have to be ready.

281
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.850
<v 12>And when he says set,</v>

282
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.580
sit sitting that gun and go out leaving all you got,

283
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.420
you just, just take it off. [inaudible] you go feel the strength that day.

284
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.820
Go slow down, no fatigue, and Nanga will up whoever's in lanes behind me.

285
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.600
They go get it. I'm just listening. Get in tune, get in tune,

286
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.560
listen to the whole hustle. The crowd is the g choir for the gun.

287
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.170
In that moment when they say, take your mark set, I become the gun.

288
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.130
So when that gun fires,

289
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.990
it's almost like I'm the bullet being fired out of the pistol.

290
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.730
And that's my reaction. When I hear that sound,

291
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.710
it's almost like there's a firing pin smacking me in my butt and pushing me.

292
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.980
So it's not that I sound out everything around me.

293
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.880
I've already sounded out everything because I'm the bullet and it's only me in

294
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:34.270
the chamber in lineup, we hear the and say fit.

295
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.920
And at that point you become blind and deaf because you don't,

296
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.960
you don't go off of what you think you've heard because if you do that,

297
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.110
you just lost the race. You have to be one with the gun.

298
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.320
And when he says set, Eh,

299
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.130
I just breathe all the air in a deep inhale,

300
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.220
take your last look on the competitors in the lane. Now focused. Just thinking,

301
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:05.620
driving, go, driving, go and then I hold my breath and then

302
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.050
<v 3>[inaudible] I let up all the air out and that's when I start running as fast as</v>

303
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:16.630
I can.

304
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.630
When you're running and you're so relaxed in what you do

305
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.490
<v 12>to where a song can just pop into your mind about 30 meters,</v>

306
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.900
that is the ultimate point I think an athlete wants to be cause that's when you

307
00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:33.490
get that peak performance.

308
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.950
It's almost like everything is moving in slow motion and you watching the birds

309
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.880
kind of slowly fly by and you hear that song just with them.

310
00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:47.020
In a year when I take off and I start to climb in the air,

311
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.400
it all goes pretty fast.

312
00:19:48.401 --> 00:19:53.401
But once I hit that apex of the jump and my hips are up over the bar,

313
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.630
time really slows down.

314
00:19:55.631 --> 00:20:00.631
I mean you can just feel this rotation and it feels like someone's grabbed a

315
00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:03.700
hold of your hips and really giving you a push,

316
00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:08.701
a boost up in the air and for this moment that you're sort of suspended on top

317
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.860
of the bar. It's really serene. It's really almost peaceful.

318
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.710
It just seems like it lasts an eternity.

319
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.270
<v 3>Come off the turn. I'm in the front. I'm in the front and who they coming from?</v>

320
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.370
[inaudible] I'm in the front so I'm just thinking, just get away. Just get away.

321
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.650
Just get away. Tone out the bro. Hold on, hold on. The stretch it out.

322
00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:33.470
Start getting to the top of Cortona after birth total. Hold on.

323
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.580
See you've come up the side, you have to lift. You gotta hold on.

324
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.530
Stall is happening. Trying to get that. The can just fight him off.

325
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.560
You be flying them all at the end. It's just compete,

326
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:50.080
compete, compete and then Leah to take

327
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.760
them all. Fuck the Mosley. You cut them off.

328
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.830
[inaudible] that's kind of stuff I live for.

329
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.200
I live for those intense moments like there again,

330
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.640
<v 6>it's hard to excel the fence. Sometimes they too are human,</v>

331
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.390
but it's true.

332
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
And I've had a heart surgery in year 2000 but as athletes,

333
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:32.320
and you can ask almost any athlete,

334
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:36.970
they'll tell you we believe we invest because if we go in there with any other

335
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.860
thoughts, there's no chance of us not though, because we have to believe.

336
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:46.861
We have to confuse ourselves into believing that no matter what's wrong with you

337
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.420
or what you're dealing with,

338
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.600
it's not going to be a factor to what you're trying to accomplish.

339
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.670
We believe we invisible

340
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.930
<v 0>thanks to the next big thing and sound artists.</v>

341
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.130
Ben Ruben for that a piece he produced for the national track and Field Hall of

342
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:14.270
fame, you can visit them on the web@trackhall.com so Robert,

343
00:22:14.271 --> 00:22:15.620
what do you think this was a case?

344
00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:20.621
I think of athletes showing you how we contest with time get power by mastering

345
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.530
time shaving. It's slightly time and power. Have a long history.

346
00:22:27.531 --> 00:22:30.700
That's what we'll look at shortly. I'm jacked up on Ron [inaudible].

347
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.470
Now back in a moment, you're the same.

348
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.160
You're the same to radio lab.
