STEPHEN CARPENTER: What
I wanted to demonstrate

00:00:02.778 --> 00:00:04.360
is how this press works.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.660
I want to show how to make
a proper water filter.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.480
And this is a
ceramic water filter

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.280
that I'm going to create here.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.070
And that's essentially a
focus of the first talk.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.600
This is bisque-fired filters
made with clay and sawdust.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.420
Dry clay, dry
sawdust, about 50/50.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.824
And when the sawdust burns
out, it leaves pores.

00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:31.240
Now, the clay is
naturally porous,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.820
but the sawdust allows
for more porosity,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.890
and so the water
can flow through.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.020
If you have water
that's contaminated

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.520
with microbes and pathogens
that might create things

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.480
like cholera, E.
coli, Giardia, you

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.490
can put that water
into this filter.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.950
It will filter about one
to three liters an hour.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.205
And that water is rendered about
95% free of those contaminants.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:01:01.060
If we add a small amount of
colloidal silver to the filter

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.550
by brushing it on--

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.310
usually, it's a less than a
gram with about 500 milliliters

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.130
of water.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.580
That silver acts as a
natural antimicrobial

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.520
and will render inert
approximately the remaining 4

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.035
and 1/2% to 5% of the bad
stuff that's in that water.

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:16.660
So this is one of
those approaches that

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.390
allows us to have potable
water or adequate access

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.050
to clean water.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.940
A few years ago, I was working
with some undergrad engineering

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.440
students.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.480
I said, look, I
have this dilemma.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.650
Here's the situation.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.777
We have this big press
that's used conventionally

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.610
to make these filters,
but it's really tough

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.462
to take with me on the road.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:35.170
Can you make one that
fits in a suitcase?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.250
They said, yeah.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.800
Can you make one that makes
the same size filters?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.370
Yeah.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.609
Can you make one that
doesn't cost any money

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:43.900
or costs as little as possible?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.840
They said, well, maybe.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.700
And they did it.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.370
This is the filter press.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.080
It was collapsed earlier.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.302
I assembled this.

00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:56.260
And they made this out
of repurposed materials,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.690
but also, some of
the material I gave

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.780
them, which was this bell, the
male and female molds here.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.620
So I'll demonstrate how
this works to make a filter.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.100
Usually, again, the filters
are made on a full-sized press,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.170
but this is a smaller press.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.890
This is both the prototype
and the final product

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.200
and the only one in existence.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.579
Cool thing about this is
one person can operate it.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.370
Usually with those big
presses, it's easier

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.260
if two people operate it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.520
But one person can do very well.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.840
So this is a male mold.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.960
This is essentially
very lightweight steel.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.800
So we have this bell form.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.480
And what we're going to do is
put the clay in the middle,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.740
and we'll make the
filter this way.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.930
So this is the metal mold,
the bottom of the mold.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.520
I'm going to-- thank you--

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.120
put this plastic down
as a release agent.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.750
Because the clay will
stick to the metal.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.230
It doesn't like to
stick to the plastic.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.480
And I have this bat.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.155
It has a bevel in
it, approximately

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:10.114
the same angle as the bell.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.530
Then, I'm going
to put this clay--

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.570
So I'm going to put the
second piece of plastic on,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.370
and then I'll put this top part.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
What's interesting is that the
original traditional approach

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.360
to these larger presses
used concrete molds,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.040
and then they moved to
lighter weight metal molds.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.570
And so this is the
same exact mold

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.470
that one would find
on a larger press.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.080
Now, this is the part that
sometimes gets tricky,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.660
because you've got to make
sure both of these sides

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.150
are latched down.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.195
Take this arm and
tighten up the jack.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.585
And then, with just a simple--

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.060
this is a fun part.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.660
I like to say you have
to get up to get down.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.000
You have to push this
thing up in order for it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.402
to have resistance
and push back down.

00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:30.115
At this point, I am going
to release the pressure.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.500
All right, we'll
tighten this back up.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.820
Certainly, this machine,
this press, portable press,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.490
wouldn't necessarily work
well for a proper production

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.830
facility where you want to crank
out lots of filters in a day

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.550
or in a week.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.800
But certainly, to
establish a facility

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.430
in a community that needs clean
water using this technology,

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.820
we can use this press to
create filters very quickly

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.440
and give ourselves a
baseline of not only

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.360
the clay but how the
filtration works.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.540
Lift this back up.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.520
Take the bell off.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.810
And there's our filter.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.380
Just takes a little bit
of cleanup at this point.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.230
Again, I'm using my thumb just
to pull some of this extra off,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.810
but I could certainly use--

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.670
and this is what you would
do in a production facility,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.820
would be to take a clay tool
and to clean this up, as well.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.710
And then, because this bat
is wider than the base,

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.280
I simply lift, and
there's the filter.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.450
I can lay this--

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.440
place this down on a shelf in
the studio or in the facility.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.840
Another worker
would clean it up,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.820
smooth up some of
the edges, perhaps.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.990
Stamp it with a
date and a number

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.100
so we can track the
way that it operates.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.730
We let it dry, then we fire it.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.945
We put it in the kiln.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:32.440
We fire it to about 866
degrees C. And what happens

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.070
then is the sawdust
burns out, which

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.120
then creates a more porous
vessel that allows the water

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.340
to flow at a more
rapid pace than it

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.259
would if it wasn't as porous.

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:47.800
This is ready to
make another filter.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.630
I could put plastic
down, another bat down.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.600
We could continue to make
filters as long as we had clay.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.410
So with one person, that was,
what, about a 10-minute time

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.120
frame.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.280
With two people, you could
move much more quickly.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.363
But the reason I wanted
to demonstrate this to you

00:07:02.363 --> 00:07:06.070
is to show you, in
real time, what it

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.220
takes to create a water filter.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.910
What if you designed houses,
what if you designed shelters,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.400
what if you designed access
to water as if you really

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.720
cared about people getting it?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.260
Not that you cared about
making money from it,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.070
or that you were
interested in fame,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.810
or that you were just
doing it to do it.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.160
What if you gave a damn
about the situation?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.840
What if you cared
in more direct ways?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.950
What would that look like?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.030
In ways that would be affordable
to people who need it,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.220
but also appropriate in terms
of appropriate technology.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.060
The idea that
materials and practices

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.800
and processes that
allow for things

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.470
like shelter and food and
water access to happen

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.425
do not complicate a cultural
set of rules and practices.

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:53.800
It's appropriate
for the culture.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.870
It's appropriate
for the situation.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.380
Thinking about culture as the
way we do things around here.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.949
So does the technology
interrupt the way

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:02.990
we do things around here?

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.400
Does it pose confusion?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.030
So this is the gentleman
who invented, or is credited

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.390
with coming up
with, the approach,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.240
Dr. Fernando Mazariegos,
who was from Guatemala.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.170
And as a first response
to natural disasters,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.980
Mazariegos thought if we
had this porous vessel that

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.390
allowed for water
to flow through,

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:31.270
that contaminated water to flow
through at a fairly rapid pace,

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.130
we might be able to produce
adequate access to clean water,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.799
to potable water, after
natural disasters.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:44.250
And so Mazariegos then was
contacted by Ron Rivera.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.380
Ron was working with Potters
For Peace at the time.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.880
This was in the late
'80s, early '90s.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.570
And Ron learned the
process and started

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.120
setting up a water filter
production facility

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.250
through Potters For Peace.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.890
Met Ron Rivera a number of
years ago at a conference.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.790
And several months after
I met him, he passed away.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.180
He was working in Nigeria to
help a community set up a water

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.280
filter production
facility so that they

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.580
wouldn't contract malaria and
would not die from malaria.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.310
Ron came back from
that trip and died

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.140
from a very rare and
difficult strain of malaria.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.400
So he gave his life so that
others could have clean water.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.470
And whenever I give
a presentation,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.050
I always think of that very
special moment meeting Ron.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.000
But the idea is that it's
possible for this technology

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.580
to be passed along
to folks so that they

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.530
can use it to move
throughout the world

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.840
and through communities
to help other people.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840
This is a cross-section.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.050
This is a drawing that
Manny did of the filter

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.010
inside the receptacle.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.815
You see the addition
of a spigot and a lid.

00:09:56.815 --> 00:09:58.440
And these are two
important components.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.810
You need a spigot
to get the water out

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.840
and a lid to keep
hands and other things

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.270
entering into the filter.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.880
Contamination is a
big issue, right?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.310
These filters, as
you see here, if they

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:15.081
were sitting on a
counter in a kitchen,

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.080
you can put anything in.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.610
Your hands can touch them.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.710
External things
could touch them.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.450
And you can
contaminate the water.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.080
Even the water that is flowing
through can get contaminated.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.750
So a lid is necessary.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.500
I don't know if you
can hear, but this one

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.791
is dripping quite loudly now
that the water is flowing.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:34.170
We have some dirty water
that we were using earlier.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.320
And we filled these filters up.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.397
I'm going to lift this
one up so you can see it.

00:10:39.397 --> 00:10:40.730
You can't see the cross-section.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.830
This is the cross-section.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.777
Here's the spigot.

00:10:42.777 --> 00:10:44.610
I don't have the lid,
but I'll lift this up.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.170
You'll notice the
bell shape, and you

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.860
should see the water
dripping from the filter.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.466
You see that?

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:59.360
And if you come up later,
after we give this little chat,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.800
you'll be able to see the
clean water that's in there.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.200
So this is a point-of-use
water filter.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.880
It's placed in the
point in which it

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.010
will be used in the home,
usually in a kitchen.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.750
And the idea is that you would
fill it up in the morning--

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.900
in the evening, I'm sorry,
before you go to sleep.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.108
It will filter through the
night, and in the morning,

00:11:17.108 --> 00:11:19.055
you have water for
cooking and drinking.

00:11:19.055 --> 00:11:20.930
You fill it up again
sometime during the day,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.440
and then you have another
batch of water in the evening.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.640
So, again, point-of-use
water filters.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.450
These filters, again, the
technology is the same.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.210
The idea is the same, but
because clay and needs are

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.870
different in
different locations,

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.160
various organizations
have set up facilities

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.260
under different names, but
using the same technology,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.830
the same idea.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.960
Because the need for clean
water is a global need.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.510
The right to access to water
is a basic human right.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.940
So this little girl and the
other two children in the image

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.310
are drinking water
like they do every day.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.560
I can go right to that water
fountain down the hallway

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.184
and get a drink of water, or my
water bottle is here somewhere.

00:12:04.184 --> 00:12:06.210
I can drink out of that.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.560
Many of you have water bottles.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.810
This is the same water that
you see in the background.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.190
This water is the same water
where the cows have defecated,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.940
where people have thrown
away whatever it is they're

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.237
throwing away in that water.

00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:21.570
This little girl is in Honduras.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.550
This gentleman is getting
water for his family, his well.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:34.330
And that box has a little
opening on the face,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
on the plane facing us.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.730
He reaches his hand in,
puts a few coins in there,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.415
and the water comes
out of that long tube.

00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:43.790
Water's been sitting in some
sort of receptacle reservoir

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.900
underneath.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.360
He fills up the containers
in the back of his truck

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.040
and then drives those
containers home.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.210
Then has to figure out how to
get the water into his house.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.834
Then has to figure
out how to make sure

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:55.610
the water is clean
and safe to drink.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.040
This gentleman is in South
Texas, outside of Laredo.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.150
Half a million people do not
have utilities, paved roads,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.210
and housing that's up
to code in South Texas,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.510
from El Paso to Brownsville
and 150 miles north,

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.580
that green swath that
you see in that map.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.070
That's South Texas.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.930
Half a million people.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.440
They don't have adequate
access to clean water, either.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.410
And so my colleague at
Texas A&amp;M, Oscar Munoz,

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.200
is the director of
the Colonias program

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.050
and works with communities
along that region.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.660
Social practice and
public pedagogy,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.170
linking those two, this notion
of intentionally disruptive

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.190
responsibility.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.010
Social practice
being a term that

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.760
grows out of a number of
moves in contemporary art,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.820
where it has been theorized
by people like Clara Bishop

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.500
and Pablo Helguera
and others to think

00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:01.120
about the way in which
artists or artistic practices

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.920
intersect with social
issues and conventions

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.010
from other disciplines
to make positive change

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.580
or to enact change
through intentional modes.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.110
Public pedagogy, very much
like what we did this morning.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.740
We were out, essentially,
on the sidewalk--

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.590
or we were on the patio that
overlooked the sidewalk--

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.629
mixing clay and
sawdust in preparation

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:27.670
for making water filters.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.080
And people stopped and
said, what are you doing?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.550
Right there, you have
developed a relationship,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.300
this interchange, by asking
a question and responding

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.180
and this back and forth
and back and forth.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.750
There's some learning that
goes on in both directions.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.460
And talking to folks
about the water filters

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.300
through a public forum
in a public space

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.780
is one form that we might
consider public pedagogy.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.745
When I moved it to
Penn State, I decide

00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:57.870
to put a name to these
performances-- collaborative

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.703
creative resistance.

00:14:58.703 --> 00:15:00.800
I mean, Larry and I were
talking about titles.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.520
And sometimes, the title's
enough to tease and pull folks

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.080
in.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.760
But the idea of how
might we collaboratively

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.400
work together to resist
those hegemonic forces

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.440
or to disrupt what others
might find acceptable.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.960
So with a small grant from
the Institute for the Arts

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.330
and Humanities, I
did a performance

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.150
in front of the
Palmer Museum of Art.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.430
So there's a proximity
to the art museum.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.980
So maybe it's more
art-like because it's

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.000
closer to the museum?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.070
I'm not necessarily saying that.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.440
But it was a
wonderful open space

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.150
that allowed for the middle
of campus to stumble upon it.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:44.050
That was a Friday afternoon
in the middle of April.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.190
Set up the press.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:48.920
Started making filters.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.870
People stopped by.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:56.010
Students in art education and
in the School of Visual Arts

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:02.370
volunteered to sieve
sawdust and to mix the clay.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.270
Although I knew this
would probably happen,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.040
I didn't count on it happening
to the degree that it did.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.890
In the background of this image,
and in the very foreground,

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.170
you probably see people
who are a little younger

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.200
than what you might expect
to see on college campuses.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.690
These are children who came
from the local daycare center

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:24.027
on campus and from the
local elementary schools.

00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:25.860
The daycare folks knew
I was going to do it,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.068
because I had talked to them.

00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:30.661
But the kids from the elementary
schools, their teachers

00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:32.910
and the kids thought they
were going inside the museum

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.945
to see art.

00:16:33.945 --> 00:16:37.290
But when they got off the bus,
they saw this guy with a fedora

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.380
wedging clay and using this
big guillotine-looking machine

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.090
in the middle of campus.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.130
They'd rather stay outside
and talk to that guy.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.700
We had wonderful conversations
about adequate access

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.260
to clean water.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.910
Former student Sam
Bachmann, who's

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:57.870
a ceramic artist, dual degree
studio art and art education.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.050
You can have class anywhere.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.969
You can engage
education anywhere.

00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:02.260
You can have learning anywhere.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.580
Education is a relationship.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.990
Teaching and learning
is a relationship

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.849
that's negotiated
between multiple parties.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.390
And there's as much
learning going on

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.639
from whoever thinks they
might be the teacher as there

00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:15.607
is from folks who
might initially

00:17:15.607 --> 00:17:16.690
think they're the learner.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.410
Everyone in that relationship
is learning and teaching

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.310
simultaneously.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.660
