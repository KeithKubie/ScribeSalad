00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.148
- [Voiceover] The scatterplot drawn above,

00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:03.226
we'll take a look at it

00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:04.891
after we finish reading the question,

00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.365
depicts the average annual
United States per capita

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:10.580
consumption of high fructose corn syrup

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.625
between the years 1970 and 1985.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.177
Which of the following functions

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:19.082
best describes the relationship shown?

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.687
So, when we look at the scatterplot,

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:25.059
we see that it definitely
looks like we could fit a,

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.944
we could fit a parabola to it.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.016
We could find a curve of best fit.

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:33.043
And that parabola might
look something like,

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:35.847
might look something like,

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:38.447
might look something like this.

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.926
Again, I'm just kind of estimating it,

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:42.389
trying to draw a parabola with my hand.

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:45.010
It's gonna be a hand-drawn parabola.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.432
But it's gonna look something like that.

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:47.651
And what they're saying is look,

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.358
they've given us some candidates,

00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:51.918
some quadratic functions
that would describe

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.514
this curve of best fit, or
this parabola of best fit.

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:57.972
And so, which of these could it be?

00:00:57.972 --> 00:00:58.988
We'll there's a couple things

00:00:58.988 --> 00:01:00.979
that you might immediately see.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.356
The first is, is that a
couple of these choices

00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:07.175
have a positive coefficient
on the highest degree term,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.489
or the second degree term.

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.169
And then the other ones, the
other ones have a negative,

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:14.277
negative coefficient on
the highest degree term.

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:15.842
Well, if you have a positive coefficient

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:18.727
on the highest degree term,
or the second degree term,

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:20.230
and if we're talking about a quadratic,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.196
you're going to have an
upward-opening parabola.

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:24.894
And if you had a negative coefficient,

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:27.413
it would be a downward-opening parabola.

00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:31.801
And what we have here
is clearly it looks like

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.625
the right half of an
upward-opening parabola.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:35.928
So we could rule out the ones

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.917
that would be downward-opening.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:39.197
So we could rule out the ones that have

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:41.461
a negative coefficient
on the second degree,

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.330
second degree term.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.808
So let's rule those out right over here.

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:47.292
And then when we look
at the remaining two,

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:50.502
we see there's a fairly
dramatic difference in them.

00:01:50.502 --> 00:01:54.870
They have, you know,
this is 201 versus .201.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.518
264 versus .264,

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:01.468
969 versus .969.

00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:04.459
And so, we could really look
at our curve right over here

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.025
and get a sense of, and test some points.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.235
So, if we look at, maybe
the easiest one is actually

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.754
test when x is equal to zero.

00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:16.111
So, when x is equal to zero,

00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:18.874
depending on how we draw our curve,

00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:21.109
our y is going to be pretty low.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.324
Our y is going to be close to zero.

00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:24.726
I'll just write close

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:28.403
close, is going to be close to zero.

00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:29.845
It's going to be definitely,

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:31.950
it's going to definitely be below five.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.205
It's going to be probably
definitely below two.

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:37.232
So, let's see which of
these choices describe that.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:40.259
So when x is zero here,
this term goes away,

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.539
this term goes away,

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.363
and we're left with 0.969.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.506
So y would be,

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:50.506
so this has a .0, 0.969 on it.

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:52.775
Which seems pretty close to our criteria,

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:56.513
that hey we want, when x is
zero, y is pretty close to zero.

00:02:56.513 --> 00:02:57.732
Let's see this one.

00:02:57.732 --> 00:03:00.820
This choice right over
here, when x is zero,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.466
this term goes away, this term goes away,

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:06.326
y is 969.

00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:09.109
So here, in order, if you pick that,

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.218
if you picked this choice right over,

00:03:12.218 --> 00:03:13.417
this is not close to zero.

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:16.078
This is nowhere, this actually
would be off the charts

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:18.496
right over here, the .0969.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:20.710
It wouldn't even fit on that graph.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.503
So you can definitely,

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:26.493
you can definitely rule this one out.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:29.894
And we would be left with
that choice right there.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:31.844
And you could try other points,

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:35.294
but that one would definitely
be the easiest to evaluate.
