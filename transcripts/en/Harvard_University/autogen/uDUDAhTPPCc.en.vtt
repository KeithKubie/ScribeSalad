there are all kinds of claims being made
 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.860
there are all kinds of claims being made
about the technology and about what it's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
about the technology and about what it's
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840
about the technology and about what it's
going to do for us so one of those

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
going to do for us so one of those
 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.180
going to do for us so one of those
claims is that it's going to make nature

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190
claims is that it's going to make nature
 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.949
claims is that it's going to make nature
better it's going to make it more

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959
better it's going to make it more
 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.530

the wrong places and so on and so forth
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.210
the wrong places and so on and so forth
and therefore we will get much more

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
and therefore we will get much more
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.110

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.650
growing but the total planetary surface
of arable land is not growing so we need

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
of arable land is not growing so we need
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.360
of arable land is not growing so we need
to get more and more out of there and we

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
to get more and more out of there and we
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.580
to get more and more out of there and we
have to make nature behave better so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590
have to make nature behave better so
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.380
have to make nature behave better so
that is certainly one kind of claim that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
that is certainly one kind of claim that
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.070
that is certainly one kind of claim that
you get another sort of claim is in that
