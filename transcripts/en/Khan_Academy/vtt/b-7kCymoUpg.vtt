00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.010
In a previous video,
we derived the formula

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.160
for the sum of a
finite geometric series

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.510
where a is the first term
and r is our common ratio.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.220
What I want to do
in this video is now

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.030
think about the sum of an
infinite geometric series.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.900
And I've always found this
mildly mind blowing because,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.660
or actually more than mildly
mind blowing, because you're

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.160
taking the sum of an infinite
things but as we see,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.550
you can actually
get a finite value

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.580
depending on what
your common ratio is.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.980
So there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.170
One is, you could
say that the sum

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.350
of an infinite
geometric series is just

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.230
a limit of this as n
approaches infinity.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.950
So we could say,
what is the limit

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.690
as n approaches infinity of
this business, of the sum from k

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:04.069
equals zero to n of
a times r to the k.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.110
Which would be the same
thing as taking the limit

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.560
as n approaches infinity
right over here.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.410
So that would be the
same thing as the limit

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.440
as n approaches infinity
of all of this business.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.940
Let me just copy
and paste that so I

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.070
don't have to keep
switching colors.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.430
So copy and then paste.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.141
So what's the limit as n
approaches infinity here?

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.640
Let's think about
that for a second.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.820
I encourage you to
pause the video,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.220
and I'll give you one hint.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.000
Think about it for r
is greater than one,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.244
for r is equal to
one, and actually

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:36.660
let me make it
clear-- let's think

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.900
about it for the absolute
values of r is greater than one,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.450
the absolute values
of r equal to one,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.180
and then the absolute
value of r less than one.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.250
Well, I'm assuming
you've given a go at it.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.210
So if the absolute value
of r is greater than one,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.660
as this exponent explodes,
as it approaches infinity,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.040
this number is just going
to become massively,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.560
massively huge.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.570
And so the whole thing
is just going to become,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.240
or at least you could
think of the absolute value

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.615
of the whole thing,
is just going

00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:10.690
to become a very, very,
very large number.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.350
If r was equal to one,
then the denominator

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.190
is going to become zero.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.480
And we're going to be
dividing by that denominator,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.930
and this formula
just breaks down.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.680
But where this formula
can be helpful,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.700
and where we can get
this to actually give us

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.390
a sensical result, is when
the absolute value of r

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.811
is between zero and one.

00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:33.560
We've already talked
about, we're not even

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.309
dealing with the
geometric, we're not even

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.570
talking about a geometric
series if r is equal to zero.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.400
So let's think about the case
where the absolute value of r

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.260
is greater than zero,
and it is less than one.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.410
What's going to
happen in that case?

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.820
Well, the denominator is going
to make sense, right over here.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.960
And then up here,
what's going to happen?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.640
Well, if you take something
with an absolute value

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960
less than one, and you take it
to higher and higher and higher

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.650
exponents, every time you
multiply it by itself,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.410
you're going to get a number
with a smaller absolute value.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.210
So this term right over
here, this entire term,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.860
is going to go to zero
as n approaches infinity.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.970
Imagine if r was 1/2.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970
You're talking about 1/2
to the hundredth power,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.420
1/2 to the thousandth power,
1/2 to the millionth power,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.880
1/2 to the billionth power.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.300
That quickly approaches zero.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.340
So this goes to zero if
the absolute value of r

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.390
is less than one.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:38.370
So this, we could argue, would
be equal to a over one minus r.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.450
So for example, if I had
the geometric series,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.070
if I had the infinite
geometric series--

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.400
let's just have a simple one.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.470
Let's say that my
first term is one,

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.150
and then each successive term
I'm going to multiply by 1/3.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:07.680
So it's one plus 1/3
plus 1/3 squared plus 1/3

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.620
to the third plus, and I were
to just keep on going forever.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.292
This is telling us that that
sum, this infinite sum--

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:17.000
I have an infinite
number of terms here--

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.779
this is a pretty
fascinating concept here--

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.054
will come out to this.

00:04:21.054 --> 00:04:27.020
It's going to be my
first term, one, over one

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.560
minus my common ratio.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.160
My common ratio in
this case is 1/3.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.260
One minus 1/3, which is the
same thing as one over 2/3,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.630
which is equal to 3/2, or you
could view it as one and 1/2.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.733
That's a mildly amazing thing.
