(rock music)

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:09.274 line:0%
- Class, who can tell me some
alternative forms of energy?

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:10.543 line:0%
- [Man] Well there's wind power

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.678 line:0%
which at 4.3% is
the fifth largest

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:14.547 line:0%
source of electricity
in the United State.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.283 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Excellent, I'm
gonna put down wind.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.018 line:0%
- [Man] Yeah, I was
also gonna say wind,

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.721 line:0%
but since Mike said
wind, I'm gonna just

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.555 line:0%
say weind.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.926 line:0%
- Okay, I'll put
down wind again.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.527 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- Professor Rich, why
do we have to have class

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.730 line:0%
in this janitor's closet anyway?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.199 line:0%
- Because the dean
put us on probation

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.902 line:0%
because of that fucking nark.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.237 line:0%
Wait, someone's coming.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.541 line:0%
Boy, it's sure good to
not be teaching anymore.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.777 line:0%
- Yeah, it's too bad you're
just a big stupid loser now.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.379 line:0%
- [Man] Yeah, you're scum.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.081 line:0%
- I kinda wish you
were dead right now.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.749 line:0%
- Yeah, you suck so hard.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.150 line:0%
- Okay, enough,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.553 line:0%
enough, he's left..

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.954 line:0%
- I just farted.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.456 line:0%
- Okay, let's go.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:59.091 line:0%
I'm Professor Rich,
expert in science.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.160 line:0%
These are my devoted students.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.897 line:0%
Together with the aid
of harmless drugs,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:08.234 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
we explore science's greatest
hypothetical questions.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.770 line:0%
(techno music)

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.453 line:0%
- Hey, this wasn't here before.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.922 line:0%
- The dean already
gave this class away

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.857 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
to Professor Leaveman
from Egyptology.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.460 line:0%
- Wish they'd Leaveman us alone.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.195 line:0%
Pretty good right?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.830 line:0%
- It's not fair Professor Rich,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.266 line:0%
you don't deserve this.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.635 line:0%
Pat does, but you don't.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.336 line:0%
- Those are kind words Jen,

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.805 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
but coming from you
they mean very little.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.175 line:0%
Right now we're on probation.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.976 line:0%
And we could still
redeem ourselves

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.980 line:0%
but we have to keep
our noses clean.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.950 line:0%
That means no vaping.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.886 line:0%
Now,

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.055 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
let's get started
with a hypothetical.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.889 line:0%
What if martial arts

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.958 line:0%
could be used to harness energy?

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.359 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Well I guess it
would really depend on

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.328 line:0%
how much energy we're talking.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.030 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
If you were to
harness what amounts

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.631 line:0%
to the electricity
of a large city,

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.233 line:0%
I'd estimate you probably need

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.236 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
about 100,000 martial artists
kicking around the clock.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.671 line:0%
- So it could work?

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.639 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.808 line:0%
- Wait, somebody's coming.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.810 line:0%
I was just fucking with ya.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.679 line:0%
Instead of staying up all night,

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.183 line:0%
I roamed the streets and
then when the sun came up,

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.351 line:0%
I had an idea.

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.520 line:0%
Solar energy.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.655 line:0%
Hello Xan.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:36.555 line:0%
- Yes, that's right.

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:39.225 line:0%
- Yes, I am Professor Rich.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.492 line:0%
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.562 line:0%
- I understand you're
in expert in energy.

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:46.532 line:0%
- My company uses thousands
of mirrors to reflect light.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.367 line:0%
- Do you mind if I
get a little closer?

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.235 line:0%
- That would be great.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.403 line:0%
- Okay, great.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.174 line:0%
I have this

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.710 line:0%
down on my list of questions.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.545 line:0%
Why?

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.381 line:0%
- Why what?

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:04.217 line:0%
- I just have why.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.888 line:0%
I have a theory what
if alternative energy

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.590 line:0%
can be done in a human way,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.059 line:0%
like through

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.694 line:0%
some kind of motion.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.029 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- You're talking about
like a human hamster wheel?

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.231 line:0%
- Kind of.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.598 line:0%
A gerbil wheel.

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:21.400 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Most of the
issues with that are

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.069 line:0%
moral or

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.071 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
not scientific or
technical in nature.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.406 line:0%
- This is the sun, right.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:31.411 line:0%
So as you describe, the
sun starts to heat up

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.579 line:0%
and then it creates

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.414 line:0%
energy.

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:38.151 line:0%
Now in human form,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:42.421 line:0%
we're moving about, we're a
whirling dervish of motion

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:43.923 line:0%
and ha.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.994 line:0%
This is a ninja warrior or
some kind of martial artist.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.263 line:0%
He's moving,

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:52.131 line:0%
ha ha ha.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.603 line:0%
(techno music)

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.840 line:0%
So could a karate chop

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.276 line:0%
charge my iPhone?

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.613 line:0%
Could a nice well placed kick

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:07.947 line:0%
boil some water?

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.117 line:0%
- If you had enough of
them, I could imagine

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.919 line:0%
you could attach some kind
of power generation device.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.788 line:0%
(beeps)

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:16.789 line:0%
- Excuse me.

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:19.859 line:0%
Your old trusty pager.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.027 line:0%
I've gotta go.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:26.933 line:0%
And scene.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.469 line:0%
Okay, stop.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:31.971 line:0%
Stop.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.139 line:0%
5.7 kilowatts.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.877 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
You've officially lit
this bulb for 10 seconds.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.979 line:0%
(cheers)

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.482 line:0%
- Well, well, well.

00:04:43.482 --> 00:04:47.152 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
How clever of you to return
to your old classroom.

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:49.321 line:0%
Oh no, wait, I meant stupid.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.325 line:0%
Consider all of you
on double probation.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.493 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- But I've got more
important classes to go to.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:55.727 line:0%
- You should have
thought of that

00:04:55.727 --> 00:04:57.229 line:0%
before you joined
these reprobates.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.831 line:0%
- I don't own any real estate.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.166 line:0%
- Help, I'm here
against my will.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.168 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Nice try Mrs.
Pearson, you've been

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:04.403 line:0%
in this class for eight months.

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:06.839 line:0%
All of you have made
an abysmal mistake

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.674 line:0%
siding with this buffoon.

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:12.044 line:0%
He could cost you your futures.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:15.715 line:0%
Energy from martial
arts, the nerve.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.049 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
You know what, an another
thing, you people-

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:19.052 line:0%
(crash)

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.091 line:0%
- Hi, I'm here on the set
of the new Woody Allen film

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.559 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Bananas Two to
meet with legendary

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.663 line:0%
stunt coordinator Steven Ho.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:31.864 line:0%
Steven hi.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:32.731 line:0%
- Hi, how are ya?

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:34.033 line:0%
- Professor Rich.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.434 line:0%
- Pleasure.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:37.436 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
- We're trying to harness
energy from karate.

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.338 line:0%
Is that possible?

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.206 line:0%
- For

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.374 line:0%
what purposes?

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.910 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- We've attached
electrodes to our arms

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.046 line:0%
in order to light up the room.

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.214 line:0%
So we need to use
the most expendable

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:51.884 line:0%
energy for karate as possible.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.052 line:0%
- So you want people to do

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.721 line:0%
karate to create energy?

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:56.722 line:0%
- Yes.

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:59.125 line:0%
I was must wondering what moves

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:03.762 line:0%
in karate are probably
give you the most energy.

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:05.765 line:0%
(gasps)

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:12.471 line:0%
- Would you like
to try the hitting?

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.074 line:0%
- I would like to
try the hitting.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.278 line:0%
I am f-ed and fucked.

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:21.547 line:0%
- Don't worry Professor Rich,

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.248 line:0%
one of us will take
the blame for you.

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.150 line:0%
- Hell no, we're all gonna die.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.252 line:0%
- I wish I had Tater with me.

00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:29.489 line:0%
- What's Tater, your lunch or?

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.422 line:0%
- No, my dog.

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.590 line:0%
- You have a dog?

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.126 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Cat's are clearly
the best animal pets.

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:35.094 line:0%
- What are you talking about?

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:36.261 line:0%
- Because they are.

00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.097 line:0%
- No they're not, they suck.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.266 line:0%
- If it sucks, it's a cat.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.935 align:start position:0% line:0%
- Cats are the cutest creatures
on the face of the planet.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.169 line:0%
- They're both cute.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.604 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- No, they're not they
can't be both cute.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:47.774 line:0%
(arguing)

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.780 line:0%
(inspirational music)

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.931 line:0%
- It works, it really works.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.036 line:0%
Class reinstated.

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:19.639 line:0%
(techno music)

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.516 line:0%
- Excellent.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.652 line:0%
- That was a mad possum.
