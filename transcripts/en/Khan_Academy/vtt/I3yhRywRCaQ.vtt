00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.510
We're on problem 28.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.600
Four pumps begin draining
a 5,400 gallon pool.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.580
At the same time, two pumps
begin draining a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.790
4,000 gallon pool.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.650
Assuming that all of the pumps
drain at the same rate, how

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.880
many gallons are left in the
smaller pool-- so the 4,000

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.370
gallon pool-- when the
larger pool is

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.690
finished being drained.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.270
And notice they didn't tell us
how fast the pumps work, so

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.750
let's just assume that.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990
Let's say that each
pump drains at

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.030
x gallons per minute.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.400
So four pumps will drain at 4x
gallons per minute, two pumps

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.520
will drain at 2x gallons
a minute.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.730
So how many minutes does
it take to drain the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.070
5,400 gallon pool?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.210
Well, it will be 5,400 gallons--
I'll just write g's,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.210
or I'll just say gallons--
divided by x gallons, or

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.030
actually 4x because we
have four pumps,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.340
4x gallons per minute.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.380
And what is this equal to?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.730
If we divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2--

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.980
actually, let's just
divide by 4.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.870
4 goes into 5,400, 4 goes into
5 one time, 1 times 4 is 4,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.320
bring down the 1.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.820
4 goes into 14 three times.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.170
3 times 4 is 12.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.300
20, 4 goes into 20 5 times.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.940
So it goes 1,350 times.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:35.110
So this is equal to 1,350 over
x minutes to drain the 5,400

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.660
gallon pool.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.410
Now, how much has drained out
of the 4,000 gallon pool at

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.330
that point?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.940
Well, we're going
to be draining

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.700
2x gallons per minute.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.690
And how long are we going
to be doing that for?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.710
Well we're going to do it
until-- or we're going to be

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.850
watching this experiment-- until
this pool is completely

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.220
drained and we've figured out
this is how long it takes to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.320
drain it: 1,350 over
x minutes.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.660
So, if we're going to be pumping
out at 2x gallons per

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.280
minute, in the smaller pool,
because we have two pumps, so

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.880
2x gallons per minute, times
this many minutes, times 1,350

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.730
over x minutes.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240
This is going to tell us how
many gallons have pumped out

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.160
of the 4,000 gallon pool.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.950
So the x's cancel out-- you have
an x in the numerator, an

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.150
x in the denominator.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.375
The minutes cancel out, so our
answer will be in gallons.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.680
So it's 2 times 1,350.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.290
So what do we get?

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.240
We get 2,700 gallons.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.140
That's how much has been pumped
out of the 4,000 gallon

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.860
pool, right?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.190
This is how much has
been pumped out.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.530
2x times 1,350 over
x is 2,700.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.890
That's how much has been pumped
out, but they're asking

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.710
us, how many gallons are left
in the smaller pool?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.880
So if we started with 4,000, and
we subtract 2,700, that's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.970
going to be 1,300 gallons
are left in the pool.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.620
That is choice A.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.070
Problem 29.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.850
Use the graph below to answer
the question that follows.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.780
Switch colors, ease
the monotony.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.850
The graph above shows the
distance, d, in miles, and the

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.380
time, t, in minutes for six
bus routes around a city.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.220
Which of the following equations
best models a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.490
relationship between d and
t for these bus routes?

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.330
So these are different
bus routes.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.600
It's almost a line.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.866
I mean we can kind of-- let me
do it in a light color so I

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:42.400
don't mess up the graph-- but we
can see, you know, I see a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.010
line that looks something like
that, right there, if I had to

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.570
fit a line into there.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.190
Let's see, which of the
following equations best

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.600
models the relationship?

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.630
So t is equal to d, what
would that look like?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.990
That line-- I'll do it in this
light green color-- t is equal

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.990
to d, so when t is equal to
10, d is equal to 10.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.050
When t is equal to 20, d is
equal to 20. t is equal to 30,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.790
d is equal to 30.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.490
So that's this line
right here.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.540
That doesn't seem to model these
black dots too well, so

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.570
it's not going to
be that answer.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.750
Let me do another one.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.280
t is equal to d plus 10.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.340
So if we start at 10, so
when d is 0, t will

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.970
be 10, right there.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.290
When d is 10, d will be 20,
right? d plus 10, 20.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.500
When d is 20, t will be 30.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260
It's going to look like this.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.140
This is a little, it's an
improvement, but it still

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.510
doesn't look that great to me.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.290
So, let's just, yeah, it's
probably not that.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.200
t is equal to 2d.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.640
Well, 2d, when you're
0, you're at 0.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.910
When t is equal to 10, you're
going to be at 20.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.570
When t is equal to 20, you're
going to be at 40, so it's

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.190
going to go like, something
like this.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.940
It's going to look something--
40 right here-- it's going to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.320
look something like this.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.090
Which is close.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.730
It seems to have the
right slope.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.630
Let's look at the last choice.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.870
I'm guessing the last
choice is going to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.040
get us right there.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.960
t is equal to 2d plus 10.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.580
Let me do this in blue, because
I have a feeling this

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.840
is the right answer.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.220
So we start at 10 when
d is 0, t is 10.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.280
And then we go up by 2d.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.810
Or another you can think of
it, when d is 10, we get 2

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.310
times 10 plus 10.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.860
We're going to go to 30.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.010
When d is 20, 2 times
20 plus 10 is 50.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.850
We're going to be at 50.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.030
So the line looks something
like this.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.280
It will look like that,
which is a pretty

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.190
good fit of the curve.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.960
It's definitely the best out
of the four choices.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.280
So I'll go with D.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.450
Next question.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.540
Let's see.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.010
Are there any questions
on this page?

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.380
No.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.740
Next page.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.026
Next question.

00:05:55.026 --> 00:05:56.700
Let's see.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.910
Use the graph below to answer
the question that follows.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.170
OK, they've drawn us
a little line.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.470
They've drawn some points
on the line.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.050
The graph above represents the
equation wx plus 4y is equal

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.560
to minus 12.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.510
What is the value of w?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.600
So they're esentially, they gave
us two points, so we can

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.100
easily figure out, actually,
the equation of this line.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.530
Maybe we do not have
to go that far.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.240
So if we can just write this
line, y is equal to mx plus b

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.180
form, and maybe if we just
figure out the slope of the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.800
line, that'll be enough.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.960
So they said that the line
is wx plus 4y is

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.710
equal to minus 12.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.500
If we subtract-- I just want to
put it into the standard mx

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.890
plus b form.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.260
So if we subtract wx from both
sides, we get 4y is equal to

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.180
minus wx minus 12, and then
divide both sides by 4, you

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.100
get y is equal to minus
w over 4x minus 3.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.140
So this is the equation of the
line, and we have to figure

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.520
out what w is.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.310
This right here, minus w over
4 is the slope of the line.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.900
So let's figure out
what the slope is.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.160
Slope is just change in x.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.830
Slope is equal to change in x,
over-- sorry-- is equal to

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.130
change in y, change in
y over change in x.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.270
Rise over run.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.780
How much do you change in y
when you change a certain

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.660
amount in x?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.760
So in this case, it's going to
be equal to-- let's take this

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.100
as our first point.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.240
So we take the y's.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:35.420
2 minus minus 3 over-- right,
that's the change in y-- 2

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.550
minus minus 3, right?

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.380
And then, the second one, we use
the 2 as the first point

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.160
here, so I use the minus 4
as the first point to the

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.480
denomintor.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.460
Minus 4 minus this
x value, is 0.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.950
So the slope here is equal
to 2 minus minus 3.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.530
That's the same thing as
2 plus 3, which is just

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.350
5 over minus 4.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.690
So this is the slope.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.870
So 5 over minus 4 has to
be the same thing as

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.210
minus w over 4.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.520
You could write minus 5/4 is
equal to minus w over 4.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.100
You could pattern match
that immediately.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.440
The w has got to
be equal to 5.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.180
You could also solve for
w, but let's just

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.175
do the pattern matching.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:17.840
That makes it easier.
