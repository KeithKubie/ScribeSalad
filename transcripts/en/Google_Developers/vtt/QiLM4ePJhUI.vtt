ARUN NAGARAJAN:
Hello and welcome

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.140
to Google Developers Live.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.460
My name is Arun Nagarajan.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.910
And I'm from the Google Apps
Developer Relations Team.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.062
And today we have a
special guest, Gliffy,

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:19.020
that's going to be joining
here in the studios.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.587
And they've actually built
a great Google Docs add-on

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.170
that they're going
to walk us through.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.750
But before we dive into some
of the demos and details,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.660
let's actually let them
introduce themselves.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.040
I have Lyubov and Han.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.494
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Hi, I'm a
software developer at Gliffy.

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:34.910
And I've been working on the
add-on for about a month now.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.034
And it's been really great.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:37.105
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Awesome.

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:37.980
HAN LEE: I'm Han Lee.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.795
I'm a product lead at Gliffy.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.220
And I've been
working with Lyubov

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.114
to get our app put together.

00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:44.030
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.196
And for the folks that are
not familiar with Gliffy,

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:48.710
can you give me a background
on what the company does?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.777
What the product is?

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:50.360
HAN LEE: Sure.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.540
Absolutely.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.130
Gliffy is a fast and
easy-to-use diagramming tool.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.320
We were founded in 2005 and
we're the world's first NET

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.840
native diagramming app.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.090
We started out in Flash
and imported to HTML5

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.310
about a year and a half ago.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.240
Because it's HTML5,
Gliffy works on platforms

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.830
anywhere where
Chrome is supported.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.522
So, Mac, PC, Linux, Chrome, OS.

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:14.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.105
HAN LEE: And
personally, I really

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:18.011
love working with
the HTML5 technology.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.010
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Awesome.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.990
And who's the typical
user of Gliffy?

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.050
HAN LEE: It varies a lot.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.750
So we support a number
of diagram types.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.630
A typical diagram would be
a flow chart like this one.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.630
An ERD diagram, like this.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.380
Or fun diagrams-- this is
something one of our users put

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.350
together for a
diagramming contest.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.225
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:38.750
Very cool.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.530
All right.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.030
So why don't we
actually take a look

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.550
at the actual add-on,
and then we'll

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.508
kind of dig in to some
of the technical details

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:47.440
and talk a bit about some of
the experience you've had.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.340
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: OK.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.570
So, we have a Gliffy
menu dropdown.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.980
And if you have
existing diagrams,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.280
all you gotta do is
just click on Find.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.380
And it'll pull up a list
of the recent diagrams

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.080
that you've been working on.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.100
And you can insert it
directly from there.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.308
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.020
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: And you
can always browse by folder

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.140
if you have diagrams saved off.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.020
There's also a search feature.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.650
And then you could also
edit the diagrams directly

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.000
from the sidebar.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.070
And it'll open up
the Gliffy interface.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.030
The full-featured interface.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.210
Additionally, you could create
a new diagram from Google Docs.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.940
And that will offer
you some templates.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.140
And after you create it,
and then you would save it,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.060
and you would be
able to, hopefully,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.075
see it in the document.

00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:52.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.200
And this is just another
tab in your browser?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.283
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Exactly.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:03:01.610
And then once it successfully
saves, if you go back to this,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.122
it will refresh every 30 seconds
and you will be able to see it.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:06.330
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.163
So it's like just
checking behind the scenes

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:08.930
for new documents?

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.480
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yeah.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.050
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.065
So you don't have to really
think about it too much.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:13.565
LYUBOV KASSIANIK:
It basically pulls

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:15.070
in all the recent
diagrams, assuming

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.360
that you might want one.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.780
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.500
There it is.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.416
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yay!

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:20.156
And then you can go
ahead and insert it.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:21.030
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Cool.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.570
I like the way you've done
the overlay menus there.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.528
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yeah.

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:25.237
Bootstrap helped.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:26.444
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:28.540
So that actually gets
to our next point, which

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.690
is can you talk a
little bit about some

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.023
of the technologies you've used?

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:33.290
Some of the internals
of how this all works?

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.392
What some of the
salient points are?

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:36.350
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yeah.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.320
So, the technical
background, it's

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.450
very simple for this add-on.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.340
We have a few HTML
templates that we use.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.160
And just one controller that
actually governs and takes

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.940
care of all the HTML templates.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.860
And, of course, we
have the server script

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.750
that talks to the Gliffy server.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.810
That's pretty much it.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.430
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.830
And you've used Bootstrap here
for the styling and everything?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:58.370
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yeah.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.634
Bootstrap was a big savior.

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:00.425
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:01.120
That's great.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.300
And are there special
considerations

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.770
you guys took into effect
for the sidebar design

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.720
from a UX standpoint?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.840
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: We had
our designers help us out

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.270
to make sure that it lays out
and it reflects, basically,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.269
the Gliffy interface as well as
matches what Google might want.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.690
So a lot of the
buttons are actually

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.570
very similar to
your Share button.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good call, yeah.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.500
Very nice.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.350
Very nice.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.630
What are some of the interesting
challenges you ran into?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.680
Some of the things
that gave you grief

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.782
or was complicated that
you could share with us.

00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:37.240
HAN LEE: For me it
was really easy.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.212
Lyubov did all the hard work.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.670
ARUN NAGARAJAN:
I'm sure there were

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.860
some interesting challenges.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.818
LYUBOV KASSIANIK: Yeah.

00:04:42.818 --> 00:04:46.020
So we did have some Caja
limitations that we ran into.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.620
I wasn't expecting to not
have certain things available.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.740
But the workarounds were
usually very simple.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.252
And just required a little
bit of investigation.

00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:54.460
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.672
What would be your advice
to other add-on developers,

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.630
other developers that
are interested in writing

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.779
other tools for
Google Docs or Sheets?

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.320
LYUBOV KASSIANIK:
I would advise them

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.680
to make a UI heavy
application and to limit

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.690
the script to just
the bare bones.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.200
Mainly because a UI
heavy add-on would

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.252
mean a more responsive
user experience.

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:15.460
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's great.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.350
And by that you mean, do
more things in JavaScript

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.779
from the sidebar itself.

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:20.320
That's great.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.903
LYUBOV KASSIANIK:
Sometimes that meant

00:05:21.903 --> 00:05:24.450
I would write hidden
HTML elements that

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.800
would store some data.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.854
But it was such a
worthwhile trade-off.

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:30.020
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Interesting.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.490
Versus going back to the
server and fetching something.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.010
Interesting.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.626
Very interesting.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.000
So when you launch
this, what are

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.550
some of the interesting
success metrics

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.549
that you'll be tracking?

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:42.270
What are some of the things
that would mean important launch

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.090
milestones for you?

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.464
HAN LEE: That's
a great question.

00:05:44.464 --> 00:05:45.600
I'm very metrics-focused.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.140
So one key one would be the
percent of our regular users

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.370
that actually used the apps.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.500
So that'll give us an idea of
the popularity within our user

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.490
base.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.250
Another one is the
conversion rate of new users.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.980
So we would take
a look at people

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.610
coming in through
the marketplace built

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.940
into Google Docs.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.580
And compare the conversion
rate to our other ecosystems.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.700
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Great.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.280
That's great.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.070
I've had a fun time
using the add-on myself.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.730
Gliffy is a really
fun to use tool.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.160
It's one of those tools
that you just open a tab

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.460
and start sketching.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.800
It's great for brainstorming.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.330
Great for architecture diagrams.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.496
For software systems
and things like that.

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:26.870
Google has Google
Drawings, but I

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.560
feel like Gliffy has got
some really good templates

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.640
and really good
capabilities that I think

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.500
is useful for anyone
in any industry.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.700
So best of luck with the launch.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.970
I urge you all to go test
this and try this add-on.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.320
And thank you very much for
being in the city with us.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.160
LYUBOV KASSIANIK:
Thank you so much.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.076
HAN LEE: Thanks, Arun.

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:44.445
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.
