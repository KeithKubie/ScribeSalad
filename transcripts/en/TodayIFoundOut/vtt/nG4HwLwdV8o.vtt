00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.660
Non-Addictive Heroin? ...and 8 Other Medical
Facts

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.420
1.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.850
Before aspirin was introduced, people would
chew on the bark of the white willow tree

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.110
to reduce fever and inflammation.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.410
White willow contains salicin, a chemical
similar to acetylsalicylic acid found in today’s

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.410
aspirin.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.440
In fact, in the early 1800s salicin was used
to make Aspirin.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.700
The tree has anti-inflammatory effects and
although it may be slower acting, the effects

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.850
of salicin in white willow are longer lasting
than Aspirin.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.220
Of course, ingesting this bark also has the
negative side effect of giving you a very

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.640
upset stomach.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
2.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.469
The human eye can detect somewhere between
100K-10 million shades of color.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.940
For reference, HDMI 1.3 supports 30 bits or
1 billion colors, 36 bits or 68 billion colors,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.179
and 48 bits or 281 trillion colors.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.179
(QF 454)

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.179
3.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.679
One of the common early uses of Heroin, which
was marketed as non-addictive, was to help

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.079
treat people who were addicted to morphine,
even though Heroin ultimately proved to be

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.179
more addictive.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.570
When morphine was first isolated from opium
in 1805, one of its early uses was a “non-addictive”

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
drug to treat people who were addicted to
the less addictive opium.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
(QF: 475)

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840
4.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.260
TNT is poisonous and skin exposure will generally
cause irritation and your skin will turn bright

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.470
yellow or orange.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.010
Further, if you eat TNT, your pee will turn
red and look like blood, though it is not.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.110
In fact, during WWI, munitions workers who
handled TNT were called “canary girls”

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.410
or “canaries” because their skin that
was exposed to the TNT turned the aforementioned

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.410
colors.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.760
On the more serious side, prolonged exposure
to TNT causes liver, blood, spleen, and immune

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.960
system problems among others.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
5.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.600
Human sperm cells on average tend to be able
to travel about 7 to 8 inches per hour (about

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.830
17-20 cm/hr).

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.050
(Fact 502)

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
6.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.540
The reason you can see eye floaters better
when looking at, for instance, a bright blue

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.330
sky, is because your pupils contract to a
very small size, thus reducing the aperture,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.620
which in turn makes floaters more apparent
and focused.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.620
7.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.480
Humans enjoy five or more different tastes
namely: sour, bitter, salty, umami (associated

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.800
with meat), and sweet.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.290
We can taste sweet things thanks to two proteins
generated by two separate genes.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.530
Cats, on the other hand, have a mutant chemoreceptor
in their taste buds that prevents them from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.010
tasting sweet things, which is actually a
trait shared by all cats big and small, not

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.370
just domestic ones.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.370
8.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.370
Another word for growling “tummy” sounds
is “borborygmi”.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.609
(Fact 484)

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:26.609
9.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:38.760
Opiorphin is a chemical in human saliva that,
according to Dr. C Rougeot et al in a 2010

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.239
study, is 6 times more potent than morphine,
gram for gram.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.609
(QF 509)
