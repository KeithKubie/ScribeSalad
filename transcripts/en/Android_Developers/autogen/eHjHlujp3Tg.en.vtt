functionality take advantage of but you

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470
functionality take advantage of but you

older platforms are going to take a few
 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.900
older platforms are going to take a few
years before they go away so you have to

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910
years before they go away so you have to
 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.000
years before they go away so you have to
do this trade-off is it worth putting in

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010
do this trade-off is it worth putting in
 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.620

backwards compatible and you're gonna
 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.310
backwards compatible and you're gonna
have to maintain that code potentially

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.320
have to maintain that code potentially
 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.440
have to maintain that code potentially
for years so when do you do that

changed but a lot of it you can still do

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:13.819
changed but a lot of it you can still do
 

00:10:13.819 --> 00:10:16.809
changed but a lot of it you can still do
and that's actually kind of a theme for

right you write your Android code in

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:42.619
right you write your Android code in
 

00:10:42.619 --> 00:10:46.269
right you write your Android code in
Java language syntax and all of the

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279

application components are basically the
 

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:50.949
application components are basically the
same we use the same core components

00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959
same we use the same core components
 

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:52.569
same we use the same core components
they interact the same way they achieve

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:52.579
they interact the same way they achieve
 

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:55.269
they interact the same way they achieve
the same end results and that's

00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279
the same end results and that's
 

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.409
the same end results and that's
something we've been able to rely on

00:10:56.409 --> 00:10:56.419
something we've been able to rely on
 

00:10:56.419 --> 00:11:01.029

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:07.429
first-class language for Android
 

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:08.799
first-class language for Android
development and that's actually what

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:08.809
development and that's actually what
 

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:11.349
development and that's actually what
we're encouraging people to use as their

00:11:11.349 --> 00:11:11.359
we're encouraging people to use as their
 

00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:13.529
we're encouraging people to use as their
primary development language for Android

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:13.539
primary development language for Android
 

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:16.359
primary development language for Android
we saw the introduction of Android

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:16.369
we saw the introduction of Android
 

00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:18.069
we saw the introduction of Android
architecture components which introduced

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079
architecture components which introduced
 

00:11:18.079 --> 00:11:19.899
architecture components which introduced
view models live data and the room

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:19.909
view models live data and the room
 

00:11:19.909 --> 00:11:22.029
view models live data and the room
database to significantly simplify the

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:22.039
database to significantly simplify the
 

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:24.249
database to significantly simplify the
way that we manage data and have it

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:24.259
way that we manage data and have it
 

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:26.079
way that we manage data and have it
interact properly with the activity

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:26.089
interact properly with the activity
 

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.379
interact properly with the activity
lifecycle we also have the job scheduler

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:29.389
lifecycle we also have the job scheduler
 

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:32.679
lifecycle we also have the job scheduler
which almost entirely eliminates the

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:32.689
which almost entirely eliminates the
 

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:34.529
which almost entirely eliminates the
need to create your own custom

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:34.539
need to create your own custom
 

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:37.389
need to create your own custom
background services and the intent

00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399
background services and the intent
 

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.039
background services and the intent
receivers that we sometimes set up to

00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:39.049
receivers that we sometimes set up to
 

00:11:39.049 --> 00:11:41.590
receivers that we sometimes set up to
monitor device state to control when our

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600
monitor device state to control when our
 

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.049
monitor device state to control when our
services are run which is a good thing

00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:44.059
services are run which is a good thing
 

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:46.690
services are run which is a good thing
because in Android oh we actually

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.700
because in Android oh we actually
 

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.520
because in Android oh we actually
the ability to have long-running

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:48.530
the ability to have long-running
 

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.470
the ability to have long-running
background services when your app is in

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480
background services when your app is in
 

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.480
background services when your app is in
the background as well and at the same

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:52.490
the background as well and at the same
 

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.040
the background as well and at the same
time most of the intent receives that

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.050
time most of the intent receives that
 

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.300
time most of the intent receives that
you may have used to monitor device

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.310
you may have used to monitor device
 

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.320
you may have used to monitor device
State have also largely been deprecated

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.330
State have also largely been deprecated
 

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.790
State have also largely been deprecated
now the good thing of course things move

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800
now the good thing of course things move
 

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.950
now the good thing of course things move
quickly job scheduler already deprecated

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:02.960
quickly job scheduler already deprecated
 

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.320
quickly job scheduler already deprecated
as of yesterday morning so now we have

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.330
as of yesterday morning so now we have
 

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.420

work manager which is nice because it

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:10.430
work manager which is nice because it
 

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.310
work manager which is nice because it
does the same stuff as job scheduler but

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320
does the same stuff as job scheduler but
 

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.870
does the same stuff as job scheduler but
it's backwards compatible right so

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880
it's backwards compatible right so
 

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.920
it's backwards compatible right so
you're starting to see some of the

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:14.930
you're starting to see some of the
 

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.050
you're starting to see some of the
trends of what we're trying to achieve

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:17.060
trends of what we're trying to achieve
 

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.440
trends of what we're trying to achieve
here so we should dig into some of this

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.450
here so we should dig into some of this
 

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.930
here so we should dig into some of this
stuff in a little bit more detail it's

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:22.940
stuff in a little bit more detail it's
 

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.160
stuff in a little bit more detail it's
something which I've talked about it

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.170
something which I've talked about it
 

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.990
something which I've talked about it
most of these pro tip sessions was the

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000
most of these pro tip sessions was the
 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.970
most of these pro tip sessions was the
first thing I talked about and comes up

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:27.980
first thing I talked about and comes up
 

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.330
first thing I talked about and comes up
every year I like to to focus on what's

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:31.340
every year I like to to focus on what's
 

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.860
every year I like to to focus on what's
happening what's happening in the

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:32.870
happening what's happening in the
 

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:38.260
happening what's happening in the
background sometimes it's easy to miss

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:38.270
background sometimes it's easy to miss
 

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.530
background sometimes it's easy to miss
until you really focus on it so the

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:41.540
until you really focus on it so the
 

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.390
until you really focus on it so the
first pro tip I gave back in 20 2010

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:45.400
first pro tip I gave back in 20 2010
 

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.680
first pro tip I gave back in 20 2010
first session first Android session

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:47.690
first session first Android session
 

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.420
first session first Android session
first real session on a big stage is

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.430
first real session on a big stage is
 

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.520
first real session on a big stage is
very exciting and this is the first pro

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:51.530
very exciting and this is the first pro
 

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.170
very exciting and this is the first pro
tip so I thought let's have a look at

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.180
tip so I thought let's have a look at
 

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.670
tip so I thought let's have a look at
what I said and see how well it holds up

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:54.680
what I said and see how well it holds up
 

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.860
what I said and see how well it holds up
so this is this is the first thing I

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:56.870
so this is this is the first thing I
 

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.030
so this is this is the first thing I
ever anything which can in any way take

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040
ever anything which can in any way take
 

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.860
ever anything which can in any way take
longer than just a fraction of a second

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:02.870
longer than just a fraction of a second
 

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.810
longer than just a fraction of a second
and interrupt the UI flow do you move it

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:04.820
and interrupt the UI flow do you move it
 

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.790
and interrupt the UI flow do you move it
into a background threat so there's a

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800
into a background threat so there's a
 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.290
into a background threat so there's a
number of ways you can do that the most

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:08.300
number of ways you can do that the most
 

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.210
number of ways you can do that the most
simple and straightforward is of course

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:10.220
simple and straightforward is of course
 

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.070
simple and straightforward is of course
just to use Java threading what we've

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.080
just to use Java threading what we've
 

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.290
just to use Java threading what we've
created in Android is a class called

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:14.300
created in Android is a class called
 

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:22.270
created in Android is a class called
async task

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.280
 
 

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.710
 
yeah you know what they say the giant

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720
yeah you know what they say the giant
 

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.280
yeah you know what they say the giant
screen actually removes 20 pounds so

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.290
screen actually removes 20 pounds so
 

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.740
screen actually removes 20 pounds so
it's kind of Shirin right like kind of

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:33.750
it's kind of Shirin right like kind of
 

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.030
it's kind of Shirin right like kind of
like we don't want to block the UI

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040
like we don't want to block the UI
 

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.920
like we don't want to block the UI
thread what the context around what I

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:36.930
thread what the context around what I
 

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.330
thread what the context around what I
was talking about was trying to

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:38.340
was talking about was trying to
 

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.130
was talking about was trying to
eliminate these application not

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:40.140
eliminate these application not
 

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.470
eliminate these application not
responding dialogues which have evolved

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480
responding dialogues which have evolved
 

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.150
responding dialogues which have evolved
over the years they look a little bit

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160
over the years they look a little bit
 

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.130
over the years they look a little bit
different now they used to be very

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.140
different now they used to be very
 

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.230
different now they used to be very
common because it was easy to block the

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240
common because it was easy to block the
 

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.150
common because it was easy to block the
foreground thread right if you tried to

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160
foreground thread right if you tried to
 

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.430
foreground thread right if you tried to
do a data transfer for example it would

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440
do a data transfer for example it would
 

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.860
do a data transfer for example it would
block and that would be a bad experience

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:54.870
block and that would be a bad experience
 

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.440
block and that would be a bad experience
and so for Android 3.0 we introduced a

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.450
and so for Android 3.0 we introduced a
 

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.820
and so for Android 3.0 we introduced a
runtime exception so if you tried to

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:58.830
runtime exception so if you tried to
 

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.130
runtime exception so if you tried to
access the internet through a runtime

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:01.140
access the internet through a runtime
 

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.320
access the internet through a runtime
exception the app would crash strong

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.330
exception the app would crash strong
 

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.180
exception the app would crash strong
encouragement for developers to not do

encouragement for developers to not do
 

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.980
encouragement for developers to not do
that more recently we've done similar

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:06.990
that more recently we've done similar
 

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.510
that more recently we've done similar
things with filesystem access with

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:08.520
things with filesystem access with
 

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.510
things with filesystem access with
database access as well now in Android

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:11.520
database access as well now in Android
 

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.060
database access as well now in Android
pee this is no longer a problem because

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.070
pee this is no longer a problem because
 

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.460
pee this is no longer a problem because
we don't show an out dialogues we just

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:16.470
we don't show an out dialogues we just
 

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.820
we don't show an out dialogues we just
crash the app so that's not a better

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.830
crash the app so that's not a better
 

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.470
crash the app so that's not a better
outcome for your users but it's a much

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480
outcome for your users but it's a much
 

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.540
outcome for your users but it's a much
stronger signal to us as developers that

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.550
stronger signal to us as developers that
 

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.070
stronger signal to us as developers that
we need to make sure that we're taking

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.080
we need to make sure that we're taking
 

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.920
we need to make sure that we're taking
care of this particular problem now I

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:27.930
care of this particular problem now I
 

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.900
care of this particular problem now I
did mention one solution and it got some

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:29.910
did mention one solution and it got some
 

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.700
did mention one solution and it got some
got some love the old async task it's a

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:34.710
got some love the old async task it's a
 

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.950
got some love the old async task it's a
reasonable solution to the stated

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:36.960
reasonable solution to the stated

back off the foreground onto a
 

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.540
back off the foreground onto a
background thread and that's what async

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:41.550
background thread and that's what async
 

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.130

probably an intent service and that goes

an activity uses a service to then
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.750
an activity uses a service to then
download data from a server say it's a

download data from a server say it's a
 

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.970
download data from a server say it's a
nice time-consuming operation and then

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:29.980
nice time-consuming operation and then
 

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.950
nice time-consuming operation and then
that saves it to a database and then

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960
that saves it to a database and then
 

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.510
that saves it to a database and then
your activity just monitors the database

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520
your activity just monitors the database
 

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.220
your activity just monitors the database
so it's kind of a one-way flow which is

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.230
so it's kind of a one-way flow which is
 

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.590
so it's kind of a one-way flow which is
nice but there is a catch there's

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600
nice but there is a catch there's
 

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.830
nice but there is a catch there's
there's always a catch and the catch is

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840
there's always a catch and the catch is
 

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.320
there's always a catch and the catch is
that this is not an efficient way to use

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:43.330
that this is not an efficient way to use

20:12 I'm not going to go into too much

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:46.610
20:12 I'm not going to go into too much
 

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.340
20:12 I'm not going to go into too much
detail but I had this whole spiel about

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.350
detail but I had this whole spiel about
 

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.890
detail but I had this whole spiel about
how the cell radio works and every time

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:50.900
how the cell radio works and every time
 

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.020
how the cell radio works and every time
you do a transfer turns on the radio it

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:53.030
you do a transfer turns on the radio it
 

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.060
you do a transfer turns on the radio it
stays in a standby state which draws

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.070
stays in a standby state which draws
 

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.160
stays in a standby state which draws
more power and the goal is that it

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.170
more power and the goal is that it
 

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.440
more power and the goal is that it
reduces latency for future transfers

00:17:59.440 --> 00:17:59.450
reduces latency for future transfers
 

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.110
reduces latency for future transfers
that's all great and the reason it's

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120
that's all great and the reason it's
 

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.360
that's all great and the reason it's
important for us to know is that if

callbacks to create a new cursor and
 

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.990
callbacks to create a new cursor and
then to receive the results so that you

simple to create you start with a
property that stores the data that you

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720
property that stores the data that you
 

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.149
property that stores the data that you
want to expose in this case we're using

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159
want to expose in this case we're using
 

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:06.669
want to expose in this case we're using

a mutable live data that's why data is
 

00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:09.430
a mutable live data that's why data is
cool and then you expose a method which

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440
cool and then you expose a method which
 

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.380
cool and then you expose a method which
is going to return that property and so

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.390
is going to return that property and so
 

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:12.730
is going to return that property and so
the first time it's going to populate

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:12.740
the first time it's going to populate
 

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.220
the first time it's going to populate
that property and then from then on it

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.230
that property and then from then on it
 

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:20.419
that property and then from then on it
will return that cached version

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:22.399
 
then you have a method which does that

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:22.409
then you have a method which does that
 

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.749
then you have a method which does that
population and again this is done

00:28:23.749 --> 00:28:23.759

not what you're using in your UI so
you'll need to create a class to

comes into its own so as it's part of

00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:20.769
comes into its own so as it's part of
 

00:32:20.769 --> 00:32:22.529
comes into its own so as it's part of
Android architecture components now part

00:32:22.529 --> 00:32:22.539
Android architecture components now part
 

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:24.509
Android architecture components now part
of jetpack and all you need to do is you

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519
of jetpack and all you need to do is you
 

00:32:24.519 --> 00:32:26.249
of jetpack and all you need to do is you
start with the class definition right

00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:26.259
start with the class definition right
 

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:29.279
start with the class definition right
defines the columns that you want within

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:29.289
defines the columns that you want within
 

00:32:29.289 --> 00:32:31.139
defines the columns that you want within
your class and you just add an

00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:31.149
your class and you just add an
 

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.820
your class and you just add an
annotation to say this is an entity that

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:32.830
annotation to say this is an entity that
 

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.549
annotation to say this is an entity that
I want to use in a database and this is

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559
I want to use in a database and this is
 

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:39.090
I want to use in a database and this is
the primary key for this table then you

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:39.100
the primary key for this table then you
 

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.190
the primary key for this table then you
create a new room database which

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200
create a new room database which
 

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.529
create a new room database which
includes each of the tables that you

00:32:43.529 --> 00:32:43.539
includes each of the tables that you
 

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:45.299
includes each of the tables that you
want to have within that database and

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:45.309
want to have within that database and
 

00:32:45.309 --> 00:32:47.049
want to have within that database and
you return an instance of the

00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:47.059
you return an instance of the
 

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:50.649
you return an instance of the
data access object and that is the class

00:32:50.649 --> 00:32:50.659
data access object and that is the class
 

00:32:50.659 --> 00:32:52.119
data access object and that is the class
where you specify all of your database

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:52.129
where you specify all of your database
 

00:32:52.129 --> 00:32:53.470
where you specify all of your database
interactions your inserts deletes

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480
interactions your inserts deletes
 

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.440
interactions your inserts deletes
updates and your queries as many of them

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:56.450
updates and your queries as many of them
 

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.789
updates and your queries as many of them
as you want in as many different styles

00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799
as you want in as many different styles
 

00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:59.980
as you want in as many different styles
as you want now you'll notice that the

00:32:59.980 --> 00:32:59.990
as you want now you'll notice that the
 

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.259
as you want now you'll notice that the
the queries here return live data and

00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:02.269
the queries here return live data and
 

00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:04.060
the queries here return live data and
that's really cool because if you're

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:04.070
that's really cool because if you're
 

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.399
that's really cool because if you're
storing your UI data in your view model

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:06.409
storing your UI data in your view model
 

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:08.320
storing your UI data in your view model
which obviously you are cuz that's the

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:08.330
which obviously you are cuz that's the
 

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.149
which obviously you are cuz that's the
right way to do things now it actually

00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159
right way to do things now it actually
 

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:11.830
right way to do things now it actually
simplifies that new view model

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840
simplifies that new view model
 

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.320
simplifies that new view model
significantly you just request access to

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:14.330
significantly you just request access to
 

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.799
significantly you just request access to
the room databases access object execute

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:17.809
the room databases access object execute
 

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:20.680
the room databases access object execute
the query which returns live data itself

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:20.690
the query which returns live data itself
 

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.810
the query which returns live data itself
then you just pass that live data rate

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:22.820
then you just pass that live data rate
 

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.430
then you just pass that live data rate
right back through to any activity or

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440
right back through to any activity or
 

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.799
right back through to any activity or
fragment which requests it back in the

00:33:26.799 --> 00:33:26.809
fragment which requests it back in the
 

00:33:26.809 --> 00:33:28.450
fragment which requests it back in the
activity it works the same way you've

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:28.460
activity it works the same way you've
 

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.759
activity it works the same way you've
got the same observe handler getting the

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:30.769
got the same observe handler getting the
 

00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:34.149
got the same observe handler getting the
same live data representing a collection

00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159
same live data representing a collection
 

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:35.710
same live data representing a collection
of objects and you can use that to

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720
of objects and you can use that to
 

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.389
of objects and you can use that to
update the UI whenever the underlying

00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399
update the UI whenever the underlying
 

00:33:37.399 --> 00:33:39.909
update the UI whenever the underlying
database changes so you've got the same

00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919
database changes so you've got the same
 

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.919
database changes so you've got the same
outcome that you did before but ten

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:41.929
outcome that you did before but ten
 

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:44.560
outcome that you did before but ten
times less boilerplate code ten times

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:44.570
times less boilerplate code ten times
 

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.299
times less boilerplate code ten times
less code that you have to maintain and

00:33:46.299 --> 00:33:46.309
less code that you have to maintain and
 

00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:47.739
less code that you have to maintain and
alter if you change a column name

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:47.749
alter if you change a column name
 

00:33:47.749 --> 00:33:50.019
alter if you change a column name
beforehand it was a lot of places that

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:50.029
beforehand it was a lot of places that
 

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:51.970
beforehand it was a lot of places that
could go wrong now you just modify the

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:51.980
could go wrong now you just modify the
 

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.320
could go wrong now you just modify the
class now if you combine that with the

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:56.330
class now if you combine that with the
 

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.149
class now if you combine that with the
work manager you actually get a really

00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159
work manager you actually get a really
 

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:01.720
work manager you actually get a really
clean solution to this whole process

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:01.730
clean solution to this whole process
 

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.299
clean solution to this whole process
right the work manager downloads data

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:04.309
right the work manager downloads data
 

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.549
right the work manager downloads data
from a server it updates the room

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559
from a server it updates the room
 

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:08.859
from a server it updates the room
database accordingly which then sends

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:08.869
database accordingly which then sends
 

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:10.540
database accordingly which then sends
the live data to the view model within

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:10.550
the live data to the view model within
 

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.609
the live data to the view model within
the activity and fragment or fragment

00:34:12.609 --> 00:34:12.619
the activity and fragment or fragment
 

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:14.440
the activity and fragment or fragment
that you want to use which then by the

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:14.450
that you want to use which then by the
 

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:17.349
that you want to use which then by the
observe handler updates the UI right so

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359
observe handler updates the UI right so
 

00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:19.659
observe handler updates the UI right so
if you're not one of the lucky folks who

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:19.669
if you're not one of the lucky folks who
 

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:21.040
if you're not one of the lucky folks who
are still getting paid by line of code

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.050
are still getting paid by line of code
 

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.629
are still getting paid by line of code
this is probably a better solution

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639
this is probably a better solution
 

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.940
this is probably a better solution
so speaking of better solutions what

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:27.950
so speaking of better solutions what
 

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.260
so speaking of better solutions what
else have we got I wanted to talk a

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:29.270
else have we got I wanted to talk a
 

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.609
else have we got I wanted to talk a
little bit about Android location

00:34:30.609 --> 00:34:30.619
little bit about Android location
 

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:32.440
little bit about Android location
services because this is again the topic

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:32.450
services because this is again the topic
 

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.839
services because this is again the topic
that I spent a lot of time talking about

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:36.849
 
 

00:34:36.849 --> 00:34:39.280
 
being able to find the current position

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:39.290
being able to find the current position
 

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.069
being able to find the current position
and put it on a map somewhere is

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079
and put it on a map somewhere is
 

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.659
and put it on a map somewhere is
something that's been part of Android

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:43.669
something that's been part of Android
 

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:47.770
something that's been part of Android
since the very first beta SDK and so by

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:47.780
since the very first beta SDK and so by
 

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.010
since the very first beta SDK and so by
2011 I'd actually managed to amass quite

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:51.020
2011 I'd actually managed to amass quite
 

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.809
2011 I'd actually managed to amass quite

most efficient and effective way
possible it was a big topic in a couple

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:58.940
possible it was a big topic in a couple
 

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.500
possible it was a big topic in a couple
of my android protips

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:00.510
of my android protips
 

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:03.800
of my android protips
talks so I went to the location team

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:03.810
talks so I went to the location team
 

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.170
talks so I went to the location team
said I've built a project which

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180
said I've built a project which
 

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.820
said I've built a project which
encapsulate all of our best practices

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:07.830
encapsulate all of our best practices

encapsulate all of our best practices
all of the things which we tell people

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:09.570
all of the things which we tell people
 

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.230
all of the things which we tell people
to do and it's fair to say that they

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240
to do and it's fair to say that they
 

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.230
to do and it's fair to say that they
were impressed by which I mean it really

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240
were impressed by which I mean it really
 

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.770
were impressed by which I mean it really
left an impression they they then went

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780
left an impression they they then went
 

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.720
left an impression they they then went
away and did what they do which is fixed

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:20.730
away and did what they do which is fixed
 

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:21.440
away and did what they do which is fixed
everything

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:21.450
everything

these classes and interfaces they went
 

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.870
these classes and interfaces they went
away and gave me an API as part of the
