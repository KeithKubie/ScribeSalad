00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020
Let me the explain the reasoning 
that I use when I look at a new layout.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.930
It looks like there's two 
equally spaced columns here.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.780
That signals to me, that
we need LinearLayout weights,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.050
where each of these have equal weights.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.370
So let's create 
a horizontal LinearLayout.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.583
Within this first child, we have 
three vertically stacked text views,

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.240
so we have a vertical LinearLayout, 
and the same goes for this second child,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.030
which has two elements vertically 
stacked on top of each other

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.530
which means we use 
a vertical LinearLayout as well.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.590
And here's the code, we created a new
list_item_forecasts_today.xml file

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.259
under the layout folder.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.120
The code looks very similar
to list_item_forecast.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.760
It has a horizontal LinearLayout, 
as a root element.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.510
The first child is a vertical LinearLayout

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.970
with width zero and a weight of one.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.386
The second child is another 
vertical LinearLayout

00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.622
with a width of zero and a weight of one,

00:00:47.622 --> 00:00:50.240
that way the horizontal space
will be distributed evenly

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.640
among each child.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.736
If you go back to the first LinearLayout,

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:56.060
notice that we have 
three TextViews within it,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.980
for date, high temperature, 
and low temperature.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.240
We specify gravity 
to be center horizontal,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.260
so anything within the LinearLayout 
will be centered horizontally.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.440
Otherwise, by default, they would be 
left-aligned to the LinearLayout.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.990
The same applies for the 
second LinearLayout.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.360
We specify gravity to be 
center horizontal so that the icon

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.700
and the weather forecast TextView 
within it are also centered horizontally.
