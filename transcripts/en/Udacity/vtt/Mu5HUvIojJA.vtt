00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now that you know about Boolean formulas,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so what is the SAT problem?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The SAT problem has as an input a Boolean formula with N variables,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I'm usually going to write them as X1, X2, and so on until you get to Xn,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the output or question since SAT is a decision problem is the following:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the question is, can you set the variables

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
X1 to Xn to a combination of true or false so

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that the whole formula that you're given in the input becomes true?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the answer to that can, of course, only be yes or no,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so again, SAT is a decision problem.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So for example, if we're given a very simple Boolean formula such X1 and X2,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then the answer to SAT would be yes

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because you could set X1 to true and X2 to true,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and then the whole formula would also evaluate to true

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because you have 1 and 1,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which is true or 1.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's do a little bit more challenging example.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you had a Boolean formula such as this,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
x1 and X2 or 1 and not X1 or X2,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and what you can also see here is that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you do not always have to put brackets around each or to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
signify in which order you evaluate the individual ones,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
so it's okay to write 2 or 3 or 4 or's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or 2 or 3 or 4 and's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or even more if you want to

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
without doing those brackets.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It really doesn't make a difference in the way that the formula evaluates.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But let's come back to SAT.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So does this Boolean formula here have a satisfying assignment,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
meaning can you set the variables to a combination of true and false

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so that the whole formula becomes true, and here the answer is again yes.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
X1, unfortunately, doesn't really help here.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So if you set X1 to true for example, this would also be true.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And here you have not X1, so X1 and not X1, that would evaluate to 0.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
If you set X1 to 0, then you have it the other way around,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then let's set X2 to 1 because then this whole thing here is 1,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
this stays at 0 no matter what we do,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and this one also goes to 1,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and then you have 1 or 0 or 1 so there's at least one 1 in here,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and so the whole thing evaluates to 1,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and the formula can be satisfied.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So now let's see if you can figure out an even more challenging example yourself.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So here's our Boolean formula,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
X1 or X3 and X1 and X2 or not X3,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the formula continues here,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
not X2 or not X3 and not X1 or not X2,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and I'm going reveal to you that this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
formula indeed has an assignment of true and false

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to the variables X1, X2, and X3

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so that the whole formula is satisfied,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
meaning it evaluates to true.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What I want to know from you is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
how I have to set the variables to do this.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So if I should set X1 to false, please check here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If I should set it to 2, please check here,

00:03:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the same thing for the variables X2 and X3, please.
