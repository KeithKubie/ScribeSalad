[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.480
SPEAKER: Today we're
extremely thrilled to have

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.830
Ted Slingerland here.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.410
He's a professor, a
member of the faculty

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.830
at the University of British
Columbia up in Vancouver.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.480
And his specialty is a study of
philosophy and Chinese thought.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.670
He's a professor of
East Asian Studies

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.550
and he also held a
fellowship with the Centers

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.520
for the Advanced Study at
the Behavioral Sciences

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.180
at Stanford.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.820
And this is, in fact, our
third in an ongoing series

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.450
of talks with members
and Fellows from CASBAS.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.100
Without further ado, please join
me in welcoming Ted to Google.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.600
Thank you.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.584
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:43.440
TED SLINGERLAND:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.540
To get a sense of the topic of
this talk, "Trying Not to Try,"

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.474
the best way to get a
feel for this paradox

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:51.890
that I'm going to
be talking about

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.740
is actually a game at
my local science museum

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.180
called Mind Ball.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.840
So the set up is pretty simple.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.310
You have two players at
either end of the table.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.810
There's a little metal
ball between them.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.639
And the goal is just
to push the metal ball

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:05.930
to the other side of the table.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.513
It gets there.

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:08.330
A buzzer goes off, and you win.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.860
So a very simple setup.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.440
The twist is that you're
not using your hands.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.490
You're using your mind.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.945
So I have my head against
an EEG monitor there.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:19.070
And what that's picking up
is alpha and beta waves.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.090
So alpha and beta
waves are the activity

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.050
your brain kicks off when it's
in a rest state, when it's

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.990
relaxed, when it's not trying.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.590
The way the game is constructed
is the more alpha and beta

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.190
waves you produce, the more
force you exert on the ball.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.740
So the more you relax, the
harder you push the ball.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.250
So the way to win at mind
ball is to not try to win.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.890
You have to actually
out relax your opponent,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.870
and it's incredibly
difficult to do.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.217
The first time I played
I thought I'd do--

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:48.800
I'm a professor of
Chinese philosophy.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.820
I'll do some Zen thing.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.220
I'll be fine.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.370
And I had my eyes closed.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.210
And I could hear--

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.460
it makes a noise when the
ball moves back and forward.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.480
It goes, eeh, eeh.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.890
And finally, I couldn't resist.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.670
I opened my eyes.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.507
And I was winning.

00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:01.590
The ball was almost at the
other end of the table.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.960
And I thought, oh, I'm winning.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.190
And as soon as I
thought that, the ball

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.470
turned around and started
rolling back toward me.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.300
And I started going,
relax, relax, Zen, Zen.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.180
And it didn't work.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.530
So I got crushed by the
person I was playing against.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250
It's challenging.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.950
What I like about the
game is that it compresses

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
into the smallest possible
space this paradox of how you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.400
can force yourself to not try.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.470
How can you try
to relax when you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.440
know that the key to
succeeding is relaxation?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.240
How do you use
your conscious mind

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.917
to shut your
conscious mind down?

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.750
So it's really-- it's
a great way of getting

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.550
a sense of the paradox.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.420
Now, this tension,
this mind ball problem,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.170
is something that you
see throughout life.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.740
In certain sub-communities in
our culture are aware of this.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.936
So athletes know that
they're at their best when

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.685
they're in the zone,
when they're relaxed.

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:51.350
They're not thinking
about what they're doing.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.790
They're just playing their game.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.770
And they worry a lot about
falling out of the zone.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.228
Because once you fall out, it's
like the mind ball problem.

00:02:57.228 --> 00:02:59.960
It's very hard to get
yourself back in again.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.290
Performers-- so people,
musicians, actors--

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.470
are also very aware of this.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.920
They know they're at their
best when they're absorbed.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.211
They're not thinking too much
about what they're doing.

00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.420
And they also worry very
much about the choking,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.520
about falling out of the zone.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.650
So there are certain
sub-communities

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.500
who are aware of this,
the power of spontaneity

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.189
and the problems involved
with being spontaneous.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.730
But what we don't
recognize, I think,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.640
as widely is that this is a
tension we all experience.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.560
Even if we're not
athletes or performers,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.380
we experience this tension
on a regular basis.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.270
So a good example is insomnia.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.520
So you have an important
meeting the next day.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.130
You know that you need
to be well-rested.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.870
You know that you're tired.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.700
If you could just
shut your mind down,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.060
you know you would fall asleep.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.640
But how do you shut
your mind down?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.370
How do you use your mind
to shut your mind down?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.730
You think about social
situations, so a job interview

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.410
or a first date.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.181
The best advice you
can get is relax.

00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:55.430
People say that to you, right?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.750
Relax, be yourself.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.640
But how are you going to
relax if faced by this, right?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.290
And in a situation that is
objectively not relaxing,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.720
how do you force yourself
to relax when you need to?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.150
This is the mind ball
problem, or the paradox

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.680
of trying not to try.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.500
So you see it
throughout daily life.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.210
We run into it all the time.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.990
We don't tend to talk
about it very much.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.390
So we don't have--

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.129
athletes have some words
for it, like the zone.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.670
But we don't tend to talk about
this very much, which is odd.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.310
And I think it's partly
because our culture tends

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.750
to focus a lot more on things
like working and trying

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.130
and striving.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.760
So our culture focuses on
the opposite of spontaneity,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.360
on effort.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.930
So we send our preschoolers
to Kumon schools

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.350
so they can cram and get into
the best elementary schools

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.820
and get into the
best high schools.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.070
So they can pop Ritalin and
get into the best colleges.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.970
And then they're going to be
us, constantly multitasking,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.840
constantly on 20
devices at once,

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.470
never shutting down the
flow of information.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.860
And even the bedroom
is no refuge anymore.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.950
Most people fall asleep tightly
clutching their smartphones,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.610
sending off that last tweet.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.080
So we're constantly striving.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.580
We're constantly trying.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.060
We get very little downtime,
I think, in our daily lives.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.010
And technology's just
making this worse.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.260
We used to have downtime
built into our lives,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.150
and now we don't anymore.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.210
Now, this would all maybe
be OK if it were the case

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.280
that striving always worked.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.400
So if it were the case that
all important goals in life

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.190
were things that we could
acquire through striving.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.100
Maybe this is just our fate
to be like Sisyphus, always

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.160
pushing this stone
up the mountain.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.300
The problem with that
is that that's not true.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.710
So there are a lot of very
important goals in life that

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.560
cannot be attained
through direct striving.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.370
You can't pursue them directly.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.130
So for instance, charisma--

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.450
if you're trying to be 007,
you're not going to be 007.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.550
You've got to pull it
off that way, right?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.560
Creativity--
artistic creativity,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.180
intellectual creativity--

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.340
is notoriously something
that you can't force.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.510
It's got to come to you.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.500
It's got to come spontaneously.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.610
Something like love of
learning or love in general

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.140
is not something you
can force on a kid.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.450
It's got to come from within.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.550
We have a sense that
things like love

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.010
have to spontaneously
arise from within somebody.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.730
You can't try to do it.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.880
And if you try to do it,
you're going to ruin it.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.360
Same thing with things
like fun or happiness.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.309
If you pursue it
directly, you crush it.

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.100
We've all been at these
parties where hosts

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.270
have been saying, have fun.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.320
Let's have fun.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.140
Those are always the
worst parties, right?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.970
If you're trying to have fun,
you're not going to have fun.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.380
So there are a lot of
these goals that just can't

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.600
be obtained through striving.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.470
So striving is actually
counterproductive

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.260
in these cases.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.040
Why do we not realize this?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.820
And why do we not have language
for the opposite of striving?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.700
We don't tend to have good
words for these things.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.580
I think it's partly the result
of a philosophical hangover.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.550
So we are very much the heirs
of Enlightenment thought,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.520
people like Emmanuel
Kant, Rene Descartes,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.980
who have bequeathed
to us what I'm going

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.200
to call the disembodied myth.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.580
So this is this picture that
what we are fundamentally

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.770
is minds, disembodied minds.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.780
So we have bodies, but
bodies are just there

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.950
to kind of carry us around,
get energy to our minds.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.560
But what we are is
fundamentally minds.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.450
And so that means
the way we obtain

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.240
anything worthwhile in this
myth is through rationality,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.470
so using amodal rationality
to think, reason, our way

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.210
through dilemmas
or to pursue goals.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.360
Self-control-- so the mind
needs to control the body.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.990
The body has got some
potentially dangerous impulses

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.850
that have to be
brought under control.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.780
And it's all about
conscious effort.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.170
So anything worthwhile
in this model

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.810
is obtained through conscious
effort in these three things.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.760
Now, the reason I call this the
myth, disembodied myth, is it's

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.370
pretty clear that this is
not accurate from a cognitive

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.220
scientific perspective.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.230
So the so-called embodied
cognition movement in cognitive

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.120
science has been arguing
for a long time--

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.710
there's fairly good consensus--

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.814
that we're not brains in a vat.

00:07:59.814 --> 00:08:00.980
We're not disembodied minds.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.610
We're embodied.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.610
The way in we think
is inextricably

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.440
tied up with our embodiment.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.930
So that means that we
think in metaphors.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.430
We think in images.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.140
And these are not
just turns of phrase.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.870
We actually really are
thinking in imagistic terms.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.130
We think with our body.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.230
A lot of our knowledge is tacit.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.970
A lot of our most
important knowledge

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.310
is not something
explicit or conscious.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.950
It's something that we've
built into our body,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.990
our bodily knowledge,
essentially.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.680
And this whole body-mind
complex that we are

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.470
was designed by evolution
for doing things,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.049
for moving through the
world in an effective way,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.612
not for thinking, not
for abstract thinking.

00:08:38.612 --> 00:08:40.070
We're capable of
abstract thinking.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.140
But it's not really
what we're built for.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.210
So we are integrated
mind-body systems.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.560
Now, given that, where did the
disembodied myth come from?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.090
So why did it arise?

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.440
Why is it appealing to people?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.800
It must have some appeal because
it's lasted for a long time.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.780
The source of the
disembodied myth,

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.230
despite our embodied
nature, is this experience

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.240
we do have of being split.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.780
So we often experience a kind
of tension within ourselves.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.820
We say things like, I
had to drag myself out

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.770
of bed this morning.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.760
Who's dragging whom, right?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.010
There's only one person there.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.718
Who's in the bed?

00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:14.840
Who's doing the dragging?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.700
I had to hold my tongue.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.650
Who are you if not your tongue?

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.570
Who's holding what?

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.370
It's just a very
strange way to talk.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.870
It seems like metaphors.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.730
But it's not
metaphorical in the sense

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.240
that it's reflecting
this tension we feel

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.040
between parts of ourselves.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.900
And what I want
to submit is what

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.450
we're feeling when
we feel that tension

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.630
is a tension between two basic
cognitive systems we have.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.300
So we are integrated
body-mind systems.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.880
But we have two basic
modes of cognition.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.120
And social psychologists,
cognitive scientists

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.590
have different
terms for this-- hot

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.000
versus cold, system one, system
two, bottom up, top down.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.340
Everybody has their own
favorite terminology,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.494
But basically
they're integrated.

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:58.910
They're designed
to work together.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.960
But they are distinct.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.760
And they're neuro
anatomically distinct.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.860
You can knock one out and
preserve the other one.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.900
So they do seem to
be different systems.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.780
The hot system, system
one, is emotional.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.130
It's fast.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.090
It's frugal.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.140
It's automatic.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.340
And it's mostly unconscious.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.830
So we don't have
typically conscious access

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.530
to hot or system-one cognition.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.250
System two, or cold
cognition, is non-emotional.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.360
It's slower.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.990
It's under executive control.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.690
So it's what allows
us to kind of stop

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.629
something that's happening and
choose another thing to do,

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:30.420
and it's conscious.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.810
So this is the seat of
our conscious awareness

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.870
of ourselves and also
the conscious narrative

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.140
we tell about ourselves that
help us understand who we are

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.914
and why we're doing
what we're doing.

00:10:40.914 --> 00:10:42.330
So I think what
we're feeling when

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.060
we feel this kind of
tension is essentially

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.391
the body-mind dualism.

00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:48.390
This idea that there's a
tension between the two

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.190
falls out of the two-system
nature of our minds.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.250
We tend to associate
with system two.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.000
That's us.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.950
So when we have to
drag ourselves out

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.014
of bed in the morning,
it's system two

00:10:58.014 --> 00:10:59.930
that knows we have an
important meeting that's

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.940
struggling with system one,
the bodily systems that

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.690
want to stay asleep, that
are enjoying being asleep.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.400
So this explains why
this tension arises,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.860
why it seems intuitive to us.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.430
It also, I think, explains
why trying not to try

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.250
is a real paradox.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.680
When I see that metal ball
rolling back toward me

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.260
and I say, stop
thinking, relax, the part

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.360
of my mind that
I'm using is a part

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.190
that needs to be shut down.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.960
The part of mind
that you're accessing

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.710
when you are consciously trying
to relax or stop thinking,

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.800
you're activating the very thing
that you need to deactivate.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.680
So the two-system
model of the mind

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.140
explains why the paradox
is a real paradox.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.900
It is a genuine
cognitive paradox.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.092
You need to get around
it somehow indirectly.

00:11:46.092 --> 00:11:47.550
Now, that said it's
a real paradox.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.300
We do need to get
around it somehow.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.620
Because if we want to access
the power of our hot systems,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.200
our embodied cognition,
we need to figure out

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.500
ways to get around this
paradox of trying not to try.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.880
And this is where I find
early Chinese philosophy,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.760
my basic specialty,
very helpful.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.820
Because what I sometimes
call the mainstream thinkers

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.460
in early China-- the
Taoists and Confusions--

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.670
actually embraced an
embodied model of the self.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.950
So they didn't see us
as split fundamentally

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.325
between body and mind in
some really strong way.

00:12:16.325 --> 00:12:17.700
And they realized
that you needed

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.820
to cultivate bodily types
of emotions and intuitions

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.010
if you're going to produce
an excellent person, somebody

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.370
who's going to be
successful in the world.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.230
Because they had
this embodied model,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.410
they also had some concepts,
some philosophical concepts,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.570
that are not, I think,
very well known in the West

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.760
but I think are helpful
for us to learn about.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.080
So one of these is
this idea of wu-wei.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.260
It literally means "no
doing" or "no trying."

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.180
I like to translate it
as "effortless action,"

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.560
because you're often
very active when

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.760
you're in a state of wu-wei.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.926
It's a state where it's a
lot like being in the zone

00:12:49.926 --> 00:12:51.330
as an athlete.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.730
You lose a sense of
yourself as an agent.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.140
You lose a sense of effort.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.931
You don't feel like
you're exerting effort,

00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:58.770
and yet everything
works out perfectly.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.520
You're successful.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.740
Everything's going the
way you want it to go.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.560
One of the best
illustrations of wu-wei

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.130
is a story in this Taoist text,
"The Zhuangzi" about Butcher

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.330
Ding.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.430
So he's cutting up
this ox in what's

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.640
probably a very important
public ceremony.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.900
So there's a huge
crowd watching him.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.270
And he's got to cut up
this enormous animal,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.180
and he just kind of
waves his cleaver,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.590
and the ox falls apart.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.100
And it's like he's dancing or
performing classical music.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.960
And the ruler who's
watching him do

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.530
this says, how did you do that?

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.750
That was amazing.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.150
And the butcher says, well,
I don't have any skill.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.370
I don't know what I did.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.640
I didn't really do anything.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.250
But then he's pressed on
it, and he says, well,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.080
what I do is I shut down.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.060
Essentially, I shut
down my cold cognition.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.010
I shut down my mind.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.930
I shut down my perception.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.780
And as he puts it, I
let my spirit guide me.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.620
He says, I let my
spiritual desires guide me,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.865
and they guide me through
the spaces in the ox

00:13:54.865 --> 00:13:56.490
in between the bones
and the ligaments.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.760
I never touch anything.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.469
I'm just moving in
the spaces in between.

00:13:59.469 --> 00:14:01.051
And it's pretty clear
this is supposed

00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:02.550
to be a metaphor for our lives.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.130
We're supposed to live our
lives like the cleaver going

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.360
through the ox.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.420
So what's interesting about
this is he's talking about,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.250
I think, essentially
hot cognition

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.450
as a force within him.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.570
So in the early Chinese world
view, this thing, this spirit,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.150
is implanted in the
Zhuangzian view, at least,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.200
implanted in us by heaven,
the supreme high god heaven.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.800
And it's something
that can guide us.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.610
If we can loosen the
hold of the mind upon us,

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.650
it's something
that can guide us.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.960
I think from a contemporary
perspective the best way

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.750
to think about it is that he
shut down his cold cognition.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.800
And he's allowing his
trained hot cognition,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.880
so not just what he's
born with but something

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.890
he's trained up
over a long period,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.320
to take over and do its work
without the interference

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.910
of the conscious mind.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.300
Another analogy or helpful
way to think about this

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.250
that I use with my
students sometimes

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.930
is the "Star Wars" example.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.330
So the end of the first
"Star Wars" movie, at least

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.350
the first for us older
people, Luke Skywalker

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.820
is going to blow
up the Death Star.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.600
He's got to fly down this
trench with his photon torpedoes

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.260
in this very small opening.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.050
And he turns on his
targeting computer,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.220
and he hears in his head
Obiwan's voice, right?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.290
He said, Luke, use the force.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.231
And he shuts off his
targeting computer.

00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:17.730
And everyone back at Rebel Base
is like, what are you doing?

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.870
You turned off your
targeting computer!

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.119
He says, don't worry about it.

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:21.585
And he taps into the force.

00:15:21.585 --> 00:15:23.400
He fires his torpedoes.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.820
They go into the little vent
and blows up the Death Star.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.370
And he returns back to
the Rebel Base triumphant,

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.420
a very romantic reunion
with Princess Leia.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.860
It was romantic back then.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.975
It's kind of creepy now.

00:15:35.975 --> 00:15:38.100
We didn't know about the
whole brother-sister thing

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.070
when I was little.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:43.530
But what I like
about this is it's

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.740
the same basic idea, right?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.252
The targeting computer's
cold cognition, right?

00:15:47.252 --> 00:15:48.960
You're shutting down
your conscious mind,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.910
your perception,
and you're tapping

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.130
into some deeper, bigger
force that's going

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.717
to guide you the right way.

00:15:54.717 --> 00:15:56.550
What's interesting,
too, and very few people

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.430
realize this is is there's a
direct historical connection

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.430
between Butcher Ding
and Luke Skywalker.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.260
So "The Zhuangzi" are this text.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.240
"The Zhuangzi" is an
early Taoist text,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.860
pre-Buddhist Taoist text.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.370
It becomes the main influence
in Chan Buddhism, an early form

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.720
of Chinese Buddhism.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.830
Chan Buddhism goes to
Japan, becomes Zen Buddhism.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.870
Zen's the Japanese pronunciation
of the same character.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.080
Zen Buddhism becomes one
of the two main components

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.500
in the Bushido Ideal,
the ideal of the samurai.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.260
The ideal of the samurai
becomes a huge influence

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.120
on the films of Kurosawa.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.400
And George Lucas in
several interviews

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.010
has said that he was
inspired by the samurai ideal

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.266
when he was thinking
about the Jedi knights.

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:39.390
So there's actually a
direct-- it's very torturous,

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.390
but there's a direct historical
connection between that Butcher

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.360
Ding story and Luke Skywalker.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.820
You basically swap the
cleaver out for a lightsaber,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.450
and it's the same basic idea.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.160
You're surrendering
conscious control

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.690
to this force within
you that's more

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.890
powerful than the
small conscious self.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.060
Another helpful way
to think about this,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.300
another contemporary
concept that's helpful,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.230
is this idea of flow.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.500
So a lot of people have heard of
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's idea

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.426
of flow.

00:17:08.426 --> 00:17:10.259
And it shares a lot of
the phenomenological,

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:14.339
or kind of from the inside
feel features of wu-wei.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.589
So you lose a sense of
yourself as an agent.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.230
You lose a sense of
the passage of time.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.079
You are successful, and you
don't feel like you're actually

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.550
doing anything.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.220
For Csikszentmihalyi,
though, for him,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.270
the crucial thing about flow
is complexity and challenge.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.490
So he says he wants
to distinguish flow

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:34.410
from other states,
like zoning out

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.700
in front of the TV eating
Doritos, where you lose

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.990
the sense of passage of time.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.490
But you emerge from that
feeling dirty and bored

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.140
and not energized.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.110
What's special about
flow, he thinks,

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.950
is it's you're in
this flow channel,

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.460
the perfect combination
of your skill

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.170
and the challenge
of the situation.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.310
So if it's too challenging,
you get anxious or frustrated.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.320
If it's too easy, you get bored.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.300
So you've got to be
in that perfect match

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.250
between your skill
and the situation.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.340
And that means that you've got
to be constantly ramping up

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.630
both of those things.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.449
So as you get better
at the activity,

00:18:08.449 --> 00:18:09.990
you've got to ramp
up the challenges,

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.385
or you're going to fall out of
the flow channel into boredom.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:14.760
So for him, it's
about-- he talks

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.230
about this ever-spiraling
challenge and complexity.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.810
Now, this fits certain
types of situations

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.400
that we'd call flow, or
wu-wei, so high-stakes rock

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.080
climbing, competitive tennis.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.290
There's a lot-- kayaking
this fits as well.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.880
The problem is it
doesn't actually

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.290
fit Csikszentmihalyi's
own survey data.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.920
So Csikszentmihalyi's
survey data--

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.600
he's now done decades of
this, he and his colleagues--

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.150
have shown that most
people report flow

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.060
in situations like
walking in a landscape

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.830
that they've been
in a hundred times

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.920
and they know really
well on a level path.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.174
There's no ropes
or chains involved.

00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:53.340
There's nothing challenging.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.950
They're just walking, but they
feel like they're in flow.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.440
Another very common
place people report

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.800
flow is social situations,
hanging out with kids

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.990
or hanging out with
family members or friends

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.950
over a meal--

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.230
again, very low challenge,
very low complexity.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.900
So there's something
his definition

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.127
of what we'd want to call flow
or wu-wei is missing something.

00:19:14.127 --> 00:19:15.960
And I think this is
where wu-wei is actually

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.160
a more helpful concept.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.410
It's actually a bigger
umbrella concept.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.220
So for the early Chinese what
defines wu-wei, what sets it

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.610
apart from other states, is
being absorbed in something

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.570
larger than yourself.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.030
So you're part of something
that's bigger than yourself.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.400
Something else is kind
of taking over in a way.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.500
And crucially, it's
something that you value.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.100
So it's a bigger whole that
as philosophers would say

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.460
is normatively positive.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.790
You value it as
something important.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.650
It doesn't have to
be life-shaking.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.140
It could just be something
that you care about doing well.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.180
But something bigger
than you that you value

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.100
is what induces wu-wei.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.050
That's how you get
into this state.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.990
Now, for the early Chinese
this was a theological concept.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.164
And so for them the larger whole
was this metaphysical order

00:19:58.164 --> 00:19:58.830
to the universe.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.410
It was the Tao, so The
Way, The Cosmic Way.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.390
So you're in a
state of wu-wei when

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:04.980
you can get in
touch with the Tao

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.840
and let the Tao carry you along.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.400
For contemporary
people who don't

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.200
share the early
Chinese world view,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.880
it's got to be other stuff.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.080
It can't be this thing.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.520
It could be,
though, theological.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.190
So for people who are
traditionally religious,

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.517
they often get into a flow,
wu-wei, state in situations

00:20:20.517 --> 00:20:22.350
where they're worshipping
with other people.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.696
So it could be a
theological idea.

00:20:24.696 --> 00:20:26.070
I think more
typically, again, we

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.930
get into it in
everyday situations

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.150
where we're enjoying
the people we're with.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.970
We're enjoying taking
care of small children.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.670
We get into wu-wei,
or flow, in landscapes

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.130
that we value that we love.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.480
There are certain
landscapes, like Point Reyes,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.800
that put me instantly
into a state of wu-wei.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.279
Activities that we like,
so cooking, whatever

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:46.820
your hobbies are
that you care about,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.460
especially typically ones that
you share with other people,

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.572
there's a strong social
component to wu-wei.

00:20:52.572 --> 00:20:53.780
So there's a variety of ways.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.200
And as modern people we tend--
often these different larger

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.246
wholes are not connected in
any kind of coherent way.

00:21:00.246 --> 00:21:02.120
There's no story you
could tell that explains

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.390
why you like cooking and
Point Reyes and kayaking.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.040
But they fit
together in your mind

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.100
in some way that's
hard to articulate.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.707
And the key thing is that they
all put you into this state.

00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:15.040
So that's the first of the
concepts I want to introduce,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.030
this idea of wu-wei.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.306
The second is this idea.

00:21:21.306 --> 00:21:22.680
Unfortunately, in
modern Mandarin

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.230
it's pronounced "duh," which
always makes my students

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.460
giggle.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.250
It's sometimes translated as
"Virtue" with a capital V.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.730
But I prefer something more
like charismatic power.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.185
This is a power--

00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:37.530
it's a kind of aura
that you kick off when

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.000
you're in a state of wu-wei.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.720
So if you're in
wu-wei, you emanate de.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.330
And so this is the thing
that as a Confucian ruler

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.835
allows you to cause people to
follow you without coercion.

00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:50.460
You don't have to
make them follow you.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.590
They just flock to you,
and they want to obey you.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.240
If you're a Taoist,
it's what allows

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.790
you to move among
people and even animals

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.720
without being harmed.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.670
Everyone's kind of
relaxed around you.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.090
So it's this very crucial power.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.050
It explains especially
the social success

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.240
of people who are in
a state of wu-wei.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.040
Now, again, for
the early Chinese

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.830
the connection is explained
in theological terms.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.810
So when you're in
a state of wu-wei,

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.240
you're in harmony with heaven.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.000
Heaven likes you because
you're doing what heaven wants.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.881
And so heaven gives
you this power

00:22:19.881 --> 00:22:22.380
as a way-- it's kind of like a
star on your forehead saying,

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.510
this person's OK.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.570
Follow what they say,
or don't hurt them.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.970
So it's connected theologically.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.910
I think, again, we could
tell a kind of modern updated

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.400
naturalized version
of this story,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.880
where we see the connection
between wu-wei and de

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.692
in cognitive terms, in
cognitive scientific terms.

00:22:42.692 --> 00:22:45.150
But doing this is going to be
a little bit more complicated

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.462
than the wu-wei story alone.

00:22:46.462 --> 00:22:48.670
And we have to go all the
way back to the Pleistocene

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.460
to explain this.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.570
So human beings have spent most
of our evolutionary history

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.710
in small hunter-gatherer
bands, just like our primate

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.740
ancestors-- so bands
where we were related to

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.740
or we knew most of the people
we were interacting with.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.320
And then in an evolutionary
blink of an eye--

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.150
I mean, agriculture
was super recent

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.540
if you have a longtime view
on the level of species--

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.850
we start living in these
large-scale societies.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.760
So agricultural societies
where we're interacting with

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.080
strangers all the time.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.810
We're having to coordinate
with massive numbers of people

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.350
way beyond what we ever had to
do in our evolutionary history.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.940
And it's a very
successful strategy.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.150
So 99.9% of people
living today are

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.070
living in large-scale societies
of one kind or another.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.340
It's a very successful strategy.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.540
There's a bit of a mystery
about how we pull it off.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.540
Because going from a
small-scale village

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.700
or a hunter-gatherer life
to large-scale societies

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.490
involves various
cooperation dilemmas

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:50.460
that we're not equipped
biologically to deal with.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.100
We haven't had time to evolve
to deal with these things.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.730
So there's got to be some
kind of new mechanisms going

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.170
on that help us get through some
of these cooperation dilemmas.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.750
There's a variety of them.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.270
The one that I
want to focus on is

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:07.000
one identified by the Cornell
economist, Robert Frank.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.480
So he's talked a lot about this
idea of the emotions as having

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.360
a kind of rational function
in human cooperation dilemmas,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.640
and particularly in
dilemmas that he talks about

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.324
as commitment dilemmas.

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.490
So these are situations
where you have a cooperation

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.550
situation that
can only be solved

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.130
by some kind of emotional
commitment between people.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.820
The classic example is
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.590
And actually, right now at the
Exploratorium in San Francisco

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.369
they have an exhibit
on social cognition

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:36.160
and that you can do
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.310
You can play it in
various iterations.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.850
So it's fun.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.880
I'd recommend
seeing this display.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.710
The classic set up in
the prisoner's dilemma,

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.140
you have two prisoners that
are being held separately.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.580
They've done something.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.040
They've done a crime.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.010
They're guilty.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.260
And yet the DA doesn't
have enough evidence.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.640
He doesn't have a very
good case against them.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.370
And so they are offered a deal.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.970
So one thing they could do
is if they both just shut up,

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.590
they'll get very
little jail time.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.090
They'll both go to
jail for a month,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.190
because they don't have a
very good case against them.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.773
But they're being
offered a deal where

00:25:06.773 --> 00:25:10.590
if they rat on the other
person, they get off scot-free.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.450
Then the other person has to
go to jail for a full year.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.027
That's the deal
that's being offered.

00:25:15.027 --> 00:25:16.860
Now, the problem in the
prisoner's dilemma--

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.110
they're being held separately.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.170
They can't communicate.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.753
Even if they could
communicate, they'd

00:25:20.753 --> 00:25:23.550
have no way to enforce any
kind of agreement they came to.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.715
The only rational decision
in prisoner's dilemmas

00:25:26.715 --> 00:25:30.450
is to confess and betray, to
defect, as economists say.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.540
And so what a purely rational
being is going to get--

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.180
so they end up both
confessing and betraying

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.611
and get three months in jail,
which is better than a year.

00:25:38.611 --> 00:25:40.610
That's why you have to
do it if you're rational.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.401
But it's not great.

00:25:41.401 --> 00:25:43.980
It'd be better to just
do one month in jail.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.870
Purely rational
beings are always

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.711
going to lose in the
prisoner's dilemma.

00:25:47.711 --> 00:25:49.710
They're always going to
get a suboptimal outcome

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.000
in the prisoner's dilemma.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.920
What's interesting is
that human beings--

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.950
Vulcans can't solve
the prisoner's dilemma.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.730
Humans can.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.800
And the way humans do
it-- so we often solve

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.650
prisoner's dilemmas, and
there's multiple forms of this

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.510
in everyday life--

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.690
through things like
trust or honor.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.780
So why do gang members
not betray each other?

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.780
Because they have honor.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.739
They're not going to betray
their fellow gang member.

00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:13.530
These are emotions.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.229
And the emotions are basically--

00:26:16.229 --> 00:26:17.270
this is Frank's argument.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.590
I think he's right about this.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.330
The emotions are pre-binding us.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.620
They're forcing us into honoring
an agreement, even when it

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.960
becomes not rational
to honor it,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.930
when it becomes against our
self-interest to honor it.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.394
One way to think
of this, I think,

00:26:31.394 --> 00:26:33.560
that's helpful as
the myth of Odysseus.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.300
So he knows that when he sails--

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.770
he wants to hear
the Sirens, but he

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.170
knows the future
Odysseus is not going

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.110
to be able to resist the Sirens
when he hears the Siren call.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.480
So he has his sailors
tie him to the mast

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.630
and put wax in their ears so
they don't hear the sirens.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.010
He's bound himself.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.690
Odysseus won.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:55.040
Odysseus in the present is
now making Odysseus two--

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.860
is forcing his decision
in a way that Odysseus two

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.240
has no choice over anymore.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.770
He's pre-binding himself.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.240
This is what emotions do for us.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.150
Emotions like honor
and loyalty and love

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.950
bind us to cooperation dyads
or triads or larger groups

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.074
in a way that's
immune to defection

00:27:12.074 --> 00:27:13.490
because we've now
bound ourselves.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.530
So that's the power
of commitments.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.780
So emotional commitments are
crucial for human beings.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.950
These type of dilemmas arise
all the time in human life.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.450
There's a problem
with these though.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.090
There's an issue with
emotional commitments.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.910
And that's really
the best strategy,

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.880
if you have commitment
things going on,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.780
is to be able to
fake commitments.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.840
It's to have your sailors
tie you to the mast,

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.160
but it's not tied very tightly.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.320
You can get out of
it if you want to.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.454
That would be ideal.

00:27:40.454 --> 00:27:41.870
So there's going
to be pressure on

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.737
people to cheat, to
fake commitments,

00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:46.070
because then they get all the
benefits of the commitment

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.090
interaction without
paying any of the costs.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.290
And you're going to also expect
a kind of evolutionary arms

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.026
race, where people are going to
get better at detecting people

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:55.150
who are faking commitments.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.590
You're going to expect
this to get ramped up.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.950
And so the worry in commitment
interactions is hypocrisy,

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.180
so people faking the
commitment to get the benefits.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.030
The solution, or at
least partial solution,

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.920
involves signaling
of various kinds.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.970
And so this idea of signaling,
one of the most helpful ways

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.130
to think of it is in
the non-human animal

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.810
world-- costly signaling.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.430
So this is an idea
that developed

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.830
when people were trying to
explain things like gazelles.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.070
So when a gazelle is approached
on the savanna by a predator,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.440
instead of running away
right away, it stops.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.090
It just jumps up
and down in place.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.320
It's the weirdest
thing you've ever seen.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.370
You're just like, what's
the matter with you?

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.900
There's a lion, run!

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.670
But they don't.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.840
And the argument in it, and
it seems to be the case,

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.280
is that this is a signal.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.430
The gazelle is saying
look how high I can jump.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.800
Don't try to chase me,
because you won't catch me.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.940
And you'll waste time.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.170
I'll waste time.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.120
So why don't you go
find a weaker gazelle

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.830
who can't stot like I can.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.572
And I'm going to keep eating
my grass and win-win situation.

00:28:51.572 --> 00:28:53.280
And this really seems
to be what happens.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.620
The lion's like,
yeah, you're right.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.220
I can't catch you.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.990
And they go off and
find another gazelle.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.860
Everyone wins.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.340
It only works, though, because
it's inherently unfakable.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.890
If you didn't have strong
legs, you couldn't stot.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.270
You couldn't jump that high.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.060
So there are these kind of
unfakable signals in the animal

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.740
world.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.030
In human beings, there's
a kind of equivalent

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.550
in these relatively
unfakable signals

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.720
that we kick off in emotional
displays and facial displays.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.600
So the classic
example is-- these

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.430
must have been
European researchers.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.550
So here's the pan-American
smile, the superficial way

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.320
Americans smile.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.440
This is a system two smile.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.715
This is consciously willed.

00:29:31.715 --> 00:29:35.510
You're using your conscious
mind to make this smile.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.400
This is the so-called
Duchenne smile.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.570
That's a sincere smile.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.040
That's hot cognition.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.470
It's different muscle
systems in the face,

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.180
and they're run by
the different systems.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.470
One's run by system two.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.240
One's run by system one.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.180
So what we're looking for when
we're evaluating someone who

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.140
says that they're loyal, who
says that they honor the gang,

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.270
and they always want to
be a member of our gang,

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.390
we want to see this.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.030
We want to see something
like the Duchenne smile.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.110
We want to see a facial
expression that reflects

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.810
a lack of cognitive effort.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:10.610
So we trust and we tend
to willingly engage

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.720
in commitment situations with
people who are not kicking off

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.380
signs of cognitive control.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.370
So I think that's the kind of
signaling that human beings do

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.490
with one another.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.330
And I think this explains
the connection between trust

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.110
and spontaneity, basically
between wu-wei and de,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.030
is that when we see people
who seem to be sincere--

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.070
they don't seem to
be making effort--

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.880
we like them.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.660
We trust them.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.860
We want to follow them.

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.030
We wish they would run
for president, right?

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:41.690
This is basically human beings
using the mind ball paradox

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.010
as a social signal.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:44.690
We're taking
advantage of the fact

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.240
that you can't force
spontaneity to use it

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.664
as a relatively honest signal.

00:30:48.664 --> 00:30:50.580
At least unless someone's
a really good faker,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.330
we're going to use it
as an honest signal.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.980
And this then explains the
connection between wu-wei

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.465
and de in a naturalistic way.

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:58.340
You don't have to tell
the story about heaven

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.980
giving to you as a power.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.540
It's that we trust people
who are not kicking off

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.040
signs of cognitive control.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.702
And there's a whole
bunch of evidence--

00:31:05.702 --> 00:31:07.160
I only got some of
it in the book--

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.190
that people who are
spontaneous behave properly.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.150
They cooperate better.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:12.830
And as soon as you give
people time to think,

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.950
then they start cheating.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.500
They start getting more selfish.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.860
The default strategy
for most people

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.860
in large-scale societies,
at least, is to cooperate.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.680
So I think this is one way
that Chinese philosophy can

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.560
be very helpful.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.760
We have this connection between
these ideas in early China

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.280
that are explained theologically
but actually points

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.660
in directions of new research.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.130
So there hasn't
been a lot of work

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.470
on this, the role of
trust and commitment

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.220
and spontaneity and
human collaboration.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.520
It's now starting to
get off the ground.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.760
But this can be very helpful.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.010
There are new ideas that can
help us understand things

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:47.020
in our own world, like how a
short-fingered vulgarian could

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.250
defeat a vastly more qualified
and dignified opponent.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.370
He's got de.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.470
It's evil de.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.740
You can have evil de.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.580
This is where I think
the Chinese are wrong.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.770
She completely lacks it.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.170
She's wooden.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.900
She lacks that kind of sense.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.490
People don't trust
her because she's

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.770
kicking off signs of
cognitive control constantly.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.110
I think if you look at
videos of the two of them,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.370
that's what it comes down to.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.670
People trust him because
he's spontaneous.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.210
He's spontaneously evil,
but he's spontaneous.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.246
People like it.

00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:20.120
So that's one way these
ideas can be helpful.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.127
They explain things in
our contemporary world

00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:23.335
that otherwise seem baffling.

00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:26.590
Another way early Chinese
thought can be helpful

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.410
is they worried about
something like the mind ball

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.340
paradox a lot.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.070
They all wanted to get
into a state of wu-wei.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.720
So they developed
these techniques

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.880
for getting around the
paradox that are actually

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.060
quite sophisticated.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.150
So I walk through
these in the book.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.490
There's the Confucius carving
and polishing strategies.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.380
So basically, try really
hard for a long time,

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.130
then the trying will
fall away, and you'll

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.810
able to be spontaneous.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.300
There's the Laozian stop trying.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.420
Go back to nature.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.474
Be like that unhewn wood.

00:32:54.474 --> 00:32:56.140
Get back in touch
with your real nature.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.220
That'll allow you
to be spontaneous.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.100
There's the Mencian
strategy that kind of

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.810
splits the difference.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:04.790
We've got the beginnings
of proper wu-wei within us,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.040
but they're not strong enough.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.109
We need to cultivate
them, help them along.

00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:09.400
But we can't force it too much.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.850
We've got to just be like a
patient farmer cultivating

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.900
sprouts.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.810
And then there's the
Zhuangzian forget about trying.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.130
Forget about not trying.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.360
Just let go, and
everything will be OK.

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.580
The spirit will take
over, and you'll be fine.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.550
So you have these
different strategies.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.610
None of them works
in a 100% way, right?

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.980
Because it's a real paradox.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.420
If one of these
strategies worked,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.740
it wouldn't be a paradox.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.260
But each of them
is a helpful way

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.110
to try to get
around the paradox,

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.630
in the same way people have
strategies like counting sheep

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.588
or whatever when you're
trying to get to sleep.

00:33:42.588 --> 00:33:45.730
You've got to fake yourself out
to get into a state of wu-wei.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.250
Which of these strategies
is the most helpful

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.960
probably depends
on the situation--

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.990
so the details of the
barriers to spontaneity

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.250
that you're facing.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.310
Life stage-- so carving
and polishing is, I think,

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.350
clearly more important
when you're younger.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:02.050
You just don't have the properly
trained hot cognition yet

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.240
to trust your hot cognition.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.710
And probably
personality type-- so

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.540
what's appropriate
for an introvert

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.429
may not be appropriate
for an extrovert.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.110
There may be kind of
innate differences

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.570
in which strategy works
the best for people.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.050
But I think there's something
very helpful about having

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.469
at your disposal a toolbox of
different strategies that you

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.520
can pick from depending
upon the situation.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.150
So I think that's
an important thing.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.380
Another important thing is
just having these words,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.820
expanding our vocabulary.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.610
So I've found that people
who know me or read my work

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.154
start using wu-wei all the time.

00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:33.820
You're not being very
wu-wei about this.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.695
Why don't you try to be
a little more wu-wei.

00:34:35.695 --> 00:34:37.150
Come on, man.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.274
She has no de.

00:34:38.274 --> 00:34:42.040
I said this to people watching
tapes of Hillary Clinton

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.820
deliver speeches.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.609
Like, that woman has no de.

00:34:45.609 --> 00:34:46.900
People start using these terms.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.820
And I think what this reflects
is a cognitive conceptual gap

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.679
in the English language,
so in the same way

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.130
that we adopted the words
schadenfreude from German

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:58.960
because we feel schadenfreude.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.170
We just didn't
have a word for it.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:02.980
Words matter.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.520
Words help us focus on
aspects of existence

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.770
that we maybe don't pay
enough attention to because we

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:09.811
don't have a word for it.

00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:12.230
We don't necessarily identify
it and single it out.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.460
So I think that's helpful.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.910
Another helpful thing is
just the role of trust.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.840
So we tend to focus, I
think, too much on contracts

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.910
and explicit
agreements and rules

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.280
and miss the fact that
most human interactions,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.400
whether in the workspace
or in larger society,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.090
are about commitments.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.010
So looking at the
spontaneity trust connection

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.510
makes you think
more about the fact

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.030
that human interactions
are about commitments

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.020
and not contracts.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.780
It's about emotional
ties people have.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.120
So that's another helpful thing.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.030
Specific policy things--
don't underestimate

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.150
the power of alcohol.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:50.440
So this is going to be
the next book topic.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.990
But alcohol is a very fast way
to deactivate your system two,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.820
at least temporarily.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.340
I think that in the
workplace right now

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.060
you have a problem where people
are having dry holiday parties

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.760
and discouraging people from
going out drinking after work.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.860
And what they're worried
about is that, right?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.250
That can happen
at office parties.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.870
So they're weighing the
potential for this kind

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.390
of disaster against what?

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:18.780
People having fun.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.420
So it seems like the
math is a no-brainer.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.460
You just don't do it.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.840
I think they're
missing the point

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.440
that when you don't give
people this cultural tool--

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.390
it's a cultural tool
we've developed--

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:33.316
you make them less able to form
commitment ties to one another.

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.940
So there's something
about human beings

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.600
for millennia have been
poisoning themselves, taking

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.370
perfectly good foodstuffs
and turning them

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:41.870
into poison for some reason.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:45.590
And it's because it helps people
get past cooperation dilemmas

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.050
by temporarily
down-regulating our defenses,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.950
our cognitive control.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.094
So I think that
when we shake hands,

00:36:52.094 --> 00:36:53.510
when you shake
hands with someone,

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.830
you're basically saying,
look, I don't have

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.490
a weapon in my dominant hand.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.900
So I'm not trying to
fool you or hurt you.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.670
Do a couple of
shots with someone,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.920
you're basically taking
your prefrontal cortex out

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.545
and putting it on
the table and saying,

00:37:05.545 --> 00:37:07.170
like, no cognitive control.

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.560
So what I say is
really what I think.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.520
You can trust me.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.604
And this is the reason why
when Skype was invented

00:37:12.604 --> 00:37:14.061
everyone was like,
oh, well, people

00:37:14.061 --> 00:37:16.250
will stop traveling for
work, because why would you

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.860
fly to Shanghai if you can
Skype with people there?

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.360
People still fly to Shanghai.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.900
And that's because people don't
trust other people unless they

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.300
sit in a room with them
and typically share a meal

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.430
and typically get a little
bit wasted with them.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.471
Because there's a sense
that when you see someone

00:37:30.471 --> 00:37:32.540
in that kind of context,
you get a-- and also

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.130
you're reading body signals.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.210
You're getting all this
incredibly thick bandwidth

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.930
of information and
person that you don't

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.850
get over Skype or the phone.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.540
So that's an important insight.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.650
And so the Chinese sometimes
used drunkenness as a metaphor

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.640
for wu-wei.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.850
There's something to that.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.530
It's a shortcut to
down-regulating your mind.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.020
And there is some
evidence also of-- there's

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.170
this idea that artists have
long had about the muse,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.542
that intoxication causes
creativity to happen.

00:38:01.542 --> 00:38:03.000
And there's some
evidence for that.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.970
So you get people
mildly drunk in the lab,

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.882
and they do better
at creativity tasks.

00:38:07.882 --> 00:38:09.090
You can't get them too drunk.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.089
Then they get bad again.

00:38:10.089 --> 00:38:12.770
But there's a sweet spot
where they're really good.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.540
I presented on this years ago.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.390
And the book came out of
the Google campus in Irvine.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.055
And the first person to raise
their hand was Balmer Peak.

00:38:21.055 --> 00:38:22.430
So I looked into
the Balmer Peak.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:26.240
Apparently there's a very narrow
blood alcohol concentration

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.000
where you guys
code a lot better.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.150
That's the theory.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.362
Afterwards they took me
to their wall of-- they

00:38:31.362 --> 00:38:33.020
have a room of
scotch down there.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.645
I don't know if you
guys are that cool.

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.487
But they have a real
amazing room of scotch.

00:38:37.487 --> 00:38:40.070
And I think what's interesting
about that is you see, I think,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:43.970
places like Google have realized
that if your business model is

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.460
predicated on
creativity and making

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.545
breakthroughs and
figuring stuff out,

00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:50.420
making people just sit
in front of the screen

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.800
for a certain number
of hours a day

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.008
is not going to get you that.

00:38:53.008 --> 00:38:55.400
The striving, striving,
striving doesn't work.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.630
And so these guys told me.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.060
They said, when we're
facing a conceptual problem,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.640
we go to the scotch room and
have a little bit of scotch.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.080
And then we play some ping pong.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.420
And then eventually
we figure things out.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.540
You need to create space
for creativity to happen.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.820
You can't force
creativity directly

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.160
by chaining someone to a
desk until they come up

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.360
with an idea.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:17.435
So that's important-- workplace
design and work culture.

00:39:17.435 --> 00:39:22.070
And at the most abstract
level, embodied cognition--

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.010
so if you take things
like wu-wei seriously,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.580
you take seriously
the fact that we

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.670
have embodied ways of being
in the world that are very

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.410
powerful and very important.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.644
Abstract knowledge
alone is not enough.

00:39:32.644 --> 00:39:35.060
You can have abstract knowledge
and not be good at things.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.404
You need to train imagination.

00:39:36.404 --> 00:39:37.820
So when you educate
kids, you need

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.100
to train them how to problem
solve and how to think,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.992
not just a set of
facts about the world.

00:39:42.992 --> 00:39:44.450
And I think this
is something we're

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.570
terrible at right now is
you've got to create space

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.310
for your unconscious
to do its work,

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:50.630
for your body to do its work.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.490
So right now we
bombard ourselves

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.380
with constant information.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.620
We never have time to actually
integrate the information

00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:58.980
that we already have.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.880
So you need to create
space for wu-wei to happen.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.070
You have to go for
walks in the mountains.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.312
You have to let your
mind wander a little bit.

00:40:06.312 --> 00:40:08.270
You could do this through
physical activity, so

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.850
things that distract
your mind from itself

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.250
because you're doing
something with your body.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.250
And also, I think crucially,
you've got to sleep.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:18.470
So those people who
are striving-oriented

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:20.930
tend to view sleep as just
this horrible waste of time.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.060
How can we minimize
that wasted time?

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.935
It's not wasted time.

00:40:23.935 --> 00:40:26.018
When you're sleeping,
you're doing important work.

00:40:26.018 --> 00:40:27.530
You're pruning
neural connections.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.110
You're integrating the knowledge
you acquired during the day.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.730
It's a very good
example of something

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.271
that looks like
you're doing nothing,

00:40:33.271 --> 00:40:34.420
but you're doing a lot.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.170
And people who don't
get enough sleep just

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:37.839
don't have a good
enough integration

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:40.130
of the knowledge they've been
acquiring during the day.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.790
So we need to build more
space into our lives

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:46.010
in a way we don't
have enough, I think.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.530
So when the book came
out, it was originally

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.500
marketed as a self-help book,
which I advised against.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.854
And what happened is
exactly what I predicted.

00:40:53.854 --> 00:40:55.520
People who bought it
as a self-help book

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.061
were pissed off,
because they thought

00:40:57.061 --> 00:40:59.190
there'd be 10 steps
to being a Zen master.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.660
And they could just follow
the 10 steps and be fine.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.000
The fortune cookie's empty.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.700
The early Chinese don't have
any kind of magic formula

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.740
for how to attain wu-wei.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:13.230
So it's not helpful directly
in that kind of self-helpy way.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.420
Where it is, I think, helpful
is by focusing our attention

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.280
on the importance of embodied
cognition, the imagination,

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.730
the importance of trusting our
body in certain situations,

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.090
and crucially, also getting us
to see how this spontaneity is

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.820
linked to trust and how
spontaneity is really

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.750
at the center of human success
in a lot of areas of our lives.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.528
So thank you.

00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:38.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:47.710
AUDIENCE: So in this era of
quantified segmented cells,

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.070
where every moment,
every breath has

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.916
to be justified, and time
cards, and we are quantifying

00:41:54.916 --> 00:41:56.040
ourselves in so many ways--

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.860
number of steps, the number of
breaths, number of heartbeats,

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:00.630
all of that.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.570
It really seems
completely counter

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.860
to this idea of flow and
trust and unquantified cells

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.170
where creativity can bloom.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.260
So in fact, it sounds like
we are poisoning ourselves

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.470
with all this quantification.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.160
What do you think?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.360
TED SLINGERLAND: Yeah,
no, I totally agree.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.380
This is one of the
problems is that we

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.450
don't build in enough
time for these things.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:23.650
And technology
has made it worse.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.920
So when I was a
student, you always

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.882
had-- like you had
enforced downtime.

00:42:27.882 --> 00:42:30.090
At the very least, when
you're walking from one class

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.830
to another, there's
nothing else you

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:33.960
can do except look at
the squirrels running

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.420
around the trees and
let your mind wander.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.060
Now I look at my students, and
they're constantly plugged in

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.380
somehow or answering texts.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.400
They never actually are
not taking in information.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.900
And I think that's
really troubling.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:46.858
I think it's going to--

00:42:46.858 --> 00:42:49.440
and it's going to have
effects down the line

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.240
in terms of people's
ability to really have

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.280
creative breakthroughs.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.380
So I think smart
companies actually

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.810
are aware that you need to give
people some unstructured time

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.010
and create ways for
them to interact in ways

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.600
that aren't being quantified.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.750
What did we accomplish
in this meeting?

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.640
It's not clear.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.570
But we drank some
good scotch and we

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.110
played some good foosball.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.760
And maybe like next
week, we're going

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.979
to have some benefit from that.

00:43:16.979 --> 00:43:18.020
But it's hard to predict.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for this talk.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.270
And I'm Chinese.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:28.580
I'm so proud of you bringing
so many Chinese culture

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.440
to your book.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.160
And I just finished a book
"Thinking Fast and Slow."

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:41.130
And it does say that when
we do a lot of things,

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.320
we should use our
system two, right?

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.420
But here you talk about wu-wei.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.570
That seems a conflict of ideas.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.950
And especially when
we do investment,

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.110
we should be reasonable.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:44:00.134
So do you think that wu-wei can
contribute to the investment?

00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:01.050
TED SLINGERLAND: Yeah.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.122
Oh, to the investment?

00:44:02.122 --> 00:44:03.330
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.780
So that's an important point.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.080
So Kahneman's book, which
I flashed briefly up there,

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.240
"Thinking Fast and
Slow," the work

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.220
that he's done on
two-system thought

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.890
is how system one's
dangerous, and you

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.580
need to guard against system
one and actually use system two.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.710
And the situations-- and
he's right about that.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.140
We're subject to all
these kind of errors

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.540
of thinking when we're
trusting our system one,

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.790
and that really has
to do with a mismatch

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.700
between our evolved
cognition and the structure

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.480
of modern life.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.900
We're just not built to
reason about investment.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.330
We're not built to reason
about climate change, right?

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:38.490
Climate change is
such a big thing.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:41.190
We just don't deal with
causality well intuitively

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.340
on that level.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.430
And that's where we either
have to use system two.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:48.480
And system two-- so
I've been emphasizing

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.330
that the power of system
one partly as a corrective.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.769
Obviously, system
two is crucial.

00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:54.060
There's a reason we evolved it.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.930
It's super expensive
physiologically.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.020
So we wouldn't have it if
it wasn't really important.

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.340
So in situations like
climate change, investment,

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.180
you either need to switch into
system two to do it right.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.650
And Kahneman's
focused most on that,

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:10.590
on correcting your intuitions.

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.840
Or you need to figure
out a way to make

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.310
your system one do the things
that system two wants it to do.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.837
And so that's where I
think things like Al Gore

00:45:20.837 --> 00:45:22.170
doesn't just give you the stats.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.900
He shows you a polar bear
drowning in the Arctic

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.610
because there's no more ice.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.330
You've got to make the--

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:31.560
you can take system two
insights and build them

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.435
into your system one.

00:45:32.435 --> 00:45:33.393
And that's actually it.

00:45:33.393 --> 00:45:35.550
So the Confucian and
self-cultivation strategy

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.620
is interesting,
because the model

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.910
seems to be they have these
insights using cold cognition.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.380
It's not what they're born with.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.799
So for instance, Xunzi, this
late Warring States Confucian,

00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:50.340
he's got this passage where he
talks about where did ritual--

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.740
and by this he really means
all of Confucian culture--

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.030
where did it come from?

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.114
And he says the sage king
saw the state of nature.

00:45:56.114 --> 00:45:57.655
People were fighting
with each other.

00:45:57.655 --> 00:45:58.470
It was too chaotic.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:59.700
And he hated it.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.312
And so they seemed to then
switch into system two

00:46:02.312 --> 00:46:04.020
cognition and say,
what would be the best

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.650
way to distribute
resources in a society?

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.330
And so they're
using cold cognition

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:11.730
and what seems to be
utilitarian reasoning.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.415
But Western philosophers
would then stop there.

00:46:14.415 --> 00:46:16.290
And then they would say,
let's teach everyone

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.570
how to reason using
utilitarianism.

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:19.320
But they don't.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.060
They say, OK, now let's design
rituals and music and things

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.310
that will take that cold
insight and build it

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:29.160
into people's hot cognition so
they can really actually do it

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.487
reliably.

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.070
So that's the other--
so to get around

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:34.050
the limitations
of our system one

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.000
is either to switch
purely into system

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.910
two, which probably is
appropriate in some situations,

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.240
or to use system two
insights to transform.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.760
Because system one is fungible.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.510
You can change it.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.490
That's how skill
acquisition happens, right?

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.000
So you can reshape your
emotions and your virtues

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.740
in ways that I think
the Confucians had

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.800
some really powerful cultural
technologies for doing.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.300
So that's an important point.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:02.010
Kahneman focuses more on how our
system one is prone to errors.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.860
That's why I tend to,
in a corrective way,

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.471
try to emphasize how system
one's really important.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.010
AUDIENCE: I like the
concepts, at least the words

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.460
that you put up, wu-wei and de.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.020
I used to call it like
emotional and rational,

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.220
something much more vague.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.090
And actually my question
was a little bit

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:32.600
that if you go full
emotional, full wu-wei,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.820
you lose all rationality,
that's not ideal.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.300
You become more like pure
instinct, more animalesque.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.040
But on the other side,
full rational system two,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:51.720
in this context,
is just too dry.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.480
It's not a healthy way to
live and eventually grinds out

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.960
way too much.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.790
So everyone, I guess, has
to find like their middle

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:04.077
in between where to use system
two, where to use system one.

00:48:04.077 --> 00:48:05.910
And the idea is to flow
as much as possible.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.368
But you're right
that we have to be

00:48:07.368 --> 00:48:12.900
able to actually take one system
when intuition is just wrong.

00:48:14.512 --> 00:48:16.470
TED SLINGERLAND: It's
also important to realize

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.960
that system one is not fixed.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.300
System one can get reshaped
in a variety of ways.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.120
So we're not just
stuck with a system one

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.886
that we had when we
were four-year-olds.

00:48:25.886 --> 00:48:28.260
AUDIENCE: But I think one of
the problems is that when we

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.430
consciously try to change our
system one in ways that are

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:38.879
actually not natural to us, when
we try to out-force ourself--

00:48:38.879 --> 00:48:39.420
I don't know.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.254
It's just a comment.

00:48:41.254 --> 00:48:42.920
I don't really have
a question about it.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.620
TED SLINGERLAND: Yeah,
you need to work.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.500
So that's where the Mencian--

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.330
I like the Mencian
model a lot, because he

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.496
is saying we've got to
change our system one.

00:48:48.496 --> 00:48:49.620
We just have these sprouts.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.350
We need to make them grow
into full-grown virtues,

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:54.360
but you can't force it.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.040
He has a story
about a farmer who

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.550
goes out and pulls
on his sprouts

00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:59.850
to try to make them grow
faster and kills them.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.430
So you can't be like the
Mohist utilitarians who

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:03.960
want to pull on their sprouts.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.140
But you also can't be lazy
and sit around and not

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.120
water or weed at all.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.460
You've got to do something.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.835
So the important
thing to realize

00:49:10.835 --> 00:49:13.230
is that none of the
early Chinese thinkers

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.410
really think we're OK at birth.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.990
Even the most radicals, so
people like Laozi, who says,

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:23.190
let's go back to our original
nature, he's writing this.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:26.190
So the people he's talking
to are already messed up.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.550
So they need to go back
to something that's

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.360
a kind of manufactured
nature, that he's imagining

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.920
is what our true nature is.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.620
So I think all these things--

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.800
no one thinks that we want to
have the hot cognition we had

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.690
when we were four-year-olds.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.630
Toddlers are not a model
of how we want to behave.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.800
So the trick then is how
much shaping is appropriate

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.007
and how much cold
cognition is appropriate.

00:49:52.007 --> 00:49:54.090
And that's where the splits
between, for instance,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.080
the Taoists and
Confucians arise.

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.920
The Taoists think the Confucians
are overdoing it and turning us

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.482
into robots.

00:50:00.482 --> 00:50:02.190
And the Confucians
think that the Taoists

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:05.520
are kind of lazy
children who don't

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.930
understand civilized life.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:08.920
And the two play off each other.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.000
I don't think the "Tao Te
Ching" or "The Zhuangzi"

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.660
make sense except as
kind of protest movements

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.090
against this kind of
excessive training--

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:19.680
what they see as
excessive training.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.140
So there's a balance
you need to strike.

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:23.862
And the fact that
none of these schools

00:50:23.862 --> 00:50:25.320
ever really wins
out in early China

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.420
suggests that there's
no right answer.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.915
There's no right way
to get that balance.

00:50:29.915 --> 00:50:32.040
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
ways in which technology

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.810
makes the problem worse.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.620
Do you see any ways in which
technology helps or can help?

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.300
TED SLINGERLAND: Yeah.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.780
I'm looking forward
to self-driving cars.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.720
I'm looking forward to a
time when you could actually

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.360
use commute time instead
of being, again, drowned

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.800
by too much
information and people

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.160
merging and worrying
about traffic,

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.400
to opening up new spaces
for daydreaming and just

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.830
looking out the window
and thinking about things.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.250
So there could be ways
that technology can help.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.670
Technology could also help just
by making us more efficient

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.750
when we are exerting effort,
so that we create more time

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:11.070
to be off.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:13.526
The problem is that's not
actually what happens, right?

00:51:13.526 --> 00:51:15.900
We're more efficient, and we
just keep doing that, right?

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:19.260
So if it was back in--
when I was in grad school,

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.450
you still had to write
letters to people.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.880
So if I wanted to correspond
with a European colleague,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.580
you'd write a letter on
that funny thin paper.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.100
And you'd mail it, and you'd
have to wait a month or two

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.630
and come back.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.107
Now I can email them, so
that's more efficient.

00:51:33.107 --> 00:51:35.690
But all it means is that I now
interact with a lot more people

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.080
and I have a lot
more work to do.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.210
So that's the problem
is that technology,

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.280
I think, in theory could help.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.460
But it just seems to be human
nature that we overdo things,

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:48.030
and we tend to just
not know when to stop.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.440
But I think that
that's something

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.440
that needs to be thought
about is how to use technology

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.690
not just to increase
our efficiency at work,

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:59.490
but to use that then to buy us
time to have that down time,

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:02.740
to allow our body and
cognition to do its thing.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.620
AUDIENCE: So I can
personally relate

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:08.270
to the idea of not trying too
hard to be good at something.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.920
And thanks for sharing that.

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.950
The one thing I thought you
didn't talk about at all

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:14.230
was practice.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:17.751
I cannot be good at anything
just by not trying too hard

00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:18.250
at it.

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.930
I have to practice
fairly deliberately

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:24.585
before I stop thinking about it,
and then I'm going to be good.

00:52:24.585 --> 00:52:25.460
TED SLINGERLAND: Yep.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.740
So that was kind of my point
with the life stage thing.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.142
You can't sit down.

00:52:32.142 --> 00:52:33.350
So if I sat down at a piano--

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.910
I don't know how
to play the piano.

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.960
If I sat down and tried to
solo, I would sound ridiculous.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.050
It would sound stupid.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.080
I have a brother-in-law
in Rome who's

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.870
a jazz pianist, who does that.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.000
He'll sit down at a piano
and just noodle around.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.140
It sounds amazing.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.440
He has a song called
"I'll be Bach,"

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.920
where he takes Bach and
then does weird things.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.720
He starts playing
it faster or slower.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.590
He starts adding stuff,
puts things in the piano.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.380
It sounds cool, but only because
he knows how to play Bach,

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.960
because he's trained his
whole life to be a musician.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.420
So in the Butcher Ding story,
he also talks about how--

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:10.420
well, why can I do this?

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.710
I trained for 19
years as a butcher,

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.254
and that's why I'm
able to do that.

00:53:14.254 --> 00:53:15.170
So that's what I mean.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:17.461
None of this stuff-- it's
always against the background

00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:18.740
of training.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.930
And obviously in
the earlier stages

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:22.850
the carving and polishing
is more important.

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:27.170
You can't solo until you
learn how to master the thing.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.000
I think that that's where
the corrective Taoist

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.690
strategies of forgetting
or letting go,

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:36.260
they're really more appropriate
once you're a trained expert.

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.489
And now what you need
to do is stop thinking.

00:53:38.489 --> 00:53:39.530
And so there's actually--

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.320
I run through some of
the experimental evidence

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:49.437
that people who are good
golfers need to not think.

00:53:49.437 --> 00:53:51.020
So if you ask them
to think about what

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.478
they're doing when
they're putting,

00:53:52.478 --> 00:53:53.526
they overshoot the hole.

00:53:53.526 --> 00:53:56.150
If they're a baseball player and
you have them think about what

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.250
angle are you hitting the
ball-- think about the angle

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.870
you're using when
you hit the ball--

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.150
they don't hit as
well-- professionals.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.400
But novices do better
when they think.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.300
So they need to pay attention.

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.240
And so obviously which
one, whether you're

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.160
focusing on trying
or not trying,

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:16.760
depends on where you are in
that skill development training

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.515
course of knowledge acquisition.

00:54:18.515 --> 00:54:19.640
So you're absolutely right.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.556
I didn't emphasize the
training thing so much.

00:54:21.556 --> 00:54:23.720
But all of this is
against the background

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:28.100
of the fact that none of the
hot cognition that we value--

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.350
very little of it is inborn.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.370
It needs to be acquired.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.362
It needs to be trained.

00:54:33.362 --> 00:54:34.820
But once you have
the training, you

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:37.110
need to know when to
let your training go.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:37.710
Thanks.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.460
