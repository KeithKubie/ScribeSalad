00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.229
If you’re sick of your phone’s battery
dying when you need it most, there might be

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:04.770
good news around the corner.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.760
Scientists are working on a weird new way
to make your battery last longer.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.060
Hey guys, Amy here on DNews, and if you’re
anything like me you use your phone for a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.160
lot more than calling, things like emailing,
texting, posting to social media, and even

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.449
streaming videos.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.390
In all these phone-based activities, that
communication is made possible because our

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.289
phones connect to cell towers or Wi-Fi routers,
and those are both energy-intensive processes

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.100
that drain our batteries.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.310
Cell phones broadcast radio signals in all
directions at once, which gives the fastest

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.260
route to a nearby cell tower or router.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.540
But not all the radio waves reach a destination.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.660
Robert Lee, a professor of electrical and
computer engineering at Ohio State University,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.250
estimates that as much as 97 percent of cell
phone signals never get anywhere, they just

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.399
leave your phone and disappear into the ether.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.370
A team from Ohio State is on the case, working
on a way to recapture some of that lost energy

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.640
and redirect it back into the phone’s battery,
not to recharge it but to slow the speed at

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.140
which the battery drains.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.310
The idea of converting radio signals into
battery power may seem kinda out there but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.590
it’s actually not.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.380
Radio waves are really just a very high-frequency
form of alternating current or AC., just like

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.979
what a power grid supplies.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.889
But most devices need direct current or DC
to operate.

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.009
So for more than a century, electronics manufacturers
have installed an electrical circuit called

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.680
a rectifier to convert AC to DC.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.009
What the research team is hoping to do is
develop circuitry that could convert some

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.100
of the lost radio signals into direct current
power that would be directed back into the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.780
phone’s battery, recycling some of the lost
power.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.579
The team from Ohio State has come up with
a system to identify which radio signals are

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.420
being wasted and which can be harvested without
compromising the phone’s function, which

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.909
is good because this system will be a balancing
act.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.509
The trick is to siphon off just enough of
the radio signal to slow battery drainage

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.749
and extend its life without degrading the
quality of voice calls or data transmission.

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.709
And though this will only work when the phone
is transmitting, i.e. when you’re using

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.590
data rather than playing music or games offline,
those transmitting functions are the energy-gobbling

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.590
ones.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.130
And it should be said that this is a very
different way of extending your phone’s

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.909
life on a charge than simply coming up with
faster or more creative ways of charging your

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.250
phone like with solar panels or even harnessing
your body heat into energy, which are both

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.260
systems research teams around the world are
investigating to extend the lives of our smart

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.260
phones.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.569
The Ohio State team will likely develop their
system into a physical add-on to a phone before

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.180
hopefully working with manufacturers to incorporate
the circuitry directly into the device.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.219
So what would you guys do with a longer battery
life?
