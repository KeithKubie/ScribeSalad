00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.110
We have three expressions here.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.130
This is 2/3 times 7/8.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.700
The second expression
is 8/7 times 2/3.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.090
This third expression is
5 times 2 over 3 times 5.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.720
And what I want you to do is
pause this video right now

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.470
and think about which
of these expressions

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.400
is the largest, which one is in
the middle in terms of value,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.699
and which one is the smallest.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.740
And I want you to think
about it without actually

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.810
doing the calculation.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.210
If you could just look
at them and figure out

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.793
which of these is the largest,
which of these is the smallest,

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:33.360
and which of these
is in the middle.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.586
So pause the video now.

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:37.210
Now, you might have
taken a shot at it.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.460
And I'll give you a little
bit of a hint in case

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.590
you had trouble with it.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.850
All of these involve
multiplying something by 2/3.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.930
And you see a 2/3 here.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.495
You see a 2/3 here.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:52.150
And it might not be as obvious,
but you also see a 2/3 here.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.670
And let me rewrite that to
make it a little bit clearer.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.830
So this first expression could
be rewritten as 7/8 times 2/3.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.749
This second expression here
could be written as-- well,

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:09.426
it's already written
as 8/7 times 2/3.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.180
And then, this
last expression, we

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.760
could write it as, in
the numerator, 5 times 2.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.790
And then in the denominator,
it's over 5 times 3.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.670
5 times 3, which is of course
the same thing as 5/5 times

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.610
2/3.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.620
So you see, all three
of these expressions

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.936
involve something times 2/3.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:43.310
Now, looking at
it this way, does

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.268
it become easier to pick
out which of these are

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:47.237
the largest, which of
these are the smallest,

00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:49.070
and which of these are
someplace in between?

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.444
I encourage you
to pause it again

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.530
if you haven't
thought about it yet.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.820
So let's visualize each
of these expressions

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.710
by first trying
to visualize 2/3.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.570
So let's say the height of
what I am drawing right now,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.510
let's say the height of this
bar right over here is 2/3.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.650
So this right over
here represents 2/3.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.075
The height here is 2/3.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.990
So first, let's think about
what this one on the right

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.320
here represents.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.580
This is 5/5 times 2/3.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.750
Well, what's 5/5?

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.880
5/5 is the same thing as 1.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.805
This is literally
just 1 times 2/3.

00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:29.430
This whole expression
is the same thing

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.230
as 1 times 2/3, or
really, just 2/3.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.550
So this, the height
here, 2/3, this

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.950
is the same thing as
this thing over here.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.610
This is going to
be equal to-- this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.590
could also be viewed as
5 times 2 over 3 times

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.420
5, which was this first
expression right over here.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.720
Now, let's think about
what these would look like.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.630
So this is 7/8 times 2/3.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.340
So it's less than 8/8 times 2/3.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.570
It's less than 1 times 2/3.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.190
So we're going to
scale 2/3 down.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.470
This is going to
be less than 2/3.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.000
It's going to be 7/8 of 2/3.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.020
So this one right over here
would look something like this.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.295
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:19.580
Yeah, it would look
something like this.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.720
If the yellow height is 2/3,
then this right over here,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.400
then this height right over
here-- let me make it clear.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.709
This height right over here
would be 7/8 times 2/3.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.750
Likewise, let's look at
this one right over here.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.210
Let's look at this one in
the middle, 8/7 times 2/3.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.260
Well, 8/7 is bigger than 7/7.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.510
It's more than 1.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.270
This is more than 2/3.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.610
This is 1 and 1/7 times 2/3.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.200
So it's going to be the same
height as 2/3 plus another 1/7.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.020
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.200
It's going to look
something like this.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.520
So its height-- now we
scaled the 2/3 up because 8/7

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.420
is greater than 1.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.140
So this right over
here, this height

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.467
is going to be 8/7 times 2/3.

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.050
So the way that you
could have spotted

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.175
which of these is the
largest and which of these is

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:21.727
the smallest is to say, well,
how are they scaling 2/3?

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:23.560
This one right over
here, you're essentially

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.330
multiplying 2/3 by 1.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.820
So you're just going to get 2/3.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.980
You're not scaling it up, or
you aren't scaling it down.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.990
This one right over here,
you're scaling 2/3 down.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.580
You are multiplying it
by something less than 1.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.404
If you multiply it by
something less than 1,

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.070
then you're going to
be scaling it down.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.110
I should say, a positive
number or a number

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.692
between 0 and 1--
less than 1-- then

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:47.150
you're going to be
scaling it down.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.690
So this thing is scaled down.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.160
It's going to be the smallest.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.690
And here, you're multiplying
the 2/3 times a number

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.200
bigger than 1, by 1 and 1/7.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.740
So you're going to scale it up.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.520
So this expression is the
largest, 8/7 times 2/3.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.050
The smallest is 2/3 times 7/8.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.240
And this one right over
here is in between.
