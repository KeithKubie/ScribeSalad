00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:06.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.760
I'm Timothy Jordan and
welcome to the Developer Show.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.610
Another episode right
here from Google I/O 2016.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.398
Right now we're going to talk
to Rich from the material design

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:16.898
team.

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:18.350
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:22.360
Rich, thank you
for taking the time

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.000
to talk to us about
material design.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.500
RICHARD FULCHER: It's
what we love, right?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
this booth-- all you're

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.810
doing-- all of Google I/O
is material design reviews.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.867
Tell me what the deal is there.

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:32.700
RICHARD FULCHER: No.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.950
It's a great opportunity for
us to have developers come in,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.730
talk about their apps, their
experiences, what questions

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.140
they have, what issues
they're facing in design,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.304
and in particular, how they're
applying material design

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:46.470
to everything they're doing.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.386
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Great.

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:49.380
So give me the quick
synopsis-- what

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.960
is material design, for
the handful of you that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.792
don't know yet.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:54.250
RICHARD FULCHER:
So material design

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.690
is a design language
that's designed

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.970
to be incredibly responsive.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.110
It can work on a
variety of platforms.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.080
It can support a large number
of brands, any brand, not just

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.576
Google's brand.

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:05.950
And it is kind of
future looking.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.050
It makes heavy use of
motion design and animation

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.732
to bring the best possible
experience to all of our users.

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:13.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And it's beautiful.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.648
You probably needed
me to say that.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:15.970
But I think it's beautiful.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000
But a point you made that
I think is really key

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780
and one of the reasons why
these reviews are so helpful

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.800
is the material design is so
flexible in its application--

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.610
that your brand can really shine
through as the primary feeling.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.370
And yet you can still build
that on to the scaffolding

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.444
of material design.

00:01:31.444 --> 00:01:32.360
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.980
I think a lot of people
look at material.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.146
And they look at a lot of
the great apps from Google

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:38.730
and naturally think, oh, that's
what material looks like.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.100
But more and more we're
seeing just fantastic apps

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760
that are using material from
brands that are not Google

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.740
and that really strongly
express the brand's identity,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.760
the characteristics,
the kind of emotional

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.570
feel you want to
have out of a brand,

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.564
but still have that
foundational layer of material.

00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:54.980
So you're getting
all the benefits

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.110
of kind of good behaviors,
of accessible, intelligent,

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.830
obvious components,
and things like that.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.483
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.420
What are some of the resources
that they can visit online

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.759
to get some of the same reviews?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.050
RICHARD FULCHER: Oh, the best
place to start is just go

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.940
to google.com/design.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.490
That's where you can get the
material design guidelines is

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.534
some of what's there.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:19.200
But there's also a
lot of other content.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.725
There's tools like the icon
library, like the resizer.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, cool.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.140
Rich, thanks for
taking the time.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.348
RICHARD FULCHER: My pleasure.

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:25.850
Thanks.
