<i> LYNSEY: Pummeled
 with tank fire mortar rounds.</i>

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.575
<i> Riots for bread.</i>

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.377
<i> Women who tried
 to commit suicide</i>

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:45.645
<i> by setting
 themselves on fire.</i>

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.482
<i> Many, many women were
 dying in child birth.</i>

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.486
<i> I was kidnapped
 by Gaddafi's troops.</i>

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.890
<i> There was no place to hide.</i>

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.794
(applause)

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.369 line:0%
So I was 26 the first time
I went to Afghanistan.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:13.005 line:0%
And I had been
living in India at the time.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.208
And I had a roommate
who went to Afghanistan

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.710
under the Taliban
and he came back

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:20.013
and he said, "You know,
you are a woman.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.347
You should go to Afghanistan

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.282
and photograph women living
under the Taliban,

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:24.918
because no one's doing it."

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.819
And he didn't tell me

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.022
that photography
was illegal at the time,

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.391
that you couldn't photograph
any living thing.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.326
And that there was
no American Embassy,

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.063
and that the only
governing body was the Taliban,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.499
which was
ruled by Sharia law.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.770
But I was 26 and I didn't care,
and so, I went.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.240
And I took
some pictures of women.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.707
I kept my cameras in my bag,

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.843
and I ran around
to people's homes.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.478
And I went
to the hospitals--

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:55.415
this was
a women's hospital in 2000.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:59.118
There was no medicine,
very few doctors.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.553
This was a woman in labor.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.091
This is a very typical scene
on the streets of Kabul.

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.227
This was the capital
at the time.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.263
There were almost no cars.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.531
Women beggars were
really the only women

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.366
you would
ever see on the street.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.804
Any form of entertainment
was illegal.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.007
There was no music,
no television,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.541
and no cell phone.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:24.510
So, when I would go to
Afghanistan at the time,

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.712
I would literally fall off
the face of the planet.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.215
I would have no idea
what was happening

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:30.884
outside of Afghanistan.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.854
This scene happened.
I was out at a refugee camp

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.523
because there was
a drought in Herat,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.125
which was
western Afghanistan.

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:41.327
And I was with my driver
and he said,

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:42.795
"Madam, I have to go early,

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.430
because my brother
is getting married."

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.498
And I said, "Great.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.067
Let's go to your
brother's wedding."

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.035
So, he took me in.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:53.272
I brought one camera,
one lens and I hung out.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.942
And I had been on a street,
like the picture

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.042
you had just seen.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.111
And we descended
down these stairs

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.681
and the Titanic
was blasting.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.682
And men and women
were dancing together.

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.085
And this was all under
the Taliban in secret.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.656
About 9 years later,
National Geographic

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.992
assigned me to photograph
women in Afghanistan.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.527
And I spent about 2 years
photographing.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:18.031
And the changes
that had been made

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:19.132
were astonishing to me.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.734
I had been working
pretty much consistently

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:25.071
in Afghanistan since 2000,
so I went almost every year.

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:30.376
And my last trip
was about 5 months ago.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.812
This is a wedding.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.047
The man on the right
is the father of the groom

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:38.150
and he is a filmmaker
in Afghanistan.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:40.519
This is a typical scene
of a midwife.

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.788
This is
in Badakhshan Province.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.991
And that province
has very few roads.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.561
So, many, many women die
in childbirth in Afghanistan,

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.030
mostly because of the
lack of access to hospitals

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:52.231
and doctors.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.800
So, what you see
here is a woman,

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:58.504
a midwife from Merlin,
and she would go out

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.006
into very remote villages

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.907
and they would make
an announcement at the mosque.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:04.543
And pregnant women
and women with young children

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.379
would come
and meet with her.

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:08.781
And after spending
about two weeks

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.684
in Badakhshan Province,
I was driving back to Fayzabad,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.286
which is the capital.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:16.021
And I notice these two women
on the side of the mountain.

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:17.356
And I said,
"That's strange,

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.091
there's no man
with those women."

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.128
And anyone who's worked
extensively in Afghanistan

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:24.897
knows that there was always
a man with the women.

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.567
So we stop the car
and Dr. Zieba,

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.837
who was my translator
and an amazing Afghan woman,

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.072
she jumped out
and we ran up the mountain

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.474
and she said,
"What's going on?"

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.009
And the woman
on the right was in labor,

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.378
and her water
had just broken.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:43.082
And they had rented a car
and her husband's first wife

00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:44.383
had died in childbirth.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.420
And he was so determined
to not have a second wife die

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.221
in childbirth
that he rented this car,

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:51.824
and they were driving
from their village to Fayzabad,

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.859
the capital,
and their car broke down.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.561
And so I said, "Get in my car

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.162
and I'll take you
to the hospital."

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.297
And they said, "We can't.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.132
We need the permission
of her husband."

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.502
And so I said, "Dr. Zieba,
go find the husband."

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:03.936
And fortunately
there was a one road

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.605
that led throughout
the whole province.

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.740
So, she took our car
and she found

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:10.109
the husband.
They all came in my car,

00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.177
and she delivered.

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:13.078
Everyone always
asks me if I took--

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.248
if I have
pictures of her delivering.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.482
And I stopped
photographing at the point

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:20.119
that I left them,
that I put them in my car,

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.087
because I changed the story
as a journalist

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.589
and I didn't feel like it
was ethical

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:25.825
to keep photographing.

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:28.126
Many women in Afghanistan
end up in prison

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:32.999
simply for asking for a divorce,
for doing things

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.134
that in the west,
we would see

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.903
as not justifiable
to end up in prison.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.905
This is Mida Hall.
She was married

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:41.907
at a very young age to a man
who was decades

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.042
older than her.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:46.679
He was handicapped,
so every day her duties

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.082
as a wife were to bathe him
and to take care of him

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.283
and feed him.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.987
When she was 21,
she asked for a divorce

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:57.490
and she was thrown in prison
by his brothers.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.760
This is a young woman.

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:03.762
Women in Afghanistan
who are unhappy

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.266
or who are ashamed,
they don't take a gun

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.869
and try and commit suicide
the way that we would try to

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:12.371
or that's more typical
in the west.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:13.872
They set themselves
on fire.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.775
And many of those
women don't die.

00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:19.411
So, I did a series
for<i> The New York Times</i>

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.013
on women who tried
to commit suicide

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.814
by setting themselves
on fire.

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.550
This young woman
had been accused

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:27.753
by her neighbors of stealing.
And she was so ashamed

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.188
that she tried
to kill herself.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.290
And she died a few days
after that picture.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.461
With the Americans
in Afghanistan,

00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:38.364
one thing they tried
to do was train up

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.998
a police force of women.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:43.136
And this is at a shooting range
outside of Kabul.

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:47.506
Education has really
picked up in Kabul,

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:49.174
that's something
when I first I used to go,

00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:52.245
there were secret girl schools
in people's homes,

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.712
hidden from the Taliban.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.714
And now you see
women graduating.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.884
This is a women's
boxing team.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.388
This is a woman
in parliament.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.025
They're women in parliament,
sorry.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:10.095
There are soap operas with women
and women actresses.

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:13.499
This is a soap opera set,
in Kabul.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:15.368
This is Trina.
She is an actress.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:18.404
She did soap operas
and she was also in some movies.

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:23.810
So, in 2009 and 2010,
I accompanied the Marines'

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.645
female engagement teams,
throughout Helmand Province.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:29.114
This was a program,
started by the Marines,

00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:32.150
to have American women
engage Afghan women,

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:33.719
because
many of the Marines--

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:37.056
all the Marines operating
in Helmand Province were men.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.291
And there was
a whole 50% of the society,

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:42.161
they couldn't--
they couldn't engage.

00:07:42.227 --> 00:07:43.895
And they couldn't go
into people's homes.

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:47.767
So, they brought women in.
And they had them

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.835
talk to Afghan women,
look at them

00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:52.371
for basic medical treatment.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:53.906
It was
fascinating for me,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.875
because I had been
embedding with the military

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:59.544
for many, many years,
but I was always the only woman.

00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:00.813
So, it was the first time

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.615
that I was able to be
around women,

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.951
to go around and see
how they operate

00:08:06.017 --> 00:08:07.820
in this hostile environment.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.324
This is a female
Blackhawk Pilot, Jesse.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.426
And she used to go in
and pick up the injured.

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:16.062
She was working
with the Medevac Team.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:20.465
This is them, training.

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:23.135
This is
all in Helmand Province:

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:25.004
cleaning their guns,

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.705
relaxing at night.

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:28.007
And it was the first time--
You know,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.574
usually when I embed
with the military,

00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.376
there's no place
for me to sleep.

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:32.978
It's always
this big crisis,

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:36.148
where is the female journalist
gonna sleep.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:38.017
And so, I finally
was able to sleep

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.186
in a normal cot
with a bunch of women,

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:42.821
which was really fun.

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:45.457
And I loved seeing them
still try and do their makeup

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.427
and be feminine
even on the front lines.

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:49.995
And we patrolled.

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:51.097
And we were shot at.

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:53.699
This was before 2013,

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:57.536
when women were allowed
on the frontlines.

00:08:57.602 --> 00:09:00.739
So, this is all in 2010.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.208
(audience laughing)

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:04.677
I love this picture.

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:10.416
In 2009, I was given
a MacArthur Fellowship

00:09:10.483 --> 00:09:13.352
and I wanted to focus on
maternal mortality,

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.588
and why women die
in childbirth.

00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:17.189
And so--

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:19.125
And it's a body of work
that I have been doing

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.959
now for about 5 years.

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:23.896
I went to Sierra Leone,
to photograph

00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:26.031
in the Magburaka
government hospital.

00:09:26.097 --> 00:09:28.467
It was a place that I knew
many, many women

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:29.701
were dying in childbirth.

00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:33.005
I went there one day
and met Mama Sise.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.507
She was a woman
who was pregnant with twins.

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:38.076
She gave birth to the first twin
in the village,

00:09:38.143 --> 00:09:40.312
and the second twin
wouldn't come out.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:43.015
So, she took
a canoe across the river.

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.516
There was
an ambulance waiting

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.817
for her across the river.

00:09:45.884 --> 00:09:48.587
And she drove about
4 hours, across bumpy roads,

00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:49.821
to get to the hospital.

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:51.690
And this is when I met her.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.493
She had delivered the first baby
about 24 hours earlier.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.095
She was so scared
and tired to push,

00:09:57.162 --> 00:10:00.365
because she was
just exhausted.

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:02.935
And she finally gave birth
and the baby was--

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:05.937
I thought, was still born.
But the nurses spent about

00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:08.207
45 minutes
resuscitating the baby.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.510
And they have
very little there.

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:13.011
They don't have
traditional machines

00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:15.781
like we do that can--
oxygen and everything.

00:10:15.848 --> 00:10:17.683
They're literally
smacking the baby

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.252
and trying to bring the baby
back to life.

00:10:20.318 --> 00:10:23.589
In that time, Mama Sise
started bleeding.

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:24.957
I thought there was
something wrong,

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:27.326
but I'm not a doctor,
I'm just a photo-journalist.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:29.761
And so I kept asking,
"Why is she bleeding so much?"

00:10:29.828 --> 00:10:31.831
And they were just
mopping up the blood

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.966
and saying she's fine.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.468
Finally, I went
to go get the doctor,

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:36.669
and he was in surgery.

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:39.104
When I came back,
her blood pressure was down

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:41.240
to 60 over 40.

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:43.676
They picked her up
and carried her across

00:10:43.742 --> 00:10:45.444
the hospital
where the doctor was.

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.980
There was one doctor
in the entire province.

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.418
And by the time
she got there, she died.

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:56.055
This is her sister
who was also a midwife,

00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:58.324
who had arranged
to send her that ambulance

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.992
because
she didn't want her to die.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.662
This is the mother finding out
that her daughter

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.965
has just died.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:09.301
And this is in the ambulance.
I went home with her body...

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:12.037
and photographed the rituals

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:14.439
surrounding her death

00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:16.408
and her burial.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.911
So, two years later
I got a call from Doctors

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:20.378
Without Borders, MSF.

00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:22.848
And they said, "We saw
the story you did.

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:26.618
And since then we've put
five ambulances in Bo province,"

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.721
in this one province
next to that province

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.022
I'd been in.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:33.024
And they offer 24 hour
emergency service

00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.294
to women in Sierra Leone,
in that province,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.463
and they gave
each of the small clinics

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.064
in the villages a radio.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.166
So, when a woman
went into the clinic

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.901
with complications,

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.470
they could call
for an ambulance.

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:46.205
And they said, "With that,
we've reduced

00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:49.642
the maternal mortality rate
by 60%."

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.379
( indistinct chattering )

00:12:21.106 --> 00:12:24.009
( indistinct chattering
continues )

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.453 line:0%
( speaking
in foreign language )

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:14.186
<i> You're almost there.</i>

00:14:58.296 --> 00:15:00.900
( Aboriginals singing )

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.549
( speaking
in foreign language )

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.310
( baby crying )

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.461 line:0%
( Aboriginals singing )

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:34.820
( applause )

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:41.393
In 2011--
It was February of 2011,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.063
and I had watched
the Arab Spring unfold from--

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:47.565
On TV
while I was sitting in Iraq.

00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:49.734
And when I was in Afghanistan,

00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:53.238
and then, Bahrain.
I was always in the wrong place.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.040
So, I called
<i> The New York Times</i>

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:57.075
and I said,
"I am going to Libya,

00:17:57.141 --> 00:17:58.977
whether you want
to send me or not."

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:01.346
So, I went to Libya.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:04.616
Like most journalists,
I crossed illegally

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:07.619
from Egypt into Eastern Libya.

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:10.055
That was really
the only way to do it,

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.457
because any journalist
who wants to cover an uprising,

00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:13.492
the government generally

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.926
doesn't want
journalists there.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.728
So, you have to sneak in.

00:18:16.794 --> 00:18:19.864
When I got there,
it was very euphoric.

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:22.668
People were really celebrating
the uprising.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.770
A parallel government
was being set up.

00:18:25.837 --> 00:18:29.874
There were demonstrations.
People were really happy.

00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:32.911
They thought Gaddafi
was gonna fall quickly.

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:35.013
They called people
to fight against

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.084
Gaddafi's troops,
and they were clearly untrained.

00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:41.085
There were doctors,
engineers,

00:18:41.152 --> 00:18:44.123
teachers, learning
how to use weapons.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.659
Immigrants were fleeing.

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:50.361
People who had gone to
Libya to work, were trying

00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:51.997
to get boats out
of the country.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.032
They felt that the fighting
was imminent.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:58.670
And in Benghazi,
there was really an
air of tension.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.239
About a week
after I got there,

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.174
some rebels started
pushing forward

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.042
towards the front line.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.810
And a handful
of photographers--

00:19:05.877 --> 00:19:09.280
It's always the
crazy photographers
who go forward.

00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:12.717
We started moving forward
with Gaddafi's troops.

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.686
We ended up
on the front line.

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.221
This is Ra's Lanuf.

00:19:16.287 --> 00:19:19.090
What you see in the background
is an oil refinery.

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:21.426
And we followed them,
as cities fell

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.729
from Gaddafi's hands
into rebel hands.

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.530
They went in,
they would shoot out

00:19:25.596 --> 00:19:27.900
pictures of Gaddafi,
go into homes.

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.236
The fighting was really
disproportionate.

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:35.106
Gaddafi had a trained military,
and we were with the rebels.

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:38.676
So, this is an example of --
We were on the front line.

00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:41.146
It was one road
that sliced through the desert,

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.513
from west to east.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.783
One day,
we were on the front line

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:47.152
when a helicopter gunship
came in directly

00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:49.454
above us and started spraying
the ground around us with

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.290
.50 caliber bullets,
like this big.

00:19:52.356 --> 00:19:55.927
They had to fight back
with Kalashnikovs.

00:19:55.993 --> 00:19:57.929
Some of the soldiers--
Some of the rebels

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:00.299
were throwing
rocks up into the air.

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:02.734
Many times,
they just turned around

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:05.904
and fled when Gaddafi's
military approached.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.373
We had been
sort of spoiled by being

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.076
with the American military,
the Marines in Afghanistan

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:13.611
and Iraq.
And it was very different.

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:15.880
This particular day,
we were being pummeled

00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:17.916
with tank fire, mortar rounds.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.584
We would just
follow the front line,

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.219
as it pushed back
and forward.

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.588
We were really trying to get
a sense of what was happening.

00:20:23.654 --> 00:20:26.557
And it was before
the no-fly zone was
put in place.

00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:28.593
So, as journalists,
we really wanted to show

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:30.528
what was happening so that--

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:34.266
While the no-fly zone
was being deliberated,

00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:36.201
we can provide
a firsthand picture

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:37.936
of what was happening
on the ground.

00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.473
The rebels were
really getting injured

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:43.175
and killed around us.

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:45.744
The fighting was
very, very intense.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:47.246
There was no place to hide.

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:51.082
We would be on the front line
and we would hear

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:53.618
the hum of an aircraft.
And you would literally

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:56.854
just hope that the bomb
didn't land on top of you.

00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:58.323
Cower in fear.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.192
This particular bomb
landed about 100, 200 feet

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.295
from where we were
standing.

00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:07.299
And we pushed forward with them,
as they took more ground.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.600
Several days
after that I took this picture,

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:11.436
I was kidnapped by
Gaddafi's troops

00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:14.072
with three other journalists
for<i> The New York Times.</i>

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:16.942
So, that was the last picture
in that series.

00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:21.213
Luckily, I had a premonition
that something might happen,

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.849
so I sent a hard drive out
with a colleague

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.284
and said,
"if I get taken,

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:28.019
please send this
to my agency."

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:30.889
And that's how I was able
to salvage all my pictures.

00:21:30.955 --> 00:21:34.192
Last year, I wanted to cover
what was happening in Syria.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:37.962
But my family begged me
not to go into Syria.

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:40.298
So, I started covering
the refugee crisis.

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:44.135
I've made eight trips
to the region: Turkey,

00:21:44.202 --> 00:21:47.138
Jordan, Lebanon,
Northern Iraq,

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.840
and I did go
once into Syria.

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.243
And so, this is
a collection of photos

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.312
with the Syrian refugees.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:57.282
These are refugees streaming
into Northern Iraq.

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:01.219
And this is them
waiting for handouts

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:03.388
in Northern Iraq,
after arriving.

00:22:03.454 --> 00:22:05.489
This is a food distribution
in Zaatari,

00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:08.460
when there were
riots for bread.

00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:10.561
This is a family
arriving in Zaatari

00:22:10.628 --> 00:22:12.731
for the first time,

00:22:12.797 --> 00:22:14.532
and when they're getting

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:17.969
registered with the
United Nations, in Zaatari.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:21.606
And a family sleeping outside,
at dawn, in Iraq.

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:26.544
This is a funeral
for a rebel fighter.

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:27.579
And they're cooking.

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.449
The body was still in Syria,
but this is the family cooking.

00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:34.419
People were
living in caves, in Lebanon.

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:37.422
I went back to these caves
several months ago,

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:40.758
and the families have all been
moved into makeshift camps.

00:22:40.825 --> 00:22:42.127
There are no camps in Lebanon,

00:22:42.193 --> 00:22:43.962
because
the Lebanese government is--

00:22:44.028 --> 00:22:46.965
Does not want
formal camps set up.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:49.167
This is at a bread distribution,
in Zaatari.

00:22:50.101 --> 00:22:52.537
And these are the camps on the
Syrian side of the border.

00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:54.572
People were
living in raw sewage.

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:57.775
There were no NGOs
working there except IHH,

00:22:57.842 --> 00:23:00.145
a Turkish NGO at the time.

00:23:00.211 --> 00:23:02.147
And this is in Syria.

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:05.516
He was a former fighter
and he was living in a school

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:06.951
with his family.

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:10.755
This is outside of
a smuggler's village in Turkey.

00:23:10.821 --> 00:23:13.124
I was waiting to try
and photograph

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:16.094
the exodus of refugees
coming out of Syria.

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:18.196
And it's a picture
that's very, very difficult

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:19.597
to get as a photographer now,

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.566
because all of the neighboring
countries have really

00:23:21.632 --> 00:23:23.134
shut down their borders.

00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:26.637
So, I stood outside
of the smuggler's village,

00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:28.572
because I knew
that they were crossing there.

00:23:28.639 --> 00:23:30.708
And every hour or so,
someone would come up

00:23:30.775 --> 00:23:31.710
to me and say,
"Get out of here,

00:23:31.776 --> 00:23:32.743
we're gonna kill you."

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.545
And one guy came up
to me and he said,

00:23:34.612 --> 00:23:36.481
"I'm gonna
go get my knife."

00:23:36.547 --> 00:23:37.915
Another guy
came up to me and said,

00:23:37.982 --> 00:23:40.518
"Just wait until dark,
because when dark comes,

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.919
you'll see all the refugees."

00:23:41.986 --> 00:23:44.189
So, I put my cameras in my bag
and I waited.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.992
And, of course, at dark
they all started streaming out.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:51.563
This is
a family living in a camp

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.731
across from a formal camp,
in Turkey.

00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:56.367
They were literally
living under the trees.

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:57.836
And this is
that same camp.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.740
I just want to show you
a few on-assignment pictures,

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:03.941
because I think it's funny.

00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:07.345
This was me in 2001,
in Pakistan.

00:24:07.411 --> 00:24:09.914
This is me,
in Fallujah.

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:13.952
Crossing illegally into Darfur,
to cover the war in Darfur.

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:15.987
We had to walk
for three kilometers,

00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:17.622
most of that through wadis.

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:20.458
This is--

00:24:20.525 --> 00:24:22.360
We had lived on the
back of this pickup truck

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:26.064
for five days, driving through
the desert in Darfur.

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:28.632
This is the Korangal Valley,
in Afghanistan.

00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:30.735
I was embedded
with the 173rd.

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:34.138
That's me and my colleague,
in Afghanistan.

00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:36.274
That's me
and that same colleague.

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:38.275
( laughter )

00:24:38.776 --> 00:24:41.278
Sort of like
being an actor.

00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:43.715
And this is us hiding
in that silo, in Libya,

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:44.983
on the front line.

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.219
And this is us
on the front line.

00:24:48.285 --> 00:24:50.088
That's me with Tyler Hicks.

00:24:50.154 --> 00:24:51.322
And we were taken together.

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:53.592
That's Gary Cosgrove
and Nikki Sobecki.

00:24:54.726 --> 00:24:58.462
And this is an example of
where we stay typically,

00:24:58.562 --> 00:25:00.097
in Libya, on the front line.

00:25:00.164 --> 00:25:02.566
People-- Libyans would
just open their homes

00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:04.235
to journalists
who were there.

00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:06.304
And for example,
in this particular house,

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.472
there were
17 journalists sleeping.

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:10.408
And every night ,
we got a knock on the door

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:13.712
at about 6:00, and it was
a 10-year-old Libyan boy.

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.613
He would come
with a giant tray of food

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.315
and just set it down and leave.

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:19.684
And so, the women who were
still in the village would

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.486
cook for us every night.

00:25:21.552 --> 00:25:23.588
And on the upper right
is Anthony Shadid.

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.424
He is a colleague,
and he died in Syria last year

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:27.926
of an asthma attack.

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.029
And that's it.

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:32.831
( applause )
