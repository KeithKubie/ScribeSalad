Gabriel: So good afternoon. I'm Gabriel Stricker,
Director of Communications

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.929
and Public Affairs here at Google and I'd
like to welcome all of you who are

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:16.030
here and who are tuning in to our latest Authors@Google
installment of "Behind

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.849
the Wheel of a Bookmobile." "Behind the Wheel
of a Bookmobile" is really, uh --

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:28.009
and if you can see it here is a quixotic journey
that was conceived by the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:37.110
renaissance man Tom Corwin who purchased a
classic bookmobile, stocked it with

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.120
thousands of books, and is about to drive
it across the country, uh, along with

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.300
a series of notable authors including Dave
Eggers, Michael Pollan, Tom Robbins,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.780
Amy Tan, Scott Turow, and many others. Tom
actually has two here with him

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.350
today, the acclaimed author Jane Ganahl and
author and Emmy-winning actor Peter

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.740
Coyote as well. And after today's talk Tom
is going to be interviewing some

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.110
people, uh, who will be giving him comments
about their reflections on books

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.580
and -- and bookmobiles and certainly if you
guys have any thoughts on that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.650
you're welcome to talk to Tom and his crew.
But without further ado, let me

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.890
introduce and welcome back to the Googleplex
the author, producer, musician, and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.980
dog whisperer, Tom Corwin.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.980
[Applause]

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:47.000
Tom: Hello. Thanks for coming. So, umm, I'm
gonna tell you a little bit about

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.760
the evolution of this project and then, uh,
get Peter and Jane up and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.460
hopefully maybe we can all participate in
a conversation. Umm, so I -- I would

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.930
say what one thing that I feel strongly about
in life is sort of following the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.349
muse and it has led me some unusual places,
none more unusual than this. Umm,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.779
but just as a matter of introduction I'm primarily
a musician and music producer

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:21.540
in this life and these are, uh, some of the
projects I've worked on and, uh, and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.790
then at some point I actually wrote an e-mail
which beckoned to become a book --

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.239
something I had never considered doing before,
publishing a book -- umm, but it

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.389
sort of happened, I followed it, and that
turned into two books, "Mr. Fooster"

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:44.900
and, umm, "Mostly Bob" and, umm, and then
I was at dinner one night with a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.989
friend of mine named Peter Laufer and he shared
this idea he had to, uh, extend

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.480
his personal library in his house which was
just overflowing by buying a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.969
bookmobile and he sits down at dinner, he
has this ad with him and he says, you

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.120
know, I found it -- I had this idea and I
found this bookmobile for sale online

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.129
and, uh, I got all excited about it and then
found out that it was actually too

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.319
big to fit in my backyard. And I just got
 -- I just sort of lit up and got all

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.180
excited about the bookmobile and by the end
of dinner had actually come up with

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.780
this concept of having authors drive it across
the country and interviewing readers

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.299
about the books that have touched their lives
and I became so possessed by it I

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.269
haven't stopped yet. I actually went to Gurnee,
Illinois, where this bookmobile

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.129
was actually in service until about eight
months ago and, uh, purchased this

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.541
bookmobile. And, umm, so then while we were
there, of course, the project

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.510
started. I -- it had to interview the bookmobile
librarians who had driven this

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.309
bookmobile for the last 18 years and hear
some of their stories and -- which are

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:09.419
really powerful and I found out not only is
the bookmobile itself, you know,

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.279
really important vehicle of enlightenment
and transformation but there's some

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:20.509
magic that happens between bookmobile librarians
and, uh, and the people who

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.240
patronize them. Like, they really feel a connection
to a sense -- and a sense

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.030
of purpose which is moving. Umm, this is Audrey,
who drove my bookmobile for 18

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.830
years and was pretty sentimental about its
leaving the premises. Umm, so then I

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.530
started calling and actually some authors
and the first author I called happened to

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.530
be,
uh, a friend of mine named Peter Coyote and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.810
I said, Pete, I have this crazy
idea, you know, what do you think? And he

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.710
said, that is fabulous. Sign me up.
And, umm, so that was just this wonderful

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.960
confirmation and -- and I continued
making calls and then I -- my friend Jane

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.789
Ganahl, who founded Litquake, San
Francisco literary festival, sort of climbed

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.900
on, has been an amazing supporter,
has really helped with a lot of outreach which

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.289
has, you know, led to these --
this amazing list of authors who've signed

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:30.289
on to be part of it. So I, uh -- I
then proceeded to sort of do a launch event,

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.250
uh, at the American Library
Association convention and I brought a film

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.720
crew there and we invited people
onto the bookmobile and we did this christening.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.580
Uh, what this photo misses is
the first swing of the champagne bottle which

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.240
just sorta clunked on the bumper
without breaking. A great moment. But -- and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.660
so we shot for the day and it was
quite lovely and at the end of the day, uh,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.139
the cameras are all put away and,
uh, this man walks up to me and says, you

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.810
know, I saw your bookmobile from the
floor of the convention. It looks just like

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.240
the one from my childhood. Would it
be okay if I stepped on? And I said, you know,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.150
of course, and I motioned to the
camera man, this looks like this is an interview.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.410
He said, you know,
everything's put away, it's out in the car.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.430
&gt;&gt; I couldn't go to the public --

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.900
Tom: Excuse me. And so I pulled my, uh, flip
camera out of my pocket and

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.509
handed it to the camera man and he stands
behind me and, uh, Ralph Eubanks

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.440
begins to tell me how growing up in Mississippi
he was not allowed on the

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.789
bookmobile -- excuse me, was not allowed in
the library as a black man, as a

00:06:45.789 --> 00:07:01.849
black child but he was allowed on the bookmobile.
&gt;&gt; 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:16.340
So I couldn't go to the public library in
my town but I could go to the

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:27.699
bookmobile and it was a white driver of -- white
driver and librarian as a pair

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.389
and they came to my house and it didn't matter
to them what color we were but we

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.780
could get books and we read. I still remember
getting "Across Five Aprils"

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.690
about the Civil War, I got "Johnny Tremain",
"Lad a Dog". We'd sit there and

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.860
kinda sit in the corner in the back and flip
through the books and my sister's

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.919
on the floor of the bookmobile deciding which
books we were going to get. And

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:56.240
if they didn't have something, we would -- they
would recommend books to us and

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.300
they'd say, well, we'll bring it the next
time we come. And I'd sit in the

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.969
backyard, under a big shade tree and read
those books. It absolutely shaped me

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.650
in a powerful way. It -- it showed me that
 -- that reading could take you

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.451
places, you know, very far away. It was a
very remote rural place so I'm -- I

00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:08.451
mean, I'd take these trips in these books.
Being a reader really helped me

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:09.451
become a writer and it was a bookmobile that
played a big role in it.

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:12.509
Tom: So, uh, the punch line is that Ralph
Eubanks not only grew up to be a

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.889
writer but he is currently the Director of
Publishing for the Library of

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:22.310
Congress. So it was really, uh, quite amazing,
the bookmobile's role in his

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:29.259
life. So, you know, the idea is to hit the
road and interview readers and

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.890
authors behind the wheel of the bookmobile.
So I picked up the bookmobile in

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:40.060
Chicago and drove it back to San Francisco
in October. I just wanna touch on a

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:47.730
few of those, uh, moments that happened along
the way. This is a good one.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.730
[Laughing]

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.580
Tom: Umm, and then, you know, I always believed
that part of the -- the ark of

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.940
this story, which will have to prove itself
in the telling and -- or in the

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.791
making is that, you know, we're gonna -- there's
gonna be bumps along the way

00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:12.390
and, umm, this is not one of them, actually.
This is actually a story of one of

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.210
the people I interviewed along the way, a
guy named Rob Goldhor, who had just

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:22.700
returned from Afghanistan and he spoke to
me about how a friend of his who was a

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.750
graduate student at Brown just sort of took
it upon themselves to collect books

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.510
from friends and send them to him at the base
and that he sort of inadvertently

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:40.920
became the base librarian, and, uh, and how
books really were this amazing, you

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.440
know, touch point to home and how powerful
that was. And I interviewed Rob on

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.130
the bookmobile and he was so eloquent about
the -- the importance of -- of

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.170
reading, you know, in the middle of a desert
and how that really became a thing

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.580
that kept him grounded and connected. And,
umm, that interview is on the web

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:07.750
site if you, uh, if you take a look at bookmobiletravels.com.
So now we get on

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.950
to the travails. I decided to -- I was thinking,
hey, yeah, we'll cross the

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.840
continental divide fresh outta Boulder and
I got about 35 minutes up the grade

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.740
and the bookmobile just completely overheated
and I was, uh, amused to find out

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:30.260
when I pulled over and opened the hood that
I was actually at Buffalo Bill's

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.930
grave site. So it made for a great -- great
shot at which point we had to

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.040
renegotiate -- re-navigate our route and,
uh, pick the lower country for the

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:49.620
route home. We hit blizzards and then we came
to the salt flats and I thought,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.970
ah. I don't know if you've ever been to the
salt flats but I hadn't and they

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.160
are spectacularly beautiful and I was just
thinking and I thought how great it would

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.630
be to get
photographs of the bookmobile on the salt

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.490
flats. And I really -- I just
couldn't contain myself so I literally drove

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.980
up over the sidewalk and down into
the salt flats with the bookmobile and got

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:18.110
some pretty photos which was awesome
and some -- some great footage of the bookmobile

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:24.260
disappearing into the white
horizon. And then of course on the way out

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.760
the plot thickened and the
bookmobile sunk into the sand on the periphery

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.160
of the salt flats and, umm --
which turned into, uh, the most amazing scene

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.840
 -- which you'll see in the movie.
Stay tuned -- where, you know, the first tow

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.470
truck comes and hitched up its
winch and when it turned on the winch instead

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.491
of the bookmobile coming to the
tow truck, the tow truck comes to the bookmobile.

00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:57.470
Then they go home and come up
with the next machine and we end up with the

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.240
mud cat.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240
[Laughing]

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.270
Tom: And meanwhile there is, you know, great
characters who are showing up, uh,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.680
the truck drivers who were stopping at the
rest stop were standing with their

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.574
arms crossed 'cause we were the best show
in town at the -- at that rest stop

00:12:14.574 --> 00:12:20.980
and the, uh, tow truck driver and just wonderful
characters including this man

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.750
who ended up being our savior, uh, in orchestrating
sort of -- as an orchestra

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:33.870
conductor telling two tow trucks, me, and
my camera person what to do to sort of

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:40.670
finally angle us out of that shot -- that
spot. Umm, and, you know, everybody

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.540
we run into of course we -- we try to interview
and this guy was a wonderful

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:53.570
sort of soft spoken cowboy and. Umm, and so
I invited him on and he was looking

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.420
at books and I said, you know, can you tell
me, is there a book that you

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.780
remember from your childhood that was, you
know, especially powerful that's had

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:12.121
some meaning in your life? And he said, yep.
Still got it in the truck. And I

00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:19.080
was like, yes, you know? So what -- what book
is that? He said, the Bible.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.670
And, uh, I was just great. I mean, that's
true for of course a lot of people.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.220
I mean, that's absolutely true what an amazing
book that is and -- and I said,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.850
are there other books that you like to read?
And he goes, yep. I really like

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:41.640
Stephen King. So, umm, you know, he took a
Stephen King novel when he left and he

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.952
was just amazing and he was so generous and
so helpful and, you know, there had

00:13:45.952 --> 00:13:51.940
been a lot of great characters along the way
and it's -- it's been really fun

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.720
already, you know, in the preliminary journey
to hear these personal stories and

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.170
how books have really been the catalyst for
change in people's lives and -- and

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.870
for staying connected to themselves and being
exposed to a world that's a lot

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.050
bigger than the one that they live in. So
that's the essence of "Behind the

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:19.240
Wheel of a Bookmobile" and, umm, now I'm gonna
invite, uh, Jane Ganahl, the

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.800
fabulous author and founder of Litquake, the
San Francisco literary festival, and

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.920
Peter Coyote up to the front of the room and
we're just gonna invite everybody really

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.761
to participate in a conversation about sort
of how storytelling and

00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:42.500
literature is sort of in the -- inexorably
connected to community and these

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.530
things really are powerful anchor points.
So thank you.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.530
[Applause]

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:59.920
Jane: I thought we could start -- can you
hear me -- but that's okay. I

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:18.730
thought we would start talking about storytelling
and how, umm, the one thing

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.320
that -- the common thread that seems to run
through all the aspects of

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.870
bookmobile was storytelling. We're filming
this for a documentary and we were

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.740
having authors come on board to tell their
stories to readers and we're asking

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.320
readers to tell their stories to authors.
And I guess my question is, why do

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
you think storytelling is still so important
and so relevant in 2010?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.340
Tom: Uh, I think that, you know, stories are
really largely what connect us. I

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:43.470
mean, there's something very powerful about
story, umm, as a means for getting

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:49.510
insight into someone else's life in a nonintrusive
way and a story is powerful

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:55.530
and -- and has incredible depth and it's not
challenging to listen to a story.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.230
And I think, you know, I'm -- one of the things
I'm especially excited about in

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:07.380
this project is really the readers' stories.
You know, I'm very interested in

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.920
the authors' stories of course as well but
I'm really interested in the human

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.360
story and how books and literature are our
catalyst for experience. And I

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.440
think, umm, you know, hearing from readers
and connecting authors and readers on

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:31.490
their common love of story has the power to
move us all in new directions.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:39.190
Pete: I'll tell you a really short story.
A really well-known old Jewish actor

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:43.910
checks himself into an old-age home and the
first night he's there he dresses in

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.610
a tuxedo and he puts on his best shirt and
he decides to go down check the

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:55.240
action. He goes down in the lobby and he sees
a really elegant lady, late 70s

00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:02.010
early 80s, and he sidles up to her and he
says, young lady, do you know who I

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:07.379
am? She looks him up and down, she says, ask
the desk clerk. He'll tell you.

00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:08.940
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:16.050
Pete: Perfect story; right? Sets up expectations,
sets a scene, you get a

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.090
character and then the rug's pulled out from
under you and you see the essential

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:26.780
ambivalence in a really simple situation.
I actually think that storytelling

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:35.830
is part of our DNA, that stories are part
of information transfer about what

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.230
human hardware is about and that the way we
make sense of the world is by

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:46.160
telling stories and communicating and there's
no culture on earth that doesn't

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.880
and the technology is not really adding anything
to the storytelling. It's

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:59.650
just changing the medium. So every movie,
every novel, every music video, every

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:07.160
successful song is just a -- a different mechanism
for basically transmitting

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.070
something about what it feels like to be alive
and I think that you can't be

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.570
human and not do that.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:21.800
Jane: Umm, those of you who don't know Peter
Coyote very well wouldn't know

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:27.890
that -- I don't think it's working but whatever.
It's fine. Umm, he -- Pete

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:34.450
was a very act -- is a very active on the
political side, too, and I think

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.360
there's a correlation sort of talking about
our own personal experiences via

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.410
Twitter, today I had a really good day versus
what he does which is forward

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.620
frequently, almost close to a daily basis
from time to time, things that he

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.760
finds interesting about the world and stories
that you should know about and,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.250
uh, to me that's sort of a different kind
of storytelling. It's like, this is

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:01.310
what I think you should know about because
this is important to me in my -- in

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:06.240
my universe. So I guess that's the digital
version of -- of storytelling and,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.380
uh, and high-tech --

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:14.230
Pete: And it has a shadow and we gotta talk
about the shadow. Umm, the -- a

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.380
virtual community doesn't bring you soup when
you're sick and a virtual

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:24.950
community doesn't bury you when you die and
one of the things I've actually just

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:30.710
stopped about a month ago I went to a long
 -- week-long zen retreat and one of

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:36.600
the things I resolved to do was to stop forwarding
all my e-mails because I was

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.540
not doing the essential work that I can really
do which was finish a political

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.770
book. I was sending everybody else's literature
around. And one of the

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.660
reasons that I wrote this book is I wrote
it for my son's generation who's about

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:57.800
25 now and I was comparing and contrasting
the last three months of Lyndon

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.220
Johnson's term as President with the last
three months of George Bush's term as

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.461
President and Lyndon Johnson was rendered
completely impotent. He could not do

00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:14.650
anything and George Bush was making mischief,
according to my definition, up to

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:19.500
his very last day in office and the big difference
was that there was no

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.120
generation of young people out in the streets.
We were blogging, we were

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:31.240
Googling, we were writing our opinions, and
that that had somehow taken on the

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.970
space that collective action used to take
and somehow the shadow side, to me, of

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.520
the computer is that we're not out in the
streets and we're not basically

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:47.550
saying, this is an unacceptable narrative
of the United States. This is not the

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.610
story we signed on for and we're not gonna
tell it and we're not gonna tolerate

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:56.660
it. I just wanted to really say that at Google.
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.500
Jane: That's not exactly like biting the hand
of the people who gave us these

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.500
burritos but --

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.840
Pete: But it's all of us. I use computers,
too.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.840
Jane: Right.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.970
Pete: I mean, Google didn't invent this problem
but it is a cultural problem

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.290
that we've fragmented community and we're
all in our houses or we're all at our

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.300
computers and we're not shoulder-to-shoulder
out in the streets anymore.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.401
Jane: Absolutely. Umm, speaking of high-technology,
maybe you could speak a

00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:29.310
little, Tom, to -- I know you can already
see that the shelves are stocked with

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:35.220
books. You're also talking about maybe doing
some kind of technology set-up inside so that

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:41.120
when you go from town to town that people
could actually read books online or

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.270
what are you still thinking of for that?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:50.440
Tom: Well, umm, I just love the idea of this
wonderful analog vehicle, you

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.100
know, telling a story about literature, you
know, as it exists in contemporary

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:01.300
times which absolutely includes digital publishing.
And, umm, so I'm interested

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:06.820
in including digital publishing, representing
it as well, on the bookmobile and

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.960
additionally, you know, of course we'll be
posting as we go, and blogging, and posting

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.160
the most poignant moments in short clips on
the web site so people can follow

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.980
along and, uh, and the stories, you know,
live, you know, in the immediate

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.720
moment as we travel across the country.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:35.840
Jane: And why take back roads? I mean, is
it -- is it as simple as we don't

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:44.110
wanna get stuck on the freeways driving or
is there something about going through

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.180
back roads communities that have their own
culture and their own voices and

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.250
connecting with authors in these small towns?
I mean, what -- why did you make

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.250
that choice?

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.880
Tom: I mean, I think that, you know, it -- it's
the best opportunity for good

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.460
storytelling and I think that there's, you
know, there's more individuation and

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:02.390
there's more small communities that have voice,
and story and identity that, you

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.930
know, we can touch into by taking a back roads
route that will be different than

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.340
if we take an interstate and stop in major
cities along the way. Umm, it's just

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.530
not as diverse a journey across America and
really not really necessarily as

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.720
representative of the diversity of culture
that exists in the United States.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.230
Jane: And I know your hope is to take some
authors along with you but also to

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:28.170
connect with authors along the way.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:35.040
Tom: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, umm, right
now, our author list is very Bay

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.950
Area-centric. There definitely are also other
authors along the way but because my

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:44.291
community is the Bay Area that was where I
started making calls. Umm, and some

00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:49.690
of those interviews will happen in the Bay
Area and others will fly in but a

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:54.420
very important part of the journey is -- is
the regional stories and so we

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.820
definitely will be, uh, picking up authors
regionally as we pass through their

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.650
areas and inviting 'em on the bookmobile to
drive a segment and tell -- talk to

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:08.190
us about books and their -- the place they
live and how those things intercept.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.190
Jane: What has surprised me as I have contacted
some of these authors myself

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:33.270
is, umm, many -- as you say, many of them
are urban, you know, San Francisco Bay

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:40.190
Area people and, uh, you know, you talk to
somebody like Andrew Sean Greer,

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.190
whose book, "Max Tivoli", was, like, the No.
1 choice of book clubs in 2006 or

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.190
something. Huge literary guy. His first question
was, well, I'll go if I can

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.190
drive the bookmobile and they all have this
crazy thing for bookmobiles and

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.190
there's a wonderful, wonderful video of Daniel
Handler, AKA Lemony Snicket,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:59.500
on the web site where he talks about the importance
of bookmobiles and how

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.220
he -- he literally became a writer because
of libraries and bookmobiles. So,

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.500
umm -- and on that -- I did have a question
in there. Umm, why famous authors?

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.530
Is it -- is it partly to kind of draw attention
to the project but also because

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.260
I think -- is it -- is it because people find
it really interesting to hear

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.380
authors who have made it talk about how they
made it and -- and what books meant

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.380
to them?

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.080
Tom: You know, I think to me that -- that
choice is about -- it's a lot about

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.800
bringing eyes to the subject and it's also
 -- it's -- as much I am interested in

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.500
talking to those authors about their books
I'm much more interested, and I think

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.011
the, you know, people who will be interested
in paying -- watching will be

00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:39.400
interested in knowing who's inspired these
people. I mean, who -- what authors,

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:45.830
what reading, what life experiences have inspired
them to do what they do and

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.429
maybe, you know, influenced their lives in
meaningful ways or changed their

00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:55.760
personal mythology? And, umm, I think those
personal stories it's just, it's a

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.920
way of connecting people with something really
important through people they're

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.410
interested in. And also I feel like there's
a power in connecting authors and

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:12.679
the readers in their common love of books.
I'm -- I'm really, uh, you know, not

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:17.970
looking to create a celebrity platform as
much as create an opportunity for the

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:23.541
readers and the authors to connect and I think
that that's part of what authors

00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:28.160
are drawn to about the project. You know,
it's sort of down -- it's walking the

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.460
street. It's really talking to your readers
and connecting in a meaningful way

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.660
instead of, uh, when you do an author event
I think there's not as much

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.970
opportunity to connect in a -- on a mutual
level, you know, across the table.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:38.970
Jane: Umm, as the director of the Litquake
festival every year we have some

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:39.970
kind of, uh -- and it's ten years old now
 -- every year we've had some kind of

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:40.970
event around memoirs and it's always packed
and there is something very,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:41.970
very compelling that people just are really
drawn to memoirs and because it's

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:59.770
the ultimate imprint sharing of your experience
and Pete and I have both written

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:17.090
one and, uh, I found it harrowing and rewarding
team, uh, maybe Pete can talk

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:25.179
about why he felt compelled to put his life
 -- tell his own story in print form.

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:29.510
Pete: Well, one of the things I did with my
book was make the decision not to

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.880
make it about my life but to make it about
a decade, to make it, uh, about the

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:41.230
people that I shared it with. Umm, it's hard
to sit out and say I'm of such

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:49.330
stellar importance that you should sit down
and read 385 pages about me. I know

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:54.000
Jane didn't do that either. So the truth of
it is that the dividing lines between

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.910
self and everything around you are semi permeable
and I wanted to write about the

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:05.890
60s because after Reagan became President,
umm, a kind of collective decision

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:13.890
was made that, uh, one generation of active,
engaged students was enough and

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:20.671
there was a conscious decision made to define
the 60s as a failure and they sent

00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:26.830
all that youthful energy into the stock market.
And, umm, I wanted to tell the

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:33.580
story for my children, umm, in my words so
that it wasn?t misdefined and I wanted

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:38.429
them to know something about some of the luminous
beings that I ran around with

00:28:38.429 --> 00:28:46.591
and how seriously people dedicated themselves
to change for, you know, change

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:52.049
that was not gonna make them rich or famous
but that was gonna make life, umm,

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:57.440
perhaps gentler or easier or fairer or -- for
a lot of other people. So there

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.641
was nothing to do but write the book.

00:28:58.641 --> 00:28:59.641
Jane: [Laughing]
That's funny. I've never heard anybody say

00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:06.420
that. I just
had to do it or nothing else to do but write

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:23.480
it and it's a fabulous book, too.
Peter Coyote's a hell of a writer. What about

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.890
giving away books, Tom? What's
that all about? Are you going to ask people

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.640
to swap your favorite books or just
hand them book and ask them to talk about

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.190
their favorite book? Are you
bribing them with something?

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.190
Tom: No, Jane.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.190
Jane: [Laughing]

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.510
Tom: The idea is that we're giving away books
 -- we're not just giving away

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:41.020
books, giving away a book in exchange for
an interview so that there's an

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.940
exchange so that people when we pull into
a town and we open the doors of the

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.600
bookmobile and we invite people on, if they
are inclined to share a story, they

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.390
can take a book, any book they like from the
bookmobile. And I just feel like

00:29:54.390 --> 00:30:00.500
there's something, uh, there's -- there's
something very nice in the exchange,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.470
in the idea of exchange. Umm, you give me
a story, I give you a book and I just

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:11.940
feel like there's -- there's just some -- some
inherent poetry in that and it

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:18.320
also is nice to be exchanging with people
and be able to give something away and

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.080
to see what they take and -- and hopefully
provide a launching point for

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.370
something new, some new perspective for them,
you know, ideally. I'm hoping

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.010
that people will take books that are a challenge
for them or something they

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.010
haven't experienced before.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:32.010
Jane: Uh, I will say that, you know, early
in this campaign, if you will call

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.010
it that, when I was sort of new and hearing
about what Tom was doing and he went

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.970
to Chicago to get the bookmobile and, umm,
it's not that I had my doubts that

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:52.970
this was a good idea. I always thought it
was a fantastic idea but it wasn't

00:30:52.970 --> 00:31:12.991
until he e-mailed me and said, you have to
see this video of Ralph Eubanks that

00:31:12.991 --> 00:31:13.991
I got today. Then I watched it and I just
 -- oh, I actually cried. In fact I

00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:14.991
cried again watching it this time and I thought,
this is why this project is so

00:31:14.991 --> 00:31:15.991
beautiful and this is -- this is why it has
to -- has to happen.

00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:16.991
Pete: And Ralph Eubanks and I both mentioned
the same book on the ride down

00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.991
here.

00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:18.991
Jane: Which book?

00:31:18.991 --> 00:31:19.991
Pete: "Lad the Dog".

00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:20.991
Jane: "Lad a Dog".

00:31:20.991 --> 00:31:23.340
Pete: I said, "Lad of Sunnybrook Farm" which
was another one in the series but

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.560
it's funny how you remember those early books.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.900
Jane: Yeah. And there's -- if you haven't
been on the web site I encourage you

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.710
to go on it to see the others -- the young
man, Rob Goldhor, who served in

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:34.890
Afghanistan talked about how Doug Peacock's
"Walking It Off", which was fairly

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.450
well-known book about the Vietnam era, once
he got back from Afghanistan and

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.220
lifted him up because he was -- you know,
it was a pretty difficult situation

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.220
and how that saved him -- I mean, every single
 -- there aren't too many videos

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:48.610
up now but every single one that is a glowing
reason for doing this project

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:54.280
and why we're all so excited to get it start
 -- get it going. Umm, documentary.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:02.150
You're -- one thing that gets a little bit
lost in all this is that you're

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:11.450
filming everything for an eventually doc -- an
eventual documentary and what do

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:21.430
you hope to do with that?

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:28.640
Tom: Well, umm, you know, I hope to screen
it in theaters and I also think that

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.309
it has, you know, a lot of potential longer
life in film screening programs in

00:32:34.309 --> 00:32:38.620
the libraries across the United States and
there are a lot of -- there's, you

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.950
know, a lot of targeted audiences interested
in these stories. So, umm, exactly

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.101
how it will be marketed, you know, I can't
say exactly at this point since it's

00:32:48.101 --> 00:32:51.400
a long process and we're at the beginning
of it but certainly -- and I also

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.380
think at this time in terms of distribution
and movies and the reality of it,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:02.070
umm, theatrical life is not the main venue
for -- for documentaries anymore.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:06.120
And, uh, and certainly, you know, there's
a -- there's the television venue and

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:11.210
also there's, you know, relevant institutions
like libraries for instance for

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.130
this film that would be, you know, would be
great screening opportunities.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.810
Jane: And how do you plan to keep getting
your books re-stocked? I mean --

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:25.510
Tom: That -- that hasn't seemed to be a challenge.
Friends of the Library

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:29.230
organizations have offered to donate books
and they exist across the United

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:33.960
States, publishers are very, uh, generous
with books and libraries have been

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:39.540
incredibly generous and anxious to contribute.
So, umm, and there's also an

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:44.720
organization called "First Book" which is
a great nonprofit that, uh -- with a

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:50.960
literacy outreach mission that has, uh, central
depositories of books that they

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.750
collect from publishers 'cause they identified
that one of the key contributions

00:33:54.750 --> 00:34:00.870
to illiteracy in this country is actually
just access to books. It's hard to

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:05.070
imagine that when you live in a city but I
guess in rural areas it's just, you

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:10.329
know, access to books is really an issue.
So, umm, they collect books from

00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:14.470
publishers and they distribute them through
nonprofits across the United States.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:19.190
So they have offered, also to replenish to
bookmobile as we cross the country.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:25.030
Jane: Sounds like that's not gonna be a problem
for you. Perhaps gas will be

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.030
more of a problem than books.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.030
Pete: Well, he'll just watch his diet.
[Laughing]

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.030
Jane: Eat burritos every day. Uh, maybe I
wanna talk just a little bit more

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.030
about books and how they can make bridges
between people that ordinarily

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.030
wouldn't have anything in common with each
other. I was sort of touched by your

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:40.159
conversing with the cowboy, I forgot what
you said his name was, and the book that changed

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:55.770
his life was "the Bible" and, uh, and he also
likes Stephen King and yet,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.260
uh, you know, the -- the communion between
you two was very probable. I mean,

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:05.059
probably his life could not be any more different
than yours but, uh, I think

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:10.430
that's part of the beauty of book -- book
lovers that sort of can bond over.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:14.369
Tom: Honestly, I mean, that's one of the things
I am most excited about

00:35:14.369 --> 00:35:17.539
relative to this project is the opportunity
to connect people who wouldn't

00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:21.819
otherwise necessarily be exposed to each other.
'Cause I think at the heart of

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:26.739
these stories, umm, some of the stories that
we've collected already and a lot

00:35:26.739 --> 00:35:32.600
of the stories that we're certain to collect
is a point of connection, you know,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.890
and there are -- I mean, even in communities
that have a high degree of literacy,

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:43.900
I mean, there are -- there are stories relative
to books and reading that I

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.450
think will touch us all, will touch the most
literate of us and to create an

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.980
opportunity for us to witness each other around
this topic that we're all

00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:00.069
curious about, books and literature is -- is
to me the most exciting aspect of

00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:02.660
the project.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:12.369
Pete: I have, uh, 56 cartons of books and
they're in cartons right now because

00:36:12.369 --> 00:36:16.940
I built a little office for myself outside
of my house and I gave my wife my

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.950
office and she tore down my floor-to-ceiling
bookshelves and I hadn't anticipated

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:28.829
that part. So I've got all these books in
cardboard boxes -- numbered boxes.

00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:35.180
And there's another aspect of books that people
don't really talk about which is

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:40.900
your book collection is a kind of way of understanding
your own mind and seeing

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:46.069
it organized. So when you're sitting in a
room and the walls are lined with

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:53.569
books and your eyes fall on -- this is gonna
sound terribly like pandering but

00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:59.000
it's not -- the title is like a little Google
search. So you see these single

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.779
sentences and each time you -- you get the
title, you're reminded of the subject

00:37:03.779 --> 00:37:07.769
matter and you're reminded of all the stuff
you got about it and the meeting of

00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:12.740
the author's mind and it's there and books
are an artifact. They're not

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:17.070
electronic. You can pick it up, you can take
it with you, you can fold it stick

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.531
it in your back pocket, take it with you to
the john. It's a very, very, very

00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:26.749
sophisticated medium and we tend to think
of it as primitive but in terms of

00:37:26.749 --> 00:37:31.880
diversity it's actually kinda better than
my Google. The batteries don't wear

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:37.779
out, you know, I don't need radio reception.
It's like -- so there is --

00:37:37.779 --> 00:37:43.839
there's just this tried and true and simplified
technology that the world has

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:49.640
taken to its bosom and that we've somehow
created identities in relationship to

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.670
and I know that I walk around in my house
feeling sort of like half a person

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.430
because my books are not on the wall.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:02.290
Tom: You know, that just makes me think about
this other point that I think is

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.819
interesting and it's also perhaps part of
the inspiration for this project which

00:38:06.819 --> 00:38:12.885
is, you know, I am sort of a tech guy. I mean,
I love technology but I am

00:38:12.885 --> 00:38:20.109
concerned about the impact our technological
society is having on us. I'm

00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:25.249
concerned, uh, that we don't have as much
time in our own heads without the

00:38:25.249 --> 00:38:30.940
distraction of something electronic around
us, I'm concerned about the loss of

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.319
introspection which I think is really a tangible
loss. And I love technology

00:38:36.319 --> 00:38:41.400
but I can tell you personally I'm very aware
I have much less time in my own

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.880
head with my -- with my own thoughts. And,
umm, and I hope that the bookmobile

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:52.039
and these stories can, uh, you know, will
inspire people and remind people to --

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:55.609
to connect to these points. I mean, books
are -- one of the wonderful things

00:38:55.609 --> 00:39:00.089
about them is they are points of reflection
and they are opportunities for

00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:04.550
introspection and relation -- relating to
our own thoughts in reflection to

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:10.619
someone else's thoughts. And, umm, you know,
I think that it's a really

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:18.970
unexamined territory, what this price is that
we're paying for our love of

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:19.970
technology.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:32.160
Jane: Are there any questions? Does anybody
have any questions for -- for Tom,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.339
or Pete, or me? Otherwise we'll just keep
yakking up here. Do you have a

00:39:38.339 --> 00:39:39.339
question? Sure.
&gt;&gt; [Pause]

00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:41.020
Jane: And by the way --
Pete: The shortest distance between two-points.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.489
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
&gt;&gt; So as we have these expert story tellers

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:50.019
on stage and it's a subject that
came up a little earlier, this is probably

00:39:50.019 --> 00:39:54.180
a very simple and basic question but
I thought a lot about, you know, what makes

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:59.049
a good story teller because
obviously everyone wants to share their experiences

00:39:59.049 --> 00:40:03.539
and some people are a little
better at it than others. Umm, what -- what

00:40:03.539 --> 00:40:07.240
is it in the people you've talked
to so far in your professional experiences

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.510
of the people you know, what are the
qualities that make someone a good story teller?

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:14.400
'Cause some folks could take
the most incredible instance and turn it into

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.112
something quite boring whereas
other people can turn the story of two folks

00:40:18.112 --> 00:40:26.630
at a -- in a -- in an old folks'
home and make it sound interesting. Thanks.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:30.769
Tom: I think Pete's gonna have the best answer
to that question somehow. But,

00:40:30.769 --> 00:40:36.930
you know, to me, honesty is a great quality
of good storytelling and for me,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:43.329
when I feel that there's something genuine
happening and it's not wandering too

00:40:43.329 --> 00:40:48.690
far away from its essence, then that's incredibly
captivating. Pete?

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:56.039
Pete: I completely agree that I think the
first engaging thing is authenticity.

00:40:56.039 --> 00:41:03.690
But then, within that, umm, I think details.
You know, kind of -- some people

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:10.279
have a sense for what detail is going to spring.
Like the story that I told

00:41:10.279 --> 00:41:14.499
you. It really makes a difference to know
that the guy dressed up in a tuxedo,

00:41:14.499 --> 00:41:19.599
and he had a hat and he had a bow tie because
you get a visual impression of his

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:26.450
grandiosity and so then he's coming in like
this high-status guy and so when the

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:31.920
woman scans him up and down she trumps his
status and you get that through the

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:38.309
details. So I think that -- that good writing
is always concrete -- good story telling is

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:42.859
always concrete and you don't overload people
with details. Some

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:48.329
people have an instinctive sense of what detail
is required to sell the story

00:41:48.329 --> 00:41:52.109
and what isn't. So between authenticity and
details.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.109
Pete: Yeah.

00:41:53.109 --> 00:42:02.200
Jane: Well, I just -- I guess we're wrapping
up here so I wanna thank

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:11.510
Google for having us. In fact, Tom.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.440
Tom: Thank Google.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.989
Pete: Thank you, Google.

00:42:14.989 --> 00:42:18.609
Tom: Umm, it's a pleasure to be here. It's
fun to be up here with Jane and

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:23.739
Pete, two of my very favorite people and,
umm, I wanna say -- I guess now

00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:27.420
we're gonna have -- some people are gonna
come take a tour on the bookmobile

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:32.960
which is parked outside. Also just to let
people know that, uh, the web site

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:40.869
for the project is bookmobiletravels.com and
we are fund raising and, uh, it

00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:45.249
looks like we're maybe a third towards our
budget but we welcome any ideas or

00:42:45.249 --> 00:42:49.969
contributions about, uh, you know, fund raising
and contributions to the fund

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:55.460
raising. There is a way to contribute on the
site. It is a non profit. And,

00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:01.739
umm, thanks to Google, thanks to Ann, thanks
to Gabe. Pleasure.

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:08.420
Pete: I have a question. Since Google is both
a noun and a verb, you know,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.489
Google is a place and it's also a verb, is
one ever Googled?

00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:22.970
Pete: Can you say "I've been Googled"? You
can? Okay. Will I know it?

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.989
[Laughing]

00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:30.500
Pete: Oh, that's right. Oh, good. See --
[Laughing]

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.500
Gabriel: Thank you so much.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.500
Pete: Thanks.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:32.501
[Applause]
