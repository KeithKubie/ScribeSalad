00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.535
ROBBIE: It is my pleasure today
to introduce Aubrey de Grey

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.420
to Google for the third
or fourth time I think.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.444
AUBREY: Fifth.

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:17.402
ROBBIE : FIfth time that
he's talked to Google,

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.500
but the first time in Cambridge.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.496
Dr. de Grey has been for the
last decade or so probably

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:27.410
the leading proponent
of anti-aging reasearch.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.830
Originally a computer
scientist, he

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.795
developed an interest in
biology and combatting

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:37.540
aging in the 1990s and went on
to create the SENS Foundation

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.010
which has the ambitious goal
of defeating biological aging,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.876
or at least, radically
extending healthy human life.

00:00:44.876 --> 00:00:47.310
So I think we have a sort of
very interesting talk ahead

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.810
of us.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.722
And I would like you to join
me in welcoming Dr. de Grey.

00:00:51.722 --> 00:00:57.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.770
AUBREY: All right,
yes, thanks for coming.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.353
Yes, actually while
Robbie was talking

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.310
I realized I think this was the
sixth one actually that I gave.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.090
I gave I think four
in Mountain View.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.800
If there any people in
Mountain View listening

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.150
who were at the talk
I gave last year,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.950
this talk will be
slightly different.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.491
I constantly try to
improve the presentation.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:22.990
And, of course, there are two
ways in which that can happen.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.410
One is to talk about
new data-- things

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.400
that we have achieved
over the recent times.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.100
And also, of course, to
improve the persuasiveness

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.160
of the argument that aging
really is humanity's worst

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.520
problem and something
that is completely

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.740
scandalous that so few
people actually try to solve.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.070
So the title of my talk deserves
a little bit of explanation.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.670
First of all, the
word "rejuvenation,"

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.850
that is carefully chosen.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390
I use that word very
advisedly because I really

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.540
mean that we are talking
about reversing aging.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.980
In other words, turning
back the biological clock,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.130
making people
biologically younger

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.970
both mentally and
physically than they

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.930
were before the
intervention was begun.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.982
And as you'll see
over the next 10 or 20

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:15.940
minutes, the first, let's
say, half of my talk,

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.680
I shall be explaining
why this constitutes

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.570
a kind of happy medium
between two essentially

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.140
impractical and
implausible extremes

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.780
that have been the major source
of all the pessimism that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600
surrounds the feasibility
of doing anything

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.240
about aging with medicine.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.400
So first of all, the
nature of the problem.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.900
This is just a randomly
chosen statistic.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.850
I've used American data here.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.950
And this is simply
the proportion

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.900
of the US population
over the age of 65.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.060
The x-axis goes from 1950
through to a projection

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.560
out to 2050.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.390
And in case you can't
see the screen properly,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.040
the proportion in question
goes up from 8% up to 22%.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.720
So it's pretty dramatic.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.990
And the first thing I want to
make sure that you don't forget

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.510
is that this is a
cause for celebration.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.300
Ultimately the fact is that
this is a result of the fact

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.670
that we are no longer seeing
all that many people dying

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.130
prematurely in infancy, or
in childbirth, or whatever.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.920
And that's wonderful.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.810
But we all know the downside.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.120
We all know that pension plans
are creaking and in danger

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.410
of collapsing and all
matter of other difficulties

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.780
are occurring as a
result of this change.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.910
The thing, of course,
that I want to focus on

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.980
is the fact that it's not the
result of the statistics shown

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.020
here-- the proportion of
the population over 65.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.270
Rather, it's a result of
the fact that people over 65

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.230
tend to not be very
well, and especially

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.310
over the age of 75 or 85.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.890
And that is what
I'm out to change.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.310
Ultimately this is a
little bit of a paradox

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.880
if you think about it.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.980
200 years ago the life
expectancy was very low.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.980
People used to die
of other stuff.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.490
And mostly they died of
communicable diseases--

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.120
tuberculosis and diphtheria.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.060
And we have become very good,
at least in the developed world,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.709
actually to be honest quite
good in the developing world,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.519
at stopping that from happening.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.060
Not just through medicine
like vaccines antibiotics,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.340
but just through
realizing that hygiene

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.980
is a good idea and
mosquito nets work.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.660
So you might think,
well hang on,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.800
why haven't the diseases
of old age been similarly

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.830
susceptible to elimination or
at least very great reduction

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.420
from similar measures?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.630
And that's where I want to
spend an amount of time.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.838
And I'm going to start by
simply giving a definition.

00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:47.910
As computer scientists, you all
know that precise definitions

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.930
are rather important in getting
anything done technologically.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.810
And medicine is no different.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.270
And this will do as a
pretty good hardcore

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.237
definition of aging.

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.320
There are loads of definitions
of aging out there.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.610
So it's quite important
to actually fix on one

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.770
for the purposes of discussion.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.780
This one is first
of all mechanistic.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.970
It actually says what aging is
in terms of cause and effect.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.230
But also in other ways it's
good at orienting our thoughts

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.210
around what might be
necessary in order

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.230
to do something about aging.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.780
So what I'm saying here is in
a very simple nutshell-- aging

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.100
is a side effect of being
alive in the first place.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.180
It is very, very
similar, in essence

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.610
it's really no different
in the human body

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.800
than it is in a simple man-made
machine like a car or whatever.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.420
Ultimately any machine
with moving parts is going,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.520
a simple side effect
of the laws of physics,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.160
forgot biology, to
do damage to itself

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.800
as a consequence of
its normal operation.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.970
And that damage is going
to accumulate progressively

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.930
until eventually it
exceeds the tolerance

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.810
that the body, the machine,
is set up to manage.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.850
And once that
happens, the machine

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.490
starts to work less well and
eventually not work at all.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.430
So it's just the same
in the human body

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.950
as it is in a man-made machine.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.880
There is, of course,
a big, big difference

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.040
between the human body and
a typical inorganic machine

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.290
which is that the human body and
indeed other living organisms

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.270
have a fabulous array of
built-in damage repair

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.220
machinery-- machinery
that eliminates damage

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.210
as fast as it is created.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.330
But you got to remember
what that means.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.620
It doesn't mean that we can't
think of the body as a machine.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.910
What it means is that our job in
extending the healthy longevity

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.840
of the machine, in the
case of the human body,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.890
is easier than it otherwise
would be because we've

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.390
got all this help
from the machinery

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.620
that the body has
already has installed.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.380
The reason it's
harder in aggregate

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.880
is, of course, that the
human body is vastly, vastly

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.490
more complicated than a simple
man-made machine or even

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.700
the most complicated
man-made machine.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.750
And, of course, also,
we have the misfortune

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.860
of not having the plans.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.400
So it's a bit tricky
figuring out what to do.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.980
But it still means
that we ought to be

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.180
able to use the same
kind of approaches

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.370
against aging of
the human body as we

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.040
do against aging of
a simple machine.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.460
Now the thing is that this
is not very well understood.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.510
And there's a
particular way in which

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.090
it's very poorly
understood by society

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.390
that has had an enormous impact
on the extent to which we have

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.230
taken seriously the idea of
doing anything about aging

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.410
medically.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.620
Ultimately the misunderstanding,
the misconception that exists,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.150
is that an arbitrary division
is made between whatever aging

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.930
itself might be defined to
be as against the diseases

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.050
and disabilities of old age--
the diseases in particular.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.770
Things like cancer
and Alzheimer's

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.140
and cardiovascular disease.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.310
These diseases of old
age are, of course,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.290
enormously widespread
and staggeringly costly

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.520
now that we don't have
much in the way of diseases

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.890
of early life.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.900
But they are not like
infectious diseases.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.300
First of all, they
are universal.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.350
You will get Alzheimer's unless
you die of something else

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.020
first.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.180
You just will.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.000
And secondly, they
are not medically

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.540
curable in the strict sense.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.980
What I mean by that is
simply that we cannot,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.360
even in principle, invent a
therapy that can be applied

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.030
once to the body and eliminate
a disease like Alzheimer's from

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.010
the body such that the person
won't get it again unless they

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.380
are reinfected in some way.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.000
We can't do that
because aging is

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.429
a side effect of being
alive in the first place.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.010
And the diseases of old
age are caused by aging.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.009
So you can't cure it in
that way without curing

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:47.050
being alive in the first
place which would rather

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.650
defeated the object really.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.590
So that makes it difficult.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.987
But it does not make it
impossible to apply medicine

00:08:53.987 --> 00:08:55.070
to the disease of old age.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.220
They are still medical problems.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.270
And they are medically
preventable in principle.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.900
We just have to start
from a different point--

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.870
a different conceptual
starting point.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.620
Putting it in another
way, it's like this.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.480
This is the conventional
way that we partition,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.990
that we classify, the
various sources of ill health

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.880
that humanity is susceptible to.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.770
We have communicable diseases.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.890
We have congenital diseases
that occasionally people

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.660
are born with because of
mistakes in their DNA.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.510
And we have the diseases
of old age-- the intrinsic,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.960
chronic, progressive things
that predominantly affect people

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.717
who were born a long time ago.

00:09:34.717 --> 00:09:36.800
And then completely separate
from all these three,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.690
we think of this over
here-- this miscellaneous,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.040
kind of diffuse, nonspecific
phenomena like sarcopenia.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.060
That means lots of muscle mass.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.350
Or immunosenescence,
the decline in function

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.350
of the immune system,
which we think

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.030
of as part of aging itself.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.230
That is the way that most
people think of ill health.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.265
But it's completely wrong.

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.640
The correct way
to think about it

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.100
is to put that big black
line there instead.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.760
That actually these are
diseases in the sense

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.630
that they can actually be
cured, whether by a vaccine

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.360
or whatever, or by some
kind of gene therapy maybe.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.847
And these ones over
here are parts of aging.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.680
The only difference
between the third column

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.790
and the fourth column is
that these things over here

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.165
are things that we've taken
the trouble to give names to.

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:22.335
That really is all it is.

00:10:22.335 --> 00:10:23.880
It's terminological, semantic.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.810
It's not a biological
difference at all.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.585
And once we understand that,
that the diseases of old age

00:10:29.585 --> 00:10:32.090
are part and parcel of
aging, we have a chance

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.490
of getting somewhere
with both of them.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.350
This is the tragedy
of not getting

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.980
to grips with that concept.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.450
At the moment, if we start
with my definition of aging

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.510
down here, that
metabolism in other words,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.676
being alive in the first
place, the normal operation

00:10:45.676 --> 00:10:47.650
of the human body
throughout life

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.990
causes a variety of different
molecular and cellular changes

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.520
to occur in the body
that eventually once they

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.800
get a abundant
enough, contribute

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.670
to the ill health of old age.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.950
That definition
leads to a variety

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.960
of different
potential approaches

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.940
to postponing the ill
health of old age.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.190
And pretty much everything
we have in the clinic today

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.390
consists of this up
here-- geriatric medicine.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.940
That is a real tragedy because
the whole idea underpinning

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.070
geriatric medicine, in
other words, the attacking

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.530
the pathologies of old age,
is to ignore everything

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.240
that I just told you in
the past few minutes.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.070
It is to pretend that
the disease of old age

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.870
can be cured just
like an infection--

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.540
to bash away at the symptoms
and hope for the best.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.990
And it's never going to
work because the precursors

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.150
of these pathologies,
this damage done here,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.720
is obviously still
continuing to accumulate

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.500
while the person is still alive.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.590
And therefore the pressure
against these therapies--

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.980
the pressure to make pathology
happen anyway is increasing--

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.190
and the therapies are
inevitably, inevitably going

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.160
to get less and less
effective as someone

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.610
gets older and older.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.159
So of course geriatric medicine
is better than nothing.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.200
I'm not saying it isn't .

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.158
But it's only a little
bit better than nothing,

00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:04.140
and it only ever will be a
little bit better than nothing.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.260
Now, I'm not the first person
to realize that by any means.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.400
For the best part of
a century some people

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.259
have been pointing this
out and saying well,

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:13.550
prevention is better than cure.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.380
Maybe we should try to
intervene at an earlier

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.810
stage in the chain of events
because this definition

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.085
of aging is perfectly
uncontroversial.

00:12:20.085 --> 00:12:20.584
You know?

00:12:20.584 --> 00:12:23.302
I may be saying it in a
slightly different way,

00:12:23.302 --> 00:12:25.510
but ultimately, this is what
people-- people wouldn't

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.220
have argued with that definition
of aging even a century ago.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.580
So as people have said well,
let's go in to up here.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.770
Let's call the problem
the problem of metabolism.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.010
Let's try to clean up
the way the body works

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.610
and thereby slow down the rate
at which it creates damage.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.772
It sounds like a fine idea.

00:12:42.772 --> 00:12:44.980
It would postpone the age
at which the damage reaches

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.110
this pathogenic threshold.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.390
And that unfortunately
has not succeeded.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:55.660
No real medicine has emerged
that substantially postpones

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.400
the disease of old
age by slowing down

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.850
the accumulation of damage.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:59.852
Why not?

00:12:59.852 --> 00:13:01.060
There's a very simple reason.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.960
It's called complexity.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.834
Just as the pathologies of
old age are rather complex.

00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:08.250
You don't have to
read this slide.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.740
This is just a small
subset of the things that

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.840
go wrong with you late in life.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.080
Similarly,
unfortunately, metabolism

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.830
is also a rather complicated.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.460
This is a simplified
diagram of a small subset

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.660
of what we know about
how the body works.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.860
And as you can tell, it's
a bit of a mess really.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.137
And any software
engineer can easily

00:13:28.137 --> 00:13:29.720
understand that this
is like spaghetti

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.530
code with no comments.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.620
There's no way that you're going
to be able to go in and tweak

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.010
this thing to make it not do the
thing you don't want it to do,

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.290
namely create
damage in this case,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.160
without having side effects
that do more harm than good.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.850
It's just not going to happen.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.250
The gerontology approach,
as I am calling it,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.140
is not doomed in principle the
way the geriatric approach is.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.880
But we would need to understand
this massively complex network

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.600
of processes almost infinitely--
astronomically better

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.990
than we actually
do today-- in order

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.940
to have a prayer of
implementing what

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.730
I'm calling the
gerontology approach.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.730
Of course I'm actually
understating the problem.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.020
The problem is not really that
this is a simplified diagram

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.270
of a small subset of what we
know about how the body works.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.884
The problem is that this
is a simplified diagram

00:14:20.884 --> 00:14:23.300
of a small subset of what we
know about how the body works

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.830
which is completely
dwarfed by the completely

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.040
astronomical amount that
we don't know about how

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.415
the body works, even ignoring
all the stuff that we don't

00:14:31.415 --> 00:14:32.660
even know that we don't know.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.300
So you know waste of time.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.460
Not going to happen
any time soon.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.150
So that is in a nutshell
why the world has become,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.400
when I say "the world" here
I am not talking of course

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.700
about people who have thought
about biology and aging,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.420
has become so fatalistic
and pessimistic

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.160
about applying medicine
to this problem.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.987
But luckily that's not
the end of the story.

00:14:55.987 --> 00:14:57.570
Let me come back to
cars for a minute.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.070
This, of course,
is a success story.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.880
This car here is
perhaps 100 years old.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.040
And it was definitely not
designed to last 100 years.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.390
It was probably designed
to last 10 or 20.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.260
So we must ask
ourselves how has it

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.370
succeeded in lasting so long.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.715
And we all know the answer.

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.590
The answer is that it's
been very, very, very

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.070
well maintained.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.000
If you maintain your car
only as well as the law

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.770
requires, then sure enough
it lasts only about as long

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.560
as its manufacturer
is expected to wait

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.410
until they could
sell you a new one.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.470
But this car, somehow
or other its owners

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.560
fell in love with
it, and they did

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.290
an unusually and
necessarily comprehensive

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.200
amount of maintenance on
it, and that was the trick.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.030
Maintenance really works if
it's comprehensive enough.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.450
And we don't have any
200-year-old cars.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.130
But the only reason for
that is because cars had not

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.600
been invented 200 years ago.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.920
We certainly will have
200-year-old cars.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.960
So if we come back and
ask what that analogy

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.079
means for the problem
at hand, the human body.

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:58.620
It mean this.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.750
It means that rather than
trying to go in and slow down

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.530
or eliminate this process
whereby metabolism creates

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:08.010
damage or go in and
interfere with this process

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.530
where damage creates pathology.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.500
Instead we just uncouple those
processes from each other.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.210
We dive in and separate them
by periodically repairing

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.050
the damage that's been
created already by the way

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.710
the body works, and
thereby, even though it's

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.940
continuing to be
created, preventing it

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.380
from reaching this pathogenic
threshold-- very simple idea.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.870
It's an idea whose
proof of concept

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.030
is all around us in
well-maintained machines.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.170
It's the way that we're
actually going to defeat aging.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.230
So what does that
mean in practice.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.470
Of course you or I,
anyway, certainly

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.870
can't go out and keep a
car going for 100 years

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.690
because we don't
have the expertise.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.810
So what I need to do is
summarize now for you,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.560
and I realize, of
course, that most of you

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.990
will not very much biology.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.160
So I won't go into
too much detail.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.820
What I need to
summarized now for you

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.610
is what it means in practice
to actually do the maintenance

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.830
approach.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.869
And the big first
step in addressing

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.500
a really complex problem
like this is often,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.329
I am sure you agree,
to break it down

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.640
into sub-problems, preferably
a manageable number

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.800
of sub-problems.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.079
So that was the first step that
I took back nearly 15 years ago

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.099
now.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.940
These are the seven
sub-problems-- seven types

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.390
of damage-- changes in the body
at the cellular or molecular

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.010
level which continue throughout
life as side effects of being

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.540
alive-- side effects of the
body's normal operation.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.860
And which eventually
accumulate to a point where

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.340
they contribute to
one or another or more

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.455
of the diseases and
disabilities of old age.

00:17:41.455 --> 00:17:44.300
And as you can see, these
are very clearly down

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.570
to earth, concrete,
biological phenomena.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.282
They are very broad categories,
and that's a good thing

00:17:49.282 --> 00:17:51.240
because it means we don't
need so many of them.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.600
But the point is that
they are clearly defined

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.800
and within each
category-- this is

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.800
the reason why this
particular classification is

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.570
useful-- within
each category there

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.310
is a generic therapy, a type
of approach to implementing

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.570
the maintenance concept
that can be applied

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.970
to every example
within the category,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.270
not necessarily identically.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.600
Certain minor changes
might be required.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.490
And we'll come to
those things later on.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.520
But basically, there's
one generic therapy,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.070
which means that this
classification is useful.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.497
So lets go through it briefly.

00:18:23.497 --> 00:18:24.830
Cell loss-- what does that mean?

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.020
It just means
cells dying and not

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.520
being automatically replaced
by the division of other cells.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.550
Simple enough-- cells die,
they are not replaced,

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.330
the number of cells goes
down, eventually the organ

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.346
of which the cells
were a part is

00:18:38.346 --> 00:18:40.220
going to not have enough
cells to do its job.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.090
So you can understand that
that would be a part of aging.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.535
You can have too many cells.

00:18:45.535 --> 00:18:47.660
It turns out that there
are two very different ways

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.284
in which you could
have too many cells.

00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:51.840
And the reason they are
different for my purposes

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.480
is precisely because
the way in which we

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.180
would go about
addressing the problem

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.806
is different in the two cases.

00:18:57.806 --> 00:18:59.841
The first one is
having too many cells

00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:01.590
because they are
dividing when they're not

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.570
supposed to, in
other words, cancer.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.360
And the other one is
having too many cells

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.240
because they are not dying
when they are supposed to.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.456
That's something that
a lot of people ignore.

00:19:10.456 --> 00:19:12.080
But it's quite
important, it turns out,

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.600
in certain parts of aging.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.650
Possibly the most conspicuous
is the immune system

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.990
in which cell death and
the-- and cell death

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.310
is really important as a way
of making room for rapid cell

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.683
division later on.

00:19:24.683 --> 00:19:29.030
So those are the three that are
related to the number of cells.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.510
Down here we've got things
that the molecular level.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.150
Two of them inside cells
and two of them outside.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.160
The ones that are
inside-- the first one

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.600
is mitochondrial mutation.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.730
So I guess most of you
know what mitochondria are,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.060
but just to recap.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.260
They are the part
of the cell that

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.860
does the chemistry
of breathing--

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.030
the combining of oxygen with
nutrients to extract energy

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.740
from the nutrients that is then
used by the rest of the body.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.445
And unlike any other
part of the cell,

00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:55.820
mitochondria have
their own DNA--

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.150
a very small amount--
only encodes 13 proteins,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.210
but still very essential.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.430
And it just turns out that
mitochondrial DNA accumulates

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.110
mutations far far faster
than the nuclear DNA.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.497
So that's really important.

00:20:11.497 --> 00:20:13.330
The second one is
garbage-- waste products--

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.270
just waste products--
things that the cell

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.690
makes as a side effect of
was it's normally doing,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.250
but which for whatever
reason, the cell does not

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.830
have the machinery either
to break down or to excrete.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.510
And so, of course,
it accumulates.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.260
And just as your
kitchen works every bit

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.560
as well after a week's
worth of garbage

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.890
has accumulated in the garbage
can as it did the moment

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.080
you took the garbage out.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.980
Similarly, the cell
works just as well

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.350
with a manageable
amount of garbage.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.140
But just as your
kitchen doesn't work

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.824
so well if you don't take
the garbage out for a month,

00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:49.490
the cell doesn't work
so well in old age

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.120
because it's got too
much of this stuff.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.430
The other two are
things that's happen

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.690
outside the cell in the
spaces between cells

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.330
and they're also
really important.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.060
First one is, again,
waste products.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.220
There's a question over there
which I will take in a moment.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.770
Extracellular
junk-- this is stuff

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.570
like the amyloid that form
plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.160
And this is important
in the same kind of way

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.510
that molecular garbage
inside the cell is important.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.460
But again I list it
separately because the way

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.834
we're going to address it is
different than for the stuff

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:21.660
inside.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.050
And finally then, molecular
changes that are not garbage

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.270
but rather changes of structure
that cause loss of elasticity

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.870
of the lattice of proteins that
gives our tissue it's-- gives

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.300
our tissues their shape and
their stretchiness which is

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.440
important in things
like the major arteries.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.020
So the question was?

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.270
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that--

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.707
AUBREY: I am sorry shout please.

00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:45.040
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
mutation rate in nuclear DNA

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.443
is much lower than
mitochondrial,

00:21:46.443 --> 00:21:48.190
and that makes sense.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.336
But there is still mutational
damage to nuclear DNA.

00:21:51.336 --> 00:21:54.330
That eventually is going
to be a problem, right?

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.860
AUBREY: Right, so
great question.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.943
I'll repeat it because it
may not have been heard.

00:21:57.943 --> 00:21:59.700
So the question is
OK, hang on, we've

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.320
got mitochondrial
mutations here.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.670
Even if nuclear mutations
accumulate much more slowly

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.920
than mitochondria, it's
still non-zero rate,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.760
surely we're going
to have to fix it.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.420
And I agree.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.711
We are going to have to fix it.

00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:12.200
The question really
is are we going

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.690
to have to fix it in
anything like a currently

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.600
normal lifetime.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.680
And it turns out that it
looks as though we probably

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.840
aren't going to have to
except in one indirect way.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.980
So without going
into too many details

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.660
the essential answer is that
there's one particular problem

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.740
that mutations in the nucleus
can cause that is so much more

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.040
serious so much more
quickly than any other

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.260
that is the thing that
has driven evolution

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.590
to make the quality of
our DNA repair machinery

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.660
and made the machinery
as good as it is.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.540
And that thing is
cancer which is

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.370
in my list in a different place
that doesn't talk about DNA.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.100
So that's basically the
answer to your question.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.840
We believe, or I believe anyway,
that the effect of mutations

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.880
which do not affect
the cell cycle,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.760
do not actually cause
cancer, is non-zero,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.210
but it is so rare as
to be non-pathogenic

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.620
until we have lived
very much longer than we

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.410
have any danger
of living so far.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.970
All right so to go on.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.340
So these are the damage types.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.160
This is a great start, but of
course, we need to know more.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.910
First of all, we need
to know a little bit

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:26.391
about how this type of damage
translates into pathology.

00:23:26.391 --> 00:23:27.890
And here I want to
stop for a moment

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.531
and emphasize perhaps
a philosophical point,

00:23:30.531 --> 00:23:32.780
a conceptual point, but a
really, really important one

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.420
that underpins the whole
logic of what I'm saying here.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.420
We would like to know
as much as we can

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.850
about how metabolism creates
these various types of damage.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.910
And we would like to
know as much as we can

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:51.470
about how these types of damage
cause the various pathologies

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.120
and diseases of old age.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.040
But we don't need to know all
that much about those things.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.050
Really it's just a
case of reassurance

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.530
to know these things because
at the end of the day given

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.410
that metabolism causes damage
and damage causes pathology,

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.570
if we can actually implement the
maintenance approach properly--

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.370
repair the damage--
in other words

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.760
restore the molecular and
cellular structure of the body

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.640
to how it was at a younger age
within a good approximation,

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.840
then we have solved our problem.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.350
We do not need to know
how it got that way,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.420
or how it's going to get worse.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.990
We just need to-- we can
just rely on the fact

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.540
that since the human
body is a machine,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.692
its function is determined
by its structure.

00:24:35.692 --> 00:24:37.150
So if we can restore
the structure,

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.470
we will restore the function,
including the remaining

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.500
longevity.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.520
This kind of side
stepping of our ignorance

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.380
is absolutely fundamental to
why this whole approach feasible

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.680
in the foreseeable future.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.270
One thing, however, that
it is important to try

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:57.580
to get a grip on is a reason why
we can be reasonably confident

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.899
that this classification
is exhaustive--

00:24:59.899 --> 00:25:01.440
that it really does
cover everything.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.648
We haven't got number eight
and nine hiding out there

00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:04.820
to be found.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.380
Now, I can make a biological
argument for that.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.270
You can start by saying
well OK, damage can only

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.640
accumulate throughout
life in structures that

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.380
persist throughout life--
long-lived structures.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.570
If a cell, or indeed a molecule,
is created and maybe gets

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.850
damaged and then it's
destroyed, then the damage

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.690
is gone along with the
molecule or the cell.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.760
So that's not accumulating.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.450
So we can say OK, what is
long lived in the body?

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.640
DNA-- certain types of
protein that don't get

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.860
destroyed-- cells that
don't divide-- and so on.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.880
And that kind of-- kind of
give you this list that way.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.770
But actually there's
a quite persuasive

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.720
circumstantial argument
as well, a very simple

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.110
circumstantial
argument that says

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.320
this list is probably complete.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:45.820
Here it is.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.400
It's been the same list
for more than 30 years.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.290
All of these things
have been major topics

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.570
of study and discussion
in gerontology

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:59.162
since at least the 1980s and
in many cases a lot longer.

00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:00.620
And you kind of
would have expected

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.411
that the list would
have got longer by now.

00:26:02.411 --> 00:26:04.630
We've come a long way
in biology in that time.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:09.670
Now one argument that might be
considered a rebuttal of this

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.110
is that well hang
on, maybe people

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.830
weren't looking for
a classification.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.710
And that's kind of
true, they weren't.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.310
But that argument is going away
as well because the fact is

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.730
I've been challenging
people to extend

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.520
this list for more
than a decade now

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.430
and I seem to be
getting away with it.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.180
This seems-- this
really does seem

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.790
to be standing the test of time.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.070
So that's quite encouraging.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.690
And it gets progressively more
encouraging as time goes on.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.200
All right, so now I do a little
bit just to concentrate mind,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.540
so to speak, with how this
translates into the initiation

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.900
and progression of the
various major diseases

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.640
and disabilities of old age.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.380
This is something that--
especially people when

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.050
I am talking to donors--
they really care about this.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:55.384
Someone's decided that they
are predisposed to getting

00:26:55.384 --> 00:26:56.550
Parkinson's at an early age.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.470
You know who I am talking about.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:02.820
Someone may have found that
their mother's got cancer

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.320
or whatever.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.528
So they'll have specific
things that they care about.

00:27:05.528 --> 00:27:08.760
They'll give eight-digit
sums to the charity that

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.190
is working on Parkinson's
disease which they hadn't done

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.710
the year before because they
only were triggered to do so

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.060
when they realize that they
personally had a problem.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.860
This is a personal thing.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.700
I think that's a shame.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.980
I think it would be much
better if the bulk of humanity

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.690
cared more about each other.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.620
But I work with this.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.110
So let's look at those
pathologies, the linkage

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.750
between the damage
and the pathology.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.760
Sometimes it's really simple.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.630
It's a one-to-one
relationship here.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.140
Division obsessed
cells-- cells that

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.931
are dividing when they
are not supposed to.

00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:43.750
That's basically the
definition of cancer.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.250
Usually though, it's a
lot more complicated.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:50.030
So there are a lot of things
that can go wrong with the hear

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.780
during old age.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.200
Atherosclerosis, the
number one cause of death

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.890
in the Western world--
the cause of heart

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.950
attack-- the cause of strokes.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.970
That's this down here.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:05.800
It starts out with cells in
the artery wall being poisoned

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.401
by stuff that gets inside
them that they can't process.

00:28:09.401 --> 00:28:11.650
And I'll talk more about
that later because it happens

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:16.030
to be something that we've had
some good success on recently.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.730
Arteriosclerosis, stiffening
of the arteries, which

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.180
causes hypertension
and of course,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.840
all the knock on effects
like in kidney failure.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.050
That's this bottom
one down here--

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.070
molecular bonds being
formed between the proteins

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.760
that make up the artery wall
and that give it its elasticity.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.430
And those bonds just stiffen
it, they make it less elastic,

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.170
and that's what causes
high blood pressure.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.420
Molecular garbage outside
the cell-- there's something

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.690
called senile
cardiac amyloidosis

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.350
which is now known to be the
number one killer of people

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.630
who get over the
age of about 105.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.286
It seems to be the number one.

00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:52.160
It took a long time to
figure that out simply

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.860
because not many people that
old have autopsies done on them.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.330
But now we've got
enough data, it's

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.050
pretty clear that
that's the case.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.200
And then finally, there's
cells in the heart called

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.380
pacemaker cells which are
responsible for actually

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.730
responding to signals
from the brain

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.720
and causing the heart
to actually beat.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.900
And those cells die, and
they're not naturally replaced

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.429
over time, not
adequately anyway,

00:29:13.429 --> 00:29:15.595
so eventually we haven't
got very many in the heart.

00:29:15.595 --> 00:29:17.719
And even though nothing
else may be wrong with it,

00:29:17.719 --> 00:29:19.510
the heart just stops
listening to the brain

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.718
and it can't be bothered to
beat anymore and you die.

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.180
So that's this one up here.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.594
So heart disease is complicated.

00:29:24.594 --> 00:29:26.510
Alzheimer's is another
really complicated one.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.080
This is a disease that was
defined more than a century ago

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.180
as the combination
of these two things

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.710
down here-- molecular
garbage inside neurons

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.930
called tangles-- molecular junk
outside neurons called plaques.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:43.450
We now know that the sharp end
of Alzheimer's is cell loss.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.327
Neurons dying initially
in certain parts

00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:47.160
of the brain like the
hippocampus-- and then

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.260
more broadly-- and causing
loss of cognitive function.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.160
So again we've got to fix all of
these things in order to really

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.740
get a cure for Alzheimer's.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.300
Frailty-- let me call just
like non-specific decrepitude.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.730
This is pretty much everything.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.430
Maybe cancer doesn't
come into that.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.960
But pretty much all
the rest you can

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.950
point to certain
aspects of frailty

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.620
that are driven by each
of these types of damage.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.690
So you see the
linkage is very clear.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.820
It's inextricable the
linkage between damage

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.320
and pathology-- the relationship
between aging itself,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.640
whatever you mean by that,
and the diseases of old age.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.720
And if society could just
get that into its thick head,

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.550
then there would be
a very great deal

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.430
more money spent on doing
something about aging.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:36.771
And we wouldn't be making
such slow progress.

00:30:36.771 --> 00:30:39.650
All right, let's get
on to the solutions.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.514
We've only talked about
the problem so far.

00:30:41.514 --> 00:30:43.430
So the maintenance
approach breaks down itself

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.800
into a variety of
different strategies.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.050
They all begin with r--
replacement, removal, repair,

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.130
and reinforcement.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:54.520
And that-- well they say it that
way, but to be more specific,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.760
they work like this.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.370
So you all have heard of
stem cell therapy, of course.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.970
Stem cell therapy is
the maintenance approach

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.366
to address this
problem-- cell loss.

00:31:03.366 --> 00:31:04.490
That's what it's all about.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:09.240
We put cells into the body that
can divide and differentiate

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.980
to replace cells that the body
is not replacing on its own

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.040
when they die.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.550
And of course, stem cell
therapy by and large

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:21.130
has been developed to do things,
to treat problems that are not

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.850
related to aging, things
like spinal cord trauma.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.240
But the fact is it is just
as applicable to certain

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.720
of the pathologies of old age.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.590
And it now increasingly
in clinical trials

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.320
being actually applied
to such problems.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.430
Perhaps the most
conspicuous and best example

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.440
is, well, the simplest anyway,
is Parkinson's disease,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.850
which has historically
been treated

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:48.520
in rather primitive ways
by injecting compounds

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.000
such as precursors of
dopamine-- the chemical

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.690
whose shortfall is the main
driver of Parkinson's disease.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.490
But the holy grail of treatment
for Parkinson's disease

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.451
without the faintest doubt is
the introduction of stem cells

00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:05.950
into the relevant
part of the brain,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:09.480
to substantia nigra which
will divide and differentiate

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.240
into the type of neuron
that makes dopamine.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.290
And we are now getting there.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.870
This was first tried
about 15 years ago.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.960
And it was sometimes successful.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.470
Sometimes patients got better.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.040
Sometimes they didn't.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.960
When it did work, it
worked spectacularly.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.800
There are people out
there now who have not

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.370
had any symptoms of Parkinson's
disease for well over a decade.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.840
And despite having been treated
once with stem cells and not

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.090
had any other treatment since.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.410
That's how well it
works when it works.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.579
But because it
usually didn't work,

00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:49.870
there was an enormous amount
of pessimism in the field.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.720
And it was pretty much
given up on for a long time.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.430
Now if you think about that,
you have to ask well, OK,

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.340
was that actually
the right decision

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.320
or was it driven by
short-termist, political,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.630
or other motivations?

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.260
Ultimately, if you
think about it,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.090
it's so obvious
why it didn't work.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.800
I mean this was
already known-- namely

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.290
that they were just not quite
good enough at getting the stem

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:15.420
cells into the right states,
the right type of stem cell,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.800
that it was a shame
that they gave up.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.250
But they did give up.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.790
They were just not making
dopaminergic neurons sometimes.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.330
And now that has finally--
the circle has finally closed,

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.750
and clinical trials are now
being pursued with great vigor.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:35.950
And I think that we're in a
very, very strong position

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.320
to have a proper cure
for Parkinson's disease

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.750
within 10 years.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.270
That's a strong
statement I know.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.360
But I really think it's true
because we're now good enough

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.760
at getting stem cells
into a state that

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.800
is a dopaminergic
precursor, as it's called,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.810
and thereby restoring
dopaminergic capacity

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.710
to the substantia nigra
by stem cell therapy.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.820
So in one talk I
don't have time to go

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.160
through all of these in detail.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.680
If you go back into the
Google Tech Talk archive,

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.170
you'll find talks from me back
in 2005, 2006 on three or four

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.130
of these things just
dedicated to each one of them.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.303
So that's where you want
the detail from back then.

00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:17.469
If you want more detail,
obviously go to our website

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.760
or read the book that I gather
we have plenty of copies

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.980
of outside at the back
which we'll give away later.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:28.020
But I'm going to just highlight
a couple of these later on.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.860
First of all though,
I want to emphasize

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.420
what this means in
terms of the sociology

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.179
and the politics of medicine
and medical research.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.920
At the moment, as I have
probably already said

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.179
a bit too often, the problem
is that we are simply

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:47.500
not addressing aging
as the precursor

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.920
of age-related disease
in the way we should be.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.310
We have to reorganize medical
research in recognition

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.090
of the fact that there is no
difference between treating

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.400
aging and preventing
age-related disease.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.500
Preventative medicine for
the diseases of old age

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.280
is the treatment
aging-- it just is.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.169
Now this is beginning to change.

00:35:07.169 --> 00:35:08.710
For the longest
time, I was basically

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.323
the only person
saying this and maybe

00:35:10.323 --> 00:35:11.320
I just wasn't saying
it well enough.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.090
I don't know.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.860
But now I'm by no
means the only one.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.320
There are mainstream people,
especially influential people

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.000
at the National
Institutes of Health,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.270
who are beginning to
get this message out.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.620
However, I'm not exactly
holding my breath.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.190
The fact is it's the government.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.700
It doesn't tend
to move very fast.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.350
There's an enormous amount of
vested interest in the status

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.040
quo in keeping
things how they are.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.300
So I honestly don't know whether
this is really going anywhere.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.910
I think that the progress
that needs to occur

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:43.190
is going to rely
predominantly on people

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.360
with independent means for
quite a long time to come.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.680
We shall see.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.130
However, in the end
what we're going to have

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.300
is medicine that actually
works against the disease

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.100
and disabilities of old age.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.200
And they are going to
be the medicines that

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.630
dominate medical
practice in the future.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.140
Medical practice
is going to be all

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.900
about what I'm calling here
"preventative geriatrics"

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.640
because ultimately that is
the major threat that people

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.740
in the developed world
anyway, and increasingly

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.100
in the developing world, face
in terms of their health.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.780
And in the long term,
it's very simple.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.400
Just as today nobody
gets tuberculosis,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:23.290
nobody gets polio, it's
going to be like this.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:25.770
Nobody will get Alzheimer's
or heart attacks,

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:28.240
or macular degeneration
or all these other things.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.900
And there will be dramatic
consequences for health.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.150
If we're not getting those,
and we're also not getting

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.060
tuberculosis and so on, then
we're going to stay the way

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.500
the people in this room are
today however long we live.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.320
And that is a very,
very different world.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.270
Now, I'll talk about
life span a bit later on.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.912
But I want to emphasize
that what we work on

00:36:47.912 --> 00:36:48.620
is not life span.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.744
We don't work on longevity.

00:36:49.744 --> 00:36:51.400
We work on health.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.590
Longevity is a side effect.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.370
It's a consequence of
keeping people healthy.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.250
Now, in terms of
credibility, I think

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.150
it's important to emphasize that
it's not just me saying this.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:05.510
I'm still, as Robbie mentioned
at the beginning, probably

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.000
the primary and most
prominent, and most vocal

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.640
advocate of all of this.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.180
But that's just because I've
been doing it for a long time.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.930
There's quite a lot
of people out there

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.980
who have come very
enthusiastically

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.300
around to the point of view that
I'm putting out to you today.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.950
This is just by
way of illustration

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.270
a research advisory board.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.870
There are 25 people here
who are extreme luminaries,

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.714
world leaders in their
various research fields.

00:37:29.714 --> 00:37:31.630
Any of you know a bit
of biology will probably

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.740
have heard of some
of these people.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.240
Here's George Church
whom I actually

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.690
had coffee with this morning.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:39.350
He's one of the pioneers of
next-generation sequencing

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:40.230
among other things.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.980
He's a really,
really important guy.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.470
Let's see, this
is Bill Haseltine

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.830
who invented the term
"regenerative medicine."

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.120
This is Mike West who started
Geron and then advanced

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.300
cell technology.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.770
He is a really important guy.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.470
This is Maria Blasco who
runs the Spanish equivalent

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.267
of the NIH.

00:37:56.267 --> 00:37:58.850
Tanya Tyler who runs the world's
biggest regenerative medicine

00:37:58.850 --> 00:37:59.349
institute.

00:37:59.349 --> 00:38:01.840
You know, these are
quite important people.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.510
And they have signed up
very, very unambiguously

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.080
to a hard-hitting statement
of endorsement of the approach

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.410
that I've been
describing to you today.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.224
So you might ask, well
hang on, what role

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:13.140
does a nonprofit have?

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.760
If this is getting so
credible, then surely

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.850
it must be getting attention
from the private sector.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.170
People must realize that
there's a fair amount of money

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:22.596
to be made in this area.

00:38:22.596 --> 00:38:24.220
And those of you who
listen to the news

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.290
probably know that
this is indeed true.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.690
There is actually an
increasing interest

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.310
from the private sector
in a very big way.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:36.250
Six or eight months ago
Larry Page, in particular,

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.210
and Google in general,
announced that there

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:43.970
was going to be a new
company called Calico working

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.290
on the problem of aging
as a medical problem.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:50.560
And they hired one of the most
successful biotech leaders

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.906
of our time, Art Levinson, who
ran Genentech for a long time,

00:38:54.906 --> 00:38:55.980
to run it.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.140
Now Art Levinson has
the enormous advantage

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.450
that he is not a card-carrying,
lifelong gerontologist,

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.620
so he is not in danger
of being encumbered

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.149
by conventional wisdom.

00:39:06.149 --> 00:39:07.565
He also has the
enormous advantage

00:39:07.565 --> 00:39:11.540
of being extremely smart
and a careful thinker,

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.560
and he has the third
extraordinary advantage

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.430
of having a humongous
budget courtesy of Google.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.930
So he is in a position to
make an enormous difference.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:23.350
And I have very high
hopes he will do so.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.760
Much more recently,
just two weeks ago,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.990
the person who sequenced the
human genome, Craig Venter,

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:32.070
together with the
person who founded

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.270
the X Prize and Singularity
University, Peter Diamandis,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.010
got together and
announced a new company

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.200
named Human
Longevity Inc., which

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.520
is working on the same problem
in a rather narrow way,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.490
focusing on genome
sequencing which

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:50.260
is no surprise given
Venter's involvement.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.500
But again, this shows that the
credibility issue is beginning

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.440
to go away, and
it's about time too.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.150
However, the fact is that
human longevity is working

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.510
on low-hanging
fruit and does not,

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.170
honestly, claim to be
working on the problem

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.760
in a comprehensive manner.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.024
I'm hoping first
for sure that Calico

00:40:12.024 --> 00:40:14.440
will be working on this problem
in a comprehensive manner.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.380
But while their precise
plans remain somewhat opaque,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.000
I'm not relying on it.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.160
Ultimately, I believe
that for quite a while

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.730
to come we're going to need a
nonprofit participation in this

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.350
that is essentially the
guardian of the things

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.160
that other people might be
in danger of neglecting.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.580
And that's what SENS
Research Foundation is.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.850
We don't work much on this top
line-- on stem cell therapy.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.310
And the reason we don't is
precisely what I just said.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:42.685
There's a lot of
people out there

00:40:42.685 --> 00:40:44.020
doing exactly that already.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.120
And our money, our
very limited budget

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.350
of something in the region of $4
million or so dollars per year,

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.230
is better spent making more
of a difference elsewhere.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.650
All of these things down
here are correspondingly

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.251
much more neglected, especially
the ones with two exclamation

00:40:57.251 --> 00:40:57.750
marks.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.541
Pretty much nobody else
is working on them,

00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:01.580
and that is a tragedy.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.870
But it does mean that
someone, namely us,

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.584
needs to be around to do it.

00:41:06.584 --> 00:41:08.500
I am going to talk about
this one for a little

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.630
longer just to give you a
proper feel for what we do.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.380
And make sure you understand
that we aren't just talk,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.680
we actually get lab work done.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.200
This is the beginning
of atherosclerosis

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.680
when a white blood cell, a
macrophage, in the artery wall

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.290
becomes poisoned by
contaminants, oxidized

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:33.070
cholesterol to be
precise, contaminants

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.952
of the material that
it is processing.

00:41:34.952 --> 00:41:36.660
It becomes this thing
called a foam cell,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.710
a kind of undead,
inflammatory thing.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.660
And it gets full of
lipids as you can see.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:45.880
And this is something
that progresses.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.190
These cells don't go away.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.150
More and more of them
pile into the plaque

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.300
and eventually the plaque
gets big enough to burst.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.625
And that's when you get a
heart attack and a stroke,

00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:53.637
and we don't want that.

00:41:53.637 --> 00:41:55.720
So what have we got now
to do anything about that?

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.980
What we've got is surgery--
stents and such like.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.290
That as you probably know
doesn't really work very well

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.220
and plus surgery
is really invasive.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.599
Also we've got statins.

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:05.640
Statins are preventative.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.530
It sounds good, doesn't it?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.780
But they are too preventative.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.160
They are an example of the,
what I would call a moment ago,

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.200
the gerontology approach.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.620
They attack the
problem by attacking

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.630
the aspects of our
desirable metabolism

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.040
that cause the problem.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.830
In other words,
in this case they

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:27.200
reduce the rate at which
we synthesize cholesterol.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.040
Now cholesterol itself is an
absolutely vital molecule.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.170
And it's only oxidized
cholesterol that's bad for you.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.980
So that means that if we
diminished oxidized cholesterol

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.210
by diminishing
cholesterol, we have

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.550
a very serious
therapeutic index problem.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.410
But there's only
so far we can go

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.800
before we start to do
more harm than good.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.560
That's why statins ultimately
are not the solution.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.570
What we're doing at
SENS Research Foundation

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.320
is attacking the oxidized
cholesterol directly.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.360
In particular we're
attacking a particular type

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.780
of oxidized cholesterol,
7-Ketocholesterol,

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.040
which has been well
established by other people

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.960
to be public enemy
number one here--

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.010
the most toxic and
the most abundant.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:05.930
First thing we did
we found bacteria

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.690
that were able to break it down.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.670
You do something called
an enrichment culture.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.294
You take a bunch of
different bacteria.

00:43:11.294 --> 00:43:12.630
You give them this stuff to eat.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.020
You don't give
them anything else.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.270
The ones that can't eat it
just sit there like lemons.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.110
The ones that can, grow.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:19.940
And of course, the
stuff goes away.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.900
And that's very straightforward.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.077
Then rather than proposing
to inject lots of bacteria

00:43:25.077 --> 00:43:27.660
into the body to eat the stuff,
which would probably have side

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.160
effects, we instead
figure out the genetics.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.110
We figure out how they do this.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.460
We do mass spectrometry
which is a way of identifying

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.690
the breakdown
products and inferring

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.630
the enzymatic activity.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.110
We could also do
expression analysis

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.710
to figure out which genes are
being activated by the thing

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.880
that this thing
is breaking down.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.810
And the result is
quite some time

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.350
ago back in 2008--
no 2009 maybe 2010--

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:58.260
we had got our hands on
some genes and enzymes which

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.630
were able to break
down 7-Ketocholesterol.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.390
Then we started on
the hard part which

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:07.000
was to get those genes
working in human cells.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.640
That's tough
because bacteria are

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.830
very different from human cells
in lots of different ways.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.240
But we finally did it.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.540
And first of all,
we had to make sure

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.510
that our engineered gene--
engineered protein-- went

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.760
to the right part of the cell.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.520
This just shows
that we can do that.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.160
You have to go to the lysosome
which is sustained by red.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.880
This is our engineered protein.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.920
This is overlap.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.930
But then we had to
actually make it work.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.750
And this basically is what
shows that we succeeded.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.330
If you have an absolutely
supportable amount

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.310
of 7-Ketocholesterol
in the medium of cells

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:44.550
that are trying to grow, then
they die, whatever happens,

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.380
but if you have a more
modest amount than the fact

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.980
that this bar on the right is
always taller than the ones

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:56.550
before it is an illustration
that the engineered gene is

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.490
protective.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:01.320
It's protective because
it creates an enzyme that

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.961
breaks down 7-Ketocholesterol
and the enzyme

00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:05.710
is targeted to the
right part of the cell.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.660
These various negative
controls, either they

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.826
don't have an enzyme, or
they have the wrong enzyme,

00:45:09.826 --> 00:45:11.980
or the enzyme is not
targeted to the lysosome.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.870
So this was a pretty
impressive result.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.510
It's only about a
year-and-a-half old.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.660
And we're now working
to extend that to make

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.260
it work in the cells that really
necessary-- not macrophages.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.135
And then of course we'll
move to mass models.

00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:25.224
AUDIENCE: Sorry just wanted
to know which of those bars

00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:27.030
is control, ie, no
change, it's the same.

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:28.830
AUBREY: OK, so the
sets of bars here.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.530
Right?

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:33.710
So each of these sets is
a different concentration

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:34.480
of the toxin so--

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.355
AUDIENCE: I got that.

00:45:35.355 --> 00:45:37.700
And the one on the far
right is with your enzyme.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.670
AUBREY: That's right.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.231
AUDIENCE: So what's
the one that has

00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:41.480
nothing cutting the cells off?

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.688
AUBREY: That's the black one.

00:45:42.688 --> 00:45:45.210
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.890
AUBREY: Right, so let's go
on to longevity for a minute.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:52.280
So the first
question is how much

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.502
extra life do we expect to get?

00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:56.460
And the first thing I
want to mention of course

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.600
is to reemphasize the fact that
this will all be healthy life.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.650
We will be keeping alive only
by keeping people healthy.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:05.540
That's really just
an extension of what

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.050
we have seen historically over
the past, let's say, 50 years.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.580
The reason why life
expectancy is now maybe

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.910
10 or 12 years greater
than it was in the 1960s

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.750
is because people
aged, let's say, 70,

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.460
are about as healthy
as people work

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.160
in the 1960s who
were aged only 58.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.570
That is a really important
thing to understand.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.110
But it's not the whole story.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.510
So the therapies that I've been
outlining to you today I think

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:39.570
have a good chance of getting
about 30 years onto our life.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.620
They will add 30 years.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.060
And because they are
rejuvenation therapies

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.790
that repair damage.

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.600
What that means is that we'll
be taking people who already,

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.720
let's say 60, and fixing them
up well enough that they won't

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.240
be biologically 60 again,
either mentally or physically,

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.190
until they are
chronologically 90.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.280
So that's the key
thing that we're doing.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.290
Not just slowing aging
down, but reversing it.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:07.180
Now you may ask,
well OK, why only 90?

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.510
Why doesn't this
work indefinitely?

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.420
And the answer is because these
therapies won't be perfect.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.910
They are pretty good.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.615
I think they're going to work
on most of the types of damage

00:47:16.615 --> 00:47:17.240
that we've got.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.270
Certainly, they're going to
work on most of the examples

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.281
within each of the
categories of damage.

00:47:22.281 --> 00:47:23.780
But they are still
going to be stuff

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.946
that is a little bit harder.

00:47:24.946 --> 00:47:26.290
They won't be perfect.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.520
So then what?

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.150
Well the thing is
that 30 years is

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.990
a hell of a long
time in technology,

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.140
including medical technology.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.800
And essentially we've
bought that time.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.060
So bearing in mind
what I told you

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.850
earlier about the
very high likelihood

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:49.732
that these categories are indeed
an exhaustive classification,

00:47:49.732 --> 00:47:51.440
notwithstanding what
the first question I

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.890
mentioned about the possibility
that in a very distant future

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.473
we may have to worry about other
effects of nuclear mutations.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.590
We're talking about a seriously
interesting situation.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.900
We're talking about the
possibility that by the time

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:08.090
these people who are
rejuvenated come back

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:11.050
as 90-year-olds who
are biologically 60,

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:14.910
we will have improved these
therapies enough, still not

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.900
perfectly, but enough that
we can re-rejuvenate them

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.790
even though the
problems of rejuvenation

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:26.450
is a bit harder than it used
to be so that they won't be

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:32.270
biologically 60 for a third
time until they are 150.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.570
And I don't know whether
by the age of 500

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.080
we're going to be
able to figure out

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.260
how to solve the problem
of nuclear mutations

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.730
that don't lead to cancer
well enough as well.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.960
But I certainly think
it's quite likely.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:50.810
So we're talking
about the possibility

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:55.320
of kicking the ball up the road
faster than time is passing

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.270
pretty much as for
as long as we like.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.550
That's what I've called
longevity escape velocity--

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.570
the minimum rate
at which we need

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.090
to improve the comprehensiveness
of the therapies

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:06.395
in order to stay one step
ahead of the problem.

00:49:06.395 --> 00:49:10.070
And I think we've got a very
good chance of maintaining

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.640
longevity escape velocity once
we get that first generation

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.920
set of therapies
that give 30 years.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.070
That's quite an important
thing to understand.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:19.930
So we're talking about
very long longevity--

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.540
people just don't tend to
die when they are healthy.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.575
So that's quite nice to know.

00:49:24.575 --> 00:49:26.700
The next question, therefore,
which you're probably

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.183
all thinking about
now, is well how soon

00:49:28.183 --> 00:49:29.974
are these therapies,
these first generation

00:49:29.974 --> 00:49:32.470
therapies, likely to arrive.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.289
And I want to answer
that in two ways.

00:49:34.289 --> 00:49:36.330
First of all, I want to
tell you a direct answer,

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.780
and then I want to tell you
the answer that matters.

00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:41.140
The direct answer is of
course we don't know.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.730
Like any other
pioneering technology,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.840
the time frame is
extremely speculative.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.830
But I would say,
going out on a limb,

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.930
that we have a 50/50
chance of getting there

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.520
within 20 or 25
years just so long

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.060
as within the next 5 or 10
years the rate of progress

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.036
is not seriously slowed
down by lack of funding.

00:49:58.036 --> 00:49:59.910
I would say it is
currently being slowed down

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.630
by at least a factor of three.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:05.350
So we're in a bad way--
we're losing a lot of lives--

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.530
but the fact is that's
a reasonable time frame.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.120
I think there's at
least a 10% chance

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.830
that it will take 100
years if we hit problems

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.121
that we haven't thought of yet.

00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:16.489
But still you know a 50%
chance is quite enough

00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:17.530
to be worth fighting for.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.257
So that's what I'm going for.

00:50:20.257 --> 00:50:22.590
But here's the answer that
you need to be thinking about

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.360
is this down here.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.600
Eventually, at some
point before then,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.950
we're going to have sufficiently
dramatic and impressive

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.220
progress in the lab,
typically with mice,

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.920
to convince people that
it's only a matter of time

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.150
before we get this sort
of thing happening.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.260
And that is when the shit is
really going to hit the fan.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.840
It's going to be
complete pandemonium.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.110
And you'd better be ready.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.310
I think the sooner that
happens the better.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.340
And I believe that one
thing I'm achieving

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.890
by giving so much
publicity to this research

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.170
is softening the world
up-- getting people

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.320
to understand the
feasibility and indeed

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.030
the desirability of doing
something serious about aging

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:07.310
in the clinic and
thereby diminishing

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.480
how dramatic the
progress in the lab

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.540
needs to be to
achieve this tipping

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:12.850
point of public opinion.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.690
That's what I want
to try and achieve.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.910
So I am just going to close
in the last minute or two

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.920
by highlighting the
sociological implications--

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.810
the social context.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.160
I spend my entire life
answering questions like this.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.450
Oh, dear where we
put all the people?

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:30.970
Won't it be only for the rich?

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.150
Won't dictators live forever?

00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:35.580
Won't we just get bored?

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.250
Wouldn't it be so
boring not having

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.420
Alzheimer's and being able to
remember everything you did?

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.350
And how will we
pay the pensions?

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.600
Now look, why do we pay people?

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.570
Why do we pay people
quite a lot of money

00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.640
to do nothing from
the age of 65?

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.470
Any ideas?

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:51.220
I'll tell you why.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.740
It's because we're
very sorry for them.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.540
And the reason we're
very sorry for them

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.546
is because there are
about to get sick and die.

00:51:58.546 --> 00:52:00.170
And I'd prefer that
not to be the case.

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:02.170
You know it will be a
whole new social contract,

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.197
yes, but the fact is,
it's the only reason.

00:52:04.197 --> 00:52:05.655
So these are not
very good reasons,

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:08.280
and I'm not even going to bother
going any further with saying,

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:08.850
why not?

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.890
This is what we ought to
be thinking about when

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:13.800
we come to the sociological
considerations.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.830
Not having ill health in
old age is quite important.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:22.230
You know it was a massive,
massive shock to me when

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.500
I discovered in
the age of about 30

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.900
that most people, certainly
even most biologists,

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.910
don't really regard
aging as a particularly

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.035
interesting or particularly
important problem.

00:52:32.035 --> 00:52:33.410
And the reason it
was a shock was

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.530
because I had never
considered that anyone

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:37.690
could think any differently.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.270
It's like you don't consider
the color of the sky.

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:45.650
I mean it's so completely clear
that ill health is the number

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.570
one source of
suffering in the world

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:50.520
and that aging is the number
one source of ill health.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.910
So obviously it's the
world's biggest problem.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.006
Dear me.

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.880
When it comes to the
economics, obviously you

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.400
have to consider the fact
that the elderly will

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.024
be able to contribute
wealth to society

00:53:01.024 --> 00:53:02.675
rather than just
consuming wealth.

00:53:02.675 --> 00:53:05.216
And that they won't get bored
because they'll have the energy

00:53:05.216 --> 00:53:07.550
and vitality to explore
novelty the way you and I do.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.980
And they can take-- they
can retire temporarily

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.720
for 20 years.

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.860
And then go back
and retrain and be

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.440
a rock for the next 40 years.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.200
And above all, the thing that
the elderly get the most scared

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.630
of is that they will become
a burden on their kids,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.471
on the people that
they used to support.

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:24.970
And they are really
scared of that--

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:26.330
it's not going to
happen anymore.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:27.410
So that's what we need
to be thinking about.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:28.760
This is the book I mentioned.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.230
It was written in
2007 so you might

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:32.730
think it might be
a bit out of date.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.120
It isn't really out of date yet.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.550
And the reason it's not
is not because there's

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:37.310
been no progress.

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:38.726
There has been
masses of progress.

00:53:38.726 --> 00:53:40.630
The reason, the very
heartening reason,

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.750
is that the progress
has overwhelmingly

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.770
been the sort of progress
that we said would happen.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:49.500
So again, this idea, this
concept, this paradigm,

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.290
is really standing
the test of time.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.250
And I'll stop there.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.595
And I hope there's time
for some questions.

00:53:55.595 --> 00:54:01.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:01.602 --> 00:54:02.310
AUBREY: Go ahead.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.168
Please.

00:54:03.168 --> 00:54:05.558
AUDIENCE: So one thought
that occurs to me.

00:54:05.558 --> 00:54:07.820
We talked earlier about
how this is easier

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.546
because the body already has
all these self-repair systems.

00:54:10.546 --> 00:54:14.450
But the question that
comes to my mind for that

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.700
is a little bit of a Pollyannish
[INAUDIBLE] question.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:21.190
Is the synergy between the
systems that you mentioned

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:24.465
and whether or not recruitments
in one of those systems

00:54:24.465 --> 00:54:27.470
would buy that synergy
from the other systems.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:29.660
I specifically thinking
of mitochondria producing

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.732
mitochondria, but it's
a general question.

00:54:31.732 --> 00:54:33.794
Do you think there's
a possibility of that?

00:54:33.794 --> 00:54:34.460
Do you see that?

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.930
AUBREY: So very
interesting question--

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.430
so it's so interesting
that I'm even

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.340
going to take the
trouble to repeat it.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.144
So the question is
really supposing

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:43.060
we just fixed one of
these things really well.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.990
But we didn't actually
fix anything else.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.970
Would that not have kind of
knock-on secondary effects

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:53.460
that would somewhat alleviate
the pathologies that

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.120
were being predominantly caused
by the other types of problem,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.120
even if those other types
of problems themselves

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.640
were not being
directly addressed?

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.480
I'm absolutely sure that
there would be such an effect.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.850
The thing that is much,
much harder to ask

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:06.450
is how much effect?

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.470
And furthermore I
think we can certainly

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:10.520
say that if you fixed
one of these things,

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.356
the overall effect
will certainly not

00:55:12.356 --> 00:55:14.730
be so substantial as to give
let's say, a decade of life.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.734
I think we can certainly put
pretty confident upper bounds.

00:55:18.734 --> 00:55:20.400
Now you mentioned
mitochondria mutations

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.680
at a particular candidate,
and it's a great candidate

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.179
to choose.

00:55:23.179 --> 00:55:25.680
I think that is the one about
which the range of uncertainty

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.500
is the greatest partly at
the bottom end actually.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:33.480
The mitochondrial
mutations are the one case

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.890
where we can't point to any
particular pathology of old age

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:41.080
for which that type of
damage is the major driver.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.760
But looking at it the other
way around, what we can say

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.720
is that if mitochondrial
mutations matter at all,

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.099
then they probably
matter very ubiquitously.

00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:51.140
So actually, my very first
book, which was purely

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.640
for an academic
audience back in 1999--

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.360
that was the book for
which I got my Ph.D.--

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.590
that was written precisely
about that and I said that maybe

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.090
we've got a 10% chance of
doubling a lifespan just like

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:04.630
that.

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:05.260
Any more?

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.210
AUDIENCE: Do you
still think that?

00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:08.780
AUBREY: Yeah, 10%.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.310
Good.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:10.846
AUDIENCE: So I suspect
this is another one

00:56:10.846 --> 00:56:12.220
of your boring
questions, but you

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.030
didn't have it on your list.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.780
You say that aging is
the biggest problem.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.600
How about hunger and
poverty as things

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.641
that cause a lot of
suffering in the world today?

00:56:19.641 --> 00:56:21.130
AUBREY: Yeah, just
do the numbers.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:23.630
How many people are hungry?

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.930
How many people have the
diseases and disabilities

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:26.977
of old age?

00:56:26.977 --> 00:56:27.810
Just do the numbers.

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.616
Yep.

00:56:32.616 --> 00:56:34.490
AUDIENCE: You may not
be able to answer this,

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.830
but if you were
going to estimate.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:39.732
Say you wanted to get all this
accomplished in the next 25

00:56:39.732 --> 00:56:41.315
years, what do you
think that it would

00:56:41.315 --> 00:56:42.398
cost in today's economics?

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:44.590
AUBREY: The glorious
news is that the money

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:46.250
is ridiculously small.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.980
So we need to
divide it in phases.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.630
The money certainly gets
much bigger at later stages

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.920
just as for any
medical research when

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.230
we get into clinical trials.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.070
But I don't even bother
thinking about that

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.200
because I know, as I
mentioned in I think

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:01.220
the second-to-last
slide, that once

00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:04.340
we get sufficiently dramatic
results in mice, game over.

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:05.450
Money will be no object.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.010
People will just get it.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.510
And it will be straightforward
to get money in the door.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.210
So the question
then is how much is

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.150
the money we need now
to really get this done.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.370
When I say "we"
here I am not just

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:16.090
talking about SENS Research
Foundation, of course,

00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:17.460
I'm talking about overall.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.710
I think we're talking
about really small money

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.880
like $100 million dollars per
year for as little as 10 years

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.930
would do it.

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.050
And we're already up
in the SENS Foundation

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.425
itself like $4 or
$5 million dollars.

00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:32.730
So It's only an order of
magnitude we're talking about.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.160
It's pitifully small.

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.830
And when we look back on how
long it took for that money

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.630
to be forthcoming,
we are going to be

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:40.555
very ashamed as a species.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.044
AUDIENCE: Are there parts of
the body that are not really

00:57:46.044 --> 00:57:47.169
designed to be rejuvenated?

00:57:47.169 --> 00:57:49.370
Like teeth and
[INAUDIBLE] maybe?

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:51.150
AUBREY: The parts
of the body that

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:55.290
don't have very much in the way
of intrinsic, built-in repair

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:58.330
capacity are actually tending
to be the easiest ones

00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.620
to fix because they're the
ones that don't need repair

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.280
very much.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.560
So teeth is a great example.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:06.330
Teeth have some repair.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:09.140
Some species have more than two
sets of teeth in their life,

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.223
and actually the work
that's going on in that area

00:58:11.223 --> 00:58:14.320
is precisely along those lines,
organizing for stem cells

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.790
to regrow a new set of teeth.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:21.950
That is relatively
on the simple side.

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:22.659
Yep, in the back.

00:58:22.659 --> 00:58:24.116
AUDIENCE: At the
beginning you said

00:58:24.116 --> 00:58:25.809
that damage was the
main cause of aging,

00:58:25.809 --> 00:58:29.330
and yet we haven't had a lot of
success moving out maximum life

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.305
spans in different
creatures, which

00:58:31.305 --> 00:58:32.799
makes it seem that
maybe there are

00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:34.340
other mechanisms
besides just damage.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:38.450
AUBREY: OK, so we've done
pretty well with maximum life.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.502
First of all it depends
how you define maximum.

00:58:40.502 --> 00:58:41.960
So the technical
definition that is

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:45.980
conventional within gerontology
which can be used conveniently

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:49.900
for populations like 7 billion
or populations like 100

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.660
like you have with
mice in the lab.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.410
They normally use
the life span--

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:58.216
the number after which 5
or 10% of the population

00:58:58.216 --> 00:58:58.840
is still alive.

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.290
So If we use that
definition, then

00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:03.740
yes we've actually been pretty
successful in moving things

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.240
out.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.220
But not because of
progress against aging.

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:12.520
What has predominantly happened
over the postwar period

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.781
is that people seem
to be benefiting

00:59:14.781 --> 00:59:17.030
from what are called cohort
affects, which essentially

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:20.330
means they were born younger, or
at least they were-- they spent

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:21.780
most of their lives younger.

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.500
And we understand
a bit about that.

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.780
Prenatal nutrition has
made an enormous difference

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.664
to lifelong health.

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:29.580
AUDIENCE: Actually I
meant maximum as maximum.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.710
AUBREY: OK, so I was
going to get onto that.

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:32.373
AUDIENCE: So the
model organism would

00:59:32.373 --> 00:59:33.280
be pushed out to the maximum.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.696
AUBREY: Right, so yeah, so in
the case of model organisms,

00:59:35.696 --> 00:59:38.060
no question, we've
actually got--

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:42.100
I mean the world record mouse
lifespan is like five years

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.860
and like 20 years ago it wasn't.

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.519
It was like three years--
or three and a half.

00:59:47.519 --> 00:59:49.560
So that's happened, but
that's small populations.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.210
So that's why I wanted to
give that earlier answer.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:53.650
If we look at huge
populations, like human race,

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:55.790
then things get a
bit more interesting.

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:58.970
It is rather curious what's
been happening there.

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.380
The world record lifespan
is 122, and the person

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.670
who reached that
age died in 1997

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.240
which is quite long time ago.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.710
In the time between
then and now,

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.050
the number of people
who reached 100

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:16.410
has gone up worldwide by a
factor of several, right?

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:20.420
So it's bizarre that-- in fact
no one is anywhere near this.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:24.350
The current world record
living person is 116.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.200
Well, what's going on?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.370
That is a big paradox.

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.190
Nobody has much idea.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.300
It could be cohort effect again.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.150
It could be that
there were periods

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:37.280
of particularly good nutrition
and such like in the 1870s

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.080
or whatever.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.764
But it's a major research topic.

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:41.430
We really don't know
the answer to that.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.110
Yep.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.876
AUDIENCE: Do you do anything
with nanorobots and things

01:00:49.876 --> 01:00:50.376
like that.

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:51.800
Do you think that's
going to play in this?

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.966
AUBREY: Will nanobots and
such like play a big part?

01:00:53.966 --> 01:00:55.664
Well, my view in
general-- let me

01:00:55.664 --> 01:00:57.330
answer a slightly
more general question.

01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:00.910
My view in general is that
non-biological solutions

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:05.420
to medical problems which
already play a minor role

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.000
with things like cochlear
implants, or indeed spectacles,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.250
right?

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:13.070
They do actually have
a very good prospect

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.680
of playing an increasing
role as time goes on.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.090
And certainly the
miniaturization

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.490
of non-biological solutions
such as nanobots or things

01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:25.190
on the way to that--
millibots, microbots--

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.990
will accelerate that process.

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:32.500
However, I'm pretty sure that
they won't play a dominant role

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.750
until well after we've got
this stuff working well

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.616
enough to get to
longevity escape velocity.

01:01:37.616 --> 01:01:39.111
Yep.

01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:40.777
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that on the whole

01:01:40.777 --> 01:01:42.447
our genes and
genetic program are

01:01:42.447 --> 01:01:46.540
kind of indifferent to whether
the elderly live longer.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.256
Or are there sort of mechanisms
within the genetic code

01:01:50.256 --> 01:01:51.755
that are actively
reducing life span

01:01:51.755 --> 01:01:56.370
because it would be adaptive to
have non-reproducing organisms

01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:57.820
sort of not be taking it?

01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.903
AUBREY: So the three-word
summary of your question

01:01:59.903 --> 01:02:01.060
is-- is aging programmed?

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.560
That's the way it's
normally stated.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.230
So the consensus answer to
this in the field which I agree

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.550
is that no aging
is not programmed.

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.290
A long time ago,
however, in fact

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:14.760
for probably 60 or
70 years starting

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.570
in the 1880s it was
firmly believed that aging

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.180
is programmed because
everything must be programmed

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.710
because evolution
is clever, right?

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.420
And people came up
with clever reasons

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.420
why it would be programmed
like it would improve

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.520
the signal-to-noise ratio
of natural selection

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.515
by eliminating these
useless, old organisms.

01:02:34.964 --> 01:02:36.630
At the beginning of
the 1950s the people

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.890
started to point out that
very few organisms in the wild

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:42.197
are actually old enough
to suffer any real

01:02:42.197 --> 01:02:44.405
functional decline because
predation, and starvation,

01:02:44.405 --> 01:02:47.790
and hypothermia, and so on take
such a rapid toll that you've

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:50.210
just got nothing
left by that time.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:52.630
Now originally that
argument was oversimplified.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:58.910
You do indeed need some
non-negligible amount of death

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:02.870
from aging in the wild in
order to maintain selection

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:05.234
for our antiaging machinery
that I spoke about earlier.

01:03:05.234 --> 01:03:06.650
Otherwise that
machinery will just

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:08.380
degrade through
spontaneous mutations

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.630
in the germline from one
generation to the next.

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:12.370
But there isn't very much.

01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:16.280
And certainly when you look at
questions like how rapidly does

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.410
the rate of aging change in a
population when you put them

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:22.065
into a different environment
where the selective pressure is

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:24.790
sharply divergent
from how it was,

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.770
then it turns out that
the rate of change

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:30.250
is really slow, so slow
that it can be ascribed only

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.930
to selection from
spontaneous mutations

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:36.660
rather than any kind of
changing in the input

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.760
environmental parameters
to any kind of program.

01:03:42.563 --> 01:03:44.688
AUDIENCE: Metabolism
reduction is one of the things

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:49.494
that people try to use for
[INAUDIBLE] without-- it

01:03:49.494 --> 01:03:51.993
doesn't seem like it's very
sure how it's going to work out.

01:03:51.993 --> 01:03:54.100
How does it lead
to the degradation?

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:54.830
AUBREY: OK, so
first of all I want

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.870
to make sure that
everyone understands

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:57.700
the way I'm using the
word "metabolism."

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.230
There's a phrase in
biology, metabolic rate,

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:04.790
which refers specifically to the
rate of consumption of oxygen.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:07.376
So that's in other words, the
rate of oxygen metabolism.

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.250
But I am using the word
metabolism in the way

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.880
that biologists use
it strictly which

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.130
means everything that
goes in the body--

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:15.440
all of the processes that
keep us alive from one

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.856
day to the next,
whether they have

01:04:16.856 --> 01:04:18.240
oxygen involved
or anything else.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.040
Now, your question refers
to calorie restriction,

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.650
essentially eating less,
and it turns out, yes, it

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:27.590
was discovered way back in the
1930s that if you feed a mouse

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.050
or rat less than
it wants then it

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:30.610
lives a bit longer--
that's cool.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:32.110
Other than that it
seems not to work

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.220
very well for
longer-lived species.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.720
It works much
better, conversely,

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.610
for really short-lived
spaces like nematodes.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.790
You can get the nematodes to
live three or four times longer

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.748
than they otherwise would
just by starving them

01:04:41.748 --> 01:04:45.080
at the right time
in their life cycle.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.590
Why is this?

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.030
Why it turns out to be
fairly straightforward.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.321
It all comes down to the
strength of natural selection.

01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:52.060
Long famines are less
common than short famines

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:55.260
and therefore the
reason, the need,

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.920
to live longer
so-to-speak is less.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.780
So we have less good machinery,
less efficient, less impressive

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.600
machinery to respond to
nutrient deprivation in this way

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.530
than a short-lived
organism does.

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:08.410
Thank you very much.

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:12.979
[APPLAUSE]
