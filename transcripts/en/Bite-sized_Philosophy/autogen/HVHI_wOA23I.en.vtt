00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.910
you're in a class it's near the

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920
you're in a class it's near the
 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.070
you're in a class it's near the
beginning of the semester you write an

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
beginning of the semester you write an
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.780
beginning of the semester you write an
exam or you hand in an essay and you

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790
exam or you hand in an essay and you
 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.849
exam or you hand in an essay and you
don't get the mark that you desired okay

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
don't get the mark that you desired okay
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.709
don't get the mark that you desired okay
so what are your options well one option

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
so what are your options well one option
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.720
so what are your options well one option
would be so you've hit an anomaly things

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
would be so you've hit an anomaly things
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.640
would be so you've hit an anomaly things
didn't happen the way you wanted them to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
didn't happen the way you wanted them to
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.250
didn't happen the way you wanted them to
happen and so maybe you say jeez that

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
happen and so maybe you say jeez that
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.810
happen and so maybe you say jeez that
was a boring and stupid class anyways

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
was a boring and stupid class anyways
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880
was a boring and stupid class anyways
this gives me an excuse to get out and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
this gives me an excuse to get out and
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950
this gives me an excuse to get out and
so that's not such a negative thing or

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
so that's not such a negative thing or
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.380
so that's not such a negative thing or
you think oh well I really better buckle

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
you think oh well I really better buckle
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.570
you think oh well I really better buckle
down and study and you decide to stay in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
down and study and you decide to stay in
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.339
down and study and you decide to stay in
the class so basically what you've done

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
the class so basically what you've done
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620
the class so basically what you've done
is maintained your framework I'm going

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
is maintained your framework I'm going
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.440
is maintained your framework I'm going
to work through this class but you're

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450
to work through this class but you're
 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.120
to work through this class but you're
you've decided to modify some of the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
you've decided to modify some of the
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.150
you've decided to modify some of the
subroutines that make up that frame you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
subroutines that make up that frame you
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.619
subroutines that make up that frame you
say well I should study more next time

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
say well I should study more next time
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.420
say well I should study more next time
or I have to prioritize this class

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
or I have to prioritize this class
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950
or I have to prioritize this class
compared to other classes so it's a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
compared to other classes so it's a
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.410
compared to other classes so it's a
micro alteration within the overarching

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
micro alteration within the overarching
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450
micro alteration within the overarching
framework but another thing you can do

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460
framework but another thing you can do
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.830
framework but another thing you can do
is say to hell with the class I just

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
is say to hell with the class I just
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.060
is say to hell with the class I just
I'll just drop it and so the advantage

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
I'll just drop it and so the advantage
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.459
I'll just drop it and so the advantage
to that is problem gone the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
to that is problem gone the
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930
to that is problem gone the
disadvantages well now you have a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
disadvantages well now you have a
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.599
disadvantages well now you have a
different problem which is okay fine you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
different problem which is okay fine you
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.219
different problem which is okay fine you
drop the class do you have another class

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
drop the class do you have another class
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.679
drop the class do you have another class
that you can replace it with is that a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
that you can replace it with is that a
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.840
that you can replace it with is that a
good way of dealing with a micro failure

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
good way of dealing with a micro failure
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090
good way of dealing with a micro failure
you know to move up a level of analysis

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
you know to move up a level of analysis
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340
you know to move up a level of analysis
and throughout the whole frame because

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
and throughout the whole frame because
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.840
and throughout the whole frame because
you could also say well maybe I should

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
you could also say well maybe I should
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.149
you could also say well maybe I should
just drop out of university and maybe I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
just drop out of university and maybe I
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980
just drop out of university and maybe I
should go hang myself you know that's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
should go hang myself you know that's
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870
should go hang myself you know that's
well it's the same line of logic it's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
well it's the same line of logic it's
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399
well it's the same line of logic it's
just taken up to a higher degree of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
just taken up to a higher degree of
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.370
just taken up to a higher degree of
abstraction and so generally speaking

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380
abstraction and so generally speaking
 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.560
abstraction and so generally speaking
you don't want to solve a problem by

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
you don't want to solve a problem by
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840
you don't want to solve a problem by
moving up a level and wiping out the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
moving up a level and wiping out the
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460
moving up a level and wiping out the
frame within which the problem was

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
frame within which the problem was
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.219
frame within which the problem was
experienced you you want to do that

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
experienced you you want to do that
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.870
experienced you you want to do that
carefully because in principle the frame

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
carefully because in principle the frame
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149
carefully because in principle the frame
that you were working within had already

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
that you were working within had already
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460
that you were working within had already
you'd already assigned value to it and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
you'd already assigned value to it and
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289
you'd already assigned value to it and
worked out it you've already invested in

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
worked out it you've already invested in
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210
worked out it you've already invested in
it too big sacrifice to blow out the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
it too big sacrifice to blow out the
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399
it too big sacrifice to blow out the
whole frame now sometimes you can do it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
whole frame now sometimes you can do it
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.450
whole frame now sometimes you can do it
so anyways what happens is well it gets

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
so anyways what happens is well it gets
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.520
so anyways what happens is well it gets
a bad grade and you're upset about it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
a bad grade and you're upset about it
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.850
a bad grade and you're upset about it
and so you've been plunged from your

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
and so you've been plunged from your
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.609
and so you've been plunged from your
happy satiated state let's say into a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
happy satiated state let's say into a
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280
happy satiated state let's say into a
state of relative chaos and the chaos is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
state of relative chaos and the chaos is
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.910
state of relative chaos and the chaos is
oh I hit an obstacle I didn't expect it

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
oh I hit an obstacle I didn't expect it
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.670
oh I hit an obstacle I didn't expect it
and now I don't know what to do and so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
and now I don't know what to do and so
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380
and now I don't know what to do and so
what does it mean to not know what to do

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
what does it mean to not know what to do
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630
what does it mean to not know what to do
well

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
well
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.690
well
it can mean I need to study harder it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
it can mean I need to study harder it
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.750
it can mean I need to study harder it
can mean I should drop this course it to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
can mean I should drop this course it to
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.610
can mean I should drop this course it to
mean I should major in a different

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
mean I should major in a different
 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.350
mean I should major in a different
subject it mean maybe I shouldn't be in

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
subject it mean maybe I shouldn't be in
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.870
subject it mean maybe I shouldn't be in
university it could mean maybe my future

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
university it could mean maybe my future
 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.180
university it could mean maybe my future
plans have been formulated badly it can

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190
plans have been formulated badly it can
 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.130
plans have been formulated badly it can
mean my future plans have been

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
mean my future plans have been
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.570
mean my future plans have been
formulated badly because I don't

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580
formulated badly because I don't
 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.220
formulated badly because I don't
understand myself very well and I've

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
understand myself very well and I've
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.200
understand myself very well and I've
been telling lies about my past right

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
been telling lies about my past right
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.140
been telling lies about my past right
the thing can really expand on you and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
the thing can really expand on you and
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390
the thing can really expand on you and
that's what the chaotic domain is that's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
that's what the chaotic domain is that's
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.150
that's what the chaotic domain is that's
the reman efest a ssin of those things

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
the reman efest a ssin of those things
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.760
the reman efest a ssin of those things
that you had considered irrelevant right

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770
that you had considered irrelevant right
 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.680
that you had considered irrelevant right
because when you go to pick up the exam

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
because when you go to pick up the exam
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.960
because when you go to pick up the exam
you've got your identity as a competent

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
you've got your identity as a competent
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.030
you've got your identity as a competent
student intact you're not questioning

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040
student intact you're not questioning
 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.710
student intact you're not questioning
whether you should be in the course or

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720
whether you should be in the course or
 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.930
whether you should be in the course or
whether you should be in that major or

whether you should be in that major or
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.340
whether you should be in that major or
whether you should be in university none

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350
whether you should be in university none
 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.620
whether you should be in university none
of that that's all in the implicitly

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630
of that that's all in the implicitly
 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.170
of that that's all in the implicitly
accepted category and as soon as the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
accepted category and as soon as the
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.960
accepted category and as soon as the
anomalous event emerges all of those

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
anomalous event emerges all of those
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.110
anomalous event emerges all of those
things that you had rendered axiomatic

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
things that you had rendered axiomatic
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.330
things that you had rendered axiomatic
start to become questionable and that's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
start to become questionable and that's
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270
start to become questionable and that's
like the shark coming up out coming up

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
like the shark coming up out coming up
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.920
like the shark coming up out coming up
from the depths to pull you down and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930
from the depths to pull you down and
 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590
from the depths to pull you down and
that's the classic way of representing

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600
that's the classic way of representing
 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.360
that's the classic way of representing
that and of symbolizing it that's Jonah

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
that and of symbolizing it that's Jonah
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.490
that and of symbolizing it that's Jonah
and the Whale for example so if

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
and the Whale for example so if
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.680
and the Whale for example so if
something is manifest itself from the

something is manifest itself from the
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.590
something is manifest itself from the
deep unknown and pulls you under like an

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
deep unknown and pulls you under like an

derived that particular kind of
mythological representation because you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700
mythological representation because you
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.190
mythological representation because you
could imagine that when we were on the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200
could imagine that when we were on the

down to the damn water holes and you've

down to the damn water holes and you've

down to the damn water holes and you've
you've watched enough nature programs to

you've watched enough nature programs to

water buffalo it's not pretty and so to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
water buffalo it's not pretty and so to

go down to the water the chaotic water

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
go down to the water the chaotic water
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780
go down to the water the chaotic water
and the source of all life as well right

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
and the source of all life as well right
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.640
and the source of all life as well right
is to risk an encounter with the
