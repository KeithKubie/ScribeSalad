00:00:02.286 --> 00:00:03.851
- [Voiceover] In the last
video, we talked about

00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:05.125
the meaning of current,

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:08.608
and current is defined to
be the movement of charge,

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.101
amount of charge per second.

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.461
We looked at a copper wire

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.961
where electrons are carrying the current,

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.661
and we looked also at a salt solution

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.861
where both positive and negative ions

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.916
are carrying the current
across this imaginary boundary

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:28.083
where we keep track of how
many charges are moving.

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:31.241
So now, next we need to talk about

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:33.763
how do we define a positive current?

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:35.421
What does a positive current mean?

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.558
So, I'm gonna move this up a little bit.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:40.904
And we're gonna get to something
that causes some confusion.

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:43.321
But, we'll try to clear it up here.

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:47.141
The positive sign, this is
a convention that we use.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:48.761
The positive sign for current

00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.865
is the direction that
positive charges move.

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.762
So, that's the direction...

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:59.901
this is the direction a
positive sodium ion moves.

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.621
This is the direction a
negative chlorine ion moves,

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.861
When I assign a positive
direction to the current,

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.963
the overall positive direction

00:01:09.963 --> 00:01:13.201
is gonna be in this direction.

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.034
That's plus current. Plus current.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.473
Alright, and the same thing
actually holds for a wire.

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:29.799
If I draw, let's go back
and draw my wire again.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.882
If I draw my copper wire,

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:38.550
and inside there we know that
all these little electrons,

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:43.343
all the electrons are
moving in that direction.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.805
So q- is moving in that direction.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:50.703
And when I assign a direction
for the arrow for a current,

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.620
the current arrow points this way.

00:01:54.703 --> 00:01:55.786
Plus current.

00:02:00.573 --> 00:02:03.602
So for instance, if I had
10 electrons per second

00:02:03.602 --> 00:02:06.149
that were moving in this direction here,

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.083
I would say the current is
plus 10 charges per second

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:12.583
in this direction.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:14.823
And ask yourself:

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:18.383
If it's always electrons
carrying a current,

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:22.283
why on Earth do we point
the arrow in the other way?

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.943
And that actually goes
back, way back in history,

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:27.383
to out friend Ben Franklin.

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:29.723
Ben Franklin is the person who said,

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:32.140
who basically made a decision

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:35.982
that said the charge on
an electron is minus.

00:02:35.982 --> 00:02:38.002
Now, when he made that decision,

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.702
nobody knew there was such
a thing as an electron.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.035
So Ben Franklin.

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:53.202
And that was in the year 1747.

00:02:56.485 --> 00:03:00.062
Ben Franklin's a person
who assigned plus and minus

00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:03.310
as being the two types
of charge that existed.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.042
And when he did that he had no idea.

00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:07.107
Nobody had any idea that
there was such a thing

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:08.697
as an electron.

00:03:08.697 --> 00:03:12.864
Electron was discovered by a
physicist named J. J. Thomson,

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:20.219
In the year 1897.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:28.059
That was when the electron was discovered.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.528
And believe it or not, if
we do the subtraction here,

00:03:30.528 --> 00:03:32.945
look at this, it's 150 years.

00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:37.326
For 150 years of electric research,

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:40.706
we were able to figure out
a lot of really good things,

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.346
assigning current

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:45.366
going in the opposite direction
of electrons in metal.

00:03:45.366 --> 00:03:48.471
And it's all okay. It's all okay.

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:51.246
One of the questions that's
often asked by new students,

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:52.986
is why don't we switch it around

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:54.526
so the current points this way?

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.734
Why don't we assign an electron,

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:00.901
why don't we make current go this way?

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.326
So, why didn't we just switch it around?

00:04:07.326 --> 00:04:09.446
Well, we had a 150 years of experience,

00:04:09.446 --> 00:04:12.146
and now we've actually had another 120,

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:15.364
since the discovery of the electron.

00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:16.938
And we've managed to get by with this.

00:04:16.938 --> 00:04:18.669
We have not chosen to do it.

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.846
One of the reasons we
don't do it is because

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:24.926
it would basically, it
would be a big mess.

00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:27.606
Imagine if for instance,
say in the United States

00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:30.926
we decided, Oh, driving on
the right side of the street

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:32.566
is the wrong side of the street.

00:04:32.566 --> 00:04:34.266
We want to all drive on the left.

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.837
Imagine the chaos that would cause.

00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:38.374
Now, before we made the change,

00:04:38.374 --> 00:04:40.379
everybody managed to
get where we were going,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.789
and after the change, everybody
would get there going,

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.026
but the change over would
be just so, so costly.

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.986
And the same thing with electricity.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:50.716
We can do perfectly well

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:52.861
talking about current going the direction

00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:54.201
of a positive charge,

00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:57.319
just like we did here
with the positive sodium

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.319
going in this direction.

00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:03.786
This is actually how electricity
is conducted in your body.

00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:08.686
So, it's not uncommon to have
positive charge moving around.

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:10.981
That's the definition of
current in a nutshell.

00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:13.041
We put a boundary across,

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.846
and you watch the charges going through,

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:20.506
in either direction, which
ever direction they do,

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:24.006
and you count up and you get q per second.

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:26.613
That's current.
