00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.270
Pandas suck at pandaing.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.450
They're literally the worst at being pandas.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:16.930
I would be a better panda than a panda.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.730
The giant panda is a divisive animal in the
DNews office.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.330
Some of us think it's the cutest, others think
it's the worst…

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.789
I think science has finally settled the debate
with a new study about the panda; and it turns

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.800
out, they are terrible at life.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.940
Here's what you probably know about Giant
Pandas already: they are solitary tree-climbing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.710
black-and-white mountain bears that only eat
bamboo and are notoriously difficult to breed

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.890
in zoos.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.880
All of that is true, but new research from
the American Society of Microbiology studied

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.920
the gut bacteria of the giant panda and found
they're NOT GOOD AT DIGESTING BAMBOO.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.470
WHICH IS THE ONLY THING THEY'LL EAT.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.829
According to their findings, the giant panda's
microbiota are horribly adapted for the diet

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070
that they eat.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.690
Which is just.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.980
*i mean* I just need a minute here.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.240
Guys.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
Giant Pandas eat bamboo for 14 hours every
day.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.270
It's one of the fastest growing plants in
the world[1], some species can grow a meter

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.229
a day; which is good because pandas consume
27.5 pounds (12.5kg) of it daily, but STILL

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.900
CAN'T DIGEST IT.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.479
They only process about 17 percent of the
stuff they shove in their maw!

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.270
This is an incredibly sad and real illustration
of evolutions lags.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.920
Looking at what bacteria the panda DOES have,
reveals the evolutionary history of our favorite

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.400
black and white bear.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.211
Pandas began to exclusively eat bamboo around
two million years ago, but even so, their

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:48.460
gut flora were essentially the same as their
carnivorous and omnivorous cousins!

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.580
Surprisingly, they have not evolved some of
the basic bacteria to break down the plant

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.420
fibers; and YET EAT PLANTS.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.540
What the hell evolution?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.540
Dick move.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.630
So it seems as if it's supposed to eat meat,
based on the bacteria living inside its gastrointestinal

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.689
tract.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.219
The reason why it doesn’t might be answered
by a study in PLOS One.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:14.010
The study looked at the genes of the giant
panda, and found 4.2 million years ago, the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.079
giant panda's T1R1 gene mutated, causing them
to lose ability to taste umami -- the deliciousness

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.010
that comes from meats like bacon.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.370
Their appetite-reward system was forever altered,
and this mutated species lost its taste for

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.049
meat, literally!

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.329
Okay, that's a little hyperbolic, pandas DO
eat the occasional small rodent, or deer fawn.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.340
But scientists believe because of the loss
of umami, their herbivorous diet was further

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.340
reinforced.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.459
Funnily enough, herbivores like cows and horses
DO carry the T1R1 gene which allows for umami…

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.659
Scientists are puzzled to say the least.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.199
To add to all this biological dissonance,
are the well-documented problems with panda

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.199
breeding.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.400
Females only ovulate once a year, for only
a couple of days!

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.419
If the female doesn't meet a male -- they're
really solitary remember -- they don't birth

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.730
any cubs that year.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.120
But if they do, the newborn is 1/900th the
size of its mother; it's seriously tiny and

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.129
blind, and it requires feeding every two hours
when it cries -- similar to a human baby.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.799
Eventually they grow and mature, gaining black
and white hair that scientists still don't

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.089
understand and three years later will strike
out on its own -- THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE WORST

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.909
SYSTEM FOR BEING AN ANIMAL.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:26.909
Look.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.129
I don't want them to go extinct, but it sure
sounds like the panda just doesn't want to

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.370
panda, doesn't it?

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.299
But let’s not put the blame entirely on
them.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.709
Thanks to humans destroying the panda habitat,
there are only about 1,000 left in the wild,

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.969
and maybe 100 in zoos; we're learning a lot
about them!

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.290
But man, the more I learn, the more I just
shake my head.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.989
Do you love pandas?

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:55.259
Not just the red ones, they're the cutest.
