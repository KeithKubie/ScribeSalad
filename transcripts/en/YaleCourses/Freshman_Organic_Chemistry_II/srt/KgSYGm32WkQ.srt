1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,680
Uh, so we were talking
about green chemistry. Uh,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,460
today we'll talk about
one aspect of Mitsui,

3
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:12,310
Nobu reaction and then get on to acids
and acid derivatives. And then, uh,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,840
we'll do that again next, uh,
lecture more about acid derivatives,

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,750
condensations and some
stuff about carbohydrates.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,220
And then the last two lectures,
uh,

7
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,110
now I remember when we were
talking about green chemistry,

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,390
they were some new
processes that were desired.

9
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,420
There were old processes
that that need improvement,

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:35,421
a new process that processes that need
to be developed according to these,

11
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,380
uh, the wishes of the
pharmaceutical industry. Uh,

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,330
remember there were six votes for aromatic
cross coupling I mentioned right at

13
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,021
the end last time.

14
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:50,970
That's how to put to benzene rings or
other aromatic rings together without

15
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:55,770
using Hallo aromatics. We haven't
talked about those reactions, but uh,

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,460
but that's their top desire then how to
use aldehydes or ketones plus ammonia

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,660
and reduction to give a chiral mean.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,790
Now notice how many of these things
have to do with getting a single lead

19
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,660
antitumor because that's so important
in drugs to have a single in antivirus.

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,260
And this notice what they want
here is to do what nature does.

21
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,790
We've talked before about making
glutamic acid by what's called reductive

22
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,940
Amination, where you have
a reducing agent, Nadh,

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,610
you make the amine and
then and then reduce it.

24
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,900
So they would like to be
four of the pharmaceutical
six pharmaceutical companies

25
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:38,550
said that was something they would really
like to be able to do or asymmetric

26
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,000
hydrogenation of Olefins
and ina means or it means,

27
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,750
and notice this is hydrogenation of
an IA mean this very reaction here,

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,210
but what they want is asymmetric.

29
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,120
That his ability to make a
single [inaudible] ante mercy.

30
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:55,500
You don't have to throw half the
stuff away and do a separation. Uh,

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,890
four voted for a greener
Fluor nation method.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,900
A lot of drugs have fluorine in them.

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,220
And the reagents that put those
in are often pretty vigorous ones.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,110
Uh, nitrogen chemistry,
avoiding a zip codes and three,

35
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:13,740
avoiding hydrazine, which
is very poisonous. Uh,

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,890
asymmetric Hydra amination.
Again, asymmetric,

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,080
a greener electrophilic nitration we
talked about a electrophilic aromatic

38
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:26,730
substitution nitration uh, but what
they want is a greener way to do it.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,860
And the final one is asymmetric
addition of HCN. Notice incidentally,

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,450
that four of these,
uh,

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,650
eight half of them have to do
with asymmetric a synthesis,

42
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:42,480
making chiral things. And notice
that s a f, uh, six of them,

43
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:47,340
six of the eight have to do
with nitrogen. Okay. Now,

44
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,600
uh, at the end last time we were
talking about that the other table,

45
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,760
the one of processes that need improving,

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,810
and in particular something that seems
surprising to many chemists is oh,

47
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,200
activation for nuclear
fillic substitution. We've
talked about that so long,

48
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,040
getting, getting a halogen or
a Tassel, eight that can, uh,

49
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,960
that can be substituted. But this is, they
want something that's better than that.

50
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,820
And notice that three voted for a safer
and more environmental Mitsui Nobu

51
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,300
reaction. So let's see what
the Mitsui Nobu reaction is,

52
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,620
and you'll see that it is a type
of height of, of that second case,

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,070
a activation of, Ooh, for
nuclear affiliate substitution.

54
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,350
So there's a picture of a Mitsui,
Nobu, and he, uh, in the 1960s,

55
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,740
he invented this reaction with
a great leaving group, uh,

56
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,310
the o p plus fennel three leaving group.

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,440
And so if you bring in a nucleophile
Bingo, it, it's a very clean,

58
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,610
a substitution reaction that is clean
in the sense that it gives a high yield.

59
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,860
Uh, so, and it's very
general, the nucleophile, uh,

60
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,940
any nucleophile we'll work,
it seems if it has a PKA,

61
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:01,580
if it's more acidic than
15, for example, a carb,

62
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:05,770
oxalate can get an r put audit
or the phosphoric acid or,

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690
or the, uh, emitted,

64
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,810
or in three minus or most significantly
active methylene compounds.

65
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,080
So let's see what that means.
Active methylene compound.

66
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,031
Okay.

67
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:24,010
So here's a specific example taken from
Mitson Ho Booze Paper in the journal

68
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:28,030
synthesis to make s minus
methyl succinic acid.

69
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,140
So it's an asymmetric synthesis to make a,
and it starts with a,

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,220
with a chiral starting material,
s minus ethyl lactate.

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,540
So the idea is to make the Oah
into a leaving group. So let's see.

72
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,760
Let's read through his thing
and see how he does it.

73
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,750
He uses the reagents one and two.
Now,

74
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,670
one is try fennel phosphene.

75
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,720
And two is a compound
whose acronym is d a d.

76
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,740
And we'll see later what it's
die. Ethel, a Zodiac carb oxalate.

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,420
So we'll see how that works. But at any
rate, those two in the next slide, but,

78
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,890
but uh, for now, let's just take that,
that makes that leaving group the, uh,

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,810
puts the foss try phosphorus on
the oxygen and with a plus charge.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,770
So now we got a good leaving group and
we want a nucleophile to displace it.

81
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,780
And the nucleophile they use in this
example is Ethel Cyan. No acetate.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,930
Okay. So, uh, so it's,

83
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,720
it's the ethyl Ester of a Siddique acid,

84
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,050
but the carbon has a cyan on it and that
makes it an active methylene compound.

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,670
Okay. And the reason is
it has a pka of 13. It's,

86
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,040
it's pretty acidic for a ch bond.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,700
Now the reason of course is what you
get is an email late because there's an

88
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,460
Alpha carbon eel.
It's Alpha to a carbon steel,

89
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:50,080
but it's also alpha to the CN
triple bond. So it's doubly, uh,

90
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,840
activated by low lumos next door.

91
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,620
So easily makes that an eye.
So this,

92
00:05:56,621 --> 00:06:00,470
this then is can be a nucleophile
that will displace on the carbon.

93
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,300
So it's gonna come across and,
and invert the carbon. Okay.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,090
And make the new bond.
And that's, that's uh,

95
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,040
the first product they want Diane Ethel
to Cyanna three methyls succinate.

96
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,940
Now notice they say the
yield is pretty good,

97
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,490
61% right.

98
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,570
And notice especially that
the conditions are very mild.

99
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,590
These reactions are started at minus
20 degrees and then just warm to room

100
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:31,580
temperature. It's not something that
needs a lot of heating. On the other hand,

101
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,620
they had to isolate it by preparative
layer chromatography. So that's,

102
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,150
that's not an easy way,
an easy thing to do on a largish scale.

103
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,170
So that's certainly a painful thing
to do to try to get written what this,

104
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,740
this is, it tends to be insoluble
so you can filter it off.

105
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,180
But to get the last bits of it out,
you have to do this layer chromatography.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,830
So that's certainly not so great. Uh, uh,

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
notice that it says ultimately the
optical purity is greater than 99%.

108
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,630
Right now this reaction is indeed very,
very clean in version.

109
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,720
So that's one of the hallmarks
of the Mitsui Nobu reaction.

110
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,450
But in fact it's not proved by this,

111
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,550
that 99% purity because you notice at
the end it was really crystallized.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,460
The product has recrystallized.

113
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,450
So even if there was a little bit
of the wrong Ian antitumor in there,

114
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,470
when you crystallize it,

115
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:31,910
you'd get only the writing antitumor
right in purifying it that way.

116
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,790
So this doesn't prove it,
but it's true that it gives very,

117
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,840
very clean and version. And that's
one of its main advantages. Okay.

118
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,280
But notice incidentally that this,
that this isn't the product they wanted.

119
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,060
This is an intermediate, right?
And notice that there would be,

120
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,220
there's two,
there are two chiral centers,

121
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,560
this one which was 99%
inverted and this one, uh,

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,750
which came from the anti and that,

123
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,450
that did the attacking the
active methylene compound.

124
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,200
And there's no reason that
that should be only one, right?

125
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:07,730
It could have inverted at the stage of
the [inaudible] that is the anti and

126
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:12,200
would've been planar because of the
conjugation with the, with the, uh,

127
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,130
double bonds next door.
So a,

128
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,530
wouldn't that lower the yield?
No,

129
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,580
because of the product they're finally
going to, and you'll see how that is.

130
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,410
They hydrolyze this intermediate
to s meinl methyl succinic acid,

131
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:30,140
which you'll notice is what it is
they're trying to make up at the top.

132
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,860
So they were able to convert
the ester to an acid,

133
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,210
the other Esther to an acid by,
that's a fee,

134
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,250
the reverse of a Fischer esterification
acid and water and the CN triple bond

135
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:48,080
also hydrolyzes to an acid,
although it takes more work,

136
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:52,970
it was heated under reflux for 16 hours,
but that converted that one to an acid.

137
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,680
And now you notice this,

138
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,560
this carbon isn't chiral anymore
because it's got to acid groups.

139
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,750
And even more than that, it turns out
that when you have a situation like that,

140
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,080
it decarboxylates,
it loses the Sio two.

141
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,190
And the h comes on here. So
again, it's not a chiral carbons.

142
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,670
So this is the product and
the ultimate yield was,

143
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,020
was 29% overall. Right? So, uh,

144
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:23,820
that's not a hundred percent reaction,
but it's very, very clean in terms of the,

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,710
of the product being stereo,
chemically pure. Okay.

146
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,660
And this,
the purity,

147
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,661
the stereo chemical purity version is
sometimes used by synthetic chemist when

148
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:39,870
they design a complicated
synthesis and they make an alcohol,

149
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,130
but it turns out not to be the one
they want, right? It's the wrong iin.

150
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,090
Antitumor so then they use a version
of this reaction called the Mitsui,

151
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,340
Nobu inversion.
So for example,

152
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,000
suppose they've made this
s configured alcohol,

153
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,070
but what they really wanted was the are,

154
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
so what you need to do is make that Ooh
into Alevi group and bring an oxygen in

155
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,020
from the backside to make the other one.

156
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,410
So they can do this to correct the
synthetic mistake by using these,

157
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:14,930
uh, these reagents, a
trifle, fos feed and dad,

158
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,010
and a Siddique acid. So the acetic acid
is something that's more acidic than,

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,210
than a PKA, uh, uh, 13, 15.

160
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:28,500
It's got PKA five. So it'll do the
trick. So you mix these things together,

161
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,200
do the reaction,
and it makes the acetate in the back.

162
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,750
And now that's the ester
the alcohol you want.

163
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,010
So all you have to do is treat it with
acid and get the inverted alcohol.

164
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,190
Now how does this activation work?

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,540
How do you do this in order to get
the great leaving group? Uh, well,

166
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,500
you react, try fennel,
phosphene with HR to do that,

167
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,730
but they won't interact directly.
That's notice minus three.

168
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,460
And in the product it's minus one.

169
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:59,910
So you're going to need an oxidizing
agent in order to do their,

170
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:04,800
and that oxidizing agent is this
compound number one up here,

171
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,250
Die Ethel.
So it's an ethyl ester on both ends.

172
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,020
Notice it's symmetrical Aso,
Die Carb, oxalate, d, e a.

173
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:17,400
D. Now this is sort of a
complicated, uh, scheme,

174
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,230
uh, and it's, it's balanced
just right. So the right,

175
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,350
the correct nucleophile
will attack at each step.

176
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,030
There are three nuclear files
that are involved. There's the,

177
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,780
the phosphorus unshared
pair. There's the, uh,

178
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:38,781
unshared pair on an oxygen to the alcohol
and there's x minus that was formed

179
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,520
from the,
from the acid that you put in,

180
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,280
which is ultimately the thing
that's going to do the displacing.

181
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:46,140
That's the nucleophile that comes in.

182
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,640
So you don't want the wrong nucleophile
to be operating at any given time.

183
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,970
Okay. So first the unshared
pair on phosphorus attacks,

184
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,470
the double bond on nitrogen, which we'll
put a charge on this nitrogen here,

185
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,300
that when these electrons go on there,

186
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,390
what's good about having
the charge on that nitrogen?

187
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,500
Why would that be better than an ad
into any old, uh, and double bond?

188
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,334
And

189
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,080
it's got the,

190
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,640
the residents with the carbon eel.
So it's gonna,

191
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,540
it's gonna make this a little lake
system here. Okay? So that, that,

192
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,020
uh,

193
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,020
that comes in and now this HX is one of
these things that has a pka less than

194
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,700
15. So it's able then to, uh,

195
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,210
to protonate this, this, this, uh,

196
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,400
remember this is a fairly stable and iron,
but it's not as stable as x minus.

197
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:48,160
It doesn't have that lower PKA.

198
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,210
So this one's able to
protonate here. Now, uh,

199
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,420
notice if x attacked people.
If x attack x is a pretty good,

200
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,850
is the anti and have a pretty good acid.

201
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,400
You could imagine it attacking
the phosphorus to make a
fifth bond to phosphorus,

202
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,420
right? Phosphorus has vacant
d orbitals but if it did,

203
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,600
it would come off again because
it's a much better and I,

204
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,660
and then the anti and for the Forbes,

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,000
if you broke the
phosphorous nitrogen bond,

206
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,370
so this is the example of it being
tuned just right. So it could, uh, if,

207
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,260
if the x k Bonne it would just come off
again. But if the double bond, if the,

208
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:33,670
if the unshared pair of oxygen goes on,
then you'd get,

209
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,090
uh, the bond formed like this. Right?

210
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,910
And now that would come off
again, this, this is, uh,

211
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,910
the protonated oxygen is
a stronger acid than the,

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,110
than this would be,
but if it loses the proton,

213
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,540
right.
Okay,

214
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,460
then this one is now a better leaving
group, especially if it gets protonated.

215
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,010
Right? So now we can, now we've
made this thing here. Okay.

216
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:07,720
The, the, the made the oxygen
into a leaving group and now,

217
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,260
and notice that the same time this,
the nitrogen nitrogen,

218
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:15,280
which originally was a double
bond now has two hydrogens on it.

219
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,330
So it got reduced, right?
And that, and that is,

220
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:23,830
it was the oxidizing agent that
allowed this to happen. Okay.

221
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,210
And now x minus is able to do the nuclear
Phillips substitution and that's how

222
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:32,080
the Mitson Obu react,
activation happens.

223
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,670
And notice that this,
this last one here then is irreversible.

224
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:39,790
Once you put the x on,
this is not a good nucleophile,

225
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,080
it's not going to come back on.

226
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:45,580
So this is a high yield
process when you do that one.

227
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,083
Okay.

228
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,410
But the problem is that a complete
required chromatography that was bad about

229
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,750
it, then at least this aspect
of it has been improved.

230
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,200
And it's an interesting way in which
it's been proved. Instead of using,

231
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,820
try fennel phosphene the benzene
rings of the trifle Phosphene,

232
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,380
some of them are attached to
a polymer, right? Like that.

233
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,390
So that means if you have a polymer
bead that holds this reagent, yeah.

234
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,961
At the end,

235
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:19,340
you don't have to do the chromatography
in order to separate your product from

236
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:21,170
the trifle phosphine oxide,

237
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,920
you just have to filter it because
it's attached to a solid polymer.

238
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,480
Okay.
But what,

239
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,830
what disturbs the green chemists about
this otherwise handy reaction is that

240
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,620
your goal is to eliminate
water between Hx and Roa H.

241
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,660
Right? But, uh, but in order to do that,

242
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,930
you generate byproducts that
have a molecular way to 450.

243
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:52,820
So this is what's called Adam inefficient.

244
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,670
You generate lots of waste for all,

245
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,250
for the way to the molecule you generate.

246
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,130
Now we're going to be talking
about oxidation of aldehydes
and alcohol's we have

247
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:08,900
talked about some of them already, but
it's nice to do those in a green way too.

248
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,950
And in fact, we already talked about
some, uh, such a reaction last semester.

249
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:17,390
It was one of the first
oxidations of, of, uh, of, uh,

250
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,380
of an Aldehyde that was studied,
which was the oil of bitter almonds.

251
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,330
You remember what was
special about this sample

252
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,200
when you turned it over?

253
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,830
It turned out that this Aldehyde
was in fact mostly solid.

254
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,130
It had converted spontaneously to, to, uh,

255
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,970
to benzoic acid without adding any of,
uh,

256
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,820
chromium manganese or anything like that.

257
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,110
You got benzoic acid just
by reacting it with oxygen.

258
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,960
So there could hardly be a
cleaner, greener, uh, uh,

259
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,313
process.

260
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,830
So the air oxidation of Benzaldehyde
is a process that I think we mentioned

261
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:01,670
before, but I'll talk about it again.
So it's a free radical chain reaction.

262
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,740
So you have some radical, which pulls
the hydrogen away from the Aldehyde,

263
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,430
which generates this ACL radical,
but the ACO,

264
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,680
radical canal attack,

265
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:17,360
oxygen to form a new bond
and a single bond to oxygen,

266
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,250
which itself is now a radical,

267
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,520
which is the X.
Okay?

268
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,700
So x comes back and takes a hydrogen from
the other and the product then is not

269
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,390
benzoic acid,
but per Roxy benzoic acid.

270
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,180
So that's what you would expect to
get at first. All right. But, uh,

271
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:42,090
in fact, it might be fun for
you just to, to, uh, review, uh,

272
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,930
free radical chain reactions by re,

273
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
by writing this thing in one of those
cyclic diagrams as to what comes in,

274
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:53,730
where the radicals are, what comes out.
That would be a good exercise, right?

275
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,920
So this is the initial product,
but this itself is an oxidizing agent.

276
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,420
It's got this week oxygen,
oxygen bond, a low Lumo,

277
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,940
which is, uh, uh,

278
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,420
which is a little bit like
using a halogen halogen bond.

279
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,090
So it also is like an alcohol,

280
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,710
so it can form a Hemi Ke Tau
by attacking the carbon eel.

281
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,040
So here's the group that attacked,
here's the new bond and we have, Ooh,

282
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,660
so it's like a heavy key towel, except
it's per Roxy. And now notice it,

283
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:28,890
it's converted, uh, the, uh,

284
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,150
what would have been an Oah into
an o with alleving group. Okay.

285
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:38,040
If this had just been a regular old, uh,
hydrate of the Aldehyde, there'd be Ooh,

286
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,020
here. But now we have, oh,
with the leaving group,

287
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,180
so base can pull off the Proton
electrons come in to make a double bond.

288
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,430
These leave,
and now you have benzoic acid and eight,

289
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,910
which is a base that can do
that reaction next time. Right?

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,640
So what could be a more
efficient reaction?

291
00:18:56,641 --> 00:19:01,641
All you do is expose Benzaldehyde to
oxygen and it becomes benzoic acid.

292
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,690
So there is a very green
oxidation reaction. Okay.

293
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,470
You can see section 1812
which talks about this. Okay.

294
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,190
But the last year when I was
talking about this subject,

295
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:19,170
we had a seminar from a professor at
the Vitamin Institute, David Milstein,

296
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,520
who talked about devising
catalysts for greener operations.

297
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,560
And I thought this one was
a very interesting one.

298
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:31,010
So this is a Ruthie medium catalyst and
it has on carbon monoxide and hydrogen

299
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,860
and then this funny league
and that it's a peer,

300
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,420
a dean of Benzine with the
nitrogen in it with two groups,

301
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:43,170
Cah do here ch two and it has a nitrogen,

302
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:48,171
Diane ethyl amine on this end and dye
tee butyl phosphene on the other end.

303
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,810
So it has three things with
unshared, pairs, phosphorous,

304
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,870
nitrogen and nitrogen that can mix with
the orbitals of the ruthenium to make

305
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,570
this complex.
Now I've met,

306
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,220
I've colored two of the hydrogens here,

307
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,670
green because there they can come off,

308
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,760
you can lose age to having lost those
two hydrogens notice or you can add h two

309
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:16,530
and come back again.
Now how does that happen?

310
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,080
Well notice that this,

311
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,140
this stuff here with the nitrogen plus
charge with an extra bond here going to

312
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:29,301
this kind of a ring is a little bit
reminiscent of what we saw before with Nad

313
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,530
plus Nadh that this is a nuclear fillic
aromatic substitution, the start of it.

314
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,820
So the h minus ads here,
these go onto the nitrogen.

315
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,570
So you have a ring like
that one and h attached,

316
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,930
but the h minus can come off again and
be given to something else. So there are,

317
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,480
this is closely balanced,
right?

318
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,030
This one has the advantage
of being aromatic.

319
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,770
This one has the advantage of having a
new bond and not being charged, right?

320
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,740
So being closely balanced,
it can go back and forth.

321
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:07,420
So the same way that Nadh in nature
can function as both an oxidizing and a

322
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:09,580
reducing agent going one way and another,

323
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,750
you could imagine that a thing like
this could go back and forth. So, uh,

324
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,160
lose the h plus and go back as far as,

325
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,360
as far as the stability of this part
of it goes. But there's a problem.

326
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,220
The h could be thought of as h minus
because it's bonded to a metal,

327
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,481
right?

328
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:29,710
So the electrons are mostly on the more
electronegativity negative hydrogen,

329
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,590
but it can't reach to that position.

330
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,440
So you can't do that kind of thing.

331
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,210
But what it can reach
is the hydrogen here.

332
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,900
If we change the confirmation of
the thing a little bit, right?

333
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,640
So you can imagine that these elect
the hydride attacks this hydrogen,

334
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,170
which loses these electrons
to make that bond.

335
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,880
And that's helped by the fact that these
electrons that get stabilized by moving

336
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:01,800
onto the positive nitrogen,
right? So this is what a lot,

337
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,550
this type of of effect is what allows us
to go back and forth either direction,

338
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,610
but we're most interested
in the direction going up.

339
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,120
So let's redraw that thing and,

340
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,970
and look at what happens
if there's an alcohol.

341
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:20,971
So an alcohol comes in and it's unshared
payer makes a bond to the ruthenium,

342
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,360
right? And now it's all plus. Okay? Now,

343
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,003
uh,

344
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,900
we could have the hydride
notice it's h uh, uh,

345
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,870
wait a second. If I don't
right through here, oh no. Uh,

346
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,480
what we're doing is using the
unshared pair of nitrogen.

347
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:41,200
This is not like hydride I said
the wrong thing. This is a proton.

348
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,480
The electrons are going
away from this hydrogen.

349
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,990
So the Proton is able to go on here,
right?

350
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,510
Degenerate the end plus again.

351
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
Okay.

352
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,440
And now notice that the
same time that that, uh,

353
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,330
alcohol that came on had an h had
two H's that I drew explicitly.

354
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:04,710
The one down here is the one
I'm interested in because
it's near the Ruthie Diem,

355
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,920
right?
And now we can,

356
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,100
if this were oh minus and notice in a
sense it is oh minus because it's bonded

357
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,630
to a metal,
right?

358
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,670
Then the electrons of the old minus these
electrons can make a double bond here

359
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,130
giving hydride a hydride
can attack the ruthenium

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,273
like that.

361
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,750
So notice what the product of this
is that we're at the top. We get,

362
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,480
we got a carbonyl group,
right?

363
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,680
And the thing we have at
the bottom is this, right?

364
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,880
Which can start the whole process
over again by giving off h two.

365
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,220
So what is this whole
catalytic cycle accomplished?

366
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,380
It you've brought in an alcohol
and you removed from it.

367
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,020
These two hydrogens as h two.

368
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,973
Okay?

369
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,620
So it's a way of,
so it's an oxidation of the alcohol,

370
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,730
not by bringing in
oxygen and making water,

371
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,420
but by giving off h two.
Okay?

372
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,470
So now you can do another, in this
particular reaction, there's another, uh,

373
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,810
oxidation. It re removing h
two from a different alcohol.

374
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,640
Notice the product is an Aldehyde,
but in water it will form a dial.

375
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,930
So it can be the alcohol that comes in
and you remove another h two from it,

376
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,050
which gives them, uh, uh, uh, uh,

377
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:39,110
a carboxylic acid plus oxidizing another,
uh,

378
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,460
alcohol, uh, and have CEO coupling.

379
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,180
And you get a,
if I had done this right,

380
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,650
I think I counted wrong here.
I think I wrote this wrong. Uh,

381
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,480
I don't think you oxidize that alcohol,

382
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:59,520
but at any rate at couples
to give the Esther,

383
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,720
I think that should be two a h
two is there, I'll correct that.

384
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,693
Okay.

385
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,740
But this happens in the presence of this
catalyst with no other op activation.

386
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,990
So what comes in as the alcohol,

387
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,760
what comes out as two moles of
hydrogen and the Ester, right?

388
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:20,730
A very clean process.
Okay,

389
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,120
so here's a table taken from Milstein
stable from Milstein is paper and you can

390
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:28,890
see with several different, uh, alcohols,

391
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,160
he was able to get high conversions
higher than 90 up to 99%.

392
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,920
Very high yields of the Ester and
only a little bit of the Aldehyde.

393
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:40,790
Most of it got oxidized.
Uh,

394
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,250
let's look at the thermo
chemistry of this. And again,

395
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,990
I think that should be two h twos.

396
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,710
So if you look at the heat of formation
of ethanol and the heat of formation of

397
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:53,880
the Ester,
that's the product from that.

398
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,710
And hydrogen has a free energy of zero.

399
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:02,580
So the two hydrogens don't count.
But if we add it together,

400
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,850
this reaction is endothermic
by 17 kilocalories per mole.

401
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,720
So it's way up hill.

402
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:12,990
You'd think the equilibrium
constant would be very unfavorable.

403
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,910
What makes it possible for this to happen?
Catalytically right?

404
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,930
We're not putting in something that's a
strong reagent that makes one of these

405
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:25,020
very reactive and then it can
react with the other things.

406
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,910
We're just putting the alcohol in and
to have the alcohol come in and Esther

407
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:32,670
come out and everything stayed the same.
Otherwise,

408
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,180
with the catalyst right there,

409
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,760
you have to go uphill and energy
by 17 kilocalories per mole,

410
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:43,620
which sounds very tough, but there
are two things that make this uh,

411
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,290
that make this good,
right? You form three, uh,

412
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,640
but you form,
uh,

413
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:55,670
you start with two molecules and you
form three molecules to h two and the

414
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,420
Ester, again, I counted wrong here. Uh,

415
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,830
so by making more molecules,
you make more entropy available.

416
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,270
And furthermore,

417
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:11,271
this is especially helped because you
make those two hydrogen gas molecules and

418
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:16,230
you can remove those from the solution.
So notice how this was done.

419
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,830
It was done in one case under a flow of
our gone to sweep the hydrogen gas out.

420
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,120
And in the other case, the, the Taleo
in solution was refluxed, which again,

421
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:31,870
take the solvent, pushes the
other gas out. So, uh, so at,

422
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,360
at, at low pressure of hydrogen, it's
possible to do this spontaneously.

423
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,140
So these are, that's an, uh,

424
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,410
an important type of analysis to do on
a catalytic cycle as to whether that

425
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,400
you've proposed as to whether in fact
it could be thermodynamically allowed.

426
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,120
They also were able to
make a means that way.

427
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,680
Starting with alcohol's make
an a mean by reacting with,

428
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,120
with ammonia.
So alcohol plus ammonia,

429
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,760
it gives it a mean and also
incidentally and m mean.

430
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,350
So probably it's the same kind of thing
before the alcohol gets oxidized to an

431
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:11,700
Aldehyde, but in the presence of
the nitrogen, it forms the amine,

432
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,020
the CN double bond. And
then that can get, uh,

433
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,710
that gets reduced to give the by the
hydrogen that's there in order to give,

434
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,310
give the, uh, uh, mean, but again,
these are very high yield, uh,

435
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,163
reactions

436
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,760
and notice that it says that they're
there too. When you look at, uh,

437
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,840
a synthetic paper and a table in it,

438
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,590
it's important to look at two
different kinds of yields. The yields,

439
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,330
the normal yields given here are analyzed
by gas chromatography to figure out

440
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,380
how much was in there.

441
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,780
But what you're really interested in is
what you can put in a bottle as a pure

442
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:52,350
form, right? So the yields in parentheses
are isolated products. So sometimes,

443
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,180
sometimes they're very good
compared to the, uh, to the uh, uh,

444
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,210
gas chromatography yield.
But in this particular case,

445
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:03,650
it's hard to separate and you
only get half as much out, uh,

446
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,680
to sell to your neighbor
as you had analyzed by GC.

447
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,810
So you can also make it means and
amids and so on with these catalysts.

448
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:17,811
So that's an interesting development
which seems to address if not to solve

449
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:22,500
perhaps some of these problems that
the pharmaceutical industry identified.

450
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,500
Now we've been talking in these last
examples of reading chemistry about acids

451
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,940
and acid derivative. So let's talk
about them a little more systematically.

452
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,340
First, the acidity of our co
two h have a carboxylic acid.

453
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,040
You remember that the Ph of a normal,

454
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,230
a carboxylic acid is
between four and five.

455
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,780
Like butyric acid is 4.8.

456
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,140
Now let's look at the effect
of putting a chlorine in there.

457
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,410
So if you put the chlorine
it on the terminal carbon,

458
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,250
it hardly changes the PK
at all just by 0.3 units.

459
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,460
If you move it a little bit
closer to the carboxylic acid,

460
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:05,170
it's 4.1 and a few moves. Move it as
close as possible to the carboxylic acid.

461
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,490
Now it makes a real difference.
2.8 what is it that the,

462
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,290
what is it that the chlorine is doing?

463
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,790
Hell, I like them. So it's electron
withdrawing and how does that help?

464
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,723
It makes the age

465
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,040
and how does it make the age come off?

466
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,960
Why does it reduce the line?

467
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,843
That's great.

468
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
You know,
actually I bet that's not true.

469
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,410
I bet it doesn't reduce the bond strength.

470
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,430
The bond strength is the kind of thing
that professor Alison talked about last

471
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:45,690
time. Breaking a bond to give
two free people laugh already.

472
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:48,900
Just mentioned his name and they like,
okay,

473
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,190
you break the bottom and you get two
free radicals. I don't know the results,

474
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,880
but my strong suspicion is that
chlorine hardly affects that at all.

475
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,220
What are the effects is dissociation
as an acid. So what is it?

476
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:03,660
The chlorine is stabilizing.

477
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,570
It affects the

478
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,850
an ion,
right?

479
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,220
So the electron withdrawal by the
chlorine makes the rest of the wall,

480
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,150
the nearby region of the molecule,

481
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:23,151
a better place to put more electrons as
in the anti on rather than the neutral

482
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,360
molecule. So this inductive
effect of the chlorine works,

483
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:31,140
but only in the vicinity of the chlorine
at dies away as you get further and

484
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,390
further from the chlorine.
So this,

485
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,160
this is so called inductive effect and
it's not very big if you're far away,

486
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,730
but if you get pretty
close, it can be big. Okay.

487
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,900
Now let's just see this inductive effect.
If it's,

488
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,790
if it could be quantitatively
reasonable, right? If, if the,

489
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:55,680
if the withdrawal by the chlorine
stabilizes a negative charge by a certain

490
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:59,310
amount of energy,
then the process becomes,

491
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:03,270
the equilibrium becomes easier
by that about of energy, right?

492
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,160
And the, uh, and the,
that energy difference,

493
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,170
right, would appear in the exponent of it
for the equilibrium constant. Remember,

494
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:17,940
10 to the two thirds Delta Age.
So it would make an effect in the x,

495
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,710
a certain energy effected the exponent.
And if you put two of them in,

496
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,910
you'd do make twice that change.
And the exponent, if it were simple.

497
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,380
Okay.

498
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,760
And that means the results would be
multiplicative because when you add things

499
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:36,900
in an exponent, that means you
multiply the numbers. Okay?

500
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,401
Okay.

501
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:43,401
So let's look a Siddique acid chloro a
CD acid dye chloro and try chloro a CD

502
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Casad and see whether this inductive
effect of the chlorine is additive in

503
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,990
energy,
therefore multiplicative in,

504
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,250
in equilibrium, constant. Or if you do
the log of the equilibrium constant,

505
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,540
then it would be additive because
it's up in the exponent. Okay?

506
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,260
So notice here is 4.8 the same as here.

507
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,150
Here it's 2.9 same as here.
So it's the same kind of effect.

508
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,920
Okay? But when we put the second,
but let's look at the values here.

509
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,770
Not at the values themselves,
but at the difference.

510
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,320
How much difference did
that first chlorine made?

511
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,770
It made a difference of 1.9 PKA units.

512
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,050
Now if the second one made this, had the
same effect on the energy of an an ion,

513
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,940
that would also be 1.9.
It's actually 1.6 not quite as big.

514
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,050
And, and the third one is hard,
hardly makes any difference at all.

515
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:46,340
It's only old 0.6. I mean, it's
substantial, but it's, but, but it's, uh,

516
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,960
but it's not anything like the first ones.
And the reason is that once,

517
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,390
once the anti and is already stabilized,

518
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,620
it gets harder and harder to
withdraw a subsequent electrons.

519
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,670
One chlorine withdraws a certain
much certain amount, the next Galore,

520
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:05,180
he doesn't have as much to withdraw.
So it can't do quite as good a job.

521
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,930
The third one does very much poorer job,
right?

522
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,060
But fluorine is better than chlorine and
try flouro is CD acid is quite a strong

523
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:17,150
acid.
It's got a negative PKA.

524
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,650
So that's the inductive effect.
And now might, we might wonder,

525
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,980
what is it that makes the carboxylic
acid acidic altogether ignoring these

526
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,250
additional inductive effects? So, uh,

527
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,040
Paul Ravelin from,
uh,

528
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,310
from Swarthmore college published
the paper in the Journal,

529
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:41,750
the American Chemical Society in 2000
that had an interesting analysis of this.

530
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:45,950
And I put it on because, uh, uh, because,

531
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,790
uh,

532
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,440
professor Ellison is such a big advocate
of resonance structures as you saw last

533
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,020
time rather than molecular orbital theory.

534
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,070
So this is an interesting analysis
in terms of resonance structures.

535
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,810
Now what he did is do
very good calculations,

536
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,530
but calculations in the gas phase,
right?

537
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:11,180
Not in a solvent of what the equilibrium
constant should be for what the energy

538
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:16,181
involved should be in transferring a
proton from an alcohol to a carboxylic

539
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,770
acid,
right?

540
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,520
So you get the anti into the alcohol
and the protonated carboxylic acid,

541
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,680
and now the carboxylic acids are caused
called acids because they give their

542
00:35:27,681 --> 00:35:29,030
protons to basis.

543
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:34,210
So this reaction lies to the left and to
go to the right is uphill by almost 28

544
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:37,920
kilocalories per mole in the gas phase.
Okay?

545
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,030
Uh,
now the difference in Pka,

546
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,340
the PK of an alcohol is about 16.

547
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:47,820
The PK of a carboxylic acid is about five.

548
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,950
So the difference in PKA is
about 11. Right? Therefore,

549
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:56,820
you would expect the equilibrium constant
at room temperature to be about four

550
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,560
thirds of that. So it should be
about 15 kilocalories per mole,

551
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,480
right? But notice that pks
are defined in water, right?

552
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,670
So it must be that the solvent
makes an enormous effect, right? Uh,

553
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,730
it reduces this to about half of its
value from near close to 30 to 15.

554
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
By making it easy,

555
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:24,120
it makes it easier to go to the right
only 15 kilocalories uphill instead of 30

556
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:26,190
kilocalories uphill.
Why?

557
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,870
It could be because this one has a
much more concentrated negative charge.

558
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,280
So it gets more effectively solve,
aided by the water compared to this one,

559
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:40,180
which helps drive the reaction to the
left. But anyhow, that's a secondary, uh,

560
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,820
consideration,
uh,

561
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:46,080
because we're just looking as rambling
did at the molecules in the gas phase.

562
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,870
Okay. So it's a 28 kilocalories
uphill to do that. Now,

563
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:55,520
what's the reason? Why does it
want to go that way? Well, we're,

564
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,770
we're tempted to say
resonance. You have, uh,

565
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,200
that's certainly what Ellison
would have said, right?

566
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,540
You have two resonance structures of this,

567
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:08,340
an ion and only one resonance structure
of that's reasonable for the on the

568
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,870
right.
Okay.

569
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,440
Can you think of any other
reason that it might be good to,

570
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,810
to go to the left? Anything? Uh,

571
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,940
anything else that makes that a better
and I in compared to this anti on other

572
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:23,964
than residents.

573
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,493
Okay.

574
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,670
Had the ideas this,

575
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:32,480
these are H's incidentally
c h three y here's h,

576
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,340
c o o minus.
If residents weren't a factor,

577
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,320
would you expect these to be the same?

578
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,380
Would you expect to
equilibrium constant to be one

579
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,133
maybe.

580
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,670
Yeah.
The Pi Star helping,

581
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,460
yeah. Is the molecular orbital way
of saying there's residents, right?

582
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,430
That's what, that's how they do it. So
that, that in fact is the same thing.

583
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,120
But is there anything else that
would tend to make it go that way?

584
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,780
Pardon me? And what, how
would the oxygen health,

585
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,690
so it could be an inductive
effect that notice this oxygen

586
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,970
closer than the chlorine that was making
the difference before the chlorine was

587
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,310
out on the next carbon.
Okay.

588
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,880
So you could also have an
inductive effect due to the oxygen.

589
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,300
Now notice that it's a double bond.

590
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,170
So it's an interesting question whether
you count the oxygen once or counted

591
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,570
twice.
Okay?

592
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,710
So for purposes of this paper,
uh,

593
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,720
Ramblin hypothesize that you
count the oxygen twice. Okay?

594
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:52,230
So now we have residents and inductive
effects and we can do some numerology

595
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,970
about these, about how important
resonance structures are. Okay?

596
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:02,971
So notice that this 27.9 kilocalories is
due to loss of resonance and to loss of

597
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,480
two inductive effects for oxygen.

598
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,670
If you're supposed to count
it twice with a double bond.

599
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,560
Now let's look at this one, where we've
put where we, instead of using alcohol,

600
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:19,400
we use a ketone and a protonated
acid here. So instead of the ad,

601
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,420
and it's protonated now and
now we transfer the proton
from here to the Ketone

602
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,300
Aldehyde. Actually these
are hydrogens, okay?

603
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,600
So we make the protonated
ketone and the carboxylic acid.

604
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,190
Now here,
the reaction lies to the right,

605
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,550
okay? It's exothermic by 6.2
kilocalories from all the gas phase.

606
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,640
Now which side would resonance favor?

607
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,533
Yeah.

608
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,720
Debbie, can you help us out? Can you draw,

609
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,510
would you draw a resonance
structures of this? You could,

610
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,490
you could use the unshared pair on the
Oah and it would be stabilized by the Pi

611
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,680
Star, but that would require
separation of charge.

612
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,520
And Ellison told us we
don't want to do that. Okay.

613
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,370
How about on the left and he
resonance structures there?

614
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,453
Yes.

615
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,510
Speak up positive now.

616
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,240
Now you could draw a double bond deer in
a single bond there and put the charge

617
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:29,240
on the bottom and you're not separating
charge. You just moving the charge.

618
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,680
So here or you have good residents here.
You don't have on the right,

619
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,740
you don't have reasonable resonance.
Okay?

620
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,990
On this one you had residents on the
left and not on the right. So now,

621
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:46,580
uh, now the or don't park. In both
cases we had residents on the left.

622
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,770
Okay?
So resonance is going to be,

623
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,930
is going to favor the left and cause
you to go uphill in either case.

624
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,940
Okay.
Now how about the inductive effect?

625
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,880
How about the oxygen? We'll
try somebody else here. Chris,

626
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,560
which side is favored by the
inductive effects? In the top,

627
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,440
the inductive effects favorite,
the left,

628
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,710
because we had two bonds to
oxygen withdrawing electrons
stabilized in the anti

629
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,640
right? Now how about in this
case when we have two bonds here?

630
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,353
Okay,

631
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,250
that's good.
If it stabilizes,

632
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:33,251
the anti in the argument is
it destabilizes the cat I
and so it's the same deal

633
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,730
except now the,
the uh,

634
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,530
we same residents that would cause
it to go uphill to the right,

635
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:48,170
but the oxygen now makes it
go down to the left. Okay?

636
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,300
Now how many,
uh,

637
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,190
how many oxygens did we air this time
is just the difference between this.

638
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,340
And this is just this bond,
right?

639
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,020
So it's not a question of counting one
or two and there's only one bond there.

640
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,110
So that's one inductive effect of oxygen.

641
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,040
Now we have two equations in two unknowns.

642
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,100
The effect we have the residents effect,

643
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,170
which is the same direction in both
cases and the, and the inductive effect,

644
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:22,310
which is in opposite directions and
twice as strong in one case, right?

645
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,320
So if we take, if we take the
difference of these two minus this one,

646
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,190
right?

647
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:32,960
We get plus 34.1 is three of
the oxygen inductive effects.

648
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,480
So the opposite inductive effect
is 11.4 kilocalories per mole.

649
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,980
And once we have that,
we can plug back in to see how big the uh,

650
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,930
the resonance effect is. It's 4.8. Okay.

651
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,740
And now if we use this
from this point of view,

652
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,190
if we look that in the top case of that
30 kilocalories per mole going uphill,

653
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,520
only five of it was due to resonance by
far and away the dominant effect is the

654
00:43:05,241 --> 00:43:09,260
inductive effect, right? Only
20% of the special acidity,

655
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:13,700
the carboxylic acid is due to
residents from this viewpoint,

656
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,680
okay? Now you may buy this
resonance argument and you may not,

657
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,940
I'm personally skeptical,
but, but one way or the other,

658
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:26,390
it would be good to check it.
So Ravelin checked it.

659
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,130
So he did this one with carbonic acid,

660
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,110
the anti enough of carbonic acid,

661
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,780
and now that's plus 37.3.
Now what does it involve?

662
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Here's the anti in which is stabilized
by resonance as this one was,

663
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,130
right?

664
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,610
And there's no resonance involving this
one because it has the hydrogen on it.

665
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,640
Okay. And how about, so it has
resonance the same as the others.

666
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:57,500
How about inductive effect?

667
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,130
How many ops compared to this?

668
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,400
How many oxygens are stabilizing this?
O minus that?

669
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,430
Count three. If you count double bond
twice, which is the rules he set,

670
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,390
then you have three. Okay, so that's Oh,

671
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,230
inductive times three.
Now let's put that together.

672
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,660
So we have oh inductive times three,

673
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:28,661
that's a 34.2 and the
resonance is 4.8 is 39

674
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,530
not bad. Okay, so we can
try another one. Okay.

675
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:41,700
So here we do the, the, the analog
of what we did here, put a proton on.

676
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,040
And now, uh, we have, uh,
no resonance on the right.

677
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,530
We have residents on the left.
How many resonance structures

678
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,310
in addition to the original structure,

679
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,173
Chris,

680
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,640
you can draw the double bond here.
That's what we did in that case,

681
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,750
which could also draw the
double bond over here, right?

682
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,970
So there should be residents
times two, right? And that should,

683
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,780
that should favor the left,
make it uphill. Right?

684
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,320
But also you're going to have oxygen's
destabilizing this cat I and two oxygens

685
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,920
d stabilizing that cat island.
Right? And if you put those together,

686
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:34,530
it's minus 13.2 and observed as 11.

687
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,390
So they thought that is so
there are people who think this,

688
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,210
right?
Uh,

689
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,560
I personally don't like this kind of
argument so much because I don't think it

690
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:48,460
comes down to really the
physics of the thing.

691
00:45:48,461 --> 00:45:52,740
It comes to count whether you count a
double bond to bonds and things like that,

692
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,110
which uh,
it works out.

693
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,520
So there are people who talk about
this thing and from that point of view,

694
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:04,521
resonance isn't as important to making
acids acidic as inductive effect is.

695
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,040
So the inductive effect
is certainly important.

696
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,350
Now making acids by oxidation
and reduction. No, we've
talked about these things.

697
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,070
A oxidizing and alcohol
with chromium oxidizing.

698
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,800
And remember on the way
you get an Aldehyde,

699
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:22,950
so you can also oxidize aldehydes
and you could do it with chromium.

700
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:25,530
I put potassium purveying bag aid in here.

701
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,610
We also talked about oxidized in double
bonds with ozone and then hydrogen

702
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:32,400
peroxide to get a carboxylic acids.

703
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,930
There's one different type of oxidation
that we haven't talked about yet,

704
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:41,370
which is mentioned in the, in the
Jones textbook here, uh, which is,

705
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,750
uh,

706
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,750
Al Keel groups attached to a benzene
ring can be oxidized by permanganate at a

707
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:51,480
hundred degrees to make
carboxylic acids as well.

708
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,910
Now you can also make a
carboxylic acids by reduction.

709
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,210
You start with,
of course this,

710
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,890
the carbon and a carboxylic acid
is pretty much oxidized, right?

711
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,600
But there are more
oxidized things like CO2.

712
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,750
So if you had CO2,

713
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:17,700
what would you react that with in order
to form a carbon carbon bond to make the

714
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,960
carboxylic acid?

715
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:27,660
What kind of reagents?
What would attack the carbon of CO2?

716
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,490
Hi.
Hi Homo or low Lenovo.

717
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,453
Yeah.

718
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,700
What would make CO2 double bond?
Double Bond. What would make it react?

719
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,710
Suppose it were just a single double bond.
What makes it react?

720
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,000
The Pi Star, right? Alo Lumo
so you want a high Hobo,

721
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,870
just like the things we talked about
with alcohols, right where you can,

722
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:59,170
you can have a ketone reacted with r
minus reacted with h minus to go on.

723
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:00,770
And then in this case,

724
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:05,240
that would be a reduction of the carb
central carbon and would form a carboxylic

725
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:09,060
acid. So you could do that
kind of thing too. Oh,

726
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:14,530
you can also react a carboxylic acids
with al kill lithium or hydride cotton

727
00:48:15,781 --> 00:48:17,390
pounds.
So for example,

728
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:22,010
you can react a generic carboxylic
acid here with Al Kewill lithium.

729
00:48:22,011 --> 00:48:23,450
What do you think the product is?

730
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,623
Yeah.

731
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,190
What would the AR, ar, ar Alfio
lithium is like our minus, right?

732
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,970
It's a high homo on the
are the are lithium bond.

733
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:37,160
So what will it attack

734
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,423
Mary,

735
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,310
in addition to what? Carbon to the carbon
deal. Right? That's what, that's what I,

736
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:50,870
that's what I was trying
to trick you into.

737
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:54,860
Say in fact it reacts in another way.

738
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,710
Can you think of any other,
what else can it,

739
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,020
what else does a high homo do
besides make something a nucleophile?

740
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,310
It makes it a base.

741
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,000
Here we have an asset. So in fact, the
easy thing to react with is the proton.

742
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:15,040
That's easier to access than the
carbon eel. Whoops, I'm sorry.

743
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:18,580
I've talked too long. Uh,
thanks for your patience.
