00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.620
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.020
Thanks very much indeed for coming.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.970
I'm delighted to welcome our guest today,
Maajid Nawaz, who has just published this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.350
book, Radical.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.670
Maajid's story is a fascinating one in that
he got involved, as a young man, in radical

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.470
Islam and then ended up in prison in Egypt
for his views, then, subsequently, had a conversion

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.530
and rejected political Islam, although he
remains a Muslim, and now campaigns around

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.640
the world in favor of democracy and nonviolent
methods.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.629
I'm particularly interested in sharing this
discussion because I've actually met Maajid

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.230
in both his incarnations.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
When I was at Newsnight a few years ago, we
did an item about Hizb ut-Tahrir, which was

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.239
the organization that Maajid was a member
of.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.300
He came into the program and complained long
into the night about the film.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.310
We discussed that until well after midnight,
I think.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.049
Then, when he decided to take a new path,
he phoned us up and said, "I am converting

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.530
and I'm going to [man coughs] change my approach
completely."

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.210
He asked if he could make a film about that
change on Newsnight, which we very quickly

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.579
said, "Absolutely."

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.170
The film went out.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.170
So welcome, Maajid.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.170
&gt;&gt;Maajid Nawaz: Thank you.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.170
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It's great to have you here.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.509
I'm really-- Let's go back to South End.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.429
How did you get involved with extremism in
the first place?

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.090
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: First of all, thank you for that
introduction.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.659
I mention Peter in the book because of the
story that he's just mentioned.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.259
It was very kind of you to actually give me
the opportunity to come back and set the record

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.340
straight.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.409
Thank you for agreeing to chair this event
today.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.630
My journey to an Islamist organization began--
I was born and raised in Essex.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.060
My journey began in my teenage years.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.640
I grew up in a very-- with a very integrated
background.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.370
In fact, all of my friends were white Essex
boys.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.409
We had little problem with racism until I
became a teenager.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:29.110
But when I hit the age of around 14 years
old, because of a phenomenon that was called

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.610
"white flight"-- Now if any of you are not
from England or London, white flight was something

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.920
that was used as a term to describe white
people moving from East London to get away

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.599
from increasing immigration and moving as
far east as they could go.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.130
Now, of course, the furthest east is South
End, because beyond that, there's the sea.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.541
When they went as far east as they could go
to get away from the immigration, they found

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.330
me in South End, which is where I was born.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.060
They didn't expect that.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.520
In those days, I think South End was about
99.5% white.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.920
So I had-- All my friends were English and
white people.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.900
I basically didn't know anything else.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.599
I became-- I experienced a rude awakening.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.720
I became suddenly aware of my skin color.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.541
I describe it in Radical as a way that when
I look at people, when I look at you, when

00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.220
I look and talk to people, I don't see my
own skin color.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.220
I see people in front of me.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.940
I see them as human beings.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.189
The racist is forever seeing me and defining
me by the color of my skin.

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:40.170
And would view the color of that skin as a
target.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.030
In those days, there was a phenomenon-- Now,
I'm saying all this-- This is the beginning

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.030
of the story.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.030
Please don't get me wrong.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.330
Racism is no longer as severe a problem in
the UK as it used to be.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.340
I have to say that point.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.299
Things are much better than they used to be.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.939
But in those days, there were people that
would engage in what they call Paki bashing.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.540
What this is is that they would ride around
in white vans and they would randomly jump

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.590
out the back of these vans to attack any one
of a brown complexion that they saw in an

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.530
unprovoked and totally without warning attack.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.709
These attacks would usually be with hammers
and with screwdrivers and with kebab knives.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.120
At the age of 14, I began experiencing or
being a target of this sort of Paki bashing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.630
on the streets in Essex.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.150
It would occur on many occasions.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.320
One of my friends called Moe Giddings was
chased down the seafront with a hammer.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.780
Had a hammer attack to his head.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.490
We were targeted on many occasions.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.140
On many occasions, I had to watch my friends
stabbed and slashed at with knives by these

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.240
racists.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.770
This was all happening at the same time while
Essex police authorities, before the days

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.270
of the Stephen Lawrence murder, before the
days of the Macpherson Report that exposed

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.660
a level of institutional racism in the police
forces in this country, we were living that

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.150
type of institutional racism.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.420
On many occasions, we were the target of police
discrimination as well as targeted on the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.260
streets of Essex for our skin color.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.730
On time, my brother, who was 16, was playing
with a toy gun in the park.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.140
A lady saw him and decided that he must be
about to rob a bank, and reported him to the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.140
police.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.080
I joined him later on in the evening, as a
15 year old, and we went to play snooker.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.980
We were on the way back home in our friend's
car, who was 17 and therefore old enough to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.230
drive.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.330
The police had blocked the roads, and there
was a police helicopter flying above us.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.050
They shone a spotlight onto our car.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.080
Suddenly, from either side of the car, came
these armed policemen with sub semi automatic

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.260
machine guns.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.230
The put guns to our heads and they dragged
us out of the car and said, "You're being

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.100
arrested for suspicion of armed robbery."

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.100
I was too young to be interrogated without
the presence of an adult, so they called my

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.580
poor mother at 3 am in the morning.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.330
They woke her up and said, "Both your sons
have been arrested for suspicion of armed

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
robbery.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.280
You have to come down to the station because
we can't interview-- interrogate the younger

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.870
one without your presence.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.510
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And your response to that was
then to turn to extreme Islam, was it?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.800
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: One more thing happened.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.070
That was Bosnia.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:12.590
With the genocide in Bosnia, what I had previously
associated as racist violence, I began seeing

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.720
as something a bit deeper.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.121
Because of course, in Bosnia, there were white,
blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims who were being

00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:22.190
targeted by the Serbs because of their faith.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.680
What all of this led to isn't me joining Hizb
ut-Tahrir.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.850
It led to me becoming very disenfranchised
and disconnected from society.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.330
What then led me to join Hizb ut-Tahrir, once
I was already primed, is the final ingredient

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.800
that you need to join the dots of the grievances
that one experienced.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.170
That's the ideological narrative.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.520
I met a recruiter who joined those dots and
basically gave me an alternative discourse

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.730
to explain away all of these grievances.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Tell us a little bit about Hizb
ut-Tahrir, because they are an organization

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.060
who effectively want to overthrow governments
right around the world and impose an Islamic

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.060
state.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.060
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Founded in 1953 in Jerusalem, Hizb
ut-Tahrir has three names.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.530
But first of all, I'll say it's an Islamist
organization.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.580
What is Islamism, and how is it different
to Islam?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.950
Islam is a religion, it's a faith.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.260
Every Muslim has the right to practice their
religion, whether in its conservative form

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.160
or in its reformist form.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.040
Islamism, on the other hand, is the desire
to impose an interpretation of that faith

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.720
over society as law.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720
That's the difference.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.580
The desire to impose an interpretation of
Islam over society is the politicization of

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.580
religion.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.590
That's why we add the suffix -ism to the end.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.810
So it's called Islamism.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.600
Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamist organization.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.270
It seeks to overthrow every single Muslim
majority regime so it can impose its interpretation

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.570
of Islam.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:51.530
It also seeks to create, as a result, a pan-Islamist
superstate, an expansionist state that will

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.530
rule the world.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.760
The final aim is to destroy the state of Israel.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.640
How they aim to get to power: there's three
different groups of methodologies within Islamist

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
organizations.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.730
We have the Muslim Brotherhood variety in
Egypt.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.700
They aim to get to power through competing
in elections and participating in the political

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700
system.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.720
Then the second category are those who are
the revolutionary Islamist organizations,

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.270
like the group I belonged to.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.490
They aim to recruit army officers, serving
army officers, from the armies of Muslim majority

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.120
countries so they can incite military coups.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.360
They've done that and I've participated in
that level of incitement across a couple of

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360
countries in the world.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.140
The third type, the third category are the
terrorist Islamist organizations.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.950
I joined a revolutionary Islamist organization.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.880
&gt;&gt;Presenter: It treaded a fine line, didn't
it, this organization?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.670
This is where we got into heated debate, because
it's not a terrorist organization.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.409
But is it a violent organization?

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.159
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: There is a level of violence that
is not defined as terrorism.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.769
For example, a military coup is inherently
a violent act.

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:51.100
When you attempt to overthrow a government
using an army, the fact is, the army is threatening

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.920
force if the government doesn't comply.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:00.029
Now, if that's a democratic regime, then it's
an illegal act to even encourage that.

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:03.069
In that sense, they're encouraging violence.

00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:08.370
But they're not encouraging terrorism, meaning
they will condemn, and not condone, attacks

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.820
on hotels, nightclubs, and these sorts of
things.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.010
It's a more focused level of violence.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.779
Once they come to power, they then aim to
use the fact that a state has a monopoly over

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:22.810
violence to engage in a very aggressive and
violent foreign policy of war.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.589
They appropriate the term jihad, which is
a Koranic concept which means "struggle",

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:28.019
and they apply it to their foreign policy.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:30.430
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And it's all based on sales,
isn't it?

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.670
And you were actually a sale recruiter, weren't
you?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.780
What does that involve?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.069
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: I went through the ranks.

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:37.019
I started off as a recruiter at Newham College.

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:40.970
I became president of the students' union
and was involved in a heavy recruitment drive

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.209
for the group.

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:46.620
My entire student union committee were members
of my organization and were elected on the

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.560
same slate as I was.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.449
We ratcheted up and poisoned the atmosphere
to such an extent that sadly, though we didn't

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:57.850
encourage this directly-- but it's a natural
consequence of what I believe is is if you

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.430
boil a kettle enough, eventually the water
will boil over.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.070
One of our supporters called Sayid Nour ended
up murdering a non-Muslim student on that

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.649
campus by stabbing him through the heart with
a machete.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:10.709
He was convicted for murder and is serving
a life sentence.

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:11.959
He was not a member of the group.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:16.620
He was a supporter who-- As I said, when you
ratchet up the atmosphere-- It's like if racism

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.379
spreads unchecked in society.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:24.540
Don't be surprised if Combat 18 and other
racist groups start engaging in violence.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.020
That's the fine line you mentioned.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.660
That was the debate we had when I was still
a member of the group.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.959
They don't directly encourage violence, and
that was the point I was pushing and was bound

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:33.959
to push.

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:35.970
When you were editor of Newsnight.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.170
I was arguing a legal point.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.569
But they don't necessarily encourage violence
directly.

00:10:40.569 --> 00:10:46.041
But what I was conceding was the fact that
this point, that just like with racism, if

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:50.220
you spread an extremist idea and if you spread
hatred and bigotry in society, then the natural

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.389
consequence-- Don't be surprised if people
then allow that the spin over and take matters

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:55.389
into their own hands.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:59.310
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Then this led to you going to
Egypt and to getting into trouble there.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:04.759
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Before I went to Egypt, I was co-founder
of this group in three other, well, two other

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:05.889
countries apart from Britain.

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:10.959
I went to Denmark and helped establish the
Danish-Pakistani branch.

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:17.110
When Pakistan tested it's nuclear bomb, we
got a message from the global leader saying

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:21.480
that the superstate that they wanted to create
would really benefit from a nuclear bomb.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.210
He sent a message to all British Pakistani
members, and asked us to leave our studies.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.029
At the time I was doing law and Arabic at
University, at Soas.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:32.290
We could leave our studies and go over as
quickly as possible to Pakistan to recruit

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:38.089
from the Pakistani Army and recruit from the
population, so prime Pakistan as being the

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.750
starting point for this so-called caliphate.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.079
Again, another appropriation of an Islamic
term, a historical term that they've now used

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.560
to call their superstate.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.689
I left in 1999.

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:52.470
I moved to Pakistan and began recruiting there.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.579
I tried to-- Well, I co-founded the group
there and set up cells in Lahore and Rahim

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:04.509
Yar Khan and other cities, and also helped
recruit Pakistani Army officers to the group,

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:09.629
who were discovered in 2003 by General Musharraf
in a purge, because they were plotting a coup.

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:14.749
Even this year, they've discovered a third
cell of my former group in the Pakistani Army.

00:12:14.749 --> 00:12:18.459
Brigadier Ali Khan and four other officers
who are currently facing a military tribunal,

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.389
again, for plotting a coup.

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:24.899
Media reports state that, in fact, there was
a recruit from the Air Force who was even

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:30.870
considering bombing the Parliament as a distraction
when they attempt to engage in this coup.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.790
After my activities in Pakistan, I ended up
in Egypt.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:41.080
In Egypt, I was head of the Alexandria chapter,
and was attempting to resurrect and recreate

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.939
this group in Egypt.

00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:48.709
I was in Egypt, after 9/11, that the authorities--
or my activities caught up with me and the

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:50.839
authorities arrested me.

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:54.281
On the 1st of April in 2002, I was arrested
in Alexandria.

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.850
I was blindfolded.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.689
I was taken to the dungeons of the state security
headquarters in Cairo in a building known

00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:03.220
as al-Gihaz.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.699
My hands were tied behind my back with rags.

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:06.699
I was given a number.

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:08.570
My number was 42.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.019
The numbers went into the hundreds.

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:15.379
It was there, in the building of al-Gihaz,
that they began torturing everybody by electrocution,

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:19.889
going up from number 1 to number 2 to number
3, all the way into the hundreds.

00:13:19.889 --> 00:13:24.079
We were eventually sentenced to five years
in prison.

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.550
I wanted to actually read an extract--

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.550
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Sure.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.980
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: --from-- Could I just borrow your
book, please?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.980
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Sure.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980
[laughs] With pleasure.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.430
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: I thought that what I'd do is just
read from that section of my time in al-Gihaz.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.740
It's not long, just a page.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.329
Because it just gives you a feeling.

00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:43.709
It's very difficult to describe walking towards
your torture, to your own torture.

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:44.870
I wasn't electrocuted, thankfully.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.709
I need to make that point clear.

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:51.390
I was instead subjected to having to witness
other people electrocuted.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.389
And then my questions were being played off
them and vice versa.

00:13:55.389 --> 00:14:00.250
But at the time that I was walking towards
the torture cell, to the interrogation room,

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.589
I didn't know.

00:14:01.589 --> 00:14:05.410
Because of course, they had tortured another
British citizen who was with me.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.850
So I didn't know if they were going to electrocute
me or not.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.510
This is-- What I try to do is explain how
that feels, in the book, when you're walking

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.939
towards what could be a very difficult situation
to deal with.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.199
This chapter-- It's from chapter 20.

00:14:19.199 --> 00:14:23.589
It's called "As-Salamu Alaykum, You've Just
Come Out of Hell" because al-Gihaz was a building

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:24.740
infamous throughout Egypt.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.209
During the Egypt uprising, the revolutionaries
in fact stormed this building.

00:14:30.209 --> 00:14:32.180
They ransacked it and they took the files.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:38.180
There are two buildings that are infamous
in Egypt for torture, and they were, respectively,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:44.180
the Cairo headquarters, Amn ad-Dawla, or the
State Security, and the Egypt headquarters.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.839
Al-Gihaz was the national Egypt headquarters,
and Lazoghly was the building that was the

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:49.699
Cairo headquarters.

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:54.860
Just merely mentioning the names, if anyone
is Egyptian in the audience, you'd know.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.269
Merely mentioning al-Gihaz and Lazoghly would
be enough to send a shiver down the spine

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:00.490
of any Egyptian.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.449
They were truly dark and despicable places.

00:15:03.449 --> 00:15:06.959
If you bear with me, this is a very difficult
passage.

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:12.079
When I wrote this, it was actually-- I had
a bit of a breakdown.

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.120
I'm just going to read it for you because
it gives you a sense of what it feels like

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.620
to be in that situation.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.119
"To be asked to voluntarily walk towards your
own torture is the cruelest of expectations.

00:15:22.119 --> 00:15:25.300
Why can't they just carry me?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.610
Each step is a personal betrayal.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.420
My body is convulsing in revulsion against
my commands.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.230
Every instinct is screaming at me to turn
the other way.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.160
[pause] But I'm expected to walk on.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.779
Try standing in the middle of a highway, watching
an oncoming bus, without flinching.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.550
That's hard.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:53.380
Now try voluntarily walking towards that bus
instead of stepping out of the way.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.279
Impossible.

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:58.050
That's what it's like walking towards your
own torture.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:02.559
My legs are buckling under each step, but
I force compliance and walk on.

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:07.490
God, your chaperoning hand that helps me walk
blindly to my own torture feels perversely

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.839
merciful.

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:12.790
For how could I avoid stepping on my brothers
in the corridor, were it not for you?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:17.730
Alas, without sight, I cannot help but feel
so disgustingly dependent on you.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.329
Now it is hard to breathe.

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:23.920
Fighting to stay hidden away deep within me,
even my breath fears coming out to face my

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.990
torturer.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.259
My heart is attempting to escape the cage
that is my chest, and my mind is beginning

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:30.259
to shut down.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:31.699
I'm in shock.

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.139
Oh, God, I need you right now.

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:38.560
If any mercy I've ever shown to anyone has
amounted to any value in your esteem, then

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.999
send me your angels now to shield me from
these monsters.

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:46.350
I'm trying to be brave for you, my Lord, but
the truth is, I'm scared.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.660
Help me, my Lord, for I am very scared."

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.189
As I said, that's from chapter 20.

00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:54.529
That's just before my number was called, number
42.

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:57.470
It's just before I was called to the torture
cell.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:04.829
After four days, we were then put into solitary
confinement in a concrete cell with no sanitation

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.579
and no-- and that means no toilet.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.709
And no bed and no light and no sink.

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.380
Eventually, we were sentenced to five years
in prison.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.000
&gt;&gt;Presenter: And did you spend five years
in prison?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.870
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: I spent my full sentence, which was
meant to be three years and nine months.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:22.150
It took them an extra three months to sort
their paperwork out, so I returned after serving

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.150
four years.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.470
The prison was Mazra Tora Prison.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:31.190
Anyone who follows the Egypt uprising will
know that Hosni Mubarak's sons and the former

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.660
Minister of Interior, Habib El Adly, and Hosni
Mubarak himself, are currently serving in

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.660
that very same prison.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.630
I thank God that they weren't tortured and
that what happened to Gaddafi didn't happen

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:46.400
to them, because of course, as Nietzsche said,
"Beware of becoming the monster you're attempting

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
to fight."

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.450
When I became an Islamist, I did become somewhat
of that monster.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.370
I'm happy that I've managed to pull myself
back from that level of anger.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.150
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So then how did you start to
change your mind?

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.270
Was it around this time?

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.770
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: You can have your book back.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.560
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Thank you very much.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.390
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Two things happened to me in Mazra
Tora Prison that had a profound impact on

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.390
me.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:13.210
One of them was that Amnesty International,
to whom I owe a great deal of thanks for their

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.630
support, they adopted me as a prisoner of
conscience.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:19.690
If you keep in mind the way in which we spoke
earlier, that there are three categories of

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:26.270
Islamist organizations, and my one was a non-terrorist
organization, and specifically, in this case,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.990
there were no charges of violence, that the
charges in Arabic were-- They're quite comical,

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.050
actually.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:39.540
[speaks Arabic] which means, "Propagation
by speech and writing for the ideas of a banned

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.540
organization."

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.250
We were charged for ideas.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.960
The charge in itself was a known goal.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.350
That spurred Amnesty on.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.130
There was a man called John Cornell, who is
a part of the Amnesty's Buckingham branch.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.200
He began writing letters to the headquarters,
asking them to adopt us as prisoners of conscience.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.590
He had an impact, and they did.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:03.240
As soon as we were charged by these dodgy
charges-- Now I've got to say, again, we were

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.420
extreme.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:11.240
We did believe in unpalatable and reprehensible
ideas.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.180
But that's different to actually doing something
illegal.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.150
It's also different to being a terrorist.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:22.010
Part of the reason I'm doing the work I'm
doing now is to make amends for the extremism

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.010
that I spread.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.540
I just want to make that point clear.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.540
When Amnesty--

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.900
&gt;&gt;Presenter: But when did you realize that
what you were doing was reprehensible?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.900
When did that dawn on you?

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.890
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: This was a-- There was no sudden
moment.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.680
There was a four year process, and one year
after prison.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.880
As I said, the two things that really helped
change my mind is Amnesty working to campaign

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.920
for my release.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.800
That began a rehumanization process.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.000
I began defining the other no longer as my
enemy, because of course, they were defending

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
me.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.250
There's a lesson there in the importance of
adhering to human rights.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.400
The war on terror decade I think had it the
wrong way around.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.630
They basically started cutting back on human
rights and going in heavy with the military,

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.100
whereas what should have happened is a heavy
civic response to extremism and a protection

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.100
of civil liberties.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.290
But anyway, that's another subject.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.831
But that had a profound impact on me.

00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:10.520
The second thing was that I was in prison,
at the time, with some of the leading jihadists

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.800
and Islamists of their day, in Egypt.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.950
Everything from, on the one end of the spectrum,
the assassins of the former president, Anwar

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:23.880
Sadat, through to the Muslim Brotherhood leadership,
Dr. Mohammed Badie, who's their current Masul,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.540
their general leader.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.550
That's the party that's now-- Their candidate
won the presidential elections in Egypt.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.010
They're now in power.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.750
All the way through to liberal political prisoners,
such as Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim and Ayman Nour,

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.510
the former presidential candidate.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:42.730
Essentially, the four years in university,
it was a political university.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.860
Everything I've told you that I did, I did
before the age of 24.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.610
I was imprisoned at 24.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.590
I'm now only 25, believe it or not.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.340
[laughs] No, I'm 34.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.570
At 24, I was imprisoned.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.540
So I was still very young.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.900
It was those four years that basically was
my political maturity, political awakening.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:06.730
From 24 to 28, the Amnesty's work, and my
political discussions in prison, and my studying

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:11.250
from Islam's original sources-- I became fluent
in Arabic, not only because I did the law

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.430
and Arabic degree at Soas, but also because,
by that time, obviously in prison, I had to

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.270
speak Arabic every day.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.180
I began studying from the Koran and the original
sources of Islam.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.060
I realized that this distinction between Islam
as a religion and Islamism as a modern political

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.540
ideology inspired by European fascism, ironically
enough.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.660
After my release from prison, it took me a
further 10 months, and I could no longer justify--

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.020
You met me during that 10 months.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.020
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yes.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.440
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: And I could no longer justify believing
in those ideas.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.170
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You changed in your mind, but
you hadn't changed publicly.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.170
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: That's right.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.600
&gt;&gt;Presenter: You were still representing Hizb
ut-Tahrir.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: On their leadership.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600
Yeah.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.690
&gt;&gt;Presenter: But you knew you were on the
wrong path.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:49.690
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yeah.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.690
I had a BBC HARDtalk interview with Sarah
Montague while I was still a member, during

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.380
the time I met you.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.540
I toed the party line as far as I could.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.530
It's still on the internet, if you wanted
to watch it.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.670
You'll see me speaking as a Hizb ut-Tahrir
member.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.110
But I was roundly criticized inside the group
for that interview because they said it was

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.110
too soft.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.370
That was me struggling with my own-- For example,
I used the term-- I said, "We're calling for

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.390
a representative caliphate."

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.070
They basically took issue with my use of the
word representative.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.870
"What do you mean, 'a representative caliphate'?

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.870
It's God's law!

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.140
God's the one who represents us."

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.410
It wasn't-- They weren't happy with that.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.740
That was like-- They could see that my views
were changing a bit.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:32.440
Like we've met again, I'm actually due onto
HARDtalk again next week, the first time since

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440
leaving.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.440
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Aha.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.220
So then, how did you make the break, and how
did that go down with Hizb ut-Tahrir?

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.270
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: They asked me to-- They pretty much
were preparing me to take over the leadership

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.070
of the group in the UK.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:49.130
The man who originally recruited me was, by
this time, the leader.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:55.310
He needed to go to Bangladesh to [pause] help
found the group in Bangladesh.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.000
Incidentally, there's also been an army purge
in Bangladesh.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.190
They found a cell in the Bangladeshi Army
plotting a coup.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:07.490
They offered that, and I was forced to make
a decision: either become the leader of the

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.340
group in the country, and I no longer believe
in the group, or leave.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.440
I unilaterally resigned.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.310
I guess the only other question is, "Why didn't
I keep quiet after my resignation?"

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.320
I think that what drove me to join the group
in the first place was a desire to see justice

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.010
and fight the injustices that I saw around
me.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:31.340
I now came to believe that the ideology of
Islamism is as big an injustice as racism

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.510
and all the other grievances, including foreign
policy grievances, that are out there.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:40.540
I believe that the ideology of Islamism is
one of the biggest obstacles standing before

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.380
Muslims and their progress.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.390
That sense that the Islamism is creating more
injustice than it's solving meant that my

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.740
original motivation was still there.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.020
I needed, I wanted to fight injustice.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.520
The target had just shifted towards this ideology
now, as well.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.040
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Did that put you at risk, do
you think, when you came out?

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:03.450
You did a, I think it was a 70 minute film
on Newsnight denouncing Hizb ut-Tahrir and

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.150
then obviously doing speaking programs and
so on.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.150
Have you had threats or intimidation as a
result?

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.650
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: There were threats, there were intimidations.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.650
Yeah.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.110
Just today, someone on Twitter said they wanted
to shoot me.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.690
If they saw me in the audience, they'd come
up and kill me, because I did a talk yesterday.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.780
We get threats all the time.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.140
But I don't know how serious they are.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.750
I have been attacked in Pakistan by a member
of the group.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.470
But keep in mind, this isn't a terrorist organization.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.250
The bigger danger is, it comes from-- Because
I'm not just criticizing Hizb ut-Tahrir.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:34.810
I'm criticizing the entire Islamist project
that I no longer agree with, and separating

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.810
it from Islam.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.720
That's very dangerous for them, because Islamists
believe that they have a monopoly over Islamic

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720
discourse.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.770
The minute you separate their ideology from
the faith, you're removing that monopoly.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.040
You're breaking that monopoly.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.410
It upsets all Islamist organizations.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.530
The bigger danger is from the violent ones.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:57.310
We do a lot of work in Pakistan now to try
and challenge the Islamist narrative and inoculate

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:01.460
young people against the extremist narratives,
and instead advocate the democratic culture.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.250
I've found in a movement, in Pakistan, mirroring
my founding of Islamist movements.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.110
I've used the same tactics and the same organizational
techniques to set up a social movement that

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.470
advocates, instead, democratic culture.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.950
A leading member of that movement is here
with me today.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.710
He's Imran Khan who's on the leadership.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.410
Just stick your hand up, Imran.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.810
If anyone wants to ask him about Pakistan
afterwards, he's on the leadership of the

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.180
movement we founded there called Khudi.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.020
He's here for a week, just to see how things
are in the UK.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.070
But we travel around and hold workshops in
universities with students.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.980
We inoculate them against the extremist narratives.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.980
We train them in how to distinguish between
Islam and Islamism.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:43.230
We're trying to popularize the counter narratives
and rebrand democratic activism in Pakistan.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:49.230
Of course, it is dangerous, but I think the
bigger danger is facing people like Imran

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.000
who are out on the front lines every day.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.050
I'm just providing my consultancy services,
if you like.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.590
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That's the Quilliam Foundation?

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.590
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yes.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:01.220
&gt;&gt;Presenter: That's interesting, because there's
a number of people, Ed Husain and some others,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.960
who had conversions round about the same time,
and banded together.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.560
Why was it that these guys all came to the
same conclusion around the same time, to found

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.560
Quilliam?

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.950
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: There was some-- Ed and I founded
Quilliam together.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.900
We brought, as you said, a number of guys
on board.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.310
There was something of a perfect storm in
those days.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.630
The perfect storm was that the public appetite
to understand the difference between Islam

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.080
and Islamism was at its peak.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.120
It was post 7/7.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.340
Policy makers were hungry for this distinction,
and to understand the debate.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:38.730
There was funds available, in terms of public
funds, to try and address some of these subjects.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:45.570
Ed had just written his book explaining his
views around these things.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.570
All of that came together.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:50.500
I had just got released from prison, and of
course, my story, being out of the group,

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.420
being the only one who had gone on the be
a bit of an international Islamist and imprisoned

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.420
and stuff.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:27:01.440
It added the extra spice, if you like, in
the masala, to create that background, backstory.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440
It was a perfect storm.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.660
I don't think we could replicate it today.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.550
I don't think we could replicate founding
Quilliam.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.180
We could probably replicate founding Khudi
in Pakistan, but founding Quilliam in the

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.680
UK as a policy-based institution dealing with,
addressing some of these issues on a policy

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.290
and media and public diplomacy level.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:22.830
I don't know if that same level of opportunities
that we found would present themselves today.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.110
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Are you succeeding?

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.010
Do you think the threat of radical Islam is
receding in Britain?

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.250
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: That's tough to say.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.240
Jonathan Evans, the head of the Security Services
just gave a speech two weeks ago, if you caught

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.980
that, warning that the security vacuum from
the Arab uprisings could be exploited and

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:46.090
is, in his view-- I'm sure he'd know-- is
being exploited by British Muslims going over

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.230
to train with al-Qaeda.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.490
Now, the Arab uprisings were great news.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.860
I believe-- Not only because they were personally
cathartic-- Hosni Mubarak was brought to justice--

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.560
but I believe that in the long term, this
is a step to the right side of history.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.280
I believe that closed societies breed closed
minds.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.010
And open and democratic societies will, in
the long run, breed open and democratic minds.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:14.000
But how to make sure they remain open and
not become elected dictatorships?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.900
To have that, we need to have the democratic
trinity I often refer to.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.840
That's the need for a democratic culture,
meaning the ideas and values that underpin

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.450
democracies, just human rights and freedoms.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.770
The democratic institutions, such as Parliament
and the Senate.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.130
And the democratic processes.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:37.470
If this democratic trinity can be rooted within
societies just as Egypt or Pakistan, they

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:43.280
will act as the strongest check against any
one party dominating politics, even an Islamist

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280
party.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.950
That's what we're trying to seed in Pakistan,
this democratic trinity.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.500
It's what we're trying to seed in Pakistan
with our social movement Khudi.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.760
But Egypt doesn't have an equivalent level
of social organizing for democratic values.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.610
It's quite disparate at the moment.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.830
Jonathan Evans gave a speech saying that British
Muslims may exploit the security vacuum from

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.490
the Arab uprisings in countries like Yemen,
Somalia, Libya, and Syria.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.440
Especially Syria because of its proximity
to Iraq, and former militants coming from

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.130
Iraq into Syria to fight Assad.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.700
He said there's a chance, and they're aware
of, some people coming back and potentially

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.300
trying to attack Britain.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.620
Now, it's not a huge leap of the imagination
to remember that 7/7 occurred during the week

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.770
we won the Olympics bid, and that now we're
about to come into the Olympics.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.400
It would be hugely symbolic if there was a
terrorist strike in London.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.330
I don't think it's a matter of if, I think
it's a matter of when and where.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.630
I hope and believe that it wouldn't be successful,
but I definitely think that there will be

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.630
attempts.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.980
In fact, there have already been arrests.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.980
A couple of cases.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.360
One non-Olympics related terrorism arrest,
a group of six.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.720
And one Olympics related, a Somali who had
14 Somalia with al-Shabaab.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.330
I think it's not about if, but when and where,
sadly.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.010
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Okay, thank you.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.530
Now, should we throw it in to the audience?

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.310
Who would like to ask some questions?

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.540
[pause]

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.250
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:12.420
My name is Eleanor Davis.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.890
I'm Israeli.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.620
I've been shaking most of the time while you
were talking.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.113
I have to collect myself.

00:30:20.113 --> 00:30:23.260
I have two questions for you.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:30.230
The first one is: I've read that you went
to meet Israeli families, bereaved families,

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:36.710
that are victims of terror attacks that Israel,
unfortunately, has a lot of.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:44.100
I wanted to ask you how you were received,
how it made you feel, and also ask you what

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:53.970
your thoughts are on terror organizations
such as Hamas and Hezbollah, who are very

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.420
focused on destroying Israel?

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:02.640
Then, my second question to you was regarding
the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.050
As you said, Arab Spring is something that
brought a lot of hope.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:14.600
But from an Israeli perspective, looking at
the Muslim Brotherhood, who have very difficult

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600
opinions.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:24.820
There's been a lot of quotations recently
in the Israeli news about whether to keep

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:30.930
the peace with Israel or not, and calls to
destroy Israel and so on, which isn't very

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.450
hopeful or Spring-like for us.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.170
I was hoping to get your opinion on that,
as well.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.980
Then, I just want to end by saying thank you,
so much, for being who you are.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.970
I just wish we had more like you.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.970
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Thank you.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:45.970
Indeed, you're correct.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.970
You probably read it in the Jewish Chronicle.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.720
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I actually read Israeli News.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.410
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Oh, was it in the Israeli paper?

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:54.620
Ah, okay, I didn't know that.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.280
I wrote that in the Jewish Chronicle.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.240
I didn't realize the Israeli press covered
it, which is good, I suppose, as well.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.320
I've just returned from both Israel and the
West Bank.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.440
In Israel I met with Mark Regev, the spokesman
for Netanyahu.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.320
I also met with our own ambassador there,
Matthew Gould, and met with Husam Zomlot from

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.890
the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank
in Ramallah.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.270
We did a full talk.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:21.230
I was part of a parliamentary delegation that
went.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:26.120
As you correctly said, I met with victims
of terror.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.500
The experience was very fulfilling for me.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:35.530
The whole rehumanization process is what I,
because of Amnesty's work, is what I put a

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:36.750
lot of emphasis on.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.330
I think rehumanization of the other is crucial.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.840
Face to face contact is one of the best ways
to do that.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.590
But not only face to face contact.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.480
What is also needed is to actually start,
respectively, to start challenging some of

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.230
the extremisms that exist within one's own
communities.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:57.720
That's why, to take responsibility for some
of the ideas that I've put out there, I'm

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.120
doing the work I'm doing now.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.650
Hamas and Hezbollah.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.530
There is absolutely no excuse and no justification,
no matter how angry somebody is, to deliberately

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:15.000
target civilians and non-combatants in revenge
or to achieve any foreign policy objective

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.320
whatsoever.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:23.960
I spoke in Israel, I say the same here, when
an individual or non-state actor targets civilians

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.210
or non-combatants, I define it as terrorism.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.130
Whoever they are, even if it's Hamas and Hezbollah.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.870
When a state does so, I describe it as a war
crime.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:39.520
Because of the position I'm in, you'll understand,
I have to be very-- I have to try and be perceived

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.280
to be very fair.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.590
I regularly write in the newspapers against
Hamas.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.020
I consider Hamas a terrorist organization.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.940
I believe the true chance for peace in the
Israel-Palestine conflict is by strengthening

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.840
the successes of the Palestinian Authority.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.990
I saw some of the projects they're involved
in, such as the new development site called

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:02.180
Rawabi, which is the first time in history
that they're building a planned city in the

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.180
West bank.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.820
It's a Qatari funded project.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.000
It's a great project.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.950
[unintelligible] It's a hugely successful
thing if they pull it off.

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.310
I think that that's the solution, in strengthening
the Palestinian Authority.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.139
So I write against Hamas' and Hezbollah's
terrorism in the papers.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.980
But I also, I won't make any qualms about
it, was critical of Israel's Gaza Operation,

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.270
the one where they were bombing Gaza, I think
a year ago, whenever it was.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.399
I believe-- yeah, two years ago.

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:27.529
I think the reaction was disproportionate.

00:34:27.529 --> 00:34:32.310
But I do draw a distinction between terrorism
and a disproportionate state reaction, which

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.999
in international law is called "disproportionate
reaction."

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:37.899
I hope that answers your question.

00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:40.169
But thank you, as well, for your kind comments.

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:42.999
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Just about the Muslim Brotherhood,
as well.

00:34:42.999 --> 00:34:43.999
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Okay.

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:46.179
Because of all the questions, what I'll say
is that the democratic trinity's what's needed

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.919
to be rooted in the Egyptian society.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:52.839
If we can do that, then there will be a check
on any one party taking over or having an

00:34:52.839 --> 00:34:54.450
undue influence in Egyptian politics.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:56.839
Finally, there is some cause for hope.

00:34:56.839 --> 00:35:01.440
Don't forget, only 25% of the population voted
for an Islamist party.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.420
That's 75% that did not vote for the Brotherhood.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.099
That's a 50% drop from their parliamentary
results.

00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:09.700
If you remember, in Parliament, they got 50%.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.200
In the presidential elections, they only got
25%.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.299
Within the space of a few months, their percentage
dropped.

00:35:15.299 --> 00:35:19.369
That's because the majority of Egyptians realized
the difference between Islam and Islamism,

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:21.230
because they have to live it.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.230
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Next question.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.230
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.650
First of all, thanks for coming.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.749
It's great to have you here.

00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:26.749
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Pleasure.

00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:27.749
Thank you for having me.

00:35:27.749 --> 00:35:29.849
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I have three questions.

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:30.849
[laughter]

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:32.300
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Is that okay with our chair?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.300
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yeah.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300
Be quick, though.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.059
&gt;&gt;Male #1: You were a recruiter.

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:41.450
What would you say to one person that you
recruited?

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:45.619
Because I guess you used some arguments, something
to convince these people.

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:49.940
What will you say to those people now?

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.690
This is my question number 1.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:59.539
My question number 2 is: are you afraid--
do you think your life is in danger after

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:03.410
these changes in your life and publishing,
writing this book?

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:12.049
And the third question is: where do you think
the Arabic Spring will come out, will end

00:36:12.049 --> 00:36:13.049
up?

00:36:13.049 --> 00:36:17.619
And also, one thing is that your book is available
in Playstore, which is great.

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:18.619
[laughter]

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:19.619
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Okay.

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:20.619
What's Playstore?

00:36:20.619 --> 00:36:21.619
Forgive my ignorance.

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:22.619
[laughter]

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:25.990
&gt;&gt;Presenter: A very good online store.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.990
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Ah!

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.990
Fantastic.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.990
Thank you, Playstore.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.230
Thumbs up to that.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:36.770
I think it's easier to deal with the second
question first, my life being in danger or

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:37.770
not.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.300
I mean, it may be or it may not be.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.040
Everyone's life's in danger in that sense,
because anything can happen.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:50.349
But the reason I'm sounding slightly flippant,
forgive me, about that question is because

00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:56.160
when you are a member of an Islamist organization
in Hosni Mubarak's Egypt, facing potential

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.710
torture or death for your Islamist activities,
you're already pretty much desensitized to

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.390
that level of danger.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:08.579
I'm not doing anything more dangerous now
than I was when known systematic torturers

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:12.150
were hunting me down in Egypt.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.960
Anything that terrorists could do to me now
is what the State Security could have done

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960
to me before.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.960
In that sense, I've pretty much reconciled
myself to it already 13 years ago.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.290
Your first question about what I'd say to
somebody.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.329
I don't think we have the time, but I am involved
in that.

00:37:25.329 --> 00:37:27.160
I am engaged in that.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.170
Just recently, I managed-- I have some good
news: I managed to convince a member of an

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:36.349
Islamist organization from a leadership position
to resign and step down and also denounce

00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:37.490
the Islamist ideology.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.759
Because they're not the same thing.

00:37:39.759 --> 00:37:42.549
You can leave the Communist Party and still
be a communist.

00:37:42.549 --> 00:37:45.720
The key is to actually convince them to leave
the ideology as well.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.720
I am engaged in that.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.789
As for your third question, I'm optimistic
in the long term about the Arab uprisings.

00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:53.710
I think Libya, for example, in the elections
that just happen there.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.710
It's great.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.140
The Islamists didn't win in Libya.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.329
And even in Egypt, as I said, only 25% voted
for the Islamist candidate.

00:38:00.329 --> 00:38:05.480
That was because they were actually rejecting
Hosni Mubarak's last PM, because the final

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.900
runoff ended up, ironically, being between
the old order and the new order.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.930
And there's no surprise there.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:14.579
They happened to be the most organized blocks
within a disorganized majority: Mubarak's

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:16.700
cronies and the Muslim Brotherhood.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.299
This election was actually a rejection of
the old, and nothing more.

00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:21.819
So I'm optimistic in the long term.

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:22.819
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Next question.

00:38:22.819 --> 00:38:24.960
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Forgive me, I'm trying to rush through
the questions.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.960
I hope you don't mind.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.970
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Just one at a time is preferred.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.859
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I saw you at BBC Interview, I think
it was 2006.

00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:34.490
I didn't know it was when you were going through
the transformation.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.890
But I want to just ask a quick question on
that.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.490
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Which BBC interview do you refer
to?

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.740
&gt;&gt;Presenter: The Sarah Montague, is that right?

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.740
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: The HARDtalk one?

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740
&gt;&gt;Male #2: HARDtalk, yeah.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.740
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Okay.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.840
&gt;&gt;Male #2: In that one, you had mentioned--
maybe it was you being "soft"-- but you had

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.609
mentioned you were trying to encourage to
Islamic governments to unite.

00:38:54.609 --> 00:38:56.740
I didn't see much wrong with that.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.859
You had defended that idea.

00:38:57.859 --> 00:39:00.900
I was in agreement with that specific idea.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.420
I just wanted to know if you are against that
idea now, because that seems not--

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.210
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Are you from Pakistan?

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.430
&gt;&gt;Male #2: No, I'm not.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:09.430
I'm from India.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.430
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: From India.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.980
It's a good question.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.270
The reason-- What I did is I remember the
analogy I drew is with the EU.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:20.099
I said, "If the European Union can come together,
why can't Muslim countries come together and

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:21.289
form a caliphate?"

00:39:21.289 --> 00:39:24.599
I'd like to tell you, now, that that analogy
is false.

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:26.509
You'll understand why it's false because you're
in London.

00:39:26.509 --> 00:39:30.309
The reason it's false is if you look at me,
I carry a British passport, and I have a Pakistani

00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:31.380
identity card as well.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.799
I can go in and out.

00:39:33.799 --> 00:39:35.160
That's called citizenship.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:41.200
Now, as a Muslim of Pakistani origin, born
in Essex, I'm a member of the EU citizens

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.200
and I'm a member of-- I'm a citizen of Britain.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.269
Britain didn't say to me, "Because you're
not a Muslim, you can't be a citizen."

00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:52.130
Britain said, "You're a British citizen."

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:56.400
In this country, we have a Muslim in the Cabinet,
serving in the Cabinet.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.880
Regardless of one's views about her.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.060
I'm not a Tory and-- But Baroness Warsi's
in the Cabinet.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.230
In the opposition, we have a Muslim in the
Shadow Cabinet.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.079
That's Sadiq Khan, who, incidentally, by the
way, or for the record, was my lawyer campaigning

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.430
for my release from prison.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.739
So I need to thank him for that on the record.

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:13.250
And in the Lib Dems as well.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.200
Muslims serve in all three parties as citizens
of this country.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.310
Why am I telling you this?

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:22.239
Because there's a difference between the citizenship
model that doesn't look at ethnicity and that

00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:25.920
doesn't look at religion, but rather looks
at your rights, yeah?

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.090
You can be American Italian, you can be American
Jewish, you can be American Muslim, you can

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.789
be American Christian.

00:40:30.789 --> 00:40:31.849
But you're American.

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:32.849
Likewise with Britain.

00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:36.609
You can be British Muslim, British Sikh, British
Hindu, British Indian, British Pakistani.

00:40:36.609 --> 00:40:40.249
However you define yourself, the fact is,
you're a citizen of this country.

00:40:40.249 --> 00:40:42.940
The EU is not a Christian club.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.259
That's the point I'm coming to.

00:40:44.259 --> 00:40:49.519
The analogy, to say, "Why can't Muslim countries
unite under a Muslim banner?" is a false analogy

00:40:49.519 --> 00:40:54.170
because we have moved out of the medieval
era where nations were basically bonding on

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.170
religion.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.940
We have moved into what I called the "citizenship
era".

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.231
If there is a regional cooperation between
Pakistan, it should be-- and that's why I

00:41:02.231 --> 00:41:06.690
asked you where you're from-- it should be
a South Asian regional economic cooperation

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.360
with India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
and the region.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.930
It should not be based on religion.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.050
That's the point why the analogy is wrong.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.050
Likewise with the Middle East.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.119
There should be a regional cooperation.

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:19.789
There are many, many Christians in the Middle
East.

00:41:19.789 --> 00:41:22.249
Egypt is not a Muslim country.

00:41:22.249 --> 00:41:23.249
It's not.

00:41:23.249 --> 00:41:24.289
It's a Muslim majority country.

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:25.900
That's why I'm very careful with my terminology.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.599
Egypt does not belong to Muslims.

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:29.299
It belongs to Egyptians.

00:41:29.299 --> 00:41:30.579
It's a republic.

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:32.859
20% of Egypt are Coptic Christians.

00:41:32.859 --> 00:41:35.750
They've been there before Muslims ever got
there.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.589
Likewise with Lebanon.

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:39.569
Lebanon is not a Muslim country.

00:41:39.569 --> 00:41:42.069
It's a Lebanese country for Lebanese people.

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:46.999
We have to stop defining nations by their
religious denomination, otherwise, we will

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:52.019
only reinforce the Islamist narrative that
defines people by their faith alone.

00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:55.660
When Google people, senior Google people like
Peter, see you, they don't say, "You're a

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.599
Muslim" and then only treat you as a Muslim.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:03.359
They see you as a man, as an Indian, as a
Google employee, as whatever else you are.

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:04.359
If you're a father, you're a father.

00:42:04.359 --> 00:42:05.970
If you're a husband, they see you as a husband.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.800
They see all of your identities together.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.349
They don't stereotype you, put you in a box,
and then patronize you just for that one identity

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:12.349
of your faith.

00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:17.539
I think it's dangerous if we, as Muslims,
try-- Inadvertently, reinforce the Islamist

00:42:17.539 --> 00:42:21.750
narrative by insisting that we are only defined
as Muslims and as nothing else.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.329
Because if you think about it, I will be self
excluding myself from British society if I

00:42:25.329 --> 00:42:26.329
do that.

00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:29.940
If I insist that I'm only a Muslim, then I'm
not British.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.230
Then I won't be allowed to participate in
the democracy of Britain and make things easier

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.829
for other Muslims in this country.

00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:38.589
Does that make sense?

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:41.720
I spent a bit of time on that answer just
to make sure that-- because it's important

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.829
to make that distinction.

00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:44.009
&gt;&gt;Male #2: It does make sense--

00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:45.009
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yeah.

00:42:45.009 --> 00:42:46.759
&gt;&gt;Male #2: --but I don't think you're-- If
I can take more?

00:42:46.759 --> 00:42:47.759
&gt;&gt;Presenter: One more.

00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:53.319
&gt;&gt;Male #2: European identities: they're not
just European, they are many things, right?

00:42:53.319 --> 00:42:55.670
Muslim identity: we can be Muslims as well
as other things.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.160
So what's wrong with having unity between--?

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.160
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Right.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.150
In which case, if it's multiple, it's done
by economy and geography, isn't it?

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.430
It's not done by religion alone.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.430
That's my only point, yeah?

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.640
If there is regional cooperation, then there
are more Muslims-- you know this-- there are

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.299
more Muslims in India then there are in Pakistan.

00:43:12.299 --> 00:43:13.569
Numerically.

00:43:13.569 --> 00:43:15.750
There are more Muslims in India than there
are in Bangladesh.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.750
Right?

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:21.059
In fact, there are more Muslims in South Asia
than the entire Middle East put together.

00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:25.119
If there are more Muslims in India than there
are in Pakistan, but India's not defined as

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:28.859
a Muslim majority country, because it's not,
then where does that leave the Muslims in

00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:30.210
India?

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.079
We need to be-- We need to stop defining it
just by religion.

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:37.970
India needs to cooperate with Pakistan on
an economic and geographic level, not on just

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.430
a religious level.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.430
That's my point.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.520
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Next question.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.550
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.619
Thank you so much for coming.

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:45.619
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Pleasure.

00:43:45.619 --> 00:43:47.380
&gt;&gt;Female #2: It's been absolutely fascinating.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:54.170
What I was really interested in was you talked
about the three different facets, I suppose,

00:43:54.170 --> 00:44:00.160
of Islamism, and how each of those builds
towards their goals.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.480
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: The methods, you mean.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480
Yeah?

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.819
&gt;&gt;Female #2: So, for example, the terrorist.

00:44:03.819 --> 00:44:04.819
Then you've got--

00:44:04.819 --> 00:44:05.819
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: The revolutionary and the political.

00:44:05.819 --> 00:44:06.819
Yeah.

00:44:06.819 --> 00:44:07.819
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Exactly.

00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:13.170
I completely understand that you draw a distinction
between what each of them does activity-wise.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:18.480
But I would say is that, the way I see it,
is that although you may not have been involved

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.230
in terrorism, you're still involved in the
incitement of a huge level of hatred, and

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:27.589
all the things that lead, in the end, to terrorism,
as you described in your time at college when

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:31.700
one of your supporters stabbed another pupil.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.740
I see you draw a distinction between their
activities.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:40.819
But what I was wondering was: do you, then,
draw a distinction between how we should deal

00:44:40.819 --> 00:44:47.599
with each of those three tenets of the building
towards Islam-- or sorry, towards Islamism?

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:51.430
And if you do see a distinction between how
we should be dealing with them, what do you

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.579
think is the most effective approach for each?

00:44:53.579 --> 00:45:00.670
Or are they all as inherent in creating that
hatred in each way-- I mean, do you believe

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:01.980
that they're all equally inherent in creating
that, or do you see some as less-- I don't

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:07.230
know, I guess more excusable than others?

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.599
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: That's a very good question.

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:13.859
Let me begin by saying I disagree with the
ideology per se.

00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:17.930
That means regardless of one's methodology,
whether you're political, revolutionary, or

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:18.930
military Islamist.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.430
I disagree with Islamism on a base level.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:26.400
I believe it's an intellectually flawed, a-history,
and un-Islamic ideology.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.769
Sorry for the hyperbole, but it's important
to make that point because I don't want anyone

00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:34.730
thinking that I have any level of sympathy
for the ideology.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.549
It's intellectually flawed, it's ahistory,
and it's un-Islamic.

00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:40.180
It's not the same as the religion of Islam.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:44.989
As for the distinctions within the ideology,
that happens even within communism.

00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:50.030
If anyone who knows their communist history,
Stalin killed Trotsky with an ice pick.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:53.920
Well, he sent his henchmen to kill Trotsky
with an ice pick in the South Americas.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.480
Because every ideology, every dogma-- If anyone
has seen the film Life of Brian, because it's

00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480
hilarious.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480
It's actually a great film.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.480
Monty Python's Life of Brian.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.839
They satirize this.

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:03.200
It's true.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.829
Every dogmatic cause will end up turning in
on itself.

00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:08.980
Islamism has the same.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:12.150
The political Islamists hate the terrorist.

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.539
And the terrorists hate the revolutionaries,
and likewise.

00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:16.720
They all hate each other because they're competing.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.670
They're competing, essentially, for the same
audience, which is the average Muslim.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:23.614
To convince the average Muslim that they have
their true salvation in their hands, and that

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:28.019
the methodology that they're adhering to is
the true way to go forward.

00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:32.359
Now, if you know that they're competing and
that they hate each other, as a strategist

00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:37.579
who is dealing on a government level with
policy responses, or as a civil society activist

00:46:37.579 --> 00:46:43.160
like we are with Khudi in Pakistan, who's
working on the grassroots to push back that

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:47.170
ideological narrative, you can exploit those
fault lines as weaknesses.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:52.539
And you can play their differences off against
each other to weaken them even more, to encourage

00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:58.370
that hatred, to encourage the level of disagreement
and sectarianism within Islamism so that the

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.279
average Muslim realizes that these guys can't
even get it right themselves.

00:47:01.279 --> 00:47:02.279
They're fighting each other.

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:03.279
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Do you think that happens?

00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:04.740
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Oh yeah, definitely, it does.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.740
Definitely.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.740
I've been involved in some of it.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.420
&gt;&gt;Female #2: They do work off of that?

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.420
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.420
They do.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.420
It's clever.

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.230
But you have to do it in a way that doesn't
legitimize the ideology itself, yeah?

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.180
That's important.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:20.440
For example, we've been involved in advising
governments, including the British government,

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:27.059
that ministers should not share platforms
with senior Islamists, even if they're nonviolent.

00:47:27.059 --> 00:47:32.390
Just like they would not share platforms with
racists, even if the racist was a nonviolent

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.500
person.

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.250
Because racism can also be nonviolent.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.359
But Islamism believes in homophobia, anti-Semitism.

00:47:38.359 --> 00:47:40.619
It believes in stoning people to death.

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:45.499
It believes in all sorts of human rights abuses,
anti women views.

00:47:45.499 --> 00:47:48.599
It's worse than racism in many respects.

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:53.319
Because white people are generally comfortable
with not cooperating with white racists, and

00:47:53.319 --> 00:47:56.799
they're uncomfortable with telling brown people
that there are elements of their views which

00:47:56.799 --> 00:48:00.099
are bigoted, because they don't want to be
painted as racist, and it's a form of reverse

00:48:00.099 --> 00:48:02.890
racism, because of course, our culture is
bigoted anyway.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.190
The more bigoted we are, the more authentic
we are.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:09.170
That sort of perverse reverse racism colonial
view needs to change and needs to stop.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.380
That's part of what we're involved in, trying
to challenge.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.609
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hizb ut-Tahrir isn't a prescribed
organization, is it?

00:48:14.609 --> 00:48:15.609
It's not illegal?

00:48:15.609 --> 00:48:18.210
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: This is the second aspect of the
relevance of your question, that we do need

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:23.150
to draw a distinction between values and where
we stand morally towards these groups and

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:24.410
the law.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.999
I would never endorse the BNP, for example,
but I would defend their right to exist as

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:31.609
a legal entity, as long as they're not violent.

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:36.460
The BNP is legal in Britain, as is Hizb ut-Tahrir,
and they should both remain legal because

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.789
they're nonviolent, even though they both
preach hatred.

00:48:38.789 --> 00:48:41.109
&gt;&gt;Female #2: This is what I wanted to get
at, actually.

00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:45.329
It's kind of like-- I understand that it's
legal, but it seems like the activities that

00:48:45.329 --> 00:48:50.670
you carried out when you were part of that
organization were as damaging, well, in my

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:57.579
mind, they're as damaging and they have as
much impact as the terrorist cells, and someone

00:48:57.579 --> 00:49:03.289
would have-- It might not be quite so obvious
upfront, but it seems to be just as negative.

00:49:03.289 --> 00:49:05.390
I mean, it's the same with the BNP here, like
their activities and what they do and what

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:06.640
they encourage is so negative that you create--

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.670
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Brevicks.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.240
&gt;&gt;Female #2: --an atmosphere of

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.489
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yeah, you create Anders Brevick,
in Norway.

00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:14.589
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah, and you create more violence.

00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:17.869
I mean, you may not be the one carrying out
the violence, but you're still creating a

00:49:17.869 --> 00:49:19.099
huge potential for it.

00:49:19.099 --> 00:49:23.640
It's not that it's legal to have these organizations,
but that's the crux of the matter, is, should

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.640
it?

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.069
I mean, it's a very complex question.

00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:33.200
But should it be, when you are part of an
organization that incites so much hatred and

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.809
can cause so much damage, should that be viewed
as legal?

00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:37.730
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: The question is: where do you draw
the line?

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:42.979
Currently, it's illegal in Britain to directly
incite violence, to directly incite it.

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:46.849
It's not illegal to incite extremist thought,
which is what the BNP and my former group

00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:47.849
do.

00:49:47.849 --> 00:49:50.599
I think the line has been drawn correct.

00:49:50.599 --> 00:49:51.780
I'm a fan of Orwell.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.270
I've read 1984.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.700
I think it's dangerous territory.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.519
I think Google believes this as well.

00:49:56.519 --> 00:49:59.099
It's dangerous territory if you start censoring
ideas.

00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:03.480
What you need to do instead is empower alternative
ideas.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.519
I think part of the problem in the Middle
East, and why the Arab uprisings happened,

00:50:06.519 --> 00:50:12.529
is because secular dictators were trying for
to long to shut down ideas and justify their

00:50:12.529 --> 00:50:16.489
own dictatorships by saying, "If you don't
support us, the extremists will come in power."

00:50:16.489 --> 00:50:18.039
We know what that leads to in the end.

00:50:18.039 --> 00:50:21.819
It leads to torture, it leads to oppression
and tyranny, and it leads to the Islamists

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:25.890
gaining credibility, because they're the only
credible opposition left, as a result.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.700
I think that the wiser course of action would
be to draw the line where British law currently

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:35.180
stands, and that's to say, "We won't tolerate
inciting, directly inciting violence, but

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:41.510
as for extremism, we would encourage and support
those civil society initiatives through industry,

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:46.720
technology, third sector organizations, that
try and build capacity to challenge extremism

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.770
within civil society.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:49.270
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you so much.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.270
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Thank you.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:51.270
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I think we're getting close to
the end.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:52.710
But time for one final question.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:53.710
Sir.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:57.589
&gt;&gt;Male #3: First of all, brilliant conversation.

00:50:57.589 --> 00:51:05.739
Appreciate it as a New Yorker that was in
New York at the time that-- This just tremendously

00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:06.739
insightful.

00:51:06.739 --> 00:51:07.739
I appreciate it.

00:51:07.739 --> 00:51:08.739
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Thank you.

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:13.630
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I wanted to get your feelings on
torture.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.299
Do you feel it actually brings out the truth?

00:51:16.299 --> 00:51:17.299
Is it demeaning?

00:51:17.299 --> 00:51:20.650
I would just love your insight on that.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:21.650
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Okay.

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:23.560
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It's a very hot topic in America.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.960
I'm sure it's worldwide.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.960
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Yeah.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.380
Can I borrow your book again?

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.380
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Sure.

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:35.729
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: In this book, being from New York,
there's a chapter that's called The Polemic.

00:51:35.729 --> 00:51:37.499
I encourage you to read it.

00:51:37.499 --> 00:51:43.849
But please read it and remember what I'm like
now, so you don't hate me, because The Polemic

00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:50.380
is simply my initial gut reaction to 9/11.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.690
As an Islamist, even though we weren't terrorists,
my emotions, of course, were still fully in

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.089
line, emotionally, with the cause and the
struggle.

00:51:58.089 --> 00:52:01.339
I had defined America as the "enemy".

00:52:01.339 --> 00:52:03.670
This chapter, The Polemic, begins-- It's chapter
16.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.729
I just wanted the chapter number.

00:52:05.729 --> 00:52:10.559
It begins with three pages of, essentially,
a polemic.

00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.559
It's a rant.

00:52:11.559 --> 00:52:15.170
But it's the rant I would have said when 9/11
happened at the time.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.640
It's how I would have felt.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:17.640
It's how I did feel.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:21.640
I remember feeling this, and I remember actually
preparing this type of a speech in my own

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640
mind.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640
So do read that.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:30.410
As for your question on torture, I suppose
there are a few things here that make me somewhat

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.410
biased.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.230
But hopefully in a good way.

00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:38.680
Being an Amnesty adopted prisoner of conscience,
being a victim of torture, and being a law

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.579
student who studied these issues from a legal
perspective, I could never endorse torture

00:52:43.579 --> 00:52:46.440
in any condition for any justification.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:52.380
The red herring of a ticking time bomb scenario
is often used as a-- What if you have someone

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.750
who definitely knows where a bomb's going
to go off, and unless you torture them, you

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.809
won't get the answer?

00:52:57.809 --> 00:53:03.349
Is, in the real world-- Essentially, when
it translates into the real world, is only

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:08.979
possible when you're in a courtroom and you've
got an agent who's accused of torturing somebody.

00:53:08.979 --> 00:53:11.349
His defense is "It was a ticking time bomb"
defense.

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:14.460
We're expected to believe him.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.450
And there's no guarantee that he's telling
the truth.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.450
He's a torturer.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:22.040
There's no guarantee that that's the real
reason that he was torturing somebody.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.729
In the real world, you don't know what's in
that person's head, and you don't know what's

00:53:24.729 --> 00:53:27.790
in the tortured person's head, which is why
legal checks exist.

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:29.569
It's to stop an abuse of power.

00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:31.960
Because of course, any abuse of power is justified.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:37.539
If I saw somebody about to murder my loved
ones in front of me, I would use serious and

00:53:37.539 --> 00:53:39.609
severe and sustained violence to stop them.

00:53:39.609 --> 00:53:43.759
But that doesn't mean I can justify that violence
in the courts of law.

00:53:43.759 --> 00:53:48.359
There's a difference between what's a personal
defense and a personal justification, and

00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:50.769
what must be put up to public scrutiny.

00:53:50.769 --> 00:53:55.329
I don't believe torture can ever be-- can
ever pass that public scrutiny test.

00:53:55.329 --> 00:54:01.069
In this book, the prologue begins with a conversation
I had with George Bush about this in his house

00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:02.140
in Texas.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:07.690
He was quite funny, actually, because he ended
up suiting that caricature that I am-- that

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:09.099
the people generally have of him.

00:54:09.099 --> 00:54:13.920
We were talking, and he said, "Tell me about
your story," and I said everything I've just

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920
said here today.

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.960
When I go up to the Egypt dungeon bit, and
I said, "We witnessed torture in Egypt", he

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.260
went, "Stop right there."

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:25.069
That's a very bad American accent, but forgive
me, I have to carry on with it, because it

00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:26.239
was so funny.

00:54:26.239 --> 00:54:29.970
I looked at him, I'm shocked why he stopped
me midway through a sentence when I used the

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:30.970
word "torture."

00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:35.069
He looked me right in the eye, and he said,
"How do you define torture?"

00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:37.940
Now, of course, this is George Bush who legalized
waterboarding.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.410
So obviously, you know what he's getting at.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.519
I thought, "What do I do here?

00:54:41.519 --> 00:54:42.950
Do I insult him in his own house?

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:44.470
How do I respond to that?"

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.039
It's in the prologue.

00:54:46.039 --> 00:54:48.220
The answer, you'd have to read the book to
find out what I said.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220
[laughter]

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.750
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Which is the perfect cue to say
that there are a few books available.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:55.000
I don't know if there's enough for everybody,
but it's first come, first serve here at the

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
front.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
We're out of time.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.200
Thank you so much, Maajid.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.200
&gt;&gt;Nawaz: Pleasure.

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.200
Thank you for having me.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:00.205
[applause] [applause fades] [more applause]
