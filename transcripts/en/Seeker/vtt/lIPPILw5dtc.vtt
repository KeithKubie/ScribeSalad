00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.090
it’s an age old question, ibuprofen or acetaminophen
What’s the difference?

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.349
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.840
I got a migraine recently and popped a few
ibuprofen and felt so much better, but that

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.189
made me wonder how do major pain relievers
actually reduce pain?

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.220
Well, there are special receptors in your
body that respond specifically to pain called

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.220
nociceptors.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.720
They protect us by responding to potentially
damaging stimuli like a burn or a cut and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.720
send a signal fast to the brain.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.360
Once your brain gets the signal, “OUCH THIS
HURTS” your body is already going to work

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.680
to heal the wound.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.720
Most injuries get hot and swollen, but this
is your body trying to protect itself, by

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.340
swelling, the body might prevent further injury
by immobilizing a joint or whatever and the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
heat might be the result of increased blood
flow or might cause increased blood flow which

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.690
means more healing immune cells get to the
point of injury.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.010
Another thing injured cells release is arachidonic
acid.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.980
Two enzymes, COX 1 and COX 2 react with this
acid to produce prostaglandins.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.580
These can create other chemicals which are
responsible for all that swelling, heat and

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.580
pain.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.080
And this seems to be the target mechanism
of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.930
like ibuprofen.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.030
Ibuprofen was discovered in the 1960s and
in 1983 was made available over the counter.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.040
It’s originally designed to be an anti-inflammatory
drug.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.870
It works by stopping the production of prostaglandins
by blocking one of the active sites of COX

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.100
1 and COX 2.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.830
When ibuprofen is in the active site, arachidonic
acid can’t fit so prostaglandins can’t

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.490
be made and thus the heat and pain-causing
swelling is reduced.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.630
Acetaminophen on the other hand, isn’t an
anti-inflammatory drug.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.670
How it works.. well gets a little complicated.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.200
It was first discovered in the late 1800s
and really didn’t reach the market until

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.170
1955 when it was marketed as Tylenol.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.360
And really, nobody's really sure how it works.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.790
I’m not kidding, there are a lot of ideas,
but nothing conclusive yet.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.120
In 2002, scientists in England discovered
another COX enzyme, and they labelled it COX

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120
3.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.600
This new enzyme can be found mostly in the
brain and it seems more sensitive to acetaminophen

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.660
than other anti pain medications.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.120
But unfortunately this only seemed true in
tests with other animals.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.520
Another idea is that acetaminophen works differently
on COX enzymes.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.530
They have two active sites, one that arachidonic
acid binds with and another, the peroxidase

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.340
site which leads to production of a tyrosine
radical.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.220
It’s this other active site that acetaminophen
might bind with, preventing the body from

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.490
making this compound, relieving some pain.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.490
h;afhjVDnk;’FVkn;FSbkn;DFSBK:afsHNO:DFSln’fsln’

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.850
Or another idea… and this one is my personal
favorite.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.920
Researchers from Lund University, in Sweden
think acetaminophen actually works on the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920
endocannabinoid system.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.490
If that word sounds a little familiar to you,
yes, it’s the system that respond to cannabis

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.490
or weed.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.400
But it’s also involved in a lot of different
processes like appetite, pain-sensation, mood,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400
and memory.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.990
So the researchers claim that acetaminophen
activates two ion channels in the brain and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.540
spinal cord and that these channels also respond
to certain cannabinoids.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.290
But the researchers caution that these channels
can actually trigger pain and itch responses,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.819
so it seems odd that activating them reduces
pain.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.480
But they might be on to something.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
Another study published in the European Journal
of Pharmacology shows that that blocking cannabinoid

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.900
receptor type 1 prevents acetaminophen from
relieving pain in mice.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.740
And there’s a few other ideas of how the
drug works, like maybe it works on serotonin

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.520
receptors, but who really knows right now.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.950
So even for a drug as old as acetaminophen…
it’s clear more research is needed.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.910
Alright guys, the question is, are you a fan
of ibuprofen or acetaminophen?

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.710
Does one work better for you than the other?

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.430
Let us know..
