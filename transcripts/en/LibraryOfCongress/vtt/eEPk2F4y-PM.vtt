&gt;&gt; Jill Garcia: Good morning.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.650
Welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.260
We are here to celebrate
reading books and authors.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.560
You guys ready?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.860
Yeah. All right.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.580
The Library of Congress makes
this easy to do this every year.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.710
But the truth is, the
National Book Festival is a

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.090
huge undertaking.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.630
And I guess it is
free for everyone

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.290
because of the generous support
of our sponsors and supporters.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.870
So a shout out to them.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.080

But let's get to what
you guys are here to see.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.550
I am pleased to introduce
Minh Le and Dan Santat,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.740
who collaborate together
to bring us a touching

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.120
and a delightful new picture
book, "Drawn Together,"

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.770
a story that explores
how a young boy

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.600
and his grandfather discover
the mutual love of art

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
and connect and bond over it.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.390
But first, let me tell you a
little bit about the authors.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.000
Writer Minh Le is a national
early childhood policy expert

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.350
and author of "Let Me Finish."

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.630
He has written for the New
York Times, the Horn Book,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.590
the Huffington Post,
among others.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.060
Le is a first-generation
Vietnamese-American

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.740
who loves spending
time with his family

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.400
in their home in Washington, DC.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.140
Dan Santat is the
author and illustrator

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.460
of the Caldecott Medal-winning
"The Adventures of Beekle,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.790
The Unimaginary Friend," as
well as "The Cookie Fiasco,"

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.070
"After the Fall,"
"Sidekicks" and others.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.900
He is also the creator

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.570
of Disney's animated hit
show The Replacements.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.730
He lives in Southern
California with his family

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.030
and a variety of pets.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.130
Just so you know, they're
going to be signing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.200
in line nine at 11:00.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.510
Please welcome Minh
Le and Dan Santat.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Woo, yeah.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.370
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Good morning.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.680
How's everybody doing today?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.260
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: I don't
know about you guys,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.520
but I was looking over at
the food show over there,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.630
and I'm like I cannot
wait to get some nachos.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.090
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: You want
me to go grab you some?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.390
I'll be right back.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.690
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: You know
what I also want to do?

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.560
I kind of just want to barrel
into that tower of cardboard.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.930
I don't know.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.230
That's the kid in me.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.240
Hey, listen, we have
a half hour,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.750
so we got to get
cracking on this.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.050
Let's hand it over to Minh,
who is the author of this book,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.970
of this fabulous fine book that
I had the honor of illustrating.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.270
So he'll read it to you.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.870
He'll talk about his thoughts,
and then he'll hand it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.620
over to me, and I'll just talk
about the goofy art process

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.420
that took place to
make the magic happen.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.290
Just so you know, we're
actually not human beings.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.850
We're actually animatronic
robots

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.870
that are powered by
your tax dollars.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.160
I'm just animatronic Abe
Lincoln like at Disneyland, so.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.600
Let's get this going.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.260
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: I'll try not to
kick out your plugin then.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.560
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: I know.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.860
I'm going to totally --

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.160
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So as Dan
said, I am the author,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.000
which means I wrote the
story and the words.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.860
But as you'll see, most of the
story is actually wordless.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.860
So it's a really amazing
treat to write a small text,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.530
hand it off to Dan,
and see like the magic

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.990
that he was able
to pull together.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.970
So as I said, we have
a little bit of time.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.790
So we're going to get started.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.170
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Going
to get cracking.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.470
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Right.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.770
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Line nine.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.070
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So this
story is about family.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.920
So it's inspired
by my grandfather,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.230
all my grandparents,
particularly my grandfather.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.710
I think Dan had a similar
experience with his grandmother.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.350
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: My grandmother,
the only grandparent I knew.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.880
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: And we both
spoke different language

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.390
or primary language
than our grandparents.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.480
Can I get people to raise their
hand if you have family members

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.560
who speak a different
language at home?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.860
That's amazing.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.160
Okay. So, yeah.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.560
Do you also speak
that language at home?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.420
If you do, please hold onto
it because I let it slip.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.040
And it's something I
regret all the time.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.340
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Terrible
grandson.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.760
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Yeah, I know.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.490
But I wouldn't be able to
write the book if I kept --

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.790
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Right.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.090
Because I was a terrible
grandson,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.390
I got to illustrate this book.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.850
So yay.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.160
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Terrible grandson
was the alternate title

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.320
for this book [inaudible].

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.450
Okay. So "Drawn Together" by us.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.970
Let's see if I can
get this to work.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.390
Okay. So the story begins.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.780
Actually, that is a
picture of my grandfather.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.850
Actually, I should
say our grandfather

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.250
because I'm pretty
sure about 30%

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.390
of the audience is
family members, so.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.470
But my grandfather
and Dan's grandmother.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.630
I wonder why I'm staying behind
here since we're mic'd up.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.560
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Let's
just be sure

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.540
to make sure people can hear us.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.990
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So the story begins

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.200
with a boy being dropped
off by his mother.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.670
And he goes up, and
he rings the doorbell.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.190
And his grandfather answers.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.720
And how does his grandfather
look when he opens the door?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.390
He's like super happy, right.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.690
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Oh my God!

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.990
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: And they
greet each other.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.810
And the grandfather
waves goodbye to the mom

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.230
as she drives off and
invites the boy inside.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.140
Now how does the boy look
when he goes inside the house?

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.880
He's a little bit unsure, right.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.770
So they sit down to
this wonderful mean.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.390
And the grandfather makes
himself this delicious bowl

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.690
of soup.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.230
And because he's a very
considerate grandfather

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.340
and wants his grandson
to eat something,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.280
he makes him a hotdog.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.230
But also because he's a
responsible grandfather,

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.400
he adds a side salad
because, I mean,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.680
you have to get the greens too.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.020
Before we move on, quick,
I want to ask real quick.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.910
If you were having this
dinner, raise your hand

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.300
if you would go for soup.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.600
Okay. Me too.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.020
Raise your hand if
you'd go for a hotdog.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.460
Okay. Raise your hand
if you'd go for both.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.100
Okay. Just the side salad.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.670
Yes.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.930
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: I have some
summer weight to work off.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.820
I'd just be the salad, just dry.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.050
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So they
sit down for dinner,

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.430
and they to have a conversation.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.430
And the boy asks, so,
what's new, grandpa.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.970
And the grandpa asks
a question in Tia.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.270
But that's as far
as they can get.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.950
They can't quite
understand each other,

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.370
so they continue
eating in silence.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.270
So afterwards, they go
and sit and watch a movie.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.590
and the grandfather looks

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.720
over to make sure
the grandson's okay.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.380
It looks like a super
exciting movie to me.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.470
But also, the movie is in Tia.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.040
So the grandson asks, can
we watch something else.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.320
And the grandfather
asks a question too.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.100
But again, that's as
far as they can get.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.580
They can't quite connect.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.780
So they continue watching.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.110
The boy's not too
psyched about that.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.750
And the grandfather gives
a little bit of a side eye.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.580
But the movie continued.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.240
Then eventually, the boy
is like you know what.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.980
I don't understand
what's going on.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.280
He's done.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.610
He walks off, and he
goes and grabs his bag.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.340
And he pulls out some
paper and some markers.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.810
Then the grandfather comes over
and peeks over his shoulder

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.330
and sees that the boy
is drawing a picture

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.730
of himself as a wizard.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.520
How has that made
the grandfather feel?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.910
He gets like super
excited, right.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.350
So he runs off to his room
or goes as fast as he can.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.560
I'm not sure if he's
actually running.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.600
So he runs off and comes back

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:29.470
with his own sketchpad
and paint and brush.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.690
So right when I gave
up on talking,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.660
my grandfather surprised me by
revealing a world beyond words.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.780
And in a flash, we see each
other for the first time.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.280
And there, you see
the boy as a wizard

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.120
and the grandfather
paints a picture of himself

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.330
as a Tia warrior
from his childhood.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.610
Now all the things we could
never say come pouring out.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.780
And we build a new world that
even words can't describe.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.290
I was going to let that
sit a second cause Dan's

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.590
art [inaudible].

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.310
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: When he
gave me the manuscript

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.720
and it said build a world
that words can even describe,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.510
I just thought, wow, this is
going to be quite the challenge.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:25.220
[ Laughter ]

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.890
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: But just when
we're closer than ever,

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:35.580
[inaudible] right now, that old
distance comes roaring back.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.880
So they were super close.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.780
All of a sudden, they find
themselves on opposite sides.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.460
And if you look closely, what
do you see on the boy's side?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.190
The grandfather's staff, right.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.660
And on the other side by the
grandfather is the boy's wand.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.050
So the grandfather looks
over and his grabs the wand

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.470
and he points it
very dramatically.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.460
And the boy looks down.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.500
He grabs the grandfather's
staff.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.460
Says but this time, I'm
not afraid because I know

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:11.630
that together, we can
make our way across.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.960
And does anyone know what
happened to the dragon?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.800
Does anyone see the
dragon anywhere?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.100
Right, the bridge.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.400
So he took them.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.700
They faced that dragon, and
they turned it into a bridge,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.000
and now they're running
across it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.190
And so, now, after years of
searching for the right words,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.490
we find ourselves
happily speechless.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.510
The grandfather and the grandson
come together and whereas

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.730
in the beginning, they didn't
know how to communicate,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.070
they couldn't connect,
now, through their artwork,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.420
they've found that common ground
and they finally feel one.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.110
But then it's time to go home.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.710
And the mother comes back,
and everyone's happy.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.620
The grandfather and mother hug.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.850
The boy looks very
content in the car.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.240
And as they wave goodbye, what
do you see the boy holding?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.330
The boy is holding one of
his grandfather's brushes,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.860
and the grandfather is
holding one of the markers.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.490
So they traded, and
then they wave goodbye.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.010
So that is our story.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.310
Thank you so much.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.510
I hope you enjoyed.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.870
[ Applause ]

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.260
But before I hand it off to Dan,

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.420
I did need one volunteer
from the group.

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.010
Let me see.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.490
I'm going to have to choose.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:39.400
Actually, is there someone
named Abby in this crowd?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.810
Where's Abby?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.430
Come, come up.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.490
Abby and I go way back.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.280
We've like been to
a whole bunch of --

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.790
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Nepotism.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.050
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So I'm
going to ask Abby.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.610
Okay. There's a secret
about this book.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.760
Who wants to know the secret
of this book, raise your hand?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.520
Okay. If you don't want to know
the secret, then close your eyes

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.230
and cover your ears because
we're about to reveal.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.680
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: You can leave.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.980
Good day.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.280
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Abby, can
you do me the favor

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.580
of taking off the cover

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.880
and showing people
what's underneath?

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.820
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Awe.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.120
Thank you, Abby.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.420
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Thank you.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.720
Thank you.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.020
Can everyone give Abby --

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.320
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Big
hand for Abby.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.620
Yay.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.920
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: So as you can see,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.340
underneath the book is the
sketchbook like the one

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.110
that the grandfather had,
which is a very nice detail

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.250
that Dan came up with I believe.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.550
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Yeah.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.040
So, you know, before
I do my little thing,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.760
do you have like a cute,
little story that you can share

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.370
about your grandfather and you?

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.670
Like, do you have a story?

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.250
I have one about my grandmother.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.550
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Then you go first.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.850
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Okay.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.390
So my grandmother, you know,
and I, our thing was food.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.050
She always wanted to
feed me like crazy.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.670
And so, that was the thing
that we had in common.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.570
But her English was
very limited.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.940
But what she heard was like bits
and pieces that she would hear

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.020
that just actually kind
of carried to Thailand.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.800
But then people in Thailand
would say these things,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.060
and they didn't understand
what they were saying.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.700
So I remember doing
yard work one day.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.000
I was doing yard work.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.700
And then when I was done
like putting all the leaves

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.510
in the trashcan, I hear
my grandmother saying,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.810
okay, cigarette.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.410
And I looked at her, I
was like what, like what.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.010
And she just smiled
just really cute.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.310
She's like, okay, cigarette.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.320
And I said, what,
what does that mean.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.620
And my mom was laughing.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.840
And she said, so in Thailand,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.790
when construction workers
are working and they're done

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.490
for the day, they take out
their cigarettes and they smoke,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.790
and they say, okay, cigarette.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.570
And then that's how they do it.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.600
So my grandmother, my sweet,
sweet grandmother who wanted

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.930
to tell me that I was
done raking leaves.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.230
She looked at me.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.530
She said, okay, cigarette.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:13:00.060
And that's my story
about my grandmother.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.350
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: But just for the
record, cigarettes are not okay.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.950
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Cigarettes
are the devil.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:09.830
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: I don't have a funny
story off the top of my head.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.950
But I will say that a lot

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.310
of people have asked me
what my grandfather thinks

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:19.000
about this book, if you
don't mind getting emotional

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.300
for a second.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.880
So I actually never told my
grandfather what this book

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.180
was about.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.340
And he ended up passing
away just

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.180
like the year before
the book came out.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.250
But I never talked
to him about it

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.160
because like those earlier
scenes where the grandfather

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.200
and the grandson are sitting
there quietly next to each other

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.500
and not knowing how to talk,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.800
that's straight out
of my childhood.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.870
Like, I loved my grandfather.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.170
Oh, man. I know that
he loved me.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.260
But he was a man of very few
words, and I'm an introvert.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.240
So we just kind of sit
there next to each other

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.370
on the couch, look
at each other.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.670
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Like this is fun.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.970
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Yeah.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.100
So while I was never able
to tell him about the book,

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.620
it means the world to me
that it is a book for him

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.400
and all my grandparents,
that they have a spot

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.300
on the shelf now, and that
my hope is that if even

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.210
like one person out there can
like read this book and want

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.960
to connect with someone
in their lives and do

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.230
so before it's too late,
then that would be great.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.430
So please, go tell the people
that you love you love them,

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.880
and go give them a hug for me.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.300
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Right, right.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.600
Okay, so.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.900
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: I mean, do
that without crying.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.200
I think that was good --

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.500
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Really, have you?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:36.040
I was going to unload,
just -- Fish sandwich.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.700
Okay. Fantastic.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:43.190
So I'm going to share a little
bit about the art process

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.820
because I'm an artiste and
that's what I do for a living.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.810
So I actually taught
myself how to draw.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.690
I went to the local library.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.430
My library, they had all
these books and how to draw,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.680
because my parents, they
didn't let me take art classes

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.180
because they wanted me to
grow up and be a doctor.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.110
But I said I'll show you.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.410
I'm going to go to the library.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.710
I'm going to check
out this book.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.010
This book is still
in publication,

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.310
"How to Draw Comics
the Marvel Way."

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.550
I read this thing
cover to cover.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.430
You know, it was my bible.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.900
It was my favorite thing.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.280
For any of you out there who
are interested in drawing

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.630
and being artists, all
I have to tell you is

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.780
that it's not something
you're born with.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.590
You're not just born with
the gifted talent of drawing.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.920
It's like riding a bicycle.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.450
And if you recall, when
you were a little baby,

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.460
you weren't a baby
riding a bicycle.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.820
Like you had to get
on the bicycle

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.390
and like I practice pedaling
and learning how to balance.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.750
And that's how you learned
how to ride a bicycle.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.050
Same thing with drawing.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.500
You just practice and
practice until you get better.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.410
It's like pretending
you're Michael Jordan

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.550
on the basketball
court, shooting hoops

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.200
at three seconds
left on the clock.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.500
You miss nine of them.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.800
But eventually, that
tenth one goes in.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.140
You go, I won the game.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.350
So I would copy pictures
of Garfield.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.660
I drew this.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.400
If you're inquiring, the medium
is paper with Crayola crayon.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.970
I drew this when I
was six years old.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.650
And what you guys don't
see are the tons of ugly,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.430
melted faced Garfields that I
was trying to draw before that.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.810
Like it takes lots
and lots of practice.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.330
And as I got older, I just
kept challenging myself more

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.630
and more.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.070
And one of my favorite rituals
was to sit down in front

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.940
of the TV on Friday
nights at 8:00 PM in front

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.240
of the Dukes of Hazard.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.420
And I would take -- Yeah.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.300
Let's cheer for these guys with
a confederate flag on the roof.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.040
And I would sit there with
a cover, and I would try

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.340
to copy it line for line.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.640
I wouldn't trace over it.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.940
I would try to look at it, and I
would try to draw it on a piece

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.800
of paper as best as I could.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.020
Now this is an example of one

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.510
of the most challenging
things I ever did.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.950
And I'm telling you this
story because I want you

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.360
to understand that, you know,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.310
like with enough
practice, you can do it.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.870
Now I remember this
took so long.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.420
I was drawing, and then
the Dukes of Hazard ended.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.030
And then 9:00 o'clock came
around, and my mom came

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.930
and sat down to watch Dallas.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.370
And I was still drawing,

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.950
and Dallas was going
on in the background.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.170
And then an hour
later, my mom gets up.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.470
Dallas is done.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.770
She leaves the room.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.070
And I'm still working
on the Hulk.

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.180
And then Falcon crest came on.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.210
And I'm still drawing the Hulk.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.760
And then 11:00 o'clock
came around.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.260
Falcon Crest was done.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.900
And lo and behold, I was
finally done with this drawing.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.220
And it was that day
I learned two things.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.170
One, I can draw anything
if I put my mind to it.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.630
And two, I love Falcon Crest.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.520
Now to this day, I still sketch.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.730
I still sketch pictures
of things that I like.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.830
Now these are examples
of famous superheroes

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.220
that you might recognize
from all the movies.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.410
Now I don't draw superheroes
the way they look on a screen.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.610
I like to draw superheroes
my way.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.250
So, you know, that group
may not look like the group

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.290
in the movie, but it's my group.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.140
And I encourage all of you
guys to express yourself openly

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.970
and do things your way because
that's how we really diversify

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.710
things and mix things
up and have some fun.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.160
Now, speaking of fun, I
do artwork traditionally.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.440
I can use a pencil, a pen,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.950
paintbrush, watercolors,
acrylic.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.410
But I really work most
of my time on a computer.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.810
I have an iMac at home.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.480
So half the screen is
dedicated towards Netflix.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.670
And the other half of the screen
is dedicated for Photoshop.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.700
And I use this wonderful
device known as a Wacom tablet.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.200
It's a digital pen and template.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.440
And so, whatever I draw
on that surface shows

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.740
up on the computer screen.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.040
It's a very, very powerful tool.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.430
Now I'll give you an example
of how powerful Photoshop is.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.780
Let's take the Crate
and Barrel catalog.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.870
Oh, hoy. So you kids,
at your young age,

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.500
you're all about
reading Ranger Rick

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.870
and Highlights and
things like that.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.650
But when you get to my age,

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.800
it's all about the Crate
and Barrel catalog.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.640
The fall catalog's coming out.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.200
Just pumpkin spice everything
is going to come out.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.590
It's exciting.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.580
Now let's take this wonderful,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.240
new four in one Weber
Grill system.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.540
now I'm a busy man.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.890
I don't have time to get into a
car and drive down in my Prius

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.190
because that's all
we drive in LA.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.600
I don't have time to get in my
Prius and drive down to a Crate

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.800
and Barrel and find this
barbecue grill and test it

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.100
out to see if I like it.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:36.020
No. But with the power of a
computer, boop, there I am,

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:43.160
with the power of Photoshop
enjoying a quinoa burger

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.750
with that man because I
live in Southern California.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.050
Now here's another one.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.530
Here's a fine dining set.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.760
Here's a fine hipsterish-looking
kitchen.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.060
Again, I'm a busy man.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.350
I can't get in my Prius and
drive down to a Crate and Barrel

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.880
and see if I can pretend eating
eggs here if like this set.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.260
No. But with the
power of a computer,

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.650
there I am pointing at oranges.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.690
I don't eat them because
they're high in sugar.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:19.470
Now here we have a spread
from "Drawn Together."

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.620
Now a lot of the
influence in the work is

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.290
from the motherland
known as Thailand.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.590
And I incorporated a lot of
traditional art that you find

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.070
in that country,
most of it coming

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.620
from the Buddhist
temples and so forth.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.160
Like maybe up to the early 2000,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.000
you didn't really
see a whole lot

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.250
of pop culture things
coming out of Thailand.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.340
A lot of it was dedicated
to the temples and churches.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.570
So here, we have a
picture of what would be

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.760
like a guardian at
a Buddhist temple.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.680
And that's what inspired
the grandfather's outfit.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.620
Although my culture loves
to be really ornate,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.540
that's something
darling about them,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.930
especially when you're sitting
there drawing every scale.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.010
Speaking of scales,
here is a dragon.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.070
This is a wonderful -- Like
that's real gold, folks.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.260
Like they don't skimp
on the gold.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.560
And for this project,
I took a brush pen,

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.150
and I actually drew all
these shapes and characters.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.360
And then I would
put those elements

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.850
and I would put it
on a computer.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.380
And I'm going to show you the
magic of how I made this spread

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.780
where the grandfather
and grandson face-off.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.270
So here's an example of layers.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.870
It's like drawing on
different layers of paper

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.270
that you can place
on top of each other.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:48.300
And so, a piece like this will
take me about a day or two.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.580
I've managed to work
fairly quickly.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.420
But this book, the illustrations
varied from piece to piece.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.650
Some pieces would take a day.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.650
Other pieces would
take seven, eight days.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.090
I really broke out of my
habit of how I usually work.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.770
So honestly, a piece
wouldn't be finished

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.440
until I felt like it was right.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.360
And it was really kind of
scary in experiencing it

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.440
because usually, I know
what the end product's going

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.740
to look like.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.790
And in this case, it was
completely different.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.260
It really broke me
out of my mold.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.660
And honestly, this is the first
time I've ever gotten a book

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.990
manuscript that helped
me evolve as an artist.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.740
And I thought it was fantastic.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.370
So that's the final piece.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.830
That took about two days.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.560
I think we have like
five minutes left.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.860
Would you --

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.160
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Actually,
we've got two minutes.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.460
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: We
have two minutes left.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.840
Do we want to do a quick
drawing demonstration,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.600
or do you guys want to
answer some questions?

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.900
Okay. All right.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.880
Well, good thing I
have a second mic.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.730
I'm going to come over here,
and I'm going to ask you guys --

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.030
I'm going to show you,
you can draw anything

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.340
with three basic shapes.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.640
The first shape is a circle.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.400
I have just drawn you a ball.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.760
Ooh. Now, if I draw another
circle on that, uh oh,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.730
I have just made the death star.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:16.500
Ooh. Now, if I draw
you a triangle,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.330
I have just made
you a gnome hat.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.960
Ooh. Now if I add
another line to that,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.180
I've just made you a
slice of cheese pizza.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.320
Now, if I add circles
to it, uh oh,

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.190
now I have just drawn you
a slice of pepperoni pizza.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:40.700
Ooh. Now, the third and
final shape is the square.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.450
Now, I have just
drawn you a box.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.790
Yay. Or if you really
want to get imaginative.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.940
I have just drawn you the
State of Colorado, ooh,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.240
or you could look at this

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.040
and say it's a slice
of cheddar cheese.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.880
But if I add circles to it, oh,
now we have made Swiss cheese.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.160
That's my Swiss accent.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:15.120
But if I take this Swiss
cheese and I add two eyes

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:21.060
and some eyelashes
and a nose and a mouth

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:26.360
and two square teeth, I just
made SpongeBob SquarePants.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.380
Ooh. Now, I'm going
to do one last thing,

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.160
and then we're going
to go off and sign.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.340
We're going to draw
an author, okay.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.640
So I need your help.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.870
What shape is an author's head?

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.490
circle. What shape
are an author's eyes?

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:51.510
Okay. What shape are
an author's pupils?

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.490
Circles. Drawing is
easy, Mr. Santat.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.700
What shape are an author's ears?

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.000
Semicircles.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.300
Two points to Gryffindor.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.470
What shape is an author's nose?

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:08.910
Triangle.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.970
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Is this is triangle?

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.700
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: What shape
are an author's eyebrows,

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.000
these big things?

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.970
I'm hearing a lot
of -- It's just --

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:33.780
No is the author happy to be
here, or is he sad to be here?

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.080
I'll be honest with you, folks.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.460
I am completely indifferent.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.760
I'm Dan Santat.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.840
This is Minh Le, the cast
members of Crazy Rich Asians.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.510
Thank you.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.810
&gt;&gt; Minh Le: Thank you, all.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.110
&gt;&gt; Dan Santat: Thank you.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.410
Thank you.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.130
Curtsey powered by your love.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.430
Thank you.
