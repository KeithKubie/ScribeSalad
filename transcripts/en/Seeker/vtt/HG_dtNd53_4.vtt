00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.010
Sometimes after a hard day at work I grab
a foamy beer and think.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.460
Why dis all foamy?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.520
C'mon scientists.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.350
Luckily, Stanford is on the case!

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.610
Hey there everyone, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.970
Researchers at Stanford University have been
playing with bubbles, which is a sentence

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.710
I can’t believe I get to say.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.430
They’ve found a way to stop the colorful
swirling patterns you see on the surface of

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.070
a bubble -- they're called eddies.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.540
The colors in those eddies actually correspond
to the thickness at that point in the bubble,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.350
and they swirl because of something called
the Marangoni Effect -- which is when molecules

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.899
that aren’t that attracted to each other
in one part of the bubble rush off to areas

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:39.899
where they’re more wanted.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.129
It has to do with the tendency of fluids to
move to areas of higher surface tension.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.859
You probably remember surface tension from
middle school science; it's why water can

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.960
fill just a LITTLE above the top of the glass.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.140
Under the surface water molecules are attracted
to all the other water molecules around them,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.460
but the ones on the surface have nothing above
them so they cohere (or stick) to their neighbors

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.640
more strongly.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.879
This creates the phenomenon of surface tension.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.600
Incidentally, they don’t do it as well when
they’re hot, which is why hot water is better

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.610
for washing: the water spreads around easier
and you literally get wetter.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.700
But that's neither here nor there.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.420
If you really want to mess up the balance you can
throw some soap into it.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.420
Soap molecules are kind of shaped like match
sticks, they have a head that is all about

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.520
water and a tail that takes to water like
a cat.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.930
If you plop a drop of soap into the middle
of these tense molecules, chaos breaks out.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.140
The soap molecule totally wrecks that surface
tension.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.479
Molecules that do this are called surfactants.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.420
When a surfactant breaks the surface tension
in one area, they’ve created a surface tension

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.420
gradient.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.219
Essentially, water in the low tension area
is pulled on by water in the high tension

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.219
areas.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.619
This is called the Marangoni
effect.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.670
And again, is why the colors swirl around
bubbles.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.079
The most visible experiment demonstrating
the Marangoni effect that you can do at home

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.600
involves milk, food coloring, and a drop of
soap.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.909
Place a couple drops of the food coloring
of your choice in the middle of a bowl of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:02.909
milk.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.609
Plop one drop of soap in and then WOOSH!

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:06.850
Marangoni effect.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.080
Again, what's happening is when the water
repelling tail of that soapy surfactant finds

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.760
the surface, it prevents the water molecules
from grouping, and sticks its tail in the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.900
air instead.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.880
Without a mass of water molecules at the surface,
we get less surface tension.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.909
And these experiments are just for
kids either, the Marangoni effect can have

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.560
real world applications…

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.560
Or so the Stanford scientists tell us.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.110
When they messed with the Marangoni effect,
they found they could stabilize these colorful

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.440
eddies on the bubble's surface.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.320
They created a bubble under the
water and raised it slowly through the surface

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.590
tension to manage the amount of Marangoni
effect.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.060
Once everything stabilized, they could raise
it a little more, and then a little more!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.909
When one colorful eddy would run into another,
they would create a boundary and lock into

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:51.909
place.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.150
No more swirling colors!

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.450
But more importantly, they've created a more
stable bubble!

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.750
And this research does have a practical purpose!

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.480
The scientists studying this are experimenting
with ways to separate crude oil from water,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.680
or how to rid drug formulations of unwanted
bubbles.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.900
Most importantly of all, they’re studying
how the structure of bubbles affects the quality

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.300
of beer foam.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.830
Listen scientists if you could make a cold
one that doesn’t foam over when I set my

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.230
bottle down a little too fast, you can play
with all the bubbles you like.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.349
Speaking of cold ones, here at DNews, we’ve
learned that it’s hard to make videos every

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.489
day of the week, let alone doing it for 10
years!

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.849
That’s why we want to raise a cold one to
congratulate Philip DeFranco on his 10 year

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.530
YouTube anniversary!

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.299
If you haven’t already, head on over to
his channel and send him some love!

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.849
The guy really deserves it! 10 YEARS!

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.650
So if hot water makes your hands wetter, do
you still need to use soap?

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.680
Yeah, totally.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.910
I explain why in this video here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.480
Did you do any other science experiments  as a kid that you wanna know the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.220
super complex explanation of? Let us know in the comments and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
make sure you keep coming back for more DNews!
