00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.740
Let's define
ourselves some sets.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.530
So let's say the set A is
composed of the numbers 1.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.510
3.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.880
5, 7, and 18.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.980
Let's say that
the set B-- let me

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.640
do this in a different
color-- let's

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.010
say that the set B is
composed of 1, 7, and 18.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:38.522
And let's say that the set C is
composed of 18, 7, 1, and 19.

00:00:38.522 --> 00:00:40.730
Now what I want to start
thinking about in this video

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.950
is the notion of a subset.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.752
So the first question
is, is B a subset of A?

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:50.960
And there you might say,
well, what does subset mean?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.590
Well, you're a subset if
every member of your set

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.410
is also a member
of the other set.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.976
So we actually can write
that B is a subset--

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:03.600
and this is a notation
right over here,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.647
this is a subset-- B is a
subset of A. B is a subset.

00:01:08.647 --> 00:01:09.730
So let me write that down.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:19.260
B is subset of A. Every
element in B is a member of A.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.040
Now we can go even further.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.950
We can say that B is
a strict subset of A,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.830
because B is a subset
of A, but it does not

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.850
equal A, which means that there
are things in A that are not

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.680
in B. So we could
even go further

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.750
and we could say
that B is a strict

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.245
or sometimes said a
proper subset of A.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:39.690
And the way you do that
is, you could almost

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.380
imagine that this is kind of
a less than or equal sign,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.590
and then you kind of
cross out this equal part

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.080
of the less than or equal sign.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.440
So this means a
strict subset, which

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.770
means everything that
is in B is a member A,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.060
but everything that's in
A is not a member of B.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.050
So let me write this.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.920
This is B. B is a
strict or proper subset.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.475
So, for example, we can write
that A is a subset of A.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.350
In fact, every set is
a subset of itself,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.330
because every one of its
members is a member of A.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.480
We cannot write that A
is a strict subset of A.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.310
This right over here is false.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.250
So let's give ourselves a
little bit more practice.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.082
Can we write that
B is a subset of C?

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.305
Well, let's see.

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:45.320
C contains a 1, it contains
a 7, it contains an 18.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.940
So every member of
B is indeed a member

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.640
C. So this right
over here is true.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.380
Now, can we write
that C is a subset?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.665
Can we write that
C is a subset of A?

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:04.490
Can we write C is a subset of A?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.700
Let's see.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.940
Every element of C needs
to be in A. So A has an 18,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940
it has a 7, it has a 1.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.910
But it does not have a 19.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.196
So once again, this
right over here is false.

00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:21.570
Now we could have
also added-- we

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.710
could write B is a subset
of C. Or we could even

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.260
write that B is a
strict subset of C.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.145
Now, we could also reverse
the way we write this.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.270
And then we're really just
talking about supersets.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.110
So we could reverse
this notation,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.015
and we could say that
A is a superset of B,

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:45.640
and this is just another way of
saying that B is a subset of A.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.400
But the way you could
think about this is,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.570
A contains every
element that is in B.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.100
And it might contain more.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.970
It might contain
exactly every element.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.452
So you can kind of view
this as you kind of

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:00.660
have the equals symbol there.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.870
If you were to view this
as greater than or equal.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.837
They're note quite
exactly the same thing.

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:06.420
But we know already
that we could also

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.320
write that A is a strict
superset of B, which

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.140
means that A contains
everything B has and then some.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.690
A is not equivalent to B. So
hopefully this familiarizes you

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:31.130
with the notions of subsets and
supersets and strict subsets.
