00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.510
- [Instructor] Let's give ourselves

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.060
a little bit more food for thought

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.700
on this labor versus capital question.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.010
So like we've mentioned many times,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.170
in order to produce anything,

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.370
you need a little bit of both

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.980
or you maybe need a lot of both.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.980
You need labor,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.813
and,

00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:18.820
and you need capital.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.640
The question is as you
produce that output,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.130
as you produce that output,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.010
or I guess you could say

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.010
as you produce this
aggregate, this product,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.190
how do you decide how
much of it goes to labor

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.900
and how much of it goes to capital?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.040
Well, one way to think about it

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.000
is which resource has more leverage?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.690
If you go back to the Gilded Age,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.760
Gilded Age,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.060
really the peak of Industrial Revolution,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.460
the people who had most of the leverage

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.570
were the owners of capital,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.410
the growth industries,
as we've said before.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.520
These were railroads,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.230
these were manufacturing plants,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.810
these were people
exploring and finding oil.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.550
And so capital had all the leverage.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.880
That the labor, most of
the labor that was involved

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.140
was fairly unskilled and was
viewed by the owners of capital

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510
as something of a commodity.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.860
And so more and more of
the outcome or the income

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.750
could go to the capital.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.740
Now, Piketty

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.120
at least hints that, hey,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.080
maybe we're going to a second Gilded Age

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.590
because returns on capital are going

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.780
to be larger than growth,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.630
and more and more wealth is
going to be going to that.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.130
But to do a thought
experiment, once again,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.950
this'll give you food for thought,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.440
and you come up with your own conclusions.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.960
Let's think about the
world that we now live in.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.230
And I'll give Silicon Valley as an example

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.040
because one could argue
that Silicon Valley

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.070
is maybe most indicative
of what 21st century,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.380
what the 21st century
economy is going to look like

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.070
and what 21st century industry
is going to look like.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.430
So, let's compare the Gilded Age,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.997
to Silicon Valley,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.910
home of folks like Google
and Facebook and Apple.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.900
Well, Silicon Valley is
it about about capital

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.720
or is it about labor?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.220
Well, the industries in Silicon Valley,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.690
they're about creating technology,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.930
they're about creating software.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.840
Software, in particular,
requires very little capital.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.310
You don't need large, a billion
dollar manufacturing plants.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.710
You don't need a ton of land.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.294
You literally can write
software in your bedroom.

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:16.300
You could do it in your closet.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.830
That's how I started.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.400
And so Silicon Valley is
really much more about labor.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.850
That's not labor,

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.780
you know, when you think of labor

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.550
in the Gilded Age Industrial Revolution,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.030
you're thinking about someone
just working on a factory line

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.560
or doing a repetitive
job over and over again.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.550
While in Silicon Valley,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.450
it's much more about highly skilled labor.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.820
So let me write that in that blue color.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.823
Highly,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.580
highly skilled,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.580
highly skilled labor.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700
And it's definitely the
case in Silicon Valley

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.816
that highly skilled labor
is viewed as a much,

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:54.910
a much stronger differentiator
for an organization

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.030
or an individual than capital.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.490
In fact, the dynamics that
you're seeing more and more

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.930
in Silicon Valley is lots
and lots and lots of capital,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.070
which is oftentimes
perceived as a commodity

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.380
pursuing a team of five people who've just

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.040
put something together
in the last few months,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.370
and they're valuing it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.790
at 10 million dollars
or 50 million dollars.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.340
We see organizations like
Facebook and WhatsApp

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.030
getting multibillion
dollar valuations based on,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300
really the output of highly skilled labor.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.220
Capital, there's some capital necessary.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.852
You need office space, you need servers.

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:28.860
But it's not like the Gilded Age.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.330
Most of the value is

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.020
in the part that's not
considered a commodity.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.663
Office space is a commodity.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.400
Servers are a commodity.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.360
Highly skilled labor is not a commodity.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.140
So, the question to ask yourself is:

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.660
Well, is this the case?

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.770
And is the case, will capital,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.410
will R be able to stay larger than G?

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.740
And will more and more capital,
more income go to capital?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.830
Or maybe does it go more and
more to highly skilled labor?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.180
Now, the other question you need to,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.890
or the other question that
may be going in your mind,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.130
is well hey look, Silicon Valley
isn't just about software,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.190
it's also about hardware.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.080
One of the most highly
successful companies

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.120
in Silicon Valley is Apple Computers,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.190
and they do write software,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.200
but they're known for
their hardware products.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.150
Their iPhone, the iPad, their computers.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.260
What about that industry?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.420
Isn't that capital intensive?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.480
Well, let's just think about

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.290
how your iPhone or your
iPad gets developed.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.840
It gets designed by Apple
in Cupertino, California,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.160
and that's what they write on their boxes,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.100
designed in California.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.891
And then they send the designs over

00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.540
to a bunch of firms.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.630
This is just some of
Apple's suppliers here.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.620
And these are incredibly
capital intensive industries.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.090
But from Apple's point of view,
they view them more or less,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.710
not all of them, some of them
have differentiated products,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.980
they make a special type of
material or whatever else.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.850
But many of them are viewed
as commodity manufacturers.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.660
That, hey, you don't
give me the right price,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.210
you're not giving me the right
few pennies per component,

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.410
I'm going to go to the other person

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.920
who can produce that same entity.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.580
And then these folks put it all together,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900
manufacture the pieces,
send it back to Apple,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.081
who'll package it,

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.100
and then market it.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.370
And so, what is the high value aspect

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.600
of this supply chain right over here?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.260
Well, it's clearly the
design and the marketing.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.160
And if you don't believe that,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.700
you should look at what portion

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.460
of the output of the income
generated by an iPhone,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.909
what portion of it goes to Apple

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.590
versus what portion of it goes

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.810
to the suppliers right over here.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.446
So, one way to think about it
is these are kind of closer

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:43.446
to the large scale capital
intensive manufacturing plants

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.940
of the Gilded Age.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.360
Although, even here, R and
D plays a major component,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.420
it did in the Gilded Age as well.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.624
And once again, R and
D though, is a labor,

00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:54.670
is a highly skilled labor.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.210
It is less about, there's
capital definitely involved,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.640
but when you look at
the real value created,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.260
it's really on the highly
skilled labor part,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.950
on the designing and the marketing side,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.520
the creative aspects of it.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.620
Now, just this, if you believe it,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.300
and you should come to
your own judgements.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.670
This by itself doesn't say that

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.610
we can't worry about inequality

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.850
because even this might say,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.960
look, more and more income,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.660
maybe it's not gonna go to capital,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.620
it's gonna go to more and
more highly skilled labor.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.810
And that's a small
subset, one could argue,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.710
of the entire labor pool.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.470
You have this highly skilled labor here.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.980
And so you might have inequality,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.720
not happening like it
happened in the Gilded Age,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.460
where it's going to owners of capital,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.520
but now it's going to, the
owners, I guess you could say,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.510
of highly, highly skilled labor.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.730
And so, that could drive inequality.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.600
But this is where the
force of convergence,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.000
that Piketty talks about, could play in.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.910
And he seems a little bit skeptical

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.730
of its ability to overweight

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.140
the forces of capital accumulation.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.860
But if we can have more people participate

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.140
in this more highly skilled labor,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.850
then potentially this could
be a force of convergence.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.830
It could balance things off,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.273
and keep us from going into
some type of neo-Gilded Age.
