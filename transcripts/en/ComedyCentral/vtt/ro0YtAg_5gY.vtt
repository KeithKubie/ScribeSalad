00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.535
There is a list going
around Twitter today

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:05.405
of the top ten
most dangerous celebrities.

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.773
I wonder who could be
at number seven.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:10.243
Probably Suge Knight,
or Suge Knight, or Suge.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.511
Let's see who it is.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.446
What? It's Chris Hardwick?

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:14.747
I don't...

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.551
-How am I... dangerous?
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.853
No, no, no, no.

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.222
Has nothing to do with me,
although I'm very honored.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.058
I never get put
on lists like this.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.325
I really feel like I've made it.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.860
I don't know
if I should be upset

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.228
that they called me dangerous,

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.230
or considered me less dangerous
than Carson Daly,

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.232
who's a very nice guy.
He's a very nice guy.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.469
But this alarming graphic
is actually McAfee's list

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.005
of the top ten
most dangerous celebrities

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.007
to search for online,
meaning that cyber criminals

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.276
use our names
to expose you to malware.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.646
Ironically, John McAfee is not
anywhere on this list...

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.314
(laughter)

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.117
...who is the most dangerous
person in the world.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.519
So don't click on anything
that sounds too fake,

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.455
like "Chris Hardwick nip slip."
Um...

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.023
-(laughter)
-It's a trap.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:58.858
I don't have nipples. Uh...

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.226
(laughter)

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.261
Well, I do have nipples,
but you don't want to...

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:04.230
All right, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.932
(applause and cheering)

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:10.002
Oops. Oops.
How did that get out?

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:12.238
-Oops.
-Oh, my.

00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.874
You want some of that little
sand dollar action for you?

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.542
(laughter)

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.645
That accidentally... flew out.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.747
Comedians,
what's a computer virus

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.784
you'd get from Googling
one of these celebrities?

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.552
Dave Foley.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.020
Uh, if you Google Daniel Tosh,

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:29.455
your computer kicks you
in the balls

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.357
and thinks it's the funniest
thing that ever happened.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.027
-All right, points. Points.
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.930
Suzy Nakamura.

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.066
Um, if you Google Selena Gomez,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.335
your computer gets whatever
virus Justin Bieber has.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.836
-All right, points.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.473
(applause and cheering)

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.743
Ken.

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:53.713
Well, he's not on the list,
but if you Google Joel McHale,

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:58.818
your computer gets so smug and
snarky, but is just so (bleep)!

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.117
HARDWICK:
All right.
