RICHARD EBERHARDT:
One really great thing

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.091
that we're finding
this year is we've

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:10.850
got a large number of women
who are taking the course.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.640
We really try to
focus on getting

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.790
a good balance of diversity
of voices in the course.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.710
Of, I think, 65, we're going
to have 25 women first day.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.905
And we're doing
basically this first day

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:27.800
is to see what we can
do to keep them engaged

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.610
and keep them as
part of the course.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.640
SARA VERRILI: We have had,
in the last couple of years,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.400
we've had almost twice as many
or three times as many women

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.570
on our first day.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.350
And by our second
week, we will be

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
down to only four or
five women in the class

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.280
out of 30 odd people.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880
So we're really hoping
we can do a better

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.679
job at keeping them this year.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.220
PHILIP TAN: And
we're trying a couple

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.690
of new techniques this year.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.950
We put a harassment
policy into our syllubus--

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.910
as well as an initial
email that went out

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.200
to all of the students--
just making it clear

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.600
that no, it's not OK to harass
or to make your classmates

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.680
feeling uncomfortable.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.720
And if you are in a position
where you feel uncomfortable,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.190
you can always speak
to the instructors.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.530
A lot of this is just
standard MIT policy,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.760
but it's not normal
practice for classes

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.240
to actually state it upfront.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.010
Still, we want the
students to understand

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.570
that they have these options.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.270
What we also try
to do is make sure

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.290
that we have a lot of women
speaking in our classes,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.450
so lecturers, for
instance, or guests.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.290
We try to make sure
that it's very easy

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.180
to be able to see yourself
as a professional because all

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.810
of our speakers work in games
in some manner or other.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.960
SARA VERRILI: I mean,
we're not entirely sure

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.564
why we're losing so many women.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:00.980
Because it's all
in the beginning.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.070
It's not that we
lose them later on.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.900
The women who go
through our class,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.520
we get a very high percentage
of them coming back

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.660
for 617, The Advanced
Game Studio Course.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.070
Once we've got
them in the class,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.430
once they decide it's going
to be an interesting class

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.470
to take, we seem to keep them.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.060
The question is how can we
keep from scattering them off

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.120
in that first week?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.370
Which is when MIT students
can say, oh, you know what?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.911
This class looks like, I think
I'll go take some other class.

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:32.370
So I think we've
put more of our work

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.680
into focusing our upfront making
it clear what the course is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.150
about and trying to make sure
that we are, in fact, being

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.614
welcoming.

00:02:43.614 --> 00:02:45.030
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
A lot of it has

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.700
to do with being welcoming
but also providing challenges

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.060
that more people might
be interested in.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.310
So in this case, it's not
necessarily targeting women,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.030
but really just
targeting a diverse group

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.960
of voices in the class.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.930
So for this semester,
the design challenge,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.220
we're really focusing on
what the design challenge is

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.760
in the class from day one.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.342
Where, in previous semesters,
we talked about a little bit

00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:11.800
in the first couple
weeks, and then

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.942
we didn't get into it
deeper until midway through.

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:16.400
So in this case,
this semester it's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.580
about decision-making in games.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.497
We're talking about
the types of games

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:23.080
many different kinds
of students would

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.680
want to play and have played.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.510
So it's not just that you're
coming to a game course

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.590
because you play all sorts of
games, and then you find out,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.340
well this one's just going
to be about war games.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.650
So talking about narrative,
talking about fiction,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.734
also talking about strategy,
talking about chance,

00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:41.691
and talking about all of
the different elements

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.260
they're going to explore the
next semester in the beginning,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.190
hopefully, we'll
keep them interested.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.416
And then also having a client
in the class where they're

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.290
actually making a game
where it's going to do

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.640
some good to somebody else.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.460
They're not just making
a game to make a game.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.790
In this case, the
games they're making

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.760
are going to be used by the
Red Cross Red Crescent Climate

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.540
Centre, particularly to
help policymakers to better

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.370
understand the need to devote
resources, time, and money

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.140
to disaster preparedness.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.210
So it's a big topic.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.339
It's a timely topic.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.920
Climate change is being
talked about a lot right now.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.030
MIT students like those kinds
of MIT-styled engineering

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.530
problems.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.490
So hopefully that also
keeps a good number

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.940
of the students keeping in the
course after the first week.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.620
We never have a problem
keeping our number high.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.410
Our numbers are always high.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.600
It's keeping the diverse number
of voices high from the get-go.
