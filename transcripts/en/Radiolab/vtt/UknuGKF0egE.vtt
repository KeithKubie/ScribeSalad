1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.160
We're going to rip her way through this. Okay.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.140
Do I need to know anything or you just want to tell me?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.660
I'm just gonna tell you it. Okay. Maybe I'll play you some music as well. Sure.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.360
Okay. Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.900
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab the podcast. That's right.

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.280
I shouldn't say it that way. The podcast. Yeah. More declarative. So we do,

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.860
you know, music is very important to the show. Very.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.770
It's never the explicit topic, but someday it's always there.

9
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.120
It is the governor. Really? Yeah.

10
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:28.010
And today we're going to make it front and center.

11
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.400
So I thought for the next 10 minutes or so,

12
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.500
let me tell you about this band that we ran into.

13
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.390
<v 0>I don't think you mean that literally. There's not a band there,</v>

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.720
but you had a collision. I kind of did. Well,

16
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:45.190
let me give you the back story please.

17
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.420
So you remember when we were doing the parasite show? Yes. Okay. Hey. Yeah,

18
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.060
we did several pieces about hookworms,

19
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.600
the first of which was about hookworms in the south. Remember this story? I do.

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.610
Just a jog. Here's a brief clip.

21
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.160
We think that these people are sick from something cause they don't,

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.660
they don't behave like we do. What does that mean? They are slow.

23
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.100
Not Mentally. They're slow. Physically they're Pale because they've got awkward.

24
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
Okay. So did you meet what you were searching for? The right music to use?

25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.920
We went to our secret weapon, her name is Karen, have like,

26
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.610
she works a couple of cubicle rows down from us. We asked her,

27
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.611
do you know anything that's Kinda southern but 20 but not kind of has an edge

28
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.740
cause these hookworms are taking over people's minds.

29
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:31.710
So it's got to have a little bit of an edge to it does.

30
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.920
She gave me all this stuff and then she's like, oh check out bucan gas case,

31
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:39.010
guess gay. So to make a long story short, she handed me a CD,

32
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:43.510
this one right here called Buke and gaze a [inaudible]. And I was like, and I,

33
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:48.100
I, I as I guess totally wrong for for the show, but it was so right.

34
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.180
And some of the other ways that I was like, OK, so, so yeah, so here we are.

35
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.050
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

36
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.520
<v 0>I visited Bucan gaze in Brooklyn in this little basement apartment where they</v>

37
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.490
play. And, uh, should we just hear some please? Uh,

38
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.010
I've been a fan of and gates for not yet.

39
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.300
It's really hard music to describe. For instance, um,

40
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.380
Aaron is say your last name. I'm Aaron Dyer.

41
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.640
Aaron is one of the members of the band. Here's how she describes what they do.

42
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.970
Uh,

43
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.970
imagine the recently retired school house janitor riding the back of a big

44
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.323
horse. Okay.

45
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960
<v 1>That's some galloping over different scenes.</v>

46
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.740
Like one scene could be a really good

47
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.740
<v 0>calm rose pedals surfaced pond,</v>

48
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.930
<v 2>eh, eh, Eh, eh,</v>

49
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.490
<v 0>jumps over that. And then it gets into another scene where there's a big part</v>

50
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.490
<v 1>topless beach goers that are totally pruned out and hanging out on the beach.</v>

51
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.770
So they're very surprised.

52
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.750
And then it jumps into another scene where there's an angry mob,

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.370
forks and flames

54
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.733
[inaudible]

55
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.470
they're running after rabbits that have just stolen all of the carrots and

56
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.660
cabbage and they're not going to be able to eat their feast because of it the

57
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.400
next day. So they're very angry. Yeah.

58
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.940
But that's what the janitor's jumping over and he's excited about it.

59
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.990
And I would be too

60
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.110
<v 0>in this scenario. Weird, weird scenario. You just vacated. I use a janitor.</v>

61
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.170
So you guys a janitor on the horse? No, no.

62
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.780
I would say the audience would be the, uh, the janitor on the horse.

63
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.110
So that's how Aaron describes it. But there's another Aaron in the band,

64
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.400
Aaron Sanchez, two errands and here's his attendance. It's like, it's,

65
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.170
it's like miniature. Um,

66
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.070
it's like the loudest miniature first.

67
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.590
Oh, right. Here's bucan gates rehearsing a song called two frogs.

68
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.663
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

69
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.723
[inaudible]

70
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.560
<v 0>oh, I was, that's as far as we got. It's so hookworm.</v>

71
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.510
I mean like right from the Gecko. Totally.

72
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.220
Now the amazing thing is that all of that noise just came from two people just

73
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:12.690
trying to make as much noise as we can.

74
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.580
The reason that they're able to make that much racket is cause they've heavily

75
00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:21.060
messed with their instruments. Aaron, the girl plays something called the Buke.

76
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.650
Buick is a baritone Ukulele or names in Buke that that is the instrument she

77
00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.000
plays. Yes, she plays the Ukulele,

78
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:31.260
which I didn't know comes in a base flavor as yours, right? Yeah. Very cute.

79
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:35.430
It's like a miniature guitar too and wooden body.

80
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.140
And you notice it has two pickups.

81
00:06:37.141 --> 00:06:40.470
This is a just a excuse actually taken this buke and modified it,

82
00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:44.700
added some strings, electrified it with some pickups and outputs inside to add,

83
00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:48.120
put sets and stare yesterday. That's the Buick. Now the gaze,

84
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.180
it seems even more complex. So this guy, that's what Aaron, the boy place.

85
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:53.790
This is the case. And this has basically,

86
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:58.250
this is a hybrid between the guitar and the Bass Guitar. Bass case. Yeah.

87
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.090
I'm just trying to think of how would it look like?

88
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.640
Well it actually looks just like a normal acoustic guitar,

89
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.210
but through the strings or bass strings it bass strings go to their own base.

90
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:08.730
Amp. The guitar strings go to their own guitar amps.

91
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.010
Wouldn't it be cool if the bass string was actually an elongated and taught

92
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.903
hookworm

93
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.770
can you sing on this one seven it would be hard to play cause it'd be biting

94
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:21.500
your fingers the whole time. Anyhow.

95
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.440
So the other thing that's happening when they play is he's beating kick drum

96
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.600
with his left foot. She's got bells on her ankle.

97
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.810
This is a really high pitched frequency.

98
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.470
Trask those. Yeah,

99
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.010
so this is like one of those people who walk around like in central Europe with

100
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:41.850
like nine instruments doing a moral simultaneously a little bit. Yeah.

101
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.350
Dank is one to four

102
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.180
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

103
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.040
<v 0>This is bucan gays performing from their first album. A song called bundle tie.</v>

104
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.813
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

105
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.363
[inaudible] [inaudible]

106
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.650
[inaudible] long. Have you guys been playing together?

107
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.370
<v 4>Let it 2000</v>

108
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.300
<v 0>and then we were in a band in 2003 called [inaudible] on an ed.</v>

109
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.490
That band broke up. We broke up because we were dating at the time.

110
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.650
This is the first time you've ever said that. Really? Yeah.

111
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.290
What are you now if you mind me asking friends or band mates? Oh yeah.

112
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.270
Not even friends. Jesus Christ. We're friends now.

113
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.080
I kept trying to push him, prod the two errands about why they broke up,

114
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.480
but they wouldn't tell me. I probably wouldn't tell me either.

115
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.260
Suffice to say something happened and then they just stopped speaking to each

116
00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:36.420
other for a really long time. If didn't, we didn't speak for like three years,

117
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.710
three or four years really. And Aaron, the girl basically moved away,

118
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.160
gave up music altogether and started racing bikes and then one day out of the

119
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.050
blue for no real reason that he can explain Aaron,

120
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:52.260
the boy writes an email to Aaron, the girl, he said,

121
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:54.510
how's so how's the cycling going or something.

122
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.450
I think I did say that you did. We've never really talked about it. Really?

123
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.220
Yeah, and beyond that, they wouldn't really talk about it with me,

124
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.820
but their music has something in it. Some kind of like hook where me and

125
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.070
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.560
<v 0>that maybe comes from stuff, they don't talk.</v>

127
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.890
<v 1>There's something about your music that feels possessed.</v>

128
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.170
<v 4>My temptation maybe wrongly is to say possessed by some soon.</v>

129
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.860
If the history you guys have to get good, great

130
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:32.970
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

131
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.400
<v 4>if largely armies of bunnies are going to steal their carrots,</v>

132
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.480
then you're just living in an anxious world. The truth is,

133
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.070
if you're the rabbit,

134
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.900
I don't think they would disagree with you there. Well,

135
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:47.960
that was [inaudible] recorded with help. Help
