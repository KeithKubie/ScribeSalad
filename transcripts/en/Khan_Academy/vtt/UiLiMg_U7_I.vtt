00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.772
- [Instructor] Told the
function g is defined

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:05.094
over the real numbers.

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:08.473
This table gives a few values of g.

00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:11.143
So for a few values of x,

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.592
they give us what g of x is equal to.

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:15.799
And they say what is a reasonable estimate

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.966
for the limit of g of x as x
approaches 9 from the left?

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.026
Or as x approaches nine,

00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:26.213
remember, when we say x approaches nine

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.918
with this little superscript,
that little negative sign,

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:30.585
that doesn't necessarily mean

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:34.698
that we're approaching nine
from negative values of x.

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:36.889
It means that we're approaching nine

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.139
from values less than nine.

00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:41.153
And so to think about this,

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:44.596
what is a reasonable
value for the left-sided,

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.690
or the left-handed limit?

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.141
We'd say, all right,
let's pick some x values

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.379
that get closer that are less than nine,

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.492
but keep getting closer
and closer to nine.

00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:55.410
So I would look at these x values,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.858
which they seem to have
chosen to exactly that.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.368
They're starting at 8.9,

00:01:00.368 --> 00:01:01.842
and they get even closer, 8.99,

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.744
then they get even closer to 8.999.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.820
And, once again, they
only want us to figure out

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.365
whether we can estimate
the left-handed limit.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.173
If we wanted to know the actual limit,

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:13.255
we would wanna figure
out the left-handed limit

00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:14.922
and the right-handed limit

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:16.806
and to feel good that they seem

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:18.375
to be approaching the same thing.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.673
But here we're only talking
about the left-handed.

00:01:20.673 --> 00:01:23.587
So when I look at this at 8.9

00:01:23.587 --> 00:01:25.894
g of x is equal to negative 5.01.

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:30.851
As we get even closer to
nine, we get to negative 4.83.

00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:35.778
As we get even closer to
nine, we get to negative 4.81.

00:01:35.778 --> 00:01:40.050
So just looking at
these three values here,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.678
for these three x's, it looks
like we're getting close

00:01:43.678 --> 00:01:46.081
to about negative 4.8.

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.681
So it's approximately negative 4.8.

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.153
Now we don't know that for sure.

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:54.784
It oftentimes a limit might
end up being a nice number

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:57.968
like negative 4.8, that's
not that nice of a number.

00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:01.385
But the limit might be negative 4.8002438

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:05.840
that we are approaching.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.882
It doesn't always have to go
to a nice to look at number.

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.422
But something interesting happens.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.151
When we get exactly to nine,

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.476
all of a sudden it seems
like we get further away

00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:18.147
from negative 4.8.

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:20.064
We jump to negative 5.3

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.511
So what does that tell us?

00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:25.277
Well, this is actually trying
to tackle a key misconception

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.773
that folks have when trying
to think about limits.

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:31.312
A limit is the value
that you are approaching,

00:02:31.312 --> 00:02:33.297
a value that the function is approaching

00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:35.907
as x approaches a certain value.

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:38.442
It isn't necessarily going to be

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:40.892
what the function is
defined at that value.

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:43.524
So you can be approaching
a different value

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:45.776
than what the function is defined at.

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:48.555
And it looks, at least looking
at inspecting this table,

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.250
it looks like that's
what's happening here.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.034
So what is a reasonable limit?

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:54.569
What is a reasonable estimate
for the left-handed limit

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.016
as x approach nine of g of x?

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:59.259
Well, I would rule out negative 5.3,

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.837
even though that is what g of nine is.

00:03:01.837 --> 00:03:03.903
This is equal to g of nine.

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:05.631
As we approach from the left,

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:09.890
it does not look like we're
approaching negative 5.3.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.271
In fact, it looks like
we're getting further

00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:13.324
and further away.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:15.181
Or it looks like we're
approaching negative 4.8.

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.724
And we're actually, as
we get closer and closer,

00:03:17.724 --> 00:03:18.675
we're getting a little bit further

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:21.043
from something like negative 5.3.

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:22.498
So I would rule this one out.

00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:25.714
Negative 4.8 I liked, even
before I looked at the choices

00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:28.275
it looked like that's
what we were approaching.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:30.180
So that seems like a reasonable estimate.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.507
I like that.

00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:32.340
So 4.7.

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:37.908
So 4.7, let's see,
okay, so this is tricky.

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:42.134
At first I was gonna say, oh, maybe.

00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:44.074
But I realized, this isn't negative 4.7.

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:45.194
If it was negative 4.7,

00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:47.829
well, maybe that would be reasonable,

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.002
we don't know for sure.

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:50.919
But it's not, it's 4.7.

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:53.159
So there's no reason why we would

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.599
be approaching negative 4.8

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.165
and then all of a sudden jump to 4.7

00:03:57.165 --> 00:03:59.053
and that'd be the limit, that's
not what we're approaching.

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:01.181
We're not approaching a positive 4.7.

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.558
So definitely rule that out.

00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:05.646
And we're definitely not approaching nine.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:07.470
Here, they're just trying to confuse you.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.412
The x is approaching nine, from the left,

00:04:10.412 --> 00:04:12.153
from values less than nine.

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:14.575
But that's not what the
function itself is approaching.

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:17.374
The function itself seems to
be getting closer and closer

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:19.405
to negative 4.8.

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:20.925
So rule that one out.

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:23.342
And the limit seems to exist.

00:04:24.344 --> 00:04:27.385
Once again, we are estimating
when we have these tables.

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:30.506
It's completely possible
that this is some type

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:31.949
of weird function that begins

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.993
to do some type of weird oscillation

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:36.758
as we get really close, so it oscillates

00:04:36.758 --> 00:04:39.254
between negative 4.8 and negative 4.7.

00:04:39.254 --> 00:04:41.227
So we don't know 100% sure.

00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:43.798
But it's not reasonable to think,

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:47.351
based on this information,
that the limit doesn't exist.

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.454
So I would rule that out.

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.773
And I like this choice right over here.

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:53.273
Now let's do one more example.

00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:57.825
A student created a
table to help the reason

00:04:57.825 --> 00:05:00.798
about the limit as x
approaches three of f of x.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.804
And so here we want the actual limits.

00:05:02.804 --> 00:05:04.431
We want the limit as we
approach from the left

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:05.461
and from the right,

00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:07.449
and see if we're
approaching the same thing.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.016
Based on the table, what can
you reason about the limit?

00:05:10.016 --> 00:05:14.080
So here we see x approaching,
we could say from below,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.943
even though (laughs) visually
it looks like from above.

00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:18.673
We're approaching x from the left.

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:21.359
We're approaching x from
values, we're approaching,

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.076
I should say we're
approaching three from values

00:05:24.076 --> 00:05:27.199
to the left of three, if
we're looking at the x-axis.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.682
So we're approaching three
from values less than three.

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:33.724
And it looks like, see 2.9, negative 1.28,

00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:37.307
2.99, negative 1.42,
2.9999, negative 1.49.

00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:41.630
So it looks like we're
getting closer and closer

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.130
to negative 1.5, negative 1.5.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.907
And even though the function
is undefined as x equals three,

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:52.958
the limit could exist.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.549
In fact, that's one of the
main values of a limit.

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:57.002
They say what is the function approaching

00:05:57.002 --> 00:06:00.055
even in cases where the
function is not defined there?

00:06:00.055 --> 00:06:02.399
So it looks like it's
approaching negative 1.5.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.566
Now if we approach three
from the positive direction,

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:08.783
from values greater than three.

00:06:08.783 --> 00:06:12.368
So we get 3.1, then our
function is negative 1.8.

00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:14.671
3.01, our function is negative 1.63.

00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:16.421
3.001, negative 1.51.

00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:20.162
So even from the right,

00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:21.870
or even from values larger than three,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.983
it still looks like we're
approaching negative 1.5.

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:27.198
So this could be a reasonable estimate,

00:06:27.198 --> 00:06:29.626
a reasonable guess based on this table

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:31.262
of what the limit actually is.

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:33.245
Now we have to be very, very careful.

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:36.127
You don't know definitively
just by trying out these numbers

00:06:36.127 --> 00:06:38.366
that the limit is definitely negative 1.5.

00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:41.533
It might be negative 1.5187 repeating.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.251
It might be that number

00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.744
We don't know for sure.

00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:49.978
Now in a typical calculus
class in a typical exam,

00:06:49.978 --> 00:06:52.032
you don't typically see numbers like that.

00:06:52.032 --> 00:06:54.735
The questions are usually engineered

00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:56.431
to give you nicer numbers.

00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:57.757
But I just wanna make it clear.

00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:01.565
You might be approaching
an irrational number.

00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:05.230
You could be approaching
a pi divided by two

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.230
or something like that.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.158
Not necessarily in this
case, but in general.

00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:10.302
But this is a reasonable estimate.

00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:11.712
So let's see what we can reason.

00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:13.855
So limit x approaches three of f of x

00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:15.578
is approximately negative 1.5.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:18.607
Yeah, I think this is a reasonable thing.

00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:20.659
So I would check that off.

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:23.438
Now we don't know this for sure.

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:24.991
In fact, there's even a scenario

00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:27.228
where this limit still might not exist,

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:28.174
even if it looks like it.

00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:29.550
Maybe as we get closer and closer

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.054
this is some type of weird function

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:33.132
that starts oscillating
in some strange way

00:07:33.132 --> 00:07:36.011
or just stops getting closer
and closer to a value,

00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:38.366
even though it looks like
it's getting closer and closer

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:39.366
right over here.

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.071
But this is a reasonable,

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:43.313
what can you reasonably reason?

00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:44.602
I'll put that here.

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:48.666
What can you reasonably
reason about the limit?

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:51.313
There appears to be an
asymptote at x equals three.

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:54.459
Well, no an asymptote
would be the situation

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:56.479
if we were a vertical asymptote,

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.533
especially as if we seem
to be approaching infinity

00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:00.624
or negative infinity.

00:08:00.624 --> 00:08:02.453
And that's definitely
not the case the here.

00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:03.791
So I'd rule that out.

00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:05.071
As we approach x equals three,

00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:07.680
the values of f of x seem
to approach negative 1.5.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.655
But we can't say for sure
if that's the limit exactly.

00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:13.439
Yeah, that's the point I
was making right over here.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.808
It seems like it's
getting to negative 1.5.

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.839
And most questions on most
tests are kinda engineered

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.344
to give you numbers that aren't crazy.

00:08:21.344 --> 00:08:23.793
But even with this data,
even with this information,

00:08:23.793 --> 00:08:25.448
it might be approaching something

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:27.700
a little bit more interesting.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.471
Or this could be some kinda crazy function

00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:33.572
that as we get within
a thousandth of three,

00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:36.514
maybe it's not defined even around three.

00:08:36.514 --> 00:08:39.155
Maybe it's not even defined at 2.99999,

00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:43.477
or 3.00001, or maybe it
doesn't get closer anymore.

00:08:43.477 --> 00:08:45.507
So, once again, you don't know for sure.

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:49.668
But this does seem to be
a reasonable thing to say.

00:08:49.668 --> 00:08:53.030
The values of f of x appear to oscillate,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.205
jump back and forth,
near x equals to three,

00:08:55.205 --> 00:08:56.602
so it's hard to say what the limit is

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:57.657
or if it even exists.

00:08:57.657 --> 00:09:00.413
Well, we're not seeing that
behavior right over here.

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.038
So I wouldn't pick that.

00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:03.311
That's not a reasonable thing,

00:09:03.311 --> 00:09:04.824
'cause you're not
observing it in the data.

00:09:04.824 --> 00:09:07.530
Now there are some crazy
functions out there

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.618
where all of a sudden if
you start trying out values

00:09:10.618 --> 00:09:12.334
that are much closer than
what we're seeing here,

00:09:12.334 --> 00:09:14.100
maybe some if this
behavior starts to happen,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.330
but we're not seeing it in the data,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.879
so I definitely wouldn't pick that.
