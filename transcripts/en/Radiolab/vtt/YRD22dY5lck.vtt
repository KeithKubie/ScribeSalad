00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.590
You are listening to radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.443
N y.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.780
S. T. E. N. N. P. E. R. N. I assume we're live on the air now.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 1>Uh Huh.</v>

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.740
<v 0>We don't do that. You have you guys ever talk to each other? I don't think so.</v>

6
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:22.690
No. Oh, this. Oh, this is Caribou, right? Well Hi, this is Jim Glick. Hey,

7
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:26.950
how are you? Fine. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Rainbows,

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.090
rainbows, rainbows. Okay, so we're going to start today with author James Glick.

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.210
As I recall, you wanted to talk about Isaac Newton. That's right.

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.940
We did call them and talk about Isaac Newton, but more specifically colors.

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.810
All right. Isaac Newton. He's 23 years old.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.090
1665 and he's, he's home for the holidays. No, there's no holiday.

13
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.730
He's home for the play. It was actually a plague.

14
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:53.530
They sent everybody home from school. In any case,

15
00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:56.980
he's in his room famously solving all these mysteries of the world.

16
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:00.670
And one of the questions that he thinks about during this break is what are

17
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.130
colors? Where do they come from?

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.880
Like when I see the color red, is that red?

19
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.380
Is it inside my head or is it something that exists sort of out there in the

20
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.990
world? Yes. The light without or is the light within?

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.420
<v 0>Hmm. So he pokes a knife into his eye. The coat he was, what do you mean?</v>

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.670
Here's what Newton wrote in his notebook. I took a Botkin,

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.990
put it twixt my eye on the bone as near to the backside of my eye as I could and

25
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.060
pressing my eye with the end of it.

26
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.493
<v 1>Whoa. Whoa.</v>

27
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.450
<v 0>It appeared several white dark colored circle.</v>

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.830
Did that lead him to some conclusion about where the spots live,

29
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:45.690
whether they're outside or inside? No,

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.500
didn't get them very far cause seeing spots when you poke your eye,

31
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.970
it doesn't tell you much about what color is. But um, what he did next did,

32
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.670
and this one needs a little more famous for, he got himself a prison,

33
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.220
which is just a bit of glass shape, like a pyramid.

34
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.250
It wasn't so easy for him to get his hands on a prison, but he did.

35
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.030
Then he shot his blind. So the rumors totally dark,

36
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
but he poked a little hole in one of the blinds and then he waited and the son

37
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.270
had to be at just the right angle

38
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.363
<v 1>and he waited.</v>

39
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.440
<v 0>And when the sun got to just the right spot,</v>

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.790
a ray of light shot through the room.

41
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.800
Newton immediately stuck his prison into the light and the light shattered

42
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.990
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

43
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.970
<v 0>and became a rainbow on the road</v>

44
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.280
<v 2>or in Newton zone. Words colored image of the Sun.</v>

45
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.460
<v 0>Yeah, that's gorgeous, isn't it? A colored image of the sun.</v>

46
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.640
That's Victoria Finley. She wrote a book about color and she says,

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.920
the thing to understand about this experiment is it,

48
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:51.921
at the time people believed that white light was given by gold or given given by

49
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.970
this amazing thing called nature. The light from the sun was sort of holy. Yeah.

50
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.530
If there was anything that was pure, it was white.

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.250
So when the prism did the rainbow thing, which people, new prisons did,

52
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.670
they just figured the colors are in there and the glass. In other words,

53
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.510
that rainbow had nothing to do with the light itself. That was just the prism.

54
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.500
Adding some kind of impurities to the light. Oh Wow.

55
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.560
I haven't thought of the possibility that the prison is muddying.

56
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.180
The light is polluting the light.

57
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.390
How do you know that the prison isn't generating these colors?

58
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.050
So he got a second prism, and this was the trick.

59
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.020
While the first prison was still making that rainbow on the wall,

60
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.470
he moved a few feet away and he held up a second prison in the blue area to see

61
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.750
what would happen to the blue light with the prison,

62
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.430
add more colors to the blue light or would it be transformed in some other way?

63
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.020
And what he found was nothing happens.

64
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.350
It remains blue. So he thought, hmm,

65
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.980
if the blue light isn't getting muddied by the prison and maybe the prison

66
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.140
wasn't muddying the white light to begin with,

67
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.790
maybe that rainbow of colors was actually coming from inside the white line.

68
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:05.710
He inferred that the first prism is dividing light into its constituent parts,

69
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.180
which means that the white light we see around us is actually constituted all of

70
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.870
these colors. The colors were in the light. They are the light.

71
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.890
He had his answer. Light is a physical thing in the physical world.

72
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.200
You can tweak it, test it, study it.

73
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.810
This was the beginning of everything we know about light today.

74
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.280
Newton put us on the road toward finding that ultraviolet rays, x-rays,

75
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:27.911
radio waves,

76
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.320
they're all different energies of light in colors or just energies within that

77
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.240
little sliver that we can see.

78
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.990
And that has led to our understanding of the greenhouse effect,

79
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.140
knowing what stars are made of, even the age of our own universe.

80
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.253
<v 3>Uh,</v>

81
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.940
<v 0>not everybody was pleased by this. A little bit later. John Keats,</v>

82
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.390
the romantic poet who was really crossed with him in, in a,

83
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:59.700
in a poem because they said he reduced,

84
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:04.260
removed all the poetry of the rainbow and the real challenge to Newton's view of

85
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.800
color. One that would really stick oddly enough, it did come from a poet,

86
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:10.720
not Keith's, but at the poet named Gerta. Yeah. Yes.

87
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.930
<v 4>Is this German romantic poet, um,</v>

88
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.840
that is authored Joanel air regularly with us who writes about this kind of

89
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:18.240
thing. And always wonderfully.

90
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.020
One day he is walking in the park and he spots these yellow crocus's and he

91
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.440
looks at the Yellow Crocus, isn't it Myers? They're pedals. It's in,

92
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.060
it's early spring and they're blooming.

93
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.240
And then it quickly turns away and in an instant

94
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.480
<v 0>he suddenly sees his dash a violet crosses eyes.</v>

95
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.020
You still sees the shape of the flower, but now it's violet.

96
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.550
It's the opposite of yellow. He hadn't rubbed his eye and stuck a needle in it,

97
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.310
<v 4>and yet there it was, seemed just as real,</v>

98
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.220
as real as the yellow crow. But he knew it wasn't real.

99
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:53.850
It came from inside his mind and it was, you know something,

100
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.290
you know we've all hallucinated colors.

101
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:59.030
You can press on your eyeball or close your and you see this riot, a fireworks.

102
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.440
But for Gerta,

103
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.180
that simple observation leads him to think that may be color isn't simply about

104
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.530
the external universe. And maybe our perception of colors began in the world,

105
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.950
but maybe it was finished inside the mind. And today,

106
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 0>hundreds of years later, this is still an open question.</v>

107
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.940
A scientist can say color has an objective reality,

108
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.350
but the colors we see are tricks of the imagination.

109
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.000
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

110
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.200
<v 0>And there is no perfectly objective view of color. I personally,</v>

111
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:34.640
I like to keep both of those opinions in mind at the same time.

112
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.630
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

113
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.250
<v 0>me too. Me Three</v>

114
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.730
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

115
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.600
<v 5>well lucky for us.</v>

116
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.970
We're going to do a whole show of this. I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.

117
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.210
This is Radiolab and today it's all about color. Yes,

118
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.230
we're is color. Is it in, is it out? That's the question. Yeah.

119
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.020
We're going to explore that question through the eyes of a butterfly in the

120
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:03.310
killing fields of Cambodia with a woman who may see colors the rest of us can

121
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:03.970
only dream of.

122
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.970
And we'll go back to a time when the sea apparently looked like dark red wine.

123
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.970
Stick this in your ear holes cause we're about to get color. Yeah.

124
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.870
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

125
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.470
<v 5>And by the way, before we get rolling,</v>

126
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.150
just want to say we did something kind of different for us while making this

127
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.850
hour, we put out this call to a bunch of musicians,

128
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.970
solo artist bands to send us their favorite color songs,

129
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:34.280
their own interpretations of their favorite color song.

130
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.820
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

131
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.770
<v 5>you got an amazing response.</v>

132
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:47.300
So throughout this hour you're gonna hear color songs of various kinds, uh,

133
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.410
woven into some of the pieces between the pieces, those songs. By the way,

134
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.280
we have plans for, yeah, big plans. You can go to our website,

135
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.220
radiolab.org to get a full list of the songs. I hadn't. Thank you. By the way.

136
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.810
Everybody who sent us the songs yet.

137
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.293
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

138
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.860
<v 0>Okay. So, uh, should we go? Yes. Let's ask. So to, to get things going. Um, hey,</v>

139
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.060
hey, he's here. You're here. He is.

140
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.820
Not long after we talked to Jim Glick about Sir Isaac Newton,

141
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.080
we had talked to a neuroscientist by the name of Mark Chinkies.

142
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.830
I'm going to grapes if that's all right with, you know,

143
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.320
who had written a book about color. Would you like some grapes? I know thing.

144
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.880
And we threw the question at him.

145
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.060
So one of the sort of debates that became interesting to us is this,

146
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.420
where is the color? Is it out there? I mean,

147
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:30.800
is this great that I'm holding right now?

148
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:34.670
Is it red for everything that'd be a whale? I mean, is this,

149
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:39.440
does it exist in a way that you can pin down and say it's outside me or does it

150
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:42.860
only get to be red when it gets in my head? Well,

151
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.490
you can another way, a more severe way to, to ask this,

152
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:48.470
and I asked this whenever I'm giving talks,

153
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.430
is just would aliens see it as red or would would aliens see it as red? Right?

154
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.490
And the answers almost surely no truth. This says mark,

155
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.240
even your dog wouldn't see it as red. Oh, your dog has color. Vision has blue,

156
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.270
yellow and black. White. Really? Yes.

157
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.000
So what would the world look like to a dog? I mean,

158
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.310
if you've ever known a guy who's color blind too, and 10% of men are colorblind,

159
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.120
that's roughly what it's like. Huh? Well, here's the question.

160
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.430
If a dog and the human and

161
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.060
<v 6>a crow where could be staring at a rainbow,</v>

162
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.630
would they be seeing very different things? Yes.

163
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.290
Now this question that Robert just kind of tossed out during an interview with

164
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.510
like about how different creatures would see the rainbow.

165
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.530
This ended up taking us down a little worm hole and we ended up actually getting

166
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:38.040
a choir to help us illustrate, uh, what we learned.

167
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.790
But just to set a baseline, your normal rainbow goes like this,

168
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.713
starting bottom up.

169
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.290
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

170
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.210
<v 6>red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, Roy g bit. Where'd you bev? Yeah.</v>

171
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.260
I don't know why people put the I in there, but that's it.

172
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.420
If you didn't have the indigo, you couldn't say it though, be Roy.

173
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.510
Did you believe that's why you need the, I think that is to say the red jeep,

174
00:10:01.511 --> 00:10:05.320
if you know that by the way, is Tom Cronin I bought,

175
00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:08.140
it's called a visual ecologist. Mark suggested we give him a call.

176
00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:11.020
He told us that humans seat seven colors in the rainbow

177
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.640
<v 0>in the, in the case of the dog, very different rainbow. Uh,</v>

178
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.370
it's going to start off blue. He'll be able to see blue just fine.

179
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.060
<v 6>So what was he a rainbow starting with blue.</v>

180
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.510
Same blue we see and then grading off into

181
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.520
<v 7>green [inaudible] same green as us and then disappearing here.</v>

182
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.750
<v 6>You mean go in there with a tiny bit of yellow thrown in? That's it. Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:36.110
So the rainbow will be only be about half as thick as ours. Wow.

184
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.450
It's a sucky rainbow dog. Yeah.

185
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.940
That's why when God promised that he would never deliver another delusion,

186
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.290
he gave a paper, made the promise in the rainbow.

187
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.510
The dogs just totally unimpressed.

188
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.700
And what is it about the dog I that makes it see this way it doesn't have red

189
00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:55.940
sensitive photo receptors. No red sensitive cones.

190
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.990
The weird thing is that the difference between dogs and us cone wise is just

191
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:02.930
one. They have cones tuned to blue and green. So do we.

192
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.090
But we have this one extra red, which doesn't really seem like a big difference.

193
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.690
I mean it's just one cone, but I have three.

194
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.900
It's so much better than two. That's Jane night's vision.

195
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:18.800
Scientists because of this kind of multiplicative thing.

196
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.340
Red Can get mixed with blue chinks, purple

197
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:28.330
<v 7>or red can get mixed with yellow to make orange green to mixed with blue to get</v>

198
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.880
teal or turquoise.

199
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.590
That's how we get about a hundred different shades of color that we can see.

200
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.180
<v 6>So by adding one photo pigment, instead of adding just one more color,</v>

201
00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:43.900
you actually add about 98 colors yourself. All right, let's move on.

202
00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:46.900
So now we have a crow. Unless you'd like to change the bird.

203
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.300
Well the crow is not [inaudible] cause it's pretty much like us.

204
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.330
So let's take a look. Psycho off something like a um, a sparrow, right?

205
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.950
Cause sparrows have ultraviolet vision. What do they see?

206
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.980
So they see the rainbow starts before our rainbow starts where we just see sky,

207
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.580
it would see an ultraviolet color,

208
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.990
<v 7>then it would see the</v>

209
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.190
Greens and the oranges

210
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.280
and then the red and probably would see further into the red rhythm has because

211
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:24.080
they have the more red sensitive red receptor than we have.

212
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.550
So you want see a much broader rainbow.

213
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.500
Let's start earlier and it would end later.

214
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.543
<v 3>Woo.</v>

215
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.560
<v 6>So should we assume that we've now that this bow is the champion,</v>

216
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.420
that that's the, that's that's as high as it gets.

217
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:41.880
If you're talking about Verda breaths,

218
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.440
[inaudible] thing that has a heart and a mind and a,

219
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.850
once you leave the vertebrates, then all bets are off.

220
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:51.630
You've got many animals have much better color vision than the vertebrates.

221
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.180
Oh yeah. Like what? Butterflies are a great example.

222
00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:57.240
Butterflies have five or six kinds of res of color receptors.

223
00:12:57.241 --> 00:13:01.710
We only have three. Remember butterflies see more colors than we do.

224
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.860
Yeah. So if a butterfly, we're looking at a rainbow,

225
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.260
so, well they do, I'm sure.

226
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:13.740
I mean butterflies are out there and when the game are out, but it was e colors.

227
00:13:13.741 --> 00:13:17.280
We have no names for between the blues and the Greens and the Greens and the

228
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:21.630
yellows. Woo. So it would go from ultraviolet. It would see that. Yup.

229
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:26.810
<v 7>Then it would see violet and then blue and then blue,</v>

230
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:31.530
blue, green, Yup. In Green, green, blue, blue e or whatever.

231
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.810
Right. And then the orange and red and all that.

232
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.073
<v 3>Yup.</v>

233
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.930
<v 6>Very complicated eyes, Huh. Okay. So just to recap. All right, here's the dog.</v>

234
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.580
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

235
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.540
<v 6>here's US humans.</v>

236
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.460
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

237
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.293
<v 6>Now the sparrow</v>

238
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.143
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

239
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.650
<v 6>bit more base, a little bit more high end, so to speak.</v>

240
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.300
And finally the butterfly

241
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:55.790
<v 3>[inaudible] which</v>

242
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.000
<v 6>is, you know, not so far above the sparrow, but it's got more mids in there.</v>

243
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.510
So I'm not thinking butterfly butterflies get the crown. Yeah,

244
00:14:02.511 --> 00:14:04.700
but then you go under Carl reefs.

245
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:08.030
You come across these animals called mantis shrimps. What are they called?

246
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.690
Metta. Like Mantis, like a praying mantis. Oh, mantis shrimp.

247
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.070
The shrimp catches pray using an arm, like a praying mantis has. Oh,

248
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.370
I've managed shrimps or are mostly pretty small about the size of a finger.

249
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.640
Some get to be as big as your forearm break. Big Animals.

250
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.140
I'm actually looking this up right here. Oh. Oh my God.

251
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:30.440
They're so colorful. No, they are colorful though. You're here. Look at this.

252
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.750
Oh my God. They're just like a, it's like they're electric colored. Yeah.

253
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.060
Like Turquoise or something that you're a decile and their eyes are like little

254
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.220
cartoonized. They're gigantic. Yeah.

255
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.650
They have two really big eyes right on the front.

256
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.500
And you said that dogs have two cones. We have three.

257
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.450
How much does the butterfly have? Again, butterfly has five.

258
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.990
Depends on the butterfly. A managed Trims Have 16

259
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.840
1615 kinds of receptors. What would the rainbow look like to them mean?

260
00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:01.010
Could they even see it matter? Sure,

261
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:04.270
but see the rainbow fine cause they live in very shallow water and so the water

262
00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:07.640
is pretty clear. Almost like air. Huh? They would start the rainbow way, way,

263
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:09.890
way inside. Where we see violet, they would see

264
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.350
<v 7>then they would go on through several kinds of ultraviolet,</v>

265
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.000
probably five or six kinds of ultraviolet and then they, we get to violet which,

266
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:27.090
which is another reaching our colors and go through violet and violet blue and

267
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.600
blue and blue green

268
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.410
<v 6>where they have those green bean blue blue blues as well.</v>

269
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.340
<v 3>Yup. [inaudible] never go out into the reds.</v>

270
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.650
So they would be about it. About as red as last when they got to the red house,

271
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.020
but only in the red. Yeah.

272
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.560
<v 6>What a rainbow that must be. Yeah.</v>

273
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.670
They have the most complicated visual system of any animals by a factor of two

274
00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:55.620
or more. Wait, wait, wait.

275
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.300
He said any do you mean you mean did you mean that unequivocally? Any, yeah.

276
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.350
No other animal that we know of has a visual system within 50% is complicated.

277
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:05.950
All right. Mantis

278
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.843
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

279
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.480
<v 7>Okay. You know, on the other hand, their brains are tiny, so who knows what,</v>

280
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.730
they may not have the ability to perceive the beauty of the rainbow in the way.

281
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.200
No, I don't. I don't know. Their,

282
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.680
their Venice from certain into violence and how do we interview?

283
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.570
<v 6>They go around and kill things. That's, I mean really that's what they do.</v>

284
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.450
That's, that's one reason there is so fascinating is how,

285
00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:37.570
how would they have to go around and kill things? What are the shells? Crabs,

286
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.640
other managed shrimps. Shrimps. Octopuses they'll kill octopuses. Yeah.

287
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.483
Small ones.

288
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.810
A good size managed shrimp will can break the wall of an aquarium where really?

289
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.591
Yeah, there's a,

290
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:51.160
there's ones in California that can break aquarium walls if they hit it hard.

291
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:51.880
Oh my God.

292
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.880
So you have a pugnacious Mohammed Ali seagoing animal with incredibly great

293
00:16:57.671 --> 00:16:58.580
visual sense

294
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.230

Michael Kirschner and the young New Yorkers Chorus and John McClay and the

298
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.820
Greece Church Curl Society and those folks from the collegiate corral them

299

Odessa of choirs who joined us and to Alex Ambross of WQXR for getting everybody

300
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:35.840
together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

<v 3>[inaudible]. Okay, a very quick</v>

302
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.500
<v 8>update since we aired this broadcast,</v>

303
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.620
the mystery of the Mantis shrimp,

304
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.710
I has just gotten deeper. As we mentioned,

305
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.950
they don't seem to gaze at sunsets or rainbows.

306
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:05.760
We now think that maybe they use colors as kind of triggers for particular

307
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:08.430
actions. One clear says fight another color.

308
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:12.960
They eat other colors has sex. They'd still have the best eyes in the world,

309
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.940
but what they're doing with those eyes, is it bigger mystery now than ever

310

<v 10>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,</v>

331
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:36.210
and today we're talking about color. Okay.

332
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.260
And that actually brings us back to Jane Nights, a professor of ophthalmology,

333
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.450
university of Washington, Seattle.

334
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.770
Jay has actually spent his entire career trying to get creatures to seek colors

335
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.610
that they normally can't see. I, well, yeah, and he started,

336
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.840
this is kind of an interesting story,

337
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.190
a by taking some color blind monkeys who couldn't see red. They have blue cones,

338
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.120
green cones, but no red cones, which is not unlike a lot of human males.

339
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.983
In any case,

340
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.130
he had these monkeys and was able to take the human gene for the red cone rabbit

341
00:20:05.131 --> 00:20:08.970
and a virus. We injected into the monkey's eyes and Bam,

342
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.550
the monkeys suddenly had red cones. Yeah, so it had blue,

343
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.720
green and red. Was this like lasix? It was just like a,

344
00:20:17.721 --> 00:20:21.210
a 10 minute outpatient situation for the monkeys. I would say close,

345
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.200
close to Lasik. Could they then now see red? Well,

346
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.020
every single morning before they get their breakfast,

347
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:30.570
they have to do their color vision test. So

348
00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.780
we'd see each monkey at a computer,

349
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:37.500
we add a touch screen and the screen looks totally gray. Man.

350
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.600
We bought in that field of gray.

351
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:43.320
He adds a little red blob right now here's the key.

352
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.940
We use grape juice as the reinforcement for the monkeys. But game is, yeah,

353
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.360
the touch the blob before you get your juice. So before the surgery,

354
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:56.770
they weren't seeing any blobs and they weren't getting any juice because all

355
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:57.670
they could see was gray.

356
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.970
So a little red blob could be right there in front of them and they'd never see

357
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:05.410
it. And the morning after there, a lasix color booster shot. Okay,

358
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.390
a tradition, you see it, they

359
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.730
<v 3>and still couldn't see it.</v>

360
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.190
<v 10>Day after day they would do their tests and everyday they would fail.</v>

361
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.553
Every day they would fail

362
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:19.990
<v 3>and</v>

363
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.200
<v 10>no blob, no juice. But it's fun for them.</v>

364
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.930
They get out of their cage and they talk to their friends. Did you fail yet?

365
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.030
Fail. You Go, I bet

366
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.580
another day another fail until one morning after about 20 weeks,

367
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.401
Jay woke up,

368
00:21:38.401 --> 00:21:43.401
the monkeys gave them the test and they began to not fail.

369
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.030
Really, if you watch the video of this,

370
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.820
it actually looks like the monkey is like, wow, you know,

371
00:21:50.821 --> 00:21:55.800
I'm not having any failures and check out this dot. Look at this thing there.

372
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.221
Get Out.

373
00:21:56.221 --> 00:22:01.221
But I did get some sense that they felt like that their life had improved.

374
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.530
Nope. If this works so well with the monkeys,

375
00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:10.920
couldn't you take a colorblind human and give them back the thing they're

376
00:22:10.921 --> 00:22:12.060
missing? Absolutely.

377
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.170
We could cure colorblindness in a human with exactly this technique.

378
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.580
We really,

379
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.580
the only thing that we have to do is convince the FDA that the risks are low

380
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:29.470
enough and the benefit is high enough that it'd be something we could do.

381
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.160
And people have never tried it or no, we've never tried it.

382
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.750
Although I get a lot of emails, let's say I don't care what the risks are,

383
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.950
I've even had offers.

384
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.850
How about if I come to your laboratory and you don't tell anybody late at night

385
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.060
and you give me the shot in the eye and we won't tell anyone?

386
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.430
Which brings us back to our original question.

387
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:52.300
If you can take a colorblind human and give them normal color vision,

388
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.330
could you take a normal color seer and boost them to make them a little more

389
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:02.500
shrimpy? Well, yes. Yeah.

390
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.140
He said, sure, why not? But then there's the whole FDA thing.

391
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.950
But here's the real surprise, Jason.

392
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.740
There were some people who already a little bit mantis shrimp,

393
00:23:13.741 --> 00:23:16.260
like there are color mutants,

394
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.320
if I may call them that in the nicest possible way among us or they're out there

395
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:25.450
in theory. Okay, so here's the deal.

396
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.000
Genes for the cones in our eyes see color. You have the red queen, blue cones.

397
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.060
Yep. They're on the x chromosome. Now men, as we know,

398
00:23:33.061 --> 00:23:35.850
only have one of those women have two x chromosomes,

399
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.690
which means that women have two sets of these cone making jeans.

400
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.140
Normally one said it's just a spare, it's not used,

401
00:23:43.141 --> 00:23:46.700
but still they've got two sets and so said, Aha,

402
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.220
it is theoretically possible. Then some women,

403
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.100
this spare set of genes might mix up, turn on,

404
00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.510
morph into a whole new cone, a forth comb.

405
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.460
We're going to call it the yellow cone.

406
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.650
So people with normal color vision are trichromatic cause we've got three cones

407
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.440
or a woman like that would be a tetra Chromat.

408
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.910
So altogether she'd have a blue cone, a green cone, a yellow cone,

409
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:13.340
and a red cone. But you wouldn't just see more yellow.

410
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.400
This new yellow would mix with the red.

411
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:19.340
And the blue and the green to create thousands,

412
00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:23.420
maybe millions of more shades of color. This amazing.

413
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.200
The technicolor is not the right word. It's whatever it would be.

414
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:30.560
The deck scatter color, that would be even more super-duper.

415
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.580
This was just a thought experiment. Yeah. But um,

416
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.070
Jay actually figured out a way to test for this.

417
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.570
We can look in people's blood and I can say this woman has the genes for blue

418
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:46.310
cones, green cons, yellow cones, red cones. You can do a DNA test. Really?

419
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.030
Yeah. So he started doing blood tests and he found this one woman,

420
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.210
she worked at the same place we did crazy enough at the university.

421
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.330
He looked at her DNA and he saw the gene for the fourth code.

422
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.703
Yeah.

423
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:06.010
So did she see in super technicolor or how would you even know that was,

424
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.820
that was a problem.

425
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.250
And so we thought of an experiment in order to be able to see whether or not she

426
00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:15.440
had this extra dimension of Color Vision.

427
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.790
He was able to produce these two yellow lights. That to us, you know,

428
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:24.440
trichromatic normal chromatids look totally identical. We're color blind.

429
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:28.250
To that difference. But to a Tetra Chromat, a woman with this fourth cone,

430
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.620
they would look totally different. Yeah. So they brought her in. I said,

431
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.650
okay, here it is. Do you see these as different? And she said,

432
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:42.500
no, no, I don't see them. And he didn't know.

433
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.650
But the story doesn't end there. Good.

434
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.810
Jay told us about a colleague of his in England because she's at Newcastle named

435
00:25:50.811 --> 00:25:51.830
Gabrielle Jordan,

436
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.860
and she apparently found eight of these women with the extra cone.

437
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:55.850
And out of those eight,

438
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.440
seven of those women behaved exactly like the person that I had tested,

439
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.000
couldn't see the difference.

440
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.960
But one of them took one look at those two yellows and said, no,

441
00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:08.210
they look totally different to me. Oh,

442
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.410
one of these women was saw the assault side as different.

443
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:14.030
So one of them had the cone,

444
00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:17.830
but you could use it and the other had the cone but couldn't use it. Yup.

445
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.730
So why is that? Yeah, why? Well, this is the part if you'd like,

446
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:26.270
I could tell you what my theory is of what's going on. Yeah.

447
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.570
So I think that Jace has,

448
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.350
let's just imagine you grew up in a world without color completely and totally

449
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.500
black and white world houses would be painted black and white printers would all

450
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:40.940
be printing black and white. Even the TV,

451
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.070
they would just have black and white TV. Women's makeup would be

452
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.110
<v 8>just, you know, either dark or light.</v>

453
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.740
So it wouldn't make any difference if you had color vision because you would

454
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.710
never use that color vision, there'd be no words for color.

455
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.540
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

456
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.680
<v 8>now, just to make an interesting,</v>

457
00:26:55.681 --> 00:27:00.630
let's imagine one day a bright red apple plops into your world.

458
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:01.910
How would you

459
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.440
<v 10>react to it? Would you see it? You think? Well,</v>

460
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.950
so that's a very good question. Maybe says Jay,

461
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.710
even though you have the ability to see that Red Apple,

462
00:27:12.711 --> 00:27:15.890
if you've never had a chance to use that ability to practice,

463
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:21.410
it may just lay doormen and that he thinks might be what happens to women living

464
00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:23.630
with the extra cone in our world.

465
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.280
They're very rarely subjected to colors that would stimulate their extra kind of

466
00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:29.810
cone differently.

467
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.310
So you're saying those other colors just aren't around enough for them? Yeah,

468
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:38.300
everything that we make is based on the fact that humans are trichromatic.

469
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.190
The television only has three colors.

470
00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.340
Our color printers have three different colors.

471
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.510
There is nothing out there that we make artificially that a tetra chromatic

472
00:27:47.511 --> 00:27:48.170
could see.

473
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:53.170
But Jay says maybe some women because they're just more aware or because of the

474
00:27:54.321 --> 00:27:57.560
job that they do. Maybe someone who works with color all the time,

475
00:27:57.561 --> 00:27:58.850
like a florist or a painter

476
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.590
<v 8>by little, because they're paying such close attention,</v>

477
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.820
their brain would learn to see that

478
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.023
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

479
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.260
<v 5>So naturally we wanted to find one of these mythic ladies in that mythic.</v>

480
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:25.320
Maybe the reason I say that is because we tried to find that one woman that he

481
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:27.010
mentioned, you know, the one out of eight. Yeah.

482
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.050
And we had a really hard time and we began to doubt that she even existed.

483
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.010
And then we began to look online and you see all these websites thing,

484
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.650
are you at Tetra Chromat contact us, contact us,

485
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.720
everybody is searching for these women.

486
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:42.660
And we began to feel like we were chasing Unicorns a little bit,

487
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.910
but then our producer,

488
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:49.680
Tim Howard claimed the claim that he had found one calculating. Yeah,

489
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:53.700
you are right on the Ferris tree. He'd been in touch with Jay.

490
00:28:53.701 --> 00:28:55.860
Jay told him that he'd tested a woman,

491
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.840
determined that she had the fourth cone and this woman was an interior designer.

492
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.810
Oh. But Jay had not yet determined whether she could use her fourth cone.

493
00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:09.720
So we sent Tim to Pittsburgh where she lives right there to see what he can find

494
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:12.420
out. Hi, I'm Susan Hogan.

495
00:29:12.421 --> 00:29:15.170
I'm a mother of three and an interior designer.

496
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.660
<v 10>Well she like, she's great. Oh, you have a jukebox.</v>

497
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.350
<v 5>Really? You want me to play something? How about number three? Oh seven.</v>

498
00:29:23.351 --> 00:29:26.200
It just seems appropriate because it's about color, whiter shade, a pair.

499
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.870
Um, she told me a lot about how she uses color in her work.

500
00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:36.340
You see the different colors of paint because she thinks a lot about it in terms

501
00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:40.330
of painting walls. I know the way the sun is oriented in a room,

502
00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.340
each wall look a different color

503
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.350
<v 12>even though you put in any case, here's my plan. I'd uh,</v>

504
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.970
ordered this test before I went to Pittsburgh that Jay had suggested.

505
00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:50.960
I get at open and over overload.

506
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.580
It involved these little pieces of brown fabric. Okay.

507
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.230
They all look identical. They look strikingly the same to me.

508
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.070
Yeah. Lynn, Brenna, me, Soren was, are completely indistinguishable.

509
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.110
Couldn't see a difference. So look the same to you guys. Yes,

510
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.460
but I'm assuming they're actually not all the same. That's the trick. Jay said,

511
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.130
if you show them to a real tetra Chromat,

512
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:16.150
they're going to be able to see these subtle differences that you know,

513
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.530
you and I can't see,

514
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.000
and I'm back to Pittsburgh. We head over toward that tree is that

515
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
it'll be much more fun. We ended up doing the test in a nearby park.

516
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.190
We're going to do a bunch of these, if you don't mind.

517
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.250
The first trial I took out three of the swatches,

518
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.790
two that were exactly the same and one that was supposedly different.

519
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.040
And when you took it out, could you see the difference? No. No.

520
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.620
So I go behind the tree and I whisper into the mic. Number three.

521
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.610
It's different. Number three, I hope you couldn't hear me.

522
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.240
I'll let you take a look.

523
00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:01.260
She steps back in the swatches gives you the look for a moment and then she says

524
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.090
number three. The third one is different, more neutral,

525
00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:11.140
less red than one and two on the left. One for one luck.

526
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:12.970
So I went behind the tree,

527
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.980
I on second changed the swatches so that now the middle swatch was the odd one

528
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:20.560
out and same, same deal. Ready? Set, go.

529
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.170
Which number? It looks different. The middle one. Number two.

530
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.320
You are right. Wow. Okay.

531
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.280
Then I figured I got to make it harder. I switched it up and I made it.

532
00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:38.620
So all three are different and I didn't tell her,

533
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.590
oh three different aisle,

534
00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.840
three different green, red, less red,

535
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.970
knocking it out of the park case Tim.

536
00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:57.820
Wow. You found her. I had, I was sure that she was not going to be,

537
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.340
there's no way this test can work. Well,

538
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.800
it actually might not have totally worked.

539
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.210
What did she start to fail there? There's one little thing I didn't mention,

540
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.780
but I brought along a friend, I'm Jason Lacroix,

541
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.430
painter landscape still life thought I'd try him out as a control. Oh,

542
00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:16.560
cause you were thinking, uh,

543
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.950
let's get someone who likes color but as a boy and can't be a tetra chroma.

544
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.510
Right. And, uh, when we tried the exact same test with him,

545
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.920
I mean these three, they look the same, don't they? To, you know,

546
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.620
I see different, he was amazing. Uh,

547
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:38.020
every time the first one on the left jumped out immediately. Number one,

548
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.400
they all three looked different to me. Wow. Was he just as good as Susan? Yeah,

549
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.860
I always a little bit disappointed. I gotta say there was no where,

550
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:48.640
where he couldn't do it and she could know. But I mean,

551
00:32:48.641 --> 00:32:51.430
I only had pieces of brown cloth, you know,

552
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.540
<v 6>so it doesn't prove anything. I guess she still might be a tetra Chromat. Right.</v>

553
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.810
For All I know. And

554
00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.820
<v 12>there was this one moment I had no, it doesn't prove anything, but I asked her,</v>

555
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.930
um,

556
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.930
I asked her about the sky and the sky was just that quintessential sky blue

557
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.820
[inaudible] and she was like, I was like, what do you see? And she's like,

558
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:16.840
<v 5>I see. Um, do you see some of the pink and the blue?</v>

559
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.660
See I see a lot of pink. Like among the blue,

560
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.700
there's red in that blue section. She was looking at a blue sky and seeing red.

561
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.120
Yeah. Yeah. Do you see that? No. Oh,

562
00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:30.700
I see so much red like up it and it's,

563
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.470
<v 12>uh, it's kind of a cop out, but it's just kind of the perfect sky blue.</v>

564
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.580
<v 5>Okay. That's, that's a good, it's just mixed in there.</v>

565
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.140
That's cool. I think I don't see is any green in that blue? I just see reds,

566
00:33:44.141 --> 00:33:47.320
right? Especially around like white clouded section.

567
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.990
<v 12>And at that moment I felt like my sky is boring.</v>

568
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.080
I'm so sorry for you. For us. I'm sorry for us.

569
00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.290
<v 5>No, I mean, how do we know that any of this makes sense?</v>

570
00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.910
That's the fun of it. I, yeah.

571
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:05.580
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

572
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.950
<v 1>So in</v>

573
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.390
[inaudible] as a minutes, hold, stay

574
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.350
battle phase at first just goes lead,

575
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.950
turn the water.

576
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.900
Shayda hey

577
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.730
<v 13>froms man chose man.</v>

578
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.710
She's just mad about me. Call Him.

579
00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.600
[inaudible] you know we haven't talked about yet. What's that? Um, where do

580
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:07.480
<v 6>well there's come from, I mean like, like I'm guy color. No, no, like,</v>

581
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.320
like painterly colors. Like a, like marine blue and, and, oh,

582
00:35:11.321 --> 00:35:13.810
like artificial colors. Well, no, they're not at, if that's the thing,

583
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.450
you think they come from a factory or something.

584
00:35:16.451 --> 00:35:20.980
But originally the came from the earth. Yeah.

585
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.280
And here's one story about Carly that has haunted me for about a year and a

586
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.350
half. It's so strange. I don't know if it's true or not, but I mean, I,

587
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:36.010
I don't know if you've seen my book. Of course. That's Victoria Finley again,

588
00:35:36.011 --> 00:35:38.010
her book is called color. And this story

589
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.420
<v 0>starts with Mil, a particular kind of goop. It's a color called Gumbos.</v>

590
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.170
It's um, it's named after Cambodia, a French word for Cambodia.

591
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.410
And it comes from the SAP of a tree that grows in the Cambodia,

592
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:55.170
Vietnam, Thailand border area. And this is a yellow color

593
00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.673
[inaudible]

594
00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.410
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

595
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.680
<v 0>how you get it is really the sticky part.</v>

596
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:06.730
I mean the way they get it is that they cut a slash in the bark and then hitch

597
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:11.880
up a tube made of bamboo about the circumference of a quarter.

598
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.320
Yes. And then little droplets of goop come. A little tiny drop does a good

599
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.350
<v 1>wow.</v>

600
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:21.840
<v 0>And they fill up the tube the same way you, you know, you get maple syrup or,</v>

601
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:26.380
or rubber, but they leave it for a couple of years. Years. Yes.

602
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:28.960
<v 1>Aw.</v>

603
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.810
<v 0>All right. So it's a really slow</v>

604
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.990
process. So slow.

605
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.650
It's some pretty strange thing. Drop

606
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.490
can happen in that time. What do you mean chap has secrets?

607
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.940
Secrets. What's secrets? Wait a minute.

608
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.730
So after two long years,

609
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.590
the harvesters come back and each of those tubes is now full of this, um, quite,

610
00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.180
um, quite like plastic. It's sort of,

611
00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:03.580
it's got that sort of plastic resonate kind of feel,

612
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.260
but that's just the beginning. The resin makes this incredible transformation,

613
00:37:08.261 --> 00:37:12.010
which we actually saw Sean and I. Hello. Alright, thanks to this guy.

614
00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:16.000
My name is Charles Kramer. I'm a color man. He owns creamers,

615
00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:18.730
pigments in Manhattan and he sells this Cambos.

616
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.190
It is an important yellow,

617
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:27.430
<v 5>it's amazing when you use it powdered and the resin form because when you have a</v>

618
00:37:27.431 --> 00:37:32.430
look at it or two this year it's just like listen, the dull it creed brown.

619
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.620
<v 0>You imagine like a a ball of wax. I mean you think,</v>

620
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.080
oh that's not very interesting coming out of Dusky sort of boring color,

621
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.380
but then you put a drop of water on it or you grind it up in a bowl with a

622
00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:50.420
little water. You look on that. It looks like this blue

623
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.170
this year and there it is. There's a little bit of skips, bright,

624
00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.250
very bright yellows, bright fluorescent. Suddenly it's like how,

625
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.320
I mean it is quite an excitedly colored, very, very.

626
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.810
<v 5>I carried one around for ages. Try to have a look at this color,</v>

627
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.680
look how boring it is now put a drop of water on it showing kids and I was

628
00:38:12.681 --> 00:38:15.350
really happy. I give them, gave it to one kid and he was,

629
00:38:15.351 --> 00:38:16.310
you just said you light it.

630
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:19.230
And it was only after two that I found out that it's so dangerous. I mean, I,

631
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.850
I used dangerous, why I

632
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.800
<v 0>still get a bad eye over here</v>

633
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.280
when the guys used to chip in and small pieces,

634
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.390
there was actually a time built in from the visit the toilet at least once an

635
00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:36.130
hour. Ian Garrett knows that because he was technical at this art

636
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.950
<v 14>supply company called Windsor in Newton in England.</v>

637
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.890
And here's what really got us interested in all this.

638
00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:46.240
Back in the 1980s Winsor and Newton would get these shipments of Cambos from

639
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:49.270
Cambodia and they would take it, two of them to this production room.

640
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.480
Quite a dusty area. Just had a table in there,

641
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.540
big old table where the workers would set and then they would have this hammer

642
00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:00.970
put big ambush pieces on this lump of iron and then hit it,

643
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.920
shatter it into small pieces because that's how they make it into a kind of

644
00:39:05.921 --> 00:39:07.390
usable, solvable paint.

645
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.590
And one day one of the workers was chipping and scraping at the Renton.

646
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.720
There they were. They found something in the resin that they didn't expect.

647
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.070
They found bullets,

648
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.330
bullets like in the hunks of resin,

649
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:27.490
you're judged in them yet sometime in that two year drip drip process toward the

650
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:29.770
end probably as the resume is getting thick,

651
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.450
a bullet went whizzing through the air, went into the goop and stayed there.

652
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.700
Actually it wasn't just one bullet. Now is total amount.

653
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.990
It doesn't and those are just the ones that you found lying around the factory.

654
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:44.530
There were probably many more. They fall into two salts.

655
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.660
That's a very sharp pointed one about just over an inch long and then the other

656
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:52.060
type of a small sort of barrel shapes,

657
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.480
which are about three quarters of an inch long and half a dozen of each and how

658
00:39:58.151 --> 00:40:01.170
they got there and what they pass through on the way into the GAM. Bougie.

659
00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.013
I'm not sure

660
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.513
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

661
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.810
<v 14>Well we do know of course was that those years in Cambodia where years of war</v>

662
00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:13.660
and murder, a million and a half people die there.

663
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.190
Most of them in the killing fields.

664
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.950
And that's the same place where you'd find the Gimbutas trees.

665
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.870
It's shocking really any cause it,

666
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.610
those were just the random little bamboo tubes hanging on the trees.

667
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.230
What happened in that grove?

668
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.740
The proposition here would be that at some point,

669
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:38.340
maybe because of the famous killing fields that some 14 year olds with collision

670
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:42.990
of cough rifles after finishing a series of murders or just shot lots of people

671
00:40:42.991 --> 00:40:47.991
have just sprayed that growth in order to get into the little tiny bamboo

672
00:40:49.651 --> 00:40:51.360
canisters collecting this gun Bush,

673
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.410
they would've had to have sprayed that entire grove with machine machine gun

674
00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:59.190
bullets and in that year or two years somebody,

675
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.970
um, no ditch people I should think. Well, I mean they, they,

676
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.240
it's not necessarily a battle scenario. It could have been target practice.

677
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.470
You see these things hanging on the side of the tree. You, you,

678
00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.170
you want to practice your, uh, marksmanship.

679
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.970
But I mean there is a way in which the, there's violence in this color. I guess.

680
00:41:20.971 --> 00:41:24.420
There's fun. It makes me wonder about the, does it ever give you pause?

681
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:30.660
Did they ever give me what, sorry. Pause. Pause. No, uh,

682
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.950
not, we would too. Remote bought it from a guy in Holland, new,

683
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:41.300
bought it from an exporter who got it from Lord knows where in Cambodia,

684
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.020
but the idea that it could have been attached to

685
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.160
to that bloodshed. Does that bother you at all?

686
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.960
You're saying, do I think it's morally acceptable?

687
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.820
Is that what you're asking me? Yeah. Um, no.

688
00:41:58.821 --> 00:42:01.310
It wasn't Winsor Newton who discovered these things?

689
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.130
These things were demanded by customers.

690
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.190
You're a hard-hearted man. I feel

691
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.010
I had never thought about it until you, you pitched it like that.

692
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.950
<v 5>As we kept on talking, he made it clear.</v>

693
00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:19.590
It wasn't that he hadn't thought about the violence per se,

694
00:42:19.591 --> 00:42:22.830
it's just that it wasn't like breaking news to him.

695
00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.890
They sell some big mitts that come straight out of hills that are right in the

696
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:30.180
middle of war zones. Okay. Colors are sometimes soaked in blood.

697
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.100
That's just how it is.

698
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.660
<v 14>On the other side of the coin.</v>

699
00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:38.661
I've made it my career in 40 years to make artists paints on the basis that

700
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.100
people who paint tend not to make war.

701
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.790
It's a peaceful occupation.

702
00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:46.970
<v 15>Yeah, that is more or less what</v>

703
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:49.910
the Euston George Kremer who runs the paint shop,

704
00:42:49.911 --> 00:42:53.930
he was pretty much of the same mind. You could think of it this way.

705
00:42:53.931 --> 00:42:58.931
Imagine the first person to ever find this brilliant yellow maybe 10,000 years

706
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:00.014
ago.

707
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:05.000
He's walking through the forest after it's rained and he sees it there on a tree

708
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.991
and he's amazed,

709
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:10.490
so he puts his finger into the yellow and then Dab some on his face and he feels

710
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.670
instantly beautiful like larger than himself.

711
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:18.180
It is about being related to something 10 centers

712
00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.131
<v 4>and that's his.</v>

713
00:43:20.131 --> 00:43:24.620
George is the other side of the coin to an upper high or what ever.

714
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.780
Therefore you probably used it from all sorts of ceremonies,

715
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.670
marriages, feasts, me be warpaint to feel invincible any moment.

716
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:39.671
He suspects that needed to be pulled out of the ordinary and lifted up and there

717
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.860
the, you need something that is pride,

718
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:46.160
something what is beautiful and special.

719
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.120
And this yellow gives you something special.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:51.463
<v 0>yeah.</v>

743
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.090
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

744
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.390
<v 0>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.</v>

745
00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.470
We're going to keep going with our show on colors now with a story about, well,

746
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.340
hey blue, the color of the sky, most beautiful color. No

747
00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.780
red. Nah. Yeah, you got it.

748
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.500
<v 12>It's a story that we find really surprising frankly.</v>

749
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.600
And it comes from my producer Tim Howard. Yes. Hello. Who a heard it from?

750
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.800
Do you want it set up? Who? This guy is a.

751
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.030
So Guy Deutscher is a linguist and a writer and uh,

752
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.810
I came across his book or through the language glass and he tells us one

753
00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:28.290
particular story in it that, uh,

754
00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.090
starts in I think 1858 with this Guy William Gladstone,

755
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.570
who was incredibly famous politician in England.

756
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.030
It was four times prime minister in the second half of the 19th century.

757
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.410
Every school kid knows who he is even now.

758
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:47.580
But there's one thing that not many people know about Gladstone. Well, he was a,

759
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:48.750
a home of fanatic.

760
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.720
<v 6>Where's the soldiers marched?</v>

761
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.370
The gleam went dazzling from the magnificent bronze all about through the upper

762
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.840
air to the heavens. He was a deeply religious man. And for him,

763
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:05.841
the Elliot in Odyssey one was like a second Bible sipping the black blood.

764
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.900
The tall shade perceive me and cried out Shockley he read them over and over

765
00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:13.270
over

766
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.090
<v 12>again throughout his life. So he was in the homer. Yes.</v>

767
00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.980
And so early on in his career,

768
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:23.190
Gladstone decided to write the definitive history of Homer's huge book,

769
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.430
actually three books,

770
00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:29.460
thousands of pages where he discussed a whole range of issues to home and his

771
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.280
world. And here's the thing, as he was reading,

772
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.120
doing his research and everything, he made this very strange discovery

773
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.180
that the way home I talks about color in the Iliad and the Odyssey is extremely

774
00:47:44.181 --> 00:47:47.720
odd. It's odd. Very, very odd. How so?

775
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.590
To start with uses extremely strange terms,

776
00:47:51.591 --> 00:47:56.591
fall colors of have simple objects and most famous one perhaps is the wome dark

777
00:47:57.081 --> 00:48:01.220
sea, the wine, wine, dark wine, dark seeds. It looks like wine.

778
00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.350
Looks like wine is possibly like a, a poetic kind of thing.

779
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.760
That's what you would naturally think. But the other thing he calls, um,

780
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.420
wine color, uh, oxen,

781
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.480
but, but it's more than just a wine take the color violet,

782
00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.920
which to me and probably the USA Purple Light Purple. When homer uses it,

783
00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.980
he talks about the sheep and cyclops rams in the cyclops caves as having dark,

784
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.790
violent. Whoa. But that's just fantasy. I mean,

785
00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:35.840
but the other thing that he also says is violet is iron iron.

786
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.110
So chew on that or how about this one?

787
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:44.380
What is both the color of honey and the color of a faces Pale with fear.

788
00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.160
I had no idea. If you ask homer, those are green,

789
00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:52.970
green honey. He didn't call his forest green,

790
00:48:52.971 --> 00:48:57.460
he didn't call his leaves green. Um, it all seems to be wrong. And um,

791
00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.480
this was totally puzzling to Gladstone. Hobo was Gladstone's absolute hero.

792
00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:07.280
So he found it difficult to understand or accept why someone who was so

793
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.750
perceptive would use such defective terms as Gladston call it.

794
00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:13.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

795
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.180
<v 12>So he starts going through the Iliad and the Odyssey.</v>

796
00:49:17.181 --> 00:49:21.830
You get page by page and he counts how many times each color appears.

797
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.970
I mean like how many times he uses the word black or blue or whatever. Yeah.

798
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.963
And um,

799
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:30.320
it only takes a couple pages for him to notice the predominance of black and

800
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:35.600
white that the term black carrion flies. He's black, Brown,

801
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:37.400
black, black, black, black, black,

802
00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:41.740
black occurred about 170 times in both books. White,

803
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.430
white arms, wiped club,

804
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:47.330
the white say curd about 100 times,

805
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.820
but red,

806
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:55.050
a blood red serpent only clocks in at about 13 times the red wine to the big

807
00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.230
drop. Yellow dorm in her yellow robe under 10 times.

808
00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.920
Green's teeth chatter in green fear also under 10.

809
00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:09.170
And then Gladstone realizes something crazy. The color blue.

810
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.133
<v 1>Um,</v>

811
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.160
<v 12>the zero times what?</v>

812
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:22.870
There's just no word that describes the color blue in any of Homer's poems.

813
00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:27.470
He does not use the word blue at all. No blue, no blue.

814
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.960
Not even once. Nope. So Gladstone Thought, Huh? Bizarre. Yeah.

815
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.750
And he started looking in other classic Greek texts too.

816
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.950
And there he kept finding all of these strange uses of color,

817
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.980
violet hat and things like that.

818
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.400
And after thinking about this for a long time,

819
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.180
Gladstone concluded that homo was kind of blind,

820
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.910
but also that all the Greeks were kind of blind.

821
00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.030
He thought all of them were colorblind. Yes.

822
00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:03.410
That they saw the world in black and white, maybe with a touch of red.

823
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.820
His thought was that they were straining to see these other colors that were

824
00:51:07.821 --> 00:51:09.950
kind of just outside of their reach.

825
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:15.010
And then their kid would inherit that effort or their kid would just be a little

826
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:18.650
bit better. So that's how we got color.

827
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.310
So homer junior would be able to see a little bit of yellow because homer tried

828
00:51:22.311 --> 00:51:24.010
really hard to see yellow. And then homer,

829
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.760
the third would be better than home or the second,

830
00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.480
and then this would happen again. And again, every generation down,

831
00:51:29.481 --> 00:51:33.690
3000 years to the present day, it just seemed the only, you know, the,

832
00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:37.490
the only possible explanation bets. Ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

833
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.810
We know today of course, having that, that the, uh,

834
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:44.990
kind of vision goes back probably about 30 million years, you know,

835
00:51:44.991 --> 00:51:48.720
to like when we were still in the jungle climbing trees. Exactly. So, um,

836
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.140
generally people mock

837
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:55.023
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

838
00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.170
<v 12>No one took him seriously.</v>

839
00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.370
So then how did people explain the no blue and homer thing? Well,

840
00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:05.020
here at the plot thickens 10 years after Gladstone's homered debacle,

841
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.460
this other guy and gem and Joyce philology is called Lazarus guy again,

842
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.830
Lazarus Geiger, a German Jewish, what did he say?

843
00:52:11.831 --> 00:52:13.900
Philologists which I thought was a linguist.

844
00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.330
It basically means he studies ancient texts.

845
00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:21.550
He finds pretty much the same kind of weird stuff that Gladstone did,

846
00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:26.430
but he finds it not just in ancient Greek texts, but all over the place. Sorry,

847
00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.240
this one he looked at and the old Icelandic Sagas

848
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.560
[inaudible] ancient Chinese,

849
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:41.830
ancient vedic hymns, the Bible,

850
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.900
a Sheltie by tonight. And surprise,

851
00:52:46.901 --> 00:52:49.240
surprise what she defined there. No blue.

852
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:52.650
Even the Bible had no blue in the original Hebrew Kona.

853
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.790
It has no blue. So where, what's this? What's this room?

854
00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.800
Right now we're in the public catalog room.

855
00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:04.830
I actually went to the New York Public Library and talk to this librarian at SOA

856
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:10.330
end to Vic [inaudible] to speak German. So and fic longer shake the dementia.

857
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:14.470
And we got out Geiger's book history of mankind. Wait a second.

858
00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:18.510
I know this voice. Really, that's my girlfriend.

859
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:22.450
My name is Brooke Watkins and I'm a librarian at the New York public library.

860
00:53:22.451 --> 00:53:26.160
She helped me find some very cool passages in book suit at first.

861
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.790
<v 17>Let's do it in germ guy again. This amazing quotation. Okay.</v>

862
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:33.280
She passed about the Indian vedic poems, Ds,

863
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.940
Alita Zane towels and vans and Dalston bish Dane. What does that say?

864
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.980
She's hymns of more than 10,000 lines are brimming with descriptions of the

865
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:47.940
heavens. Scarcely is there any subject of vogue more frequently?

866
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:52.680
The Sun and reddening, dawn's play of color, day and night. Cloud and lightning.

867
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:57.690
The air in the ether and are unfolded before us and over and over and splendor

868
00:53:57.691 --> 00:53:58.860
and did it fullness.

869
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:02.790
There's only one thing that no one would ever learn from those ancient songs who

870
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:06.270
do not already know it. And that is that the sky is blue.

871
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.983
<v 18>Who? Who?</v>

872
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:10.460
<v 12>It gets weirder.</v>

873
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.720
You already and totally ready. Alright. Cause Geiger then wondered,

874
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.750
all right if there's no blue in any of these old texts,

875
00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:23.200
then when did blue come into these languages? Yeah.

876
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:28.150
So he did this massive analysis to trace when each color term was first

877
00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:29.650
introduced to each language.

878
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:34.770
And what he found was that the order at which languages seem to acquire these

879
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.720
kind of terms is not entirely random.

880
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:41.030
<v 18>[inaudible]</v>

881
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:43.850
<v 12>first black and white. Every language has black and white.</v>

882
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:48.200
Then when they get their first color term, red always comes fast.

883
00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.590
Always red after red. It's always yellow. Really? Yeah.

884
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:56.270
And then green and blue. Only the very end. So black, white, red,

885
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.780
green, yellow and then blue. Yeah. And that's universal. Well,

886
00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:03.770
as people discovered more and more languages, they found some exceptions,

887
00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:06.980
but a couple of things held even from Geiger out of these colors.

888
00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.730
Red Is always first and blue is always last. Why?

889
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.950
Well, why would there be an order at all and why would blue always be last?

890
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.240
Well, here's where you get to the guessing part. Okay.

891
00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:21.890
I think some might have to do with a couple of things. First in Homer's world,

892
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:25.400
you wouldn't have actually been exposed to a lot of blue things. Actually,

893
00:55:25.401 --> 00:55:30.170
if you think about it, blue is extremely rare in nature. Blue foods,

894
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.370
no blue animals. And how about plants?

895
00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.670
There's a few blue plants like what I flowers that are really blue eyes.

896
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:41.270
Extremely rare. A lot of flowers that we think of as blue.

897
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.970
They're actually artificial flowers. We made them blue. Ah, genetically man.

898
00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.650
Yeah. What about Blue Eyes? Blue Eyes at the time. Way In short supply, um,

899
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.050
among the Greeks. But here's where we get the guy's main point.

900
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:59.690
He says you don't really need a word for a color until you can make that color

901
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.310
reliably. And the reason they're red might've been first is that red is a,

902
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:06.500
frankly one of the easiest to produce.

903
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.770
You can just take a dried piece of red clay and you can use that as a Korean,

904
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.180
which is why paints made out of oak or go back something like 60,000 years.

905
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:19.430
And blue blue is the hardest of all. Um, for thousands of years,

906
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.640
no one had it. One exception, the Egyptians, the Egyptians, and they,

907
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:29.380
and only they had their own word for blue. So that's it. That's your answer.

908
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.280
Yeah. Like no blue dyes. No blue words.

909
00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.630
That's not interesting. I want more than that. What do you mean more?

910
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.610
I don't know. Something more to say than just, it's about,

911
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.800
<v 2>there you go.</v>

912
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.670
<v 12>As I was calling around,</v>

913
00:56:46.671 --> 00:56:51.500
I ran into something that made me think a little differently about Gladstone's

914
00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:55.820
whole theory of colorblindness call. This guy named Jules Davidoff,

915
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:58.710
<v 15>professor of newest psychology, London University.</v>

916
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:03.510
<v 12>And a few years back he got interested in this particular tribe in Namibia</v>

917
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.620
called the Himba.

918
00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.900
<v 15>Not many languages in the world. They don't have a different word for blue.</v>

919
00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:12.450
<v 12>You might think of them as like a very poor stand in for homer. Alright,</v>

920
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.850
and to make a long story short, Joseph went to Namibia.

921
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:17.340
He sat down with a bunch of members of the Himba tribe,

922
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.620
whipped out a laptop and showed them 12 colored squares for one.

923
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.160
And there's actually some really cool video footage of his research assistant

924
00:57:26.161 --> 00:57:28.980
doing this. And they asked them very simply,

925
00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.780
which one is different now that you look at this and you see the 11 of these

926
00:57:33.781 --> 00:57:36.930
squares are green. My colleague, we would call Glee, very green,

927
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:42.030
and the other one is blue. This blue one, it's shouting. It's like, Hey,

928
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.220
I'm mu over here. I'm blue.

929
00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:48.720
<v 15>It's easy enough for us to do. It's a no brainer,</v>

930
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.600
but the Himba who don't have a separate word for blue in their language,

931
00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:56.670
they find this distinction and it's difficult. When they stare at this screen,

932
00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.050
they just stare and stare.

933
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.980
They don't see the difference in the green. No. Well,

934
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.350
was there something wrong with their eyes? No, definitely not.

935
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:09.120
We completely blew that out.

936
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:12.150
They don't see color and individual colors differently,

937
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:17.330
but then way it's so easy to say that they're seeing different colors to us and

938
00:58:18.421 --> 00:58:22.320
then not, well then how does he explain it? Okay. When we,

939
00:58:22.321 --> 00:58:27.321
when we decide to put colors together in a group and then give those colors a

940
00:58:28.141 --> 00:58:31.890
word like blue, something happens. He says,

941
00:58:31.891 --> 00:58:34.890
what happens is that now that there's a category for that thing,

942
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:36.420
the thing in the category

943
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:40.920
<v 12>out, it gets louder and louder to your eyes.</v>

944
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:45.780
The category actually feeds back on your perception. So you notice it more.

945
00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:51.690
You're saying that having the word for blue unlocks your ability to see blue.

946
00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:55.260
I mean it, that's how it feels to me. And Joel says, no,

947
00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.600
no car that he says without the word,

948
00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:01.470
you're still seeing the blue no matter what. You're just not. Um,

949
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:02.790
noticing it.

950
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.930
Your eyes are just kind of glossing right over it so you don't see it.

951
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:12.990
It's, it's, it's, it's harder to spot. It says jewels, whatever.

952
00:59:12.991 --> 00:59:14.370
I don't quite understand that difference.

953
00:59:14.371 --> 00:59:18.930
But in blue would not jump out and say high five the way it does with us.

954
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.390
But if it doesn't jump out to that extent,

955
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.460
then this is starting to sound very Gladstone. He to me,

956
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.170
I mean maybe he was a little right. Like,

957
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:31.910
cause if homer had no word for blue and the word somehow enables the blueness of

958
00:59:31.911 --> 00:59:36.440
the blue, then maybe his world was less blue than it would be for us. I mean,

959
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:38.510
maybe the blue went through his eyes in the same way,

960
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:42.200
but perhaps didn't get into his mind in the same way. Yeah.

961
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.230
Blue didn't matter.

962
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:49.690
Wait a second. Do you know where this breaks down?

963
00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:54.370
Where the sky, I mean,

964
00:59:54.371 --> 00:59:57.220
you look up and there's the bluest blue in the world and then it's right there

965
00:59:57.221 --> 00:59:59.440
above our head. It's been there since the dawn of time.

966
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.860
So why wouldn't blue matter more? I mean,

967
01:00:02.861 --> 01:00:05.770
why wouldn't it be the first color instead of the last? Well,

968
01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:09.500
that's what I thought too. And I ask guy about that. Yeah. Why is the sky blue?

969
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.430
Is, is the, the,

970
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:14.990
the first question that be the first question that all children ask. Yeah.

971
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:19.850
But I wanted to see how obvious or striking this blueness of the skies.

972
01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.380
So I decided to make an experiment.

973
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:23.293
<v 19>Uh,</v>

974
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:28.110
<v 12>guy has a very young daughter, but 18 months she was learning to speak.</v>

975
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.223
What's her name?

976
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:34.080
[inaudible] I talked a lot about colors with Ama and taught her all the colors,

977
01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:34.920
including blue.

978
01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.610
And we would play all these games then that dads play with the children,

979
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:42.480
you know, pointing at objects. I would point it to a blue object and ask him,

980
01:00:42.481 --> 01:00:47.010
what's the color of this? You'd say boo boo for blue. Uh, okay. Soon enough,

981
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.120
Alma was a total pro. She could identify any color, show me the red object,

982
01:00:51.121 --> 01:00:53.790
show me that this. And the only thing I didn't do,

983
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.170
and I asked my wife not to do was ever mentioned that the sky was blue.

984
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:02.810
That was the setup. So one day guy in Elmo,

985
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:06.520
we're taking a stroll and they're practicing the colors. What's this tree?

986
01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:09.570
What's this, what's this? And then I pointed at the sky and said,

987
01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.400
what kind of is that?

988
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.380
And she wouldn't give me any answer. Huh.

989
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:20.460
Although she just a second before would was happily telling me that something

990
01:01:20.461 --> 01:01:21.810
was blue on red or green.

991
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:26.970
She just looked up and looked at me in comprehending Lee sort of,

992
01:01:26.971 --> 01:01:28.920
what are you talking about? She thought you're kidding.

993
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.520
I think she didn't understand what I was on about. Huh? In retrospect,

994
01:01:32.521 --> 01:01:35.970
there was no object that there was nothing with color for her.

995
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.540
You're just pointing into the void, basically pointing into nothingness.

996
01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.310
So she wouldn't say anything,

997
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.670
but guy kept asking every single time they went out.

998
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:47.040
Of course I would do it only when the sky was blue and she would never answer.

999
01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:49.200
And this one on for two months.

1000
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:52.980
And then finally you did consent to give me a color name, but it wasn't blue.

1001
01:01:52.981 --> 01:01:57.150
It was white for four a few times you said white.

1002
01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.700
And then finally after a month and a half or two moments, she,

1003
01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.690
she said blue for the first time. Wow.

1004
01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:08.550
Even then it wasn't consistently blue. So she then she said once blue,

1005
01:02:08.610 --> 01:02:13.080
no white, no blue. Did she eventually decide though? You know what,

1006
01:02:13.081 --> 01:02:15.810
that is blue. Well, no, she never said it this way,

1007
01:02:15.811 --> 01:02:19.500
but eventually when I asked it became consistently it.

1008
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:21.660
So she just would say blue. Okay.

1009
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.180
This was for me really the point why I could, you know,

1010
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.720
convince myself or to convince,

1011
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:32.610
at least in my heart that this sort of allegedly perfect example of blue,

1012
01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:37.230
um, is not so perfect. So, you know, for Houma, who, you know,

1013
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:42.030
never ever probably saw a blue object except the sky and the sea.

1014
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.860
Never had a dad who sort of went on and bought blue objects and asking what the

1015
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:50.040
color of the sky was. The fact that he didn't lose sleep over.

1016
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:53.100
It doesn't seem so strange anymore.

1017
01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:59.330
<v 10>You know, it's kind of, it's a, now that I've heard this, I'm a little,</v>

1018
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:02.930
I'm a little, uh, ruining the,

1019
01:03:02.931 --> 01:03:05.060
the moment when Alma decided to sky was blue,

1020
01:03:05.061 --> 01:03:06.830
let her have whatever color she wants it to be.

1021
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:11.900
Doesn't have to be blue weirdly then color is a loss of innocence.

1022
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.750
Yeah. It's Kinda like having something fixed.

1023
01:03:14.751 --> 01:03:19.280
That for awhile is just between you and your friends.

1024
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:22.100
Heat harsh, you know, just this guy has many colors. Truthfully.

1025
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.070
On the other hand though, I'm disagreeing with myself now.

1026
01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.810
If we all agree the sky is blue,

1027
01:03:26.811 --> 01:03:29.300
then that's something we can share that she can share.

1028
01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:33.620
And then she's in conversation and then eventually she'll understand, you know,

1029
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:34.603
this kind of blue

1030
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.263
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1031
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.930
<v 10>yeah, there aren't, but there,</v>

1032
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.770
but you know what one would know what it feels like. Yeah. Not a happy night.

1033
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.853
