00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389
all right so we've got a sphere it's

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
all right so we've got a sphere it's
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.010
all right so we've got a sphere it's
sort of a shell or a sphere and then

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020
sort of a shell or a sphere and then
 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.809
sort of a shell or a sphere and then
there's a thing for it to stand on

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819
there's a thing for it to stand on
 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.120
there's a thing for it to stand on
little base there's a hole on top and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
little base there's a hole on top and
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.919
little base there's a hole on top and
there's this pattern this cool pattern

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929
there's this pattern this cool pattern
 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.810
there's this pattern this cool pattern
sort of Pentagon's and so on and I've

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
sort of Pentagon's and so on and I've
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509
sort of Pentagon's and so on and I've
got a flashlight or torch if you haven't

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
got a flashlight or torch if you haven't
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.860
got a flashlight or torch if you haven't
been in America for too long you can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870
been in America for too long you can
 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.269
been in America for too long you can
take the the sort of lens off and you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279
take the the sort of lens off and you
 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980
take the the sort of lens off and you
just get like a it's supposed to be like

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
just get like a it's supposed to be like
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.230
just get like a it's supposed to be like
like it's like a candle or something but

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
like it's like a candle or something but
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.259
like it's like a candle or something but
what I want to use it for is to show

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
what I want to use it for is to show
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.480
what I want to use it for is to show
this thing stereographic projection so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
this thing stereographic projection so
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.380
this thing stereographic projection so
if I put the lights right at the North

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
if I put the lights right at the North
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020
if I put the lights right at the North
Pole of the sphere then you get this

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
Pole of the sphere then you get this
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630
Pole of the sphere then you get this
pattern of shadows so right so what is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
pattern of shadows so right so what is
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880
pattern of shadows so right so what is
geographic projection it's a map from

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
geographic projection it's a map from
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.790
geographic projection it's a map from
the sphere to the plane and the light

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
the sphere to the plane and the light
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400
the sphere to the plane and the light
rays sort of do that map a light ray

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
rays sort of do that map a light ray
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.610
rays sort of do that map a light ray
comes from the North Pole and let's say

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
comes from the North Pole and let's say
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.459
comes from the North Pole and let's say
this one here right so it hits the point

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
this one here right so it hits the point
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.900
this one here right so it hits the point
on the sphere here and it goes down to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
on the sphere here and it goes down to
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.900
on the sphere here and it goes down to
the the table here to the plane so you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
the the table here to the plane so you
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150
the the table here to the plane so you
can see like if I put my little finger

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
can see like if I put my little finger
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430
can see like if I put my little finger
near to this point on the sea you can

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
near to this point on the sea you can
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680
near to this point on the sea you can
see the shadow on the plane is where

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
see the shadow on the plane is where
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420
see the shadow on the plane is where
it's where it's going to it was one of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
it's where it's going to it was one of
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160
it's where it's going to it was one of
the first way that people thought about

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
the first way that people thought about
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.649
the first way that people thought about
like maps of the earth or the heavens

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
like maps of the earth or the heavens
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.240
like maps of the earth or the heavens
where the celestial stuff so the Greeks

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
where the celestial stuff so the Greeks
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980
where the celestial stuff so the Greeks
knew about this stuff and all of the old

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
knew about this stuff and all of the old
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929
knew about this stuff and all of the old
kind of star maps are done with

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
kind of star maps are done with
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940
kind of star maps are done with
stereographic projection so one of the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
stereographic projection so one of the
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.260
stereographic projection so one of the
things that's really cool about it is it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270
things that's really cool about it is it
 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660
things that's really cool about it is it
preserves angles and you can see on this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
preserves angles and you can see on this
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.440
preserves angles and you can see on this
model is always like three or six 60

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
model is always like three or six 60
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270
model is always like three or six 60
degree angles here it's like it's like a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
degree angles here it's like it's like a
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490
degree angles here it's like it's like a
radiation symbol here and the shadow has

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
radiation symbol here and the shadow has
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.920
radiation symbol here and the shadow has
these 60 degree angles and the sphere

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
these 60 degree angles and the sphere
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899
these 60 degree angles and the sphere
also has those 60 degree angles so not

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
also has those 60 degree angles so not
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.760
also has those 60 degree angles so not
only does it preserve angles like angles

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
only does it preserve angles like angles
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890
only does it preserve angles like angles
stay the same it also preserves circles

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
stay the same it also preserves circles
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.039
stay the same it also preserves circles
you can see on this as all these great

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
you can see on this as all these great
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440
you can see on this as all these great
circles like an equator of the sphere

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
circles like an equator of the sphere
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149
circles like an equator of the sphere
well actually this one doesn't have an

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
well actually this one doesn't have an
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830
well actually this one doesn't have an
equator if this is North Pole those and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
equator if this is North Pole those and
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780
equator if this is North Pole those and
then quite a drawn in but like the path

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
then quite a drawn in but like the path
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399
then quite a drawn in but like the path
that you take if you just start setting

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
that you take if you just start setting
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660
that you take if you just start setting
in a straight line around the Earth is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
in a straight line around the Earth is
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210
in a straight line around the Earth is
this circle that's like an equator if

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
this circle that's like an equator if
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.280
this circle that's like an equator if
you look at where is this path on down

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
you look at where is this path on down
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499
you look at where is this path on down
on the shadow think it's this one here

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
on the shadow think it's this one here
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819
on the shadow think it's this one here
and you'll see that it's a circle there

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
and you'll see that it's a circle there
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.670
and you'll see that it's a circle there
as well so to see the circles a little

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
as well so to see the circles a little
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.959
as well so to see the circles a little
bit better maybe let's let's have a look

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
bit better maybe let's let's have a look
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760
bit better maybe let's let's have a look
at this one it's got circle the place is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
at this one it's got circle the place is
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469
at this one it's got circle the place is
kind of like a dodecahedron I

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
kind of like a dodecahedron I
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.749
kind of like a dodecahedron I
coffee-drinking with circles let's see

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
coffee-drinking with circles let's see
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059
coffee-drinking with circles let's see
what kind of shadow this makes and if I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
what kind of shadow this makes and if I
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.260
what kind of shadow this makes and if I
hold the light in the right place you

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
hold the light in the right place you
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.199
hold the light in the right place you
can see so this circle up here

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209
can see so this circle up here
 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.500
can see so this circle up here
goes to this circle down here so yes

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
goes to this circle down here so yes
 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.839
goes to this circle down here so yes
somehow it knows that circles are

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849
somehow it knows that circles are
 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:19.949
somehow it knows that circles are
supposed to be circles even though

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
supposed to be circles even though
 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.970
supposed to be circles even though
things are getting kind of weirdly

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
things are getting kind of weirdly
 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.399
things are getting kind of weirdly
distorted right the size of the circles

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409
distorted right the size of the circles
 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.069
distorted right the size of the circles
changes a lot on the plane they're all

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079
changes a lot on the plane they're all
 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.289
changes a lot on the plane they're all
the same size on the spherical but it

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299
the same size on the spherical but it
 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.550
the same size on the spherical but it
still knows that they should be circles

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560
still knows that they should be circles
 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.170
still knows that they should be circles
right I mean you know if you move it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
right I mean you know if you move it
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.390
right I mean you know if you move it
somewhere else then like it has to be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400
somewhere else then like it has to be
 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.890
somewhere else then like it has to be
right at the North Pole sit to work in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
right at the North Pole sit to work in
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390
right at the North Pole sit to work in
the same thing with the angles there's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400
the same thing with the angles there's
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.069
the same thing with the angles there's
not as a North Pole it's not serigraph a

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079
not as a North Pole it's not serigraph a
 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.839
not as a North Pole it's not serigraph a
projection doesn't have all these nice

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849
projection doesn't have all these nice
 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.690
projection doesn't have all these nice
properties so here's a yet another right

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
properties so here's a yet another right
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.940
properties so here's a yet another right
pattern on a sphere which is sort of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
pattern on a sphere which is sort of
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.729
pattern on a sphere which is sort of
weird curvy thing going on so well

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739
weird curvy thing going on so well
 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.259
weird curvy thing going on so well
what's this going to make you may be

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269
what's this going to make you may be
 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.509
what's this going to make you may be
surprised well let's find out and put

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519
surprised well let's find out and put
 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.780
surprised well let's find out and put
this in there's this perfectly regular

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
this in there's this perfectly regular
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.030
this in there's this perfectly regular
square grid hiding inside of this really

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
square grid hiding inside of this really
 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640
square grid hiding inside of this really
curvy round thing well the way I made

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
curvy round thing well the way I made
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.229
curvy round thing well the way I made
this is I started with the square grid

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239
this is I started with the square grid
 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.640
this is I started with the square grid
and then I put it back up onto the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650
and then I put it back up onto the
 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.199
and then I put it back up onto the
sphere to see what's going on so I could

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209
sphere to see what's going on so I could
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.119
sphere to see what's going on so I could
just continue making this square grid

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129
just continue making this square grid
 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.190
just continue making this square grid
going further and further out and then

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200
going further and further out and then
 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.470
going further and further out and then
I'm going to get closer and closer into

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm going to get closer and closer into
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.179
I'm going to get closer and closer into
the North Pole but I'll never actually

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189
the North Pole but I'll never actually
 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.920
the North Pole but I'll never actually
get to the North Pole like the North

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930
get to the North Pole like the North
 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.379
get to the North Pole like the North
Pole somehow corresponds to going

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389
Pole somehow corresponds to going
 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.210
Pole somehow corresponds to going
infinitely far out this way

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220
infinitely far out this way
 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.360
infinitely far out this way
going infinitely many squares eventually

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370
going infinitely many squares eventually
 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.649
going infinitely many squares eventually
well I wouldn't ever get to the North

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659
well I wouldn't ever get to the North
 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.420
well I wouldn't ever get to the North
fault but that's what the North Pole

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430
fault but that's what the North Pole
 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.949
fault but that's what the North Pole
corresponds to the North Pole isn't

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959
corresponds to the North Pole isn't
 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.319
corresponds to the North Pole isn't
there it's a once one thing every point

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329
there it's a once one thing every point
 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.119
there it's a once one thing every point
on the sphere gets a point on the plane

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129
on the sphere gets a point on the plane
 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.939
on the sphere gets a point on the plane
apart from the North Pole so so the

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949
apart from the North Pole so so the
 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.819
apart from the North Pole so so the
plane plus one point at infinity

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829
plane plus one point at infinity
 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.339
plane plus one point at infinity
infinitely far away is the same as the

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349
infinitely far away is the same as the
 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.869
infinitely far away is the same as the
sphere this is a two-dimensional surface

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879
sphere this is a two-dimensional surface
 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.670
sphere this is a two-dimensional surface
goes through the two-dimensional plane

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
goes through the two-dimensional plane
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.610
goes through the two-dimensional plane
let's go one dimension down let's do

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
let's go one dimension down let's do
 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.780
let's go one dimension down let's do
that so the equivalent of the sphere the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790
that so the equivalent of the sphere the
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.009
that so the equivalent of the sphere the
2-dimensional sphere is the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019
2-dimensional sphere is the
 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.749
2-dimensional sphere is the
one-dimensional circle right it looks

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:51.759
one-dimensional circle right it looks
 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.979
one-dimensional circle right it looks
like a line if you just look at the

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989
like a line if you just look at the
 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.289
like a line if you just look at the
pieces let's do all the the table and

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299
pieces let's do all the the table and
 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.809
pieces let's do all the the table and
then my light is going to be here at the

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819
then my light is going to be here at the
 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.270
then my light is going to be here at the
North Pole of this circle right a circle

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280
North Pole of this circle right a circle
 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.679
North Pole of this circle right a circle
is sort of a one dimensional version of

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689
is sort of a one dimensional version of
 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:03.839
is sort of a one dimensional version of
the of the sphere and so you know a

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849
the of the sphere and so you know a
 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.119
the of the sphere and so you know a
light ray comes down here and it hits

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129
light ray comes down here and it hits
 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.920
light ray comes down here and it hits
the sphere somewhere and hits the plane

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930
the sphere somewhere and hits the plane
 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.969
the sphere somewhere and hits the plane
somewhere and that's the map

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979
somewhere and that's the map
 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:10.649
somewhere and that's the map
stereographic projection takes you from

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659
stereographic projection takes you from
 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.219
stereographic projection takes you from
here to here and so you know what we

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229
here to here and so you know what we
 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.319
here to here and so you know what we
were doing is okay squares are marching

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329
were doing is okay squares are marching
 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.779
were doing is okay squares are marching
off this way and like you know there's

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789
off this way and like you know there's
 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.759
off this way and like you know there's
there's another Square and so there's

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769
there's another Square and so there's
 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.250
there's another Square and so there's
another line that goes out here and the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260
another line that goes out here and the
 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.110
another line that goes out here and the
corresponding point on the sphere gets

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
corresponding point on the sphere gets
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.519
corresponding point on the sphere gets
closer to the North Pole and you get

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:26.529
closer to the North Pole and you get
 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.080
closer to the North Pole and you get
closer

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090
closer
 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.670
closer
and this line goes off and you get

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680
and this line goes off and you get
 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.220
and this line goes off and you get
closer when this line goes off but you

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230
closer when this line goes off but you
 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.620
closer when this line goes off but you
never like nor full itself is somehow

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630
never like nor full itself is somehow
 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.340
never like nor full itself is somehow
like infinitely far away circle same

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350
like infinitely far away circle same
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.890
like infinitely far away circle same
thing as the line plus a point and then

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
thing as the line plus a point and then
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.659
thing as the line plus a point and then
we had the sphere in ordinary

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669
we had the sphere in ordinary
 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.300
we had the sphere in ordinary
three-dimensional space is the same

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310
three-dimensional space is the same
 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.150
three-dimensional space is the same
thing as the two dimensional plane plus

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160
thing as the two dimensional plane plus
 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.430
thing as the two dimensional plane plus
one point the North Pole infinitely far

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440
one point the North Pole infinitely far
 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.070
one point the North Pole infinitely far
away spear in two-dimensional space

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080
away spear in two-dimensional space
 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.040

sphere in three-dimensional space sphere

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050
sphere in three-dimensional space sphere
 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.250
sphere in three-dimensional space sphere
in 4-dimensional space okay so if we're

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260
in 4-dimensional space okay so if we're
 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.320
in 4-dimensional space okay so if we're
in four dimensional space we can still

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330
in four dimensional space we can still
 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.480
in four dimensional space we can still
measure things and we can still say the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490
measure things and we can still say the
 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.310
measure things and we can still say the
sphere right it's the thing which is the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320
sphere right it's the thing which is the
 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.900
sphere right it's the thing which is the
set of points which are at some distance

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910
set of points which are at some distance
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.270
set of points which are at some distance
from the center and we can't see it you

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280
from the center and we can't see it you
 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.620
from the center and we can't see it you
can't you know this is four dimensional

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630
can't you know this is four dimensional
 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.680
can't you know this is four dimensional
but same thing the sphere is the same

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690
but same thing the sphere is the same
 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.260
but same thing the sphere is the same
thing as the three dimensional plane

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270
thing as the three dimensional plane
 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.790
thing as the three dimensional plane
space whatever plus the point at

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800
space whatever plus the point at
 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.790
space whatever plus the point at
infinity so or in other words I can't

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800
infinity so or in other words I can't
 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.500
infinity so or in other words I can't
show you this sphere in 4-dimensional

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510
show you this sphere in 4-dimensional
 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.680
show you this sphere in 4-dimensional
space but I can show you the shadow the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690
space but I can show you the shadow the
 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.029
space but I can show you the shadow the
shadow is going to be a three

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039
shadow is going to be a three
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.909
shadow is going to be a three
dimensional thing so we can see it but

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919
dimensional thing so we can see it but
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.219
dimensional thing so we can see it but
we can 3d print it or we can do computer

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229
we can 3d print it or we can do computer
 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.960
we can 3d print it or we can do computer
animations or something it gets give you

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970
animations or something it gets give you
 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.580
animations or something it gets give you
some idea of what this thing in four

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590
some idea of what this thing in four
 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.740
some idea of what this thing in four
dimensions is so here what were we doing

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
dimensions is so here what were we doing
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.379
dimensions is so here what were we doing
we were like drawing squares on the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389
we were like drawing squares on the
 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.270
we were like drawing squares on the
sphere and three dimensional spacemen

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280
sphere and three dimensional spacemen
 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.830
sphere and three dimensional spacemen
casting the shadow so we're going to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840
casting the shadow so we're going to
 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.810
casting the shadow so we're going to
draw something else on the sphere in

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820
draw something else on the sphere in
 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.050
draw something else on the sphere in
4-dimensional space and cast a shadow so

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060
4-dimensional space and cast a shadow so
 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.290
4-dimensional space and cast a shadow so
what are we going to be drawing monkeys

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
what are we going to be drawing monkeys
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.050
what are we going to be drawing monkeys
so this is a like a monkey design like

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060
so this is a like a monkey design like
 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.940
so this is a like a monkey design like
so so you're sketchy of sketching

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950
so so you're sketchy of sketching
 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.740
so so you're sketchy of sketching
something on the surface of this sphere

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750
something on the surface of this sphere
 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.659
something on the surface of this sphere
so just like you know you're drawing

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669
so just like you know you're drawing
 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.100
so just like you know you're drawing
some two-dimensional picture here I need

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110
some two-dimensional picture here I need
 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.719
some two-dimensional picture here I need
to draw a three-dimensional picture on

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729
to draw a three-dimensional picture on
 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.000
to draw a three-dimensional picture on
this sphere in 4-dimensional space and

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010
this sphere in 4-dimensional space and
 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.560
this sphere in 4-dimensional space and
the three-dimensional picture I'm going

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570
the three-dimensional picture I'm going
 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.800
the three-dimensional picture I'm going
to draw is this monkey or it's going to

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810
to draw is this monkey or it's going to
 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.690
to draw is this monkey or it's going to
be a slightly distorted version of this

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700
be a slightly distorted version of this
 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.640
be a slightly distorted version of this
monkey so what what could you draw it

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650
monkey so what what could you draw it
 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.230
monkey so what what could you draw it
with like like three-dimensional paint

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240
with like like three-dimensional paint
 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.050
with like like three-dimensional paint
well yeah I mean like like the sphere in

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060
well yeah I mean like like the sphere in
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.190
well yeah I mean like like the sphere in
4-dimensional spaces of

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200
4-dimensional spaces of
 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.659
4-dimensional spaces of
three-dimensional things so anything

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669
three-dimensional things so anything
 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.370
three-dimensional things so anything
free dimensional you can put it on there

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380
free dimensional you can put it on there
 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.570
free dimensional you can put it on there
in the same way for anything

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580
in the same way for anything
 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.650
in the same way for anything
two-dimensional on a two-dimensional

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660
two-dimensional on a two-dimensional
 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.839
two-dimensional on a two-dimensional
sphere surface whatever so really this

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849
sphere surface whatever so really this
 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.200
sphere surface whatever so really this
is drawn on one cubical side of a

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210
is drawn on one cubical side of a
 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.010
is drawn on one cubical side of a
hypercube whatever and then it gets sort

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020
hypercube whatever and then it gets sort
 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.920
hypercube whatever and then it gets sort
of really projected out onto the sphere

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
of really projected out onto the sphere
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.640
of really projected out onto the sphere
in for

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650
in for
 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.680
in for
no space once you're on the sphere then

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690
no space once you're on the sphere then
 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.510
no space once you're on the sphere then
we can do this stereographic projection

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520
we can do this stereographic projection
 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.920
we can do this stereographic projection
make a three-dimensional shadow of it in

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
make a three-dimensional shadow of it in
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.700
make a three-dimensional shadow of it in
three-dimensional space which we can see

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710
three-dimensional space which we can see
 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.650
three-dimensional space which we can see
this is the monkey inside of one cube of

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660
this is the monkey inside of one cube of
 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.350
this is the monkey inside of one cube of
the hypercube and he's so this this cube

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360
the hypercube and he's so this this cube
 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.060
the hypercube and he's so this this cube
has six neighbors so this monkey needs

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070
has six neighbors so this monkey needs
 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.770
has six neighbors so this monkey needs
six neighbors and they're all kind of

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780
six neighbors and they're all kind of
 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.719
six neighbors and they're all kind of
like twisting around in various ways

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729
like twisting around in various ways
 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.700
like twisting around in various ways
this is showing kind of some kind of

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710
this is showing kind of some kind of
 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.439
this is showing kind of some kind of
crazy four-dimensional symmetry group

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449
crazy four-dimensional symmetry group
 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.050
crazy four-dimensional symmetry group
that's why the monkey is there is it's a

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060
that's why the monkey is there is it's a
 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.240
that's why the monkey is there is it's a
motif that's showing this symmetry we

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250
motif that's showing this symmetry we
 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.219
motif that's showing this symmetry we
get our four-dimensional flashlight

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229
get our four-dimensional flashlight
 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.020
get our four-dimensional flashlight
and/or torch whatever depending on your

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030
and/or torch whatever depending on your
 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.960
and/or torch whatever depending on your
Commonwealth status and you project it

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:14.970
Commonwealth status and you project it
 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.409
Commonwealth status and you project it
down to three dimensional space and we

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419
down to three dimensional space and we
 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.060
down to three dimensional space and we
see what it looks like we can figure it

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070
see what it looks like we can figure it
 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.830
see what it looks like we can figure it
out and we can see it without poor

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840
out and we can see it without poor
 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.510
out and we can see it without poor
three-dimensional brains that can't deal

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520
three-dimensional brains that can't deal
 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.580
three-dimensional brains that can't deal
with four-dimensional stuff there are

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590
with four-dimensional stuff there are
 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.930
with four-dimensional stuff there are
people who claim they can see in four

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940
people who claim they can see in four
 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.189
people who claim they can see in four
dimensions but I think they're lying

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199
dimensions but I think they're lying
 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.719
dimensions but I think they're lying
right so this is eight monkeys

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729
right so this is eight monkeys
 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:35.930
right so this is eight monkeys
I'm a showing this particular kind of

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940
I'm a showing this particular kind of
 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.510
I'm a showing this particular kind of
four-dimensional symmetry so maybe you

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520
four-dimensional symmetry so maybe you
 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.670
four-dimensional symmetry so maybe you
can see this was like there's a ring of

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680
can see this was like there's a ring of
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.610
can see this was like there's a ring of
for monkeys one two three four going

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620
for monkeys one two three four going
 

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.129
for monkeys one two three four going
around like this and they're all sort of

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139
around like this and they're all sort of
 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:48.170
around like this and they're all sort of
standing on each other's heads and then

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.180
standing on each other's heads and then
 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.580
standing on each other's heads and then
there's another ring of four monkeys

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590
there's another ring of four monkeys
 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.129
there's another ring of four monkeys
that go through here one two three four

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139
that go through here one two three four
 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.409
that go through here one two three four
and there's a particular kind of sort of

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419
and there's a particular kind of sort of
 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:58.310
and there's a particular kind of sort of
twisting symmetry that sends like this

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.320
twisting symmetry that sends like this
 

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.899
twisting symmetry that sends like this

this month in it and they kind of screw

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500
this month in it and they kind of screw
 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.000
this month in it and they kind of screw
twist around as you go through there's

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010
twist around as you go through there's
 

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.860
twist around as you go through there's
an animation you'll show the animation

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:06.870
an animation you'll show the animation
 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:12.290
an animation you'll show the animation
maybe we'll make sense really right some

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300
maybe we'll make sense really right some
 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.089
maybe we'll make sense really right some
people get like really weirded out by

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099
people get like really weirded out by
 

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:15.800
people get like really weirded out by
this they date they like you know this

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:15.810
this they date they like you know this
 

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.510
this they date they like you know this
is they're sort of disturbing the shapes

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520
is they're sort of disturbing the shapes
 

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.879
is they're sort of disturbing the shapes
of them but it's just math like this is

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:19.889
of them but it's just math like this is
 

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:21.800
of them but it's just math like this is
just what it does for the monkey there's

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:21.810
just what it does for the monkey there's
 

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.070
just what it does for the monkey there's
no emotional content intended take some

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080
no emotional content intended take some
 

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.330
no emotional content intended take some
it what you will I guess that's not

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340
it what you will I guess that's not
 

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.610
it what you will I guess that's not
right you can do whatever you want with

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620
right you can do whatever you want with
 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.320
right you can do whatever you want with
it it's your fault you gave them the

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.330
it it's your fault you gave them the
 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.820
it it's your fault you gave them the
horrific faces though that's not the

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:31.830
horrific faces though that's not the
 

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.880
horrific faces though that's not the
fault of math you fuck he's happy look

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:34.890
fault of math you fuck he's happy look
 

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.219
fault of math you fuck he's happy look
at this happy monkey I mean maybe he's a

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
at this happy monkey I mean maybe he's a
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.500
at this happy monkey I mean maybe he's a
little bit annoyed that his his friend

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.510
little bit annoyed that his his friend
 

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.550
little bit annoyed that his his friend
is standing on his head but so this is

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560
is standing on his head but so this is
 

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.440
is standing on his head but so this is
the fun part so this is a this is a fun

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.450
the fun part so this is a this is a fun
 

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.300
the fun part so this is a this is a fun
story actually just oh yeah well

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.310
story actually just oh yeah well
 

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.240
story actually just oh yeah well
actually so oh it's still going yeah so

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.250
actually so oh it's still going yeah so
 

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.370
actually so oh it's still going yeah so
so they're printed right 3d printed in

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380
so they're printed right 3d printed in
 

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:52.940
so they're printed right 3d printed in
is

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:52.950
is
 

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.620
is
they would like plastic dust that gets

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:54.630
they would like plastic dust that gets
 

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.950
they would like plastic dust that gets
melted they're Hollow but in shipping

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:57.960
melted they're Hollow but in shipping
 

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.070
melted they're Hollow but in shipping
some dust gets shaken out so they you

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080
some dust gets shaken out so they you
 

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.480
some dust gets shaken out so they you
know gradually sort of lose dust we can

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:04.490
know gradually sort of lose dust we can
 

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.650
know gradually sort of lose dust we can
yeah everything gets covered in white

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660
yeah everything gets covered in white
 

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.570
yeah everything gets covered in white
das that's from the 4th to me it is it

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580
das that's from the 4th to me it is it
 

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.660
das that's from the 4th to me it is it
is is four dimensional monkey dust now I

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:11.670
is is four dimensional monkey dust now I
 

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.360
is is four dimensional monkey dust now I
could have made this less of a problem

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:16.370
could have made this less of a problem
 

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.700
could have made this less of a problem
that the issue is like the mouth is the

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:19.710
that the issue is like the mouth is the
 

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.740
that the issue is like the mouth is the
only exit hole right if there were two

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:21.750
only exit hole right if there were two
 

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.390
only exit hole right if there were two
exit holes in the monkey then you could

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:23.400
exit holes in the monkey then you could
 

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.920
exit holes in the monkey then you could
blow air through it and blow all the

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:24.930
blow air through it and blow all the
 

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.960
blow air through it and blow all the
dust out but where are you going to put

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:26.970
dust out but where are you going to put
 

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.930
dust out but where are you going to put
another hole in the monkey I mean you

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940
another hole in the monkey I mean you
 

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.730
another hole in the monkey I mean you
already have monkey butts all it like

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740
already have monkey butts all it like
 

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.080
already have monkey butts all it like
you cannot take a photograph of this

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.090
you cannot take a photograph of this
 

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.610
you cannot take a photograph of this
that doesn't involve a monkey butt and

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620
that doesn't involve a monkey butt and
 

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.040
that doesn't involve a monkey butt and
if they were eight yet now so this is

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.050
if they were eight yet now so this is
 

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.400
if they were eight yet now so this is
eight monkeys which and there's one

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.410
eight monkeys which and there's one
 

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.200
eight monkeys which and there's one
monkey in each cube of the hypercube

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.210
monkey in each cube of the hypercube
 

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.520
monkey in each cube of the hypercube
that cute the high peak you as eight

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:43.530
that cute the high peak you as eight
 

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.700
that cute the high peak you as eight
eight cubes in it so this is a

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:46.710
eight cubes in it so this is a
 

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.410
eight cubes in it so this is a
particular symmetry that comes sort of

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.420
particular symmetry that comes sort of
 

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.330
particular symmetry that comes sort of
associated with hypercube so there's

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:50.340
associated with hypercube so there's
 

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.340
associated with hypercube so there's
these other four dimensional versions

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.350
these other four dimensional versions
 

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.290
these other four dimensional versions
with Platonic solids so there's

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.300
with Platonic solids so there's
 

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.540
with Platonic solids so there's
something called a 24 cell and you do

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:56.550
something called a 24 cell and you do
 

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.710
something called a 24 cell and you do
the same thing with 24 monkeys so this

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720
the same thing with 24 monkeys so this
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.530
the same thing with 24 monkeys so this
one there were these two chains of for

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540
one there were these two chains of for
 

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.080
one there were these two chains of for
monkeys each had to head to foot head to

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.090
monkeys each had to head to foot head to
 

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.240
monkeys each had to head to foot head to
foot this one also has these these

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.250
foot this one also has these these
 

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.610
foot this one also has these these
chains of monkeys so the best one is

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620
chains of monkeys so the best one is
 

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.410
chains of monkeys so the best one is
probably this one right in the middle

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:12.420
probably this one right in the middle
 

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.890
probably this one right in the middle
one two three four five there's a chain

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:15.900
one two three four five there's a chain
 

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.600
one two three four five there's a chain
of six monkeys here going head to foot

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:17.610
of six monkeys here going head to foot
 

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.790
of six monkeys here going head to foot
and you can spot these other chains of

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800
and you can spot these other chains of
 

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.260
and you can spot these other chains of
monkey so there's another chain of six

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.270
monkey so there's another chain of six
 

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.450
monkey so there's another chain of six
monkeys so as always I think four

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:23.460
monkeys so as always I think four
 

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.400
monkeys so as always I think four
different chains of six monkeys because

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:25.410
different chains of six monkeys because
 

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.340
different chains of six monkeys because
4 times 6 to 24 good 24 cell and just

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:28.350
4 times 6 to 24 good 24 cell and just
 

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.230
4 times 6 to 24 good 24 cell and just
going one step further because why not

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240
going one step further because why not
 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.830
going one step further because why not
you can do the same thing with 120 cell

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:32.840
you can do the same thing with 120 cell
 

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.240
you can do the same thing with 120 cell
120 monkeys this isn't actually the

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.250
120 monkeys this isn't actually the
 

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.820
120 monkeys this isn't actually the
whole thing so this is only up to the

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:37.830
whole thing so this is only up to the
 

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.070
whole thing so this is only up to the
equator of the sphere in 4-dimensional

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080
equator of the sphere in 4-dimensional
 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.200
equator of the sphere in 4-dimensional
space so this is only showing the

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.210
space so this is only showing the
 

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.260
space so this is only showing the
southern hyper hemisphere and me

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:45.270
southern hyper hemisphere and me
 

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.480
southern hyper hemisphere and me
hypersphere whatever

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.490
 

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.920
so there should be more monkeys out here

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:50.930
so there should be more monkeys out here
 

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.420
so there should be more monkeys out here
you can see like they're trying to grab

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.430
you can see like they're trying to grab
 

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.040
you can see like they're trying to grab
on to things but there are no more

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.050
on to things but there are no more
 

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.420
on to things but there are no more
monkeys out there just as they would get

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:55.430
monkeys out there just as they would get
 

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.300
monkeys out there just as they would get
enormous but okay so it was like chains

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:58.310
enormous but okay so it was like chains
 

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.220
enormous but okay so it was like chains
of monkeys this one has a chain of ten

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.230
of monkeys this one has a chain of ten
 

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.800
of monkeys this one has a chain of ten
and again you can you can do these

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:02.810
and again you can you can do these
 

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.800
and again you can you can do these
animations where those monkeys are sort

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:05.810
animations where those monkeys are sort
 

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.480
animations where those monkeys are sort
of slowly moving along those chains

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:07.490
of slowly moving along those chains
 

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.429
of slowly moving along those chains
twisting as they go means showing

00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:09.439
twisting as they go means showing
 

00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:11.050
twisting as they go means showing
different four dimensional symmetries

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:11.060
different four dimensional symmetries
 

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.999
different four dimensional symmetries
that don't really exist in

00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:13.009
that don't really exist in
 

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:16.360
that don't really exist in
three-dimensional space even why you

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:16.370
three-dimensional space even why you
 

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.730
three-dimensional space even why you
know this thing I mean it's not actually

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:18.740
know this thing I mean it's not actually
 

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.749
know this thing I mean it's not actually
fair because you know there's different

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:19.759
fair because you know there's different
 

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:22.030
fair because you know there's different
like the six dents taken out of this one

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040
like the six dents taken out of this one
 

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.590
like the six dents taken out of this one
as wondering you know or get forgetting

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600
as wondering you know or get forgetting
 

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.300
as wondering you know or get forgetting
all that suppose it was an ordinary you

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.310
all that suppose it was an ordinary you
 

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.870
all that suppose it was an ordinary you
know just a perfect mathematical cube
