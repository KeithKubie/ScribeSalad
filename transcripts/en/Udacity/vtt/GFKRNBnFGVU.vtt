00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.100
My next question was, well, okay, so people aren't

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.180
very good at guessing their audience sizes. But maybe,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.220
maybe people who are older, maybe they have a

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.670
better sense, than teenagers, for example. So the next

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.390
plot that we did was another scatter plot, but

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.380
this time we added a third level, where we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.910
added color to represent the age of the survey

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.380
respondent. And you can see again we have this horizontal

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.090
stripes for people who are guessing that there are 50

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.720
or 100 people in their audience. But I don't see

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
any pattern in the color. I think this is actually

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.660
kind of a dead end. This is one example of

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.480
kind of a failure. I can tell if younger people

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.750
were more accurate then older people, there is too much

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.160
over plotting. In this plot there are too many dots

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.490
on top of each other and color really doesn't add much.
