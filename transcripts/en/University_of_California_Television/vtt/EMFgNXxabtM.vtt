00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.533
(inspiring music)

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:12.199
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.699
bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:21.792
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.209
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:29.359
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.442
yet filled with optimism,

00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.171
we grow up slowly.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.584
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:39.667
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.280
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.030
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:50.252
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:54.419
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.152
an exploration made possible by

00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:00.985
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.376 --> 00:01:18.126
(ethereal music)

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.124
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.379
- I'm gonna give you a little
bit of a break from the brain

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.212
and focus on the face.

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:49.306
So, a central, if in fact
not the central question

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:51.210
in modern biology is to understand

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.634
the genotype to phenotype connection.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.693
In other words, how does information

00:01:55.693 --> 00:01:58.405
encoded by the genome reveals itself

00:01:58.405 --> 00:02:00.528
through the developmental process

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:03.074
to produce specific phenotypes?

00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:05.127
And, the flip side to this question

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:07.873
is to understand how
variation between the genome,

00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:11.415
during evolution produces
phenotypic variation,

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:13.716
either between species,

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:18.053
or between individuals
within the same species.

00:02:18.053 --> 00:02:21.553
And, how come such common genetic variants

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:25.618
can determine disease susceptibility

00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:28.239
in complex human diseases.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.346
I'm sure most of you heard by now

00:02:30.346 --> 00:02:34.220
that most complex disease
and trait associated variants

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.248
not to the noncoding part of the genome.

00:02:37.248 --> 00:02:40.272
So not to our genes per se,

00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.069
the protein coding parts of the genome,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.101
but to the vast noncoding space

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.851
that comprises over 98
percent of the genome.

00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:51.620
Moreover, evidence begins to emerge

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.648
that these variants are enriched

00:02:53.648 --> 00:02:56.049
within cis-regulatory elements,

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.536
and especially within a specific class

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:01.344
of regulatory elements called enhancers.

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.724
So these are modular genetic sequences

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:07.184
that can activate gene
expression at large distances,

00:03:07.184 --> 00:03:11.186
and are typically specialized
to activate gene expression

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.603
in a specific tissue context.

00:03:14.464 --> 00:03:17.471
And the idea here, is that
this genetic variance,

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:21.028
or single nucleotide
polymorphisms within enhancers,

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:25.483
can produce either weak or
strong enhancer alleles,

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:28.966
which in turn, can lead to
quantitative differences

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:33.133
in gene expression and
influence downstream traits.

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:36.257
We learned from the evo-devo community

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:37.980
working on model organisms

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.935
that starting this regulatory
landscape evolution

00:03:40.935 --> 00:03:42.822
of closely related species

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.269
can be an extremely powerful tool

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.004
in uncovering genotype
to phenotype connections.

00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:52.534
So for example, elegant
work from Sean Carroll,

00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:54.218
David Kingsley, and others,

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:55.964
unequivocally demonstrated

00:03:55.964 --> 00:03:58.027
the change in enhancer sequence

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.413
can dictate change in phenotypes,

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:02.645
such as wing pattern in Drosophila,

00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:05.873
or skeletal changes in stickleback fish.

00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:07.251
And we were very interested

00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:09.905
in extending this type
of evo-devo thinking

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:12.276
into humans and other primates.

00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:16.004
But of course, as it's
already been mentioned,

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.347
some of the key developmentally

00:04:18.347 --> 00:04:20.955
and evolutionary important cell types

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:24.325
cannot be studied directly
in embryonic context

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:26.324
from humans and other great apes,

00:04:26.324 --> 00:04:28.657
for obvious ethical reasons,

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.419
but it has already been introduced,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.484
that now with induced
pluripotent stem cell models,

00:04:37.484 --> 00:04:40.499
we can study cellular
and molecular mechanisms

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.650
underlying phenotypic
divergence in high primates.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.589
And a few years back, we referred

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.505
to this general strategy
as cellular anthropology.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:54.029
So one of the phenotypes that
we are most interested in,

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.784
is human face and also human
craniofacial development.

00:04:57.784 --> 00:05:00.016
We know that craniofacial variation,

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.328
both within and between species,

00:05:02.328 --> 00:05:04.911
is largely genetically encoded.

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:08.101
So we have unique facial features

00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:12.621
that are distinct from
those of other great apes,

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:14.105
but also there is a lot

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.489
of individual variation in facial form,

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:18.016
both within the humans

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:22.157
but also in our close
evolutionary relatives.

00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:23.211
So the question is,

00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:26.630
what are the cellular
origins of facial variation?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.367
Well, it turns out that
most of our face and head

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:31.547
is derived from the single cell type

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:33.649
called cranial neural crest cells.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.078
These are very unique
cells that form early

00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:39.437
in gestations of three to five weeks.

00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:42.837
They're induced in dorsal
anterior part of the neural tube,

00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:45.609
and then they migrate long distances.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:47.167
And their destination,

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.369
they can differentiate to a
large variety of cell types,

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:53.345
including bone, cartilage,
connective tissue,

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.919
cranial nerve, and pigment cells.

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.610
And as a result, in fact,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.713
most of the craniofacial complex

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:02.537
is derived from the neural crest.

00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:05.941
Moreover, seminal work
from Nicole Le Douarin,

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:07.354
and others showed

00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:10.476
through cross species
transplantation experiments

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:12.689
in avian embryos, that these cells

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.405
autonomously carry much of the information

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:18.619
on species specific facial morphology.

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:19.951
So these cells are important,

00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:22.187
but how can we access them

00:06:22.187 --> 00:06:24.770
from humans and other primates?

00:06:25.765 --> 00:06:28.175
As you already probably realized,

00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:30.127
this is a tricky proposition.

00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:32.383
So, this is transient embryonic cell types

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:34.747
forming at three to
five weeks of gestation.

00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:37.514
We cannot access them
directly from the embryo,

00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:41.520
but thanks to the IPS and ES technologies,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.217
we can derive them in vitro,

00:06:43.217 --> 00:06:45.999
and indeed that's what my lab has done

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.340
over the last several years
is establish protocols

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.907
to obtain in vitro cells
with bonafide characteristics

00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:55.909
of the cranial neural crest cells.

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.196
More recently, Sara Prescott,

00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:00.216
a former graduate student in the lab,

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:02.630
working in collaboration with Rusty Gage,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.766
extended this model to our chimpanzee.

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:08.544
And here, really a few key features were,

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:11.454
to reduce heterogeneity of the population

00:07:11.454 --> 00:07:15.639
and properly stage human and chimp cells,

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.134
because unless you do that,

00:07:18.134 --> 00:07:20.738
the developmental differences
are gonna dominate

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:23.593
over species differences.

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.682
And moreover, we also
went to great lengths

00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:29.049
so I'm sure that not only
molecular signatures,

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:32.101
but also cellular
properties of these cells

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.159
represent bona fide neural crest cells.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.605
So for example, we can
transplant these cells,

00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.699
through the chick embryo neural tube,

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.866
and they will then engraft, migrate,

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:44.662
and assume correct positional
identities in the embryo.

00:07:44.662 --> 00:07:46.276
And they also retain

00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:48.612
this very broad differentiation potential,

00:07:48.612 --> 00:07:50.898
characteristic of the crest.

00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:53.074
So now with this model in hand,

00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:54.584
we use epigenomic strategy

00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:57.803
to systematically annotate
regulatory elements.

00:07:57.803 --> 00:08:00.387
So just to give you an idea,

00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:04.554
for those of you who are not
so familiar with epigenomics,

00:08:05.647 --> 00:08:07.399
when active enhancers share

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:10.042
certain common chromatin features.

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:12.903
And when we can use
technology, like ChIP-seq

00:08:12.903 --> 00:08:15.735
or ATAC-seq to map these
features genome wide

00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:19.977
in an unbiased manner
in a specific cell type.

00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:22.230
And then, we can correlate these changes

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.098
in epigenomic patterns

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:28.265
with changes in gene expression
determined by RNA-seq.

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:34.497
So to do this, Sara took
neural crest cells in vitro,

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:35.858
derived neural crest cells

00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:40.025
from multiple, independent
chimp and human individuals

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.171
and performed mapping
of transcription factors

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:46.413
and general coactivators,

00:08:46.413 --> 00:08:49.222
analysis of hypersensitivity by ATAC-seq,

00:08:49.222 --> 00:08:52.965
and also analyzed certain chemical tags,

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:56.120
or histone modifications that
are present on nucleosomes

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.483
when regulatory elements are active.

00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:01.843
And based on the simple
chromatin signatures,

00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:04.395
she was able to map enhancers

00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:06.875
that are active in the neural crest cells

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:08.630
and also distinguish them

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.303
from other classes of regulatory elements,

00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:15.032
such as promoters, and
then ultimately linked

00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:18.085
to differences in gene expression.

00:09:18.085 --> 00:09:19.473
One thing that I really need to mention,

00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:22.165
is that not only we can map
these regulatory elements,

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:24.324
but that quantitative comparisons

00:09:24.324 --> 00:09:27.533
of chromatin signatures of these elements,

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.571
can be used to infer
differences in their activity.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.101
So, it's not only where
these enhancers are,

00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:36.568
but we can compare quantitatively

00:09:36.568 --> 00:09:39.840
these tags, chromatin signatures

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.423
to infer how different they are

00:09:42.423 --> 00:09:45.128
in their activity between the species.

00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:47.848
So this forms the basis of what I refer to

00:09:47.848 --> 00:09:49.224
as comparative epigenomics.

00:09:49.224 --> 00:09:51.532
And the idea here is simple,

00:09:51.532 --> 00:09:54.735
that we're comparing, in the same cell,

00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:57.270
that between two closely related species.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.527
So, most of these epigenomic
patterns that we recover

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:03.318
should be invariant
between the two species,

00:10:03.318 --> 00:10:05.814
but the idea is also that
we will be able to see

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:09.205
some differences,
quantitative differences,

00:10:09.205 --> 00:10:13.321
in those chemical tags
that mark active chromatin,

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.409
which will be indicative of the difference

00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:18.153
in regulatory activity,

00:10:18.153 --> 00:10:20.455
which then hopefully
we'll also be able to link

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:23.226
to differences in gene expressions.

00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:24.422
So, that's the idea.

00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:26.475
How does the actual data look like?

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:29.075
Well indeed, most of
the epigenomic patterns

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:32.305
are invariant between human and chimp,

00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:34.167
but we also see, at the subset of,

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.146
smaller subset of regions
we see differences,

00:10:37.146 --> 00:10:40.896
as indicted here in this
chimp biased region,

00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:46.515
or indicated here at this
human biased enhancer region.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:48.486
So we can quantify
them, these differences,

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.201
across the whole genome

00:10:50.201 --> 00:10:54.360
and compare different
individuals of the same species.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.249
So, different humans or different chimps,

00:10:56.249 --> 00:10:58.866
and that variation is shown here in red.

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:01.151
Or, we can compare between the species,

00:11:01.151 --> 00:11:02.753
between human and chimp.

00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:03.701
And as you can see,

00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:06.699
there's more variation
between the species,

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:10.710
shown here in blue than
within the species.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.074
And we will refer to those falling outside

00:11:13.074 --> 00:11:15.021
as either human-biased

00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:18.659
or chimp-biased candidate
enhancer regions.

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:22.943
Importantly, we can also
see these regulatory changes

00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:26.133
with changes in gene expression.

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:29.529
So in other words, genes
near human-biased enhancers

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:32.116
tend to be human-biased in expression,

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.388
and those near chimp-biased enhancers

00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:36.259
are chimp-biased in expression.

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:37.713
And that's of course important,

00:11:37.713 --> 00:11:39.381
because it's gene expression difference

00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:43.548
that ultimately matters for
exerting phenotypic differences.

00:11:45.152 --> 00:11:48.073
Moreover, these are not
just some random genes,

00:11:48.073 --> 00:11:50.543
but in fact when we do ontology annotation

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.989
for these biased genes,

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:54.791
we see that they're
associated with development

00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:58.279
and malformation of various
craniofacial structures,

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.964
including those structures that
are actually quite divergent

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:04.635
between human and chimp.

00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.541
But now, a important question to ask is,

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.825
where do these interspecies differences

00:12:09.825 --> 00:12:12.555
in enhancer signatures come from?

00:12:12.555 --> 00:12:13.950
Are they due to differences

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.080
in the trans-regulatory environments

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.823
of the human and chimp neural crest?

00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:22.169
So, different in
transcription factor networks,

00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:23.557
things like that?

00:12:23.557 --> 00:12:27.460
Or are they due to differences
in enhancer sequence itself?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.284
So, cis-regulatory changes.

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:33.120
And to distinguish between
these two possibilities,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.362
we designed the following assay.

00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:38.717
We synthesized the library
of orthologous regions,

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.986
that were either
human-biased, chimp-biased,

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:44.857
or invariant in our epigenomic data.

00:12:44.857 --> 00:12:46.463
And then we cloned this library

00:12:46.463 --> 00:12:49.885
to a so-called self-transcribing
enhancer reporter vector

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:52.165
forming the basis of the STARR-seq,

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:55.348
as he described two years
backed by Alex Stark's lab,

00:12:55.348 --> 00:12:57.945
and which relies on
the ability of enhancer

00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:00.786
to activate its own
expression at a distance,

00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:02.950
and then drive its own expression

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.150
and serve as its own barcode.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.571
And we took this library and
introduced it to either chimp,

00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:10.953
or human neural crest cells.

00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:13.550
From this, we learned
two important things.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.050
First of all, bias in epigenomic signature

00:13:19.447 --> 00:13:23.329
translates into the bias and
ability of these sequences

00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:25.534
to drive gene expression.

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:29.339
In other words, what we
predicted as human-biased,

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:32.244
which you should be seeing
here, was human-biased.

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:35.102
And what we predicted as chimp-biased,

00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:36.926
was chimp-biased in general

00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:40.554
in the ability to drive gene expression.

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:42.443
And the second important conclusion

00:13:42.443 --> 00:13:45.354
was the direction of
the bias was the same,

00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:48.007
whether we tested our
library in the context

00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:51.424
of the human or chimp neural crest cells.

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:56.143
And what this tells us, is
that the bias is encoded

00:13:56.143 --> 00:13:58.713
by the sequence of enhancers themselves,

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.923
rather than imposed by the differences

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.816
in trans-regulatory environments.

00:14:03.816 --> 00:14:05.338
So if it's in the sequence,

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:07.773
and the trans-regulatory environments

00:14:07.773 --> 00:14:10.720
are more conserved, we can go as far as

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.394
to the trans-regulatory
environment of the mouse,

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.232
to gain some insight where,

00:14:16.232 --> 00:14:18.677
when and where during development

00:14:18.677 --> 00:14:21.165
these enhancers may be active.

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:23.969
And here, I'm showing a
couple of examples of this,

00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:27.803
where we're looking at
the human-biased enhancer,

00:14:27.803 --> 00:14:29.996
and we're cloning orthologous sequence

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:32.234
from either human or chimp

00:14:32.234 --> 00:14:34.127
to the LacZ enhancer reporter vector,

00:14:34.127 --> 00:14:37.346
and testing in the context
of the mouse embryo.

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:39.682
And why there is a shared expression

00:14:39.682 --> 00:14:41.608
in the olfactory placode,

00:14:41.608 --> 00:14:45.358
there is a human-associated
gain in multiple,

00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:50.642
in multiple domains
within the head and face.

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:53.416
And here is another example,

00:14:53.416 --> 00:14:55.525
again, a human-biased enhancer.

00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:57.821
This one is more pan-neural crest.

00:14:57.821 --> 00:15:00.914
And again, you see the gain of activity

00:15:00.914 --> 00:15:02.943
for the human sequence.

00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:05.397
And this one is actually quite blazing in,

00:15:05.397 --> 00:15:07.269
in the face, whereas the chimp,

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:10.612
corresponding chimp
sequence is not active.

00:15:10.612 --> 00:15:13.153
So, this is interesting because it shows

00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:15.733
that we can systematically
identify enhancers

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:18.750
that change the regulatory activity,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.983
during recent human evolution,

00:15:20.983 --> 00:15:22.745
and we can even learn something

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:26.721
about their spatial temporal
activity during development,

00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:29.446
but what this type of
work will not tell us

00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:32.532
is whether these enhancers
are actually responsible

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:36.747
for driving variation
in facial morphology.

00:15:36.747 --> 00:15:38.797
And while we can model
some of these aspects

00:15:38.797 --> 00:15:40.628
of variation in the mouse,

00:15:40.628 --> 00:15:42.800
again mouse is not an ideal system

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.891
for studying human facial variation.

00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.254
So to try addressing these questions,

00:15:49.254 --> 00:15:51.898
we thought about harnessing glorious

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:54.278
normal-range human facial variation,

00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:58.373
which you can see just
looking around this room,

00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:00.827
and our ability to noninvasively

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:03.436
and quite precisely quantify it.

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:05.270
And to do this, we teamed up

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.763
with a group of
anthropologists, engineers,

00:16:08.763 --> 00:16:10.486
and human geneticists,

00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:13.392
who developed a very novel methodology

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:15.932
for unbiased facial phenotyping.

00:16:15.932 --> 00:16:19.514
And, I just wanna mention
at least three names,

00:16:19.514 --> 00:16:23.753
Peter Claes, Mark Shriver,
and Seth Weinberg.

00:16:23.753 --> 00:16:26.216
And, what Peter has done is develop

00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:29.683
this very precise method
to quantify facial shape,

00:16:29.683 --> 00:16:32.430
which relies on 3D facial scans

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.847
that are then, mirror imaged,

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:38.405
and then remapped into the mesh,

00:16:40.472 --> 00:16:43.222
dense mesh of 10,000 coordinates.

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:46.465
So essentially, in other words,

00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:50.625
each face is translated
into 10,000 coordinates,

00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:52.742
then averaged, to remove deviations

00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:54.600
from bilateral symmetry,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.886
and then aligned across many,

00:16:56.886 --> 00:16:58.786
many participants in the study,

00:16:58.786 --> 00:17:03.010
to establish correspondents
of these 10,000 coordinates.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.695
And this allows for
unbiased facial phenotyping,

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:08.953
and quantifying shape variation

00:17:08.953 --> 00:17:11.702
over global-to-local facial segments,

00:17:11.702 --> 00:17:15.777
starting from very global
effects on facial variation,

00:17:15.777 --> 00:17:19.944
to effects on very specific
aspects of the facial shape,

00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:23.474
as highlighted here in yellow.

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:25.571
And this type of analysis has been done

00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:30.318
on many, many participants,
over 2,000 participants,

00:17:30.318 --> 00:17:33.744
and replicated on an independent cohort

00:17:33.744 --> 00:17:35.988
of another 2,000 participants.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:40.792
And, having genotype information
for this participant,

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:44.233
allowed us to perform genome
wide association studies

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:47.337
to identify candidate variants
that may be associated

00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:50.221
with different aspects
of facial variation.

00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:51.735
While I don't have time to go

00:17:51.735 --> 00:17:53.744
into the details of that study,

00:17:53.744 --> 00:17:56.051
I just wanna show you one example

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:58.800
that I think is really quite interesting.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.618
So this example of one subgenetic variant

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:03.118
a lead SNP on Chr2

00:18:04.064 --> 00:18:07.994
that will link to variation
in lower face morphology,

00:18:07.994 --> 00:18:10.244
particularly the jaw shape.

00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:13.907
So when we look at underneath this SNP,

00:18:13.907 --> 00:18:15.675
at our epigenomic data,

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:17.857
we see that it falls smack in the middle

00:18:17.857 --> 00:18:20.457
of an active neural crest enhancer.

00:18:20.457 --> 00:18:22.563
But what is really interesting about it,

00:18:22.563 --> 00:18:24.435
is that the same enhancer

00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:27.248
is actually chimp-biased in activity.

00:18:27.248 --> 00:18:29.785
Moreover, the very same SNP

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:32.312
was associated by another
group earlier this year,

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:35.787
with susceptibility to
nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate

00:18:35.787 --> 00:18:38.120
in Europeans, as shown here.

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:42.372
So we're really quite excited
by examples like that,

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.224
because what this suggests

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:47.123
that perhaps overlapping
set of regulatory elements

00:18:47.123 --> 00:18:50.477
can influence variation
in multiple levels,

00:18:50.477 --> 00:18:54.078
both between the species,
within the species,

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:58.471
and then when combined
with either environmental

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.869
perturbation or other variants,

00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:03.695
influencing disease susceptibility

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:06.454
in common disease like cleft lip palate.

00:19:06.454 --> 00:19:08.209
So, we're starting to think that

00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:11.024
it's going to be about the
quantitative differences

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.257
and about the combinatorial effect,

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:17.033
which really will ultimately
separate those three scenarios.

00:19:17.033 --> 00:19:19.103
The differences between,

00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:22.298
within species and disease states.

00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:24.036
And with this thought, I wanna leave you,

00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:26.958
and thank people involved,

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.836
in particular, Sara Prescott,

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:32.396
who now moved onto Harvard as a postdoc,

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:36.519
was extremely talented and
open-minded graduate student

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.330
who took on and started

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.826
all the evolutionary projects in my lab.

00:19:40.826 --> 00:19:42.591
I wanna acknowledge Tomek

00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:45.402
for most of the genomic data analysis

00:19:45.402 --> 00:19:46.968
that I've shown you today

00:19:46.968 --> 00:19:50.209
and really thinking about
how we can quantitatively

00:19:50.209 --> 00:19:53.542
compare human and chimp epigenomic data.

00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:58.829
I also grateful to Rusty
and Carol Marchetto,

00:19:58.829 --> 00:20:00.983
about whom you already heard today,

00:20:00.983 --> 00:20:03.766
for really sharing with us chimp IPS cells

00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:05.574
very early in the game.

00:20:05.574 --> 00:20:08.763
Our mouse genetics
collaborator, Licia Selleri,

00:20:08.763 --> 00:20:12.511
and also our human
phenotyping and GWAS team,

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:15.486
Peter Claes, Seth
Weinberg, and Mark Shriver,

00:20:15.486 --> 00:20:17.192
thank you very much.

00:20:17.192 --> 00:20:19.197
(applause)

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:21.266
- So I thought I'd take
the director's prerogative

00:20:21.266 --> 00:20:25.526
and spend the first five, 10
minutes going back in time

00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:28.059
over some of the events that lead

00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:29.753
to the work that I'm going to present.

00:20:29.753 --> 00:20:31.016
And also because some of the people

00:20:31.016 --> 00:20:33.812
that are here in the
audience were involved

00:20:33.812 --> 00:20:36.880
in some of these early phenomena.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.713
So first, let's step
back and go to the 1950s,

00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:43.936
when the work of many
people have clearly shown

00:20:43.936 --> 00:20:48.524
that we shared a common
ancestor with the great apes,

00:20:48.524 --> 00:20:50.984
and most likely the chimpanzee,

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:52.969
but there's considered
to be this great gulf

00:20:52.969 --> 00:20:55.948
that needed to be resolved,

00:20:55.948 --> 00:20:58.174
but then Sarich and Wilson in the '60s,

00:20:58.174 --> 00:20:59.906
by immunochemical techniques,

00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:02.919
and Goodman, Russ Doolittle
here in the audience,

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:06.034
and others showed that most
of the proteins are identical.

00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:08.275
Sequences are essentially identical,

00:21:08.275 --> 00:21:11.414
and Mary-Claire King in her thesis work,

00:21:11.414 --> 00:21:14.499
was asked to find something different,

00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:16.828
and she couldn't find much at all.

00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:18.751
And so, they wrote this famous paper

00:21:18.751 --> 00:21:21.373
that said that maybe the
genes are nearly identical,

00:21:21.373 --> 00:21:22.554
and the proteins are identical.

00:21:22.554 --> 00:21:24.633
They just express differently.

00:21:24.633 --> 00:21:26.432
And this theory actually held,

00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:29.016
believe it not for almost 20 years,

00:21:29.016 --> 00:21:31.409
although part of it is definitely true,

00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:36.303
until Mary Olson, who's
also here in the audience,

00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:39.800
suggested in 1999 that
gene loss may be important.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.741
That it's getting rid of a
gene may be just as interesting

00:21:42.741 --> 00:21:45.131
as having more of a
gene or changing a gene,

00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:46.452
or its expression.

00:21:46.452 --> 00:21:49.755
And by some coincidence
actually, that very year,

00:21:49.755 --> 00:21:52.651
the end of that year, just before that,

00:21:52.651 --> 00:21:56.441
we reported the first genomic
and biochemical difference

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:58.081
between humans and great apes,

00:21:58.081 --> 00:21:59.440
the first known at the time.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.248
And, it was due to gene loss, CMAH.

00:22:02.248 --> 00:22:05.128
I'll come back to what CMAH is.

00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:07.515
So let's define some of
the title words here.

00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:10.662
Hominin, hominins are human ancestors

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:13.423
and our extinct evolutionary relatives,

00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:16.500
that is Neanderthals example.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.017
Hominids are human
ancestors that are living

00:22:19.017 --> 00:22:21.375
and extinct evolutionary relatives,

00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:23.430
which includes the great apes.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.055
So we go back to our diagram here,

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:28.975
there are the hominids,
and there are the hominins.

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:31.859
And we are one of a group of hominins.

00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:34.278
So, we go back into detail background.

00:22:34.278 --> 00:22:37.566
Oh, before any of the
aficionados get upset,

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:40.025
the branching relationships here only,

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.901
do not reflect timing.

00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:45.667
The branch length does not,
it's just relationships.

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:47.571
And there is one time
point that does matter,

00:22:47.571 --> 00:22:51.178
and that's the one shown
down there 0.5 million years.

00:22:51.178 --> 00:22:53.231
Right here is 0.5 million years,

00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:55.042
the junction where the common ancestor,

00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:57.786
Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Humans.

00:22:57.786 --> 00:22:59.874
So, let's look at what
happened going up to there,

00:22:59.874 --> 00:23:01.537
and this is a very complex slide.

00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.754
But it includes all the known information,

00:23:03.754 --> 00:23:06.412
except for the last couple
of years from Wood and Boyle,

00:23:06.412 --> 00:23:09.793
talking about all the different hominins

00:23:09.793 --> 00:23:13.916
that existed in Africa until
about two million years ago,

00:23:13.916 --> 00:23:16.596
when the genus Homo emerged

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:18.977
and not only stayed behind in Africa,

00:23:18.977 --> 00:23:20.856
and spread across Africa,

00:23:20.856 --> 00:23:23.228
but spread all across the Old World.

00:23:23.228 --> 00:23:27.228
And eventually, gave rise
to us again in Africa.

00:23:28.387 --> 00:23:31.934
And, Homo of course had the wanderlust,

00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:34.160
and wandered all over the Old World,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.061
never crossed the waterway,

00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:38.469
couldn't see the other
side, as far as we know,

00:23:38.469 --> 00:23:40.842
but otherwise you've heard of Peking Man,

00:23:40.842 --> 00:23:42.909
Java Man, and so on.

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:45.856
And then, this probably went
on for about two million years,

00:23:45.856 --> 00:23:47.903
and finally our own species,

00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:49.243
again the numbers have changed.

00:23:49.243 --> 00:23:51.082
They change every month now,

00:23:51.082 --> 00:23:53.266
because of the new data coming in,

00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:55.127
but the general pattern is true.

00:23:55.127 --> 00:23:58.120
Emerged in Africa, and
spread all across the world,

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.331
essentially replacing
all the other species,

00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:03.561
including the species in Africa
that limited interbreeding.

00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.909
So we had found a pseudogenization,

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:08.220
a gene deletion in humans,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.207
and this has to do with sialic acid,

00:24:11.207 --> 00:24:12.793
another word in my title.

00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:14.815
So what's a sialic acid?

00:24:14.815 --> 00:24:16.980
All cells in nature, without exception,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.833
are coated with a dense array
of glycans, or sugar chains.

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:23.970
Here's a classic slide
from a Nobel laureate,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.379
George Palade, in the early days of EM,

00:24:26.379 --> 00:24:29.270
but he already saw the stuff
sitting on the surface.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.258
But if you look over
here, at a mammalian cell,

00:24:31.258 --> 00:24:34.031
you can see this huge,
thick layer of sugars.

00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:36.166
Same in the bacterium,

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:38.945
and even many viruses
are coated with sugars

00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:41.128
of this massive layers of glycans,

00:24:41.128 --> 00:24:44.588
which is sort of the dark matter
of the biological universe

00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:46.693
that most people don't study,

00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:49.623
or even acknowledge
their existence in many.

00:24:49.623 --> 00:24:52.223
You didn't see it in any of the
slides in the first session.

00:24:52.223 --> 00:24:54.473
(laughter)

00:24:56.759 --> 00:25:00.424
So these, on the outermost
strip of vertebrate glycans

00:25:00.424 --> 00:25:02.713
are these sugars called sialic acids,

00:25:02.713 --> 00:25:06.188
which sit out at the tip,
and there's a lot of them.

00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:08.051
There can be millions and 10s,

00:25:08.051 --> 00:25:10.989
and even hundreds of
millions of copies per cell.

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:13.648
A recent calculation
said that a lymphocyte

00:25:13.648 --> 00:25:18.140
had a density of 100
millimolar on the surface.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.971
That's right, millimolar, that's a lot.

00:25:21.971 --> 00:25:25.115
And so, obviously they must
have a lot of biological roles.

00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:29.489
And the story that we have
been pursuing is that,

00:25:29.489 --> 00:25:32.391
the fact that there are
many kinds of sialic acids.

00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:34.705
And the two most common ones are called

00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:36.205
Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc.

00:25:37.523 --> 00:25:39.030
(audience laughs)

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.947
Yes, we have some rock
and rollers in my group.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:47.841
Gc is derived from Ac by
adding one oxygen atom

00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:50.676
by this enzyme called CMAH.

00:25:50.676 --> 00:25:53.302
And so, here is that single oxygen atom.

00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:54.843
Now you may think that's trivial,

00:25:54.843 --> 00:25:56.520
but that's a single oxygen atom added

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.561
to a 100 millimolar concentration

00:25:58.561 --> 00:26:01.751
of something on the cell
surface, so that's a big effect.

00:26:01.751 --> 00:26:05.043
And what we basically found
was that Gc was missing

00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:08.426
in humans due to a mutation in CMAH.

00:26:08.426 --> 00:26:11.482
Looking further into this
with Toshiyuki Hayakawa,

00:26:11.482 --> 00:26:14.232
Yoko Satta, and Naoyuki Takahata.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.453
We found, Pascal and
I found that there was

00:26:17.453 --> 00:26:19.895
this Alu-mediated inactivation

00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:22.999
that occurred in this manner,

00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:26.606
taking out this critical exon
that was fixed in all humans.

00:26:26.606 --> 00:26:29.349
All of you have this mutation, homozygous.

00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:31.658
And this exercise was also useful

00:26:31.658 --> 00:26:34.683
because this allowed timing
by several different methods,

00:26:34.683 --> 00:26:36.404
none of which are perfect,

00:26:36.404 --> 00:26:38.249
but I wouldn't go into
the details of the timing,

00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:40.379
but all of them gave a time of about

00:26:40.379 --> 00:26:45.092
2.5 to 3.5 million years where
the mutation first occurred.

00:26:45.092 --> 00:26:49.041
So, we went further then
and collaborated with both

00:26:49.041 --> 00:26:51.338
Svante Paabo and Meave
Leakey back at that time,

00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:53.103
looking at fossil samples

00:26:53.103 --> 00:26:55.743
and the sort of site fracture
into the DNA extraction,

00:26:55.743 --> 00:26:58.652
and we could find only Ac
in Neanderthal fossils.

00:26:58.652 --> 00:27:00.657
So we thought that maybe

00:27:00.657 --> 00:27:02.982
there was no GSR sequence at the time.

00:27:02.982 --> 00:27:05.874
Also, we're missing CMAH,

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.289
but then the question came up,

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.956
how did this mutation get fixed?

00:27:10.897 --> 00:27:15.113
And, Pascal came up with
a very interesting idea.

00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:17.059
After all, when you get a mutation,

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:18.577
if there is this mutation that is due to,

00:27:18.577 --> 00:27:20.520
let's say a pathogen that is binding Gc,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.715
leaving some people with Gc negative,

00:27:22.715 --> 00:27:24.739
you'd expect a kind of a polymorphism

00:27:24.739 --> 00:27:26.583
like you see in sickle cell disease.

00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:28.143
How did it get fixed?

00:27:28.143 --> 00:27:31.007
By the time we had knockout
mice with the same mutation,

00:27:31.007 --> 00:27:32.607
which have a lot of
phenotypes, by the way,

00:27:32.607 --> 00:27:35.326
that I'm not going to go
into human-like phenotypes.

00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:38.556
And so, we could do this
experiment that he suggested,

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.014
which was to show

00:27:40.014 --> 00:27:43.764
that while the rare male
that is Gc negative,

00:27:45.134 --> 00:27:49.103
and if there's a large number
of males that are Gc positive,

00:27:49.103 --> 00:27:51.821
the Gc positive sperm
are killed by antibodies

00:27:51.821 --> 00:27:53.810
produced by the female.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:57.393
In fact, human serum will
kill chimpanzee sperm, also.

00:27:57.393 --> 00:28:00.993
And so, Steve Springer
actually did a calculations,

00:28:00.993 --> 00:28:04.209
saying that within 30 to 650 generations,

00:28:04.209 --> 00:28:07.330
this could actually generate two lineages.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.197
And so we hazard a guess at this point,

00:28:09.197 --> 00:28:11.264
be the origin of the genus Homo.

00:28:11.264 --> 00:28:14.704
And, unfortunately sialic acids and DNA

00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:16.697
do not survive in African fossils.

00:28:16.697 --> 00:28:18.551
The samples that Meave Leakey gave us

00:28:18.551 --> 00:28:20.818
had no sialic acids in them.

00:28:20.818 --> 00:28:23.099
But very recently, this
is hot off the press,

00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:25.949
we found that these N-glycolyl groups,

00:28:25.949 --> 00:28:29.983
these Gc groups actually
survive in a byproduct

00:28:29.983 --> 00:28:33.666
called chondroitin sulfate
in ancient fossils.

00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:36.350
And in fact, Meave sent us some samples

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.724
from a four million year old bovid fossil,

00:28:38.724 --> 00:28:40.818
and you could find GCCS there.

00:28:40.818 --> 00:28:45.439
So, we now wonder whether we
can go back to this theory,

00:28:45.439 --> 00:28:48.475
and we're trying to improve our techniques

00:28:48.475 --> 00:28:51.100
and convince people to share with us

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.798
small amounts of their hominin samples,

00:28:52.798 --> 00:28:55.321
but if you can do that,
we could end up with

00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:59.775
N-glycolyl-CS positive and
N-glycolyl-CS negative fossils.

00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:02.670
And this branch would then try to break up

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.311
this big bush that
everybody's studying right now

00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:08.428
and get some lineage out of it.

00:29:08.428 --> 00:29:10.636
Okay, what's a Siglec?

00:29:10.636 --> 00:29:13.581
A Siglec is a molecule,
a family of molecules

00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:15.907
that we discovered and
named some years ago,

00:29:15.907 --> 00:29:20.320
which, through this red domain
on the amino terminal end,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.519
this is the cell membrane,
binds sialic acid.

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:26.940
They have many functions, but
one of their major functions

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.006
is this subgroup called
CD33-related Siglecs.

00:29:30.006 --> 00:29:32.483
What they basically do is see sialic acid

00:29:32.483 --> 00:29:34.749
as self-associated molecular patterns.

00:29:34.749 --> 00:29:36.373
You hear about danger-associated,

00:29:36.373 --> 00:29:38.286
pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

00:29:38.286 --> 00:29:40.115
Well why don't your cells attack you?

00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:44.914
Well the reason is, they see
sialic acid and say, halt.

00:29:44.914 --> 00:29:47.390
So the immune cell is stopped by that.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:52.176
So you can think of it as
brakes on immune cells.

00:29:52.176 --> 00:29:55.213
And so, these molecule patterns
are actually widespread.

00:29:55.213 --> 00:29:57.564
Pascal suggested I show this picture,

00:29:57.564 --> 00:30:00.603
'cause a picture speaks a thousand words.

00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:02.115
Here's a fresh blood smear,

00:30:02.115 --> 00:30:03.848
that's glyco-foreign on the surface,

00:30:03.848 --> 00:30:05.867
covered with sialic
acids, red blood cells.

00:30:05.867 --> 00:30:08.257
Here's a white blood cell, a neutrophil,

00:30:08.257 --> 00:30:10.532
and you can see all the
Siglec-9 is clustered.

00:30:10.532 --> 00:30:13.017
The red cells are holding
onto the neutrophil saying,

00:30:13.017 --> 00:30:16.232
wait there, buddy, you're
not ready to fight yet.

00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:19.227
And so of course, pathogens
have taken advantage of this.

00:30:19.227 --> 00:30:22.581
And it turns out that
no pathogen can make Gc.

00:30:22.581 --> 00:30:24.771
How have we lost Gc?

00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:27.325
We threw away our best self-signal.

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:29.582
And so, now we have these bugs

00:30:29.582 --> 00:30:32.381
of wolves in sheep's clothing
that are invading us.

00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:34.405
(laughter)

00:30:34.405 --> 00:30:36.053
And so, then we found a second mutation

00:30:36.053 --> 00:30:40.003
affecting sialic acid biology in SIGLEC12.

00:30:40.003 --> 00:30:42.185
And here, we had fixed genomic changes,

00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.572
polymorphic genomic changes,

00:30:44.572 --> 00:30:46.427
and major expression changes.

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:48.119
Well, three of the major categories,

00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:51.059
but we were really quite
frustrated because without,

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.693
the level of molecular
biology we could do,

00:30:53.693 --> 00:30:55.690
we couldn't go much further.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.475
But fortunately, many people
started getting interested

00:30:59.475 --> 00:31:01.064
in the chimpanzee genome.

00:31:01.064 --> 00:31:03.554
This is an article I wrote.

00:31:03.554 --> 00:31:05.050
And the baby, Papot,

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.268
from this photograph by Pascal Gagneux,

00:31:07.268 --> 00:31:09.357
and Sarah Varki from Hudson Freeze.

00:31:09.357 --> 00:31:11.663
I did get permission from Sarah Varki.

00:31:11.663 --> 00:31:13.307
(laughter)

00:31:13.307 --> 00:31:15.432
And so, Maynard got excited about this,

00:31:15.432 --> 00:31:17.852
and actually 9-11 has
something to do with it,

00:31:17.852 --> 00:31:20.149
but that's a story for another time.

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:21.924
And white papers are submitted,

00:31:21.924 --> 00:31:24.835
we actually had the first
ever CARTA Symposium,

00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:27.760
just before the chimpanzee
genome came out.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.601
That's Sarah again, again,
with her permission.

00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:34.331
So now we have the sequence
of chimpanzee genome,

00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:37.855
and fast forward now 10, 12 years,

00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:40.243
and we could look at all these SIGLECS.

00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:41.463
The long and the short of it is

00:31:41.463 --> 00:31:45.296
in the circle of life
that Pascal drew for me.

00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:50.401
We find rows of SIGLECS,
mutations of SIGLECS

00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:54.751
involving many, many different
parts of the circle of life.

00:31:54.751 --> 00:31:59.057
From cells ranging from
sperm to gut epithelia

00:31:59.057 --> 00:32:01.664
to T and B cells, to
even pancreatic islets,

00:32:01.664 --> 00:32:04.164
and ROS production, and so on.

00:32:05.734 --> 00:32:08.124
The problem was that we had,

00:32:08.124 --> 00:32:11.556
just one or two genomes
of each of the apes.

00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:14.051
And there's always this worry,
is it just genome quality?

00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:17.669
Is this just chance, is
just ascertainment bias?

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:19.359
Are we like the prodigal drunk,

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:22.692
looking under the lamppost for the keys?

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:27.842
Fortunately, at that time, Evan Eichler

00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:29.781
and Tomas Marques-Bonet came up

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.858
with great ape genetic diversity
and population history,

00:32:32.858 --> 00:32:35.926
actually involving many
people and CARTA, as well.

00:32:35.926 --> 00:32:38.217
So we had access to ape genomes.

00:32:38.217 --> 00:32:39.785
So, now we could get

00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:41.325
a reasonable number of ape genomes,

00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:43.159
not as many as humans, of course.

00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:45.124
But, still something to work with.

00:32:45.124 --> 00:32:46.658
We did that, it turned out that,

00:32:46.658 --> 00:32:48.616
in fact, even some of the polymorphisms

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:51.543
we thought were fixed
in apes were not fixed.

00:32:51.543 --> 00:32:54.415
They're polymorphic, they're not fixed.

00:32:54.415 --> 00:32:55.416
So, in fact we've seen

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.919
that apes don't have many mutations.

00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:00.991
so this finding over here,
and some of these are,

00:33:00.991 --> 00:33:05.158
of course are expression
patterns, is significant.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:08.811
And so this, and so
we've shown you multiple

00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:12.592
genomic events altering
hominin sialic acid biology,

00:33:12.592 --> 00:33:15.584
and now I'll come to
the actual topic of the,

00:33:15.584 --> 00:33:19.565
about the common ancestor
of humans and Neanderthals.

00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:23.141
These mutations are all
found in African populations,

00:33:23.141 --> 00:33:26.352
so they've predated the common
origin of modern humans.

00:33:26.352 --> 00:33:28.100
Actually, a paper just online,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.975
including Tony Capra, I think is here,

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:34.376
shows that genes involved
in sialic acid biology

00:33:34.376 --> 00:33:37.037
do not harbor, at least strong signatures

00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:38.895
of recent positive selection.

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:41.478
They're of more ancient origin.

00:33:42.907 --> 00:33:46.135
And so, Stephane and Kay, from Leipzig,

00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:47.221
showed a new method.

00:33:47.221 --> 00:33:48.943
And showed in fact, there's no evidence

00:33:48.943 --> 00:33:51.051
of strong selection on these genes

00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:52.466
after the divergence of humans

00:33:52.466 --> 00:33:55.520
and Neanderthal common ancestors.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.687
So now we can zoom in here

00:34:00.095 --> 00:34:02.444
and start looking at the wonderful data

00:34:02.444 --> 00:34:05.860
that Svante Paabo and so
many others have generated

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.710
on Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:12.366
And, looking at these
sequences, we find that,

00:34:12.366 --> 00:34:15.067
we can find essentially
all of these mutations,

00:34:15.067 --> 00:34:17.975
almost all of them, although obviously

00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:20.172
the population sizes here are very small.

00:34:20.172 --> 00:34:22.350
So we can't, we don't know
whether they're fixed or not.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:26.697
But you can find mutations
SIGLEC3, 12, 14, 16,

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.614
13, 17, SIGLEC12, CMAH.

00:34:29.663 --> 00:34:32.658
There's a few other genes
that we're looking at.

00:34:32.658 --> 00:34:34.888
And as for these
expression pattern changes,

00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:36.334
we've looked at comparisons

00:34:36.334 --> 00:34:38.366
with chimps, and bonobos, and so on,

00:34:38.366 --> 00:34:41.425
but we don't have all
the possible comparisons.

00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:43.502
But something seems to be going on

00:34:43.502 --> 00:34:45.237
where a large number of genes

00:34:45.237 --> 00:34:46.254
seem to have been turned on

00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:50.127
in the human lineage in many tissues.

00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:53.170
So, what we believe is that

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.981
this cluster of genes on chromosome 19

00:34:56.981 --> 00:34:58.875
has undergone some changes.

00:34:58.875 --> 00:35:01.292
Clearly undergone a
lot of genomic changes,

00:35:01.292 --> 00:35:03.683
and perhaps secondarily,

00:35:03.683 --> 00:35:05.919
perhaps affecting epigenetics,

00:35:05.919 --> 00:35:08.015
and transcription, and so on,

00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:11.852
also, produced a lot of
ectopic expression we think,

00:35:11.852 --> 00:35:14.119
of SIGLECS in various other tissues,

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:15.933
but there's a lot more work to be done

00:35:15.933 --> 00:35:19.313
before we can say much about that.

00:35:19.313 --> 00:35:21.354
but in terms of what we think happened,

00:35:21.354 --> 00:35:23.206
you can never be sure in evolution.

00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:26.793
You just make up stories
and see if they fit.

00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:28.701
It's more like a murder mystery

00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:31.144
and actually a patient in
coma in emergency room,

00:35:31.144 --> 00:35:35.194
the kind of thing I'm more
used to doing actually,

00:35:35.194 --> 00:35:37.752
but we think that the CMAH mutation

00:35:37.752 --> 00:35:40.603
really occurred two to
three million years ago,

00:35:40.603 --> 00:35:42.820
and we have some other
connections to the genus Homo

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.805
that we haven't published yet,

00:35:44.805 --> 00:35:47.577
or perhaps there was some incident,

00:35:47.577 --> 00:35:50.946
or incidents involving loss of CMAH

00:35:50.946 --> 00:35:53.567
and selection of the
kind that we suggested,

00:35:53.567 --> 00:35:55.207
and perhaps pathogens.

00:35:55.207 --> 00:35:58.972
And it turns out that the
binding pockets of the SIGLECS,

00:35:58.972 --> 00:36:01.066
I am not showing you the data,

00:36:01.066 --> 00:36:03.348
have evolved very rapidly, as well.

00:36:03.348 --> 00:36:06.372
And so maybe there was selection there.

00:36:06.372 --> 00:36:07.705
So, conclusions,

00:36:09.611 --> 00:36:13.333
multiple genomic events
altering hominin sialic acid

00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:14.678
and Siglec biology,

00:36:14.678 --> 00:36:16.159
and there's a few other
sialic acid changes

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:18.250
I've not mentioned,

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.760
predate the common ancestor
of humans and Neanderthals.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.432
Actually, I don't know of any other system

00:36:22.432 --> 00:36:24.635
where they've been so many changes.

00:36:24.635 --> 00:36:26.887
There are likely multiple selection forces

00:36:26.887 --> 00:36:30.598
affecting innate immunity and
host-pathogen interactions.

00:36:30.598 --> 00:36:33.024
And perhaps, this is the interesting part,

00:36:33.024 --> 00:36:34.695
the secondary consequence has been

00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:37.354
human-specific expression of CD33 Siglecs

00:36:37.354 --> 00:36:39.922
in unusual cell types and tissues,

00:36:39.922 --> 00:36:43.639
including brain microglia,
mucosal surfaces,

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:46.803
losses from some surfaces,
the reproductive system,

00:36:46.803 --> 00:36:49.331
amnion, placenta, et cetera.

00:36:49.331 --> 00:36:51.053
So, I'll leave it there,

00:36:51.053 --> 00:36:54.470
and say that we have a lot of work to do.

00:36:55.404 --> 00:36:58.556
I encourage others interested in this area

00:36:58.556 --> 00:37:01.788
to join us in this pursuit, thank you.

00:37:01.788 --> 00:37:03.945
(applause)

00:37:03.945 --> 00:37:06.788
- My lab is primarily interested in

00:37:06.788 --> 00:37:09.589
understanding some of the
molecular and cellular basis

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:11.820
for the development of the cortex,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.138
but unlike some of the previous
speakers we're focusing

00:37:16.138 --> 00:37:19.465
on the development of
neuronal connectivity

00:37:19.465 --> 00:37:21.932
and how circuits assemble basically,

00:37:21.932 --> 00:37:23.543
in developing brain.

00:37:23.543 --> 00:37:26.651
I'm gonna move fast on the introduction,

00:37:26.651 --> 00:37:31.334
'cause I think you've heard a
lot about the general interest

00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:33.293
of understanding what makes us human,

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:36.536
and in particular, what makes
our brain human-specific.

00:37:36.536 --> 00:37:39.517
Another way to phrase that
question as you heard before,

00:37:39.517 --> 00:37:42.051
is to ask what happened to our genome

00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:44.465
since we diverged from
our common ancestor,

00:37:44.465 --> 00:37:46.965
more than 7, 10 million years.

00:37:48.322 --> 00:37:50.904
There's actually debate
about that exact time

00:37:50.904 --> 00:37:54.504
for divergence from our common ancestor.

00:37:54.504 --> 00:37:55.855
So to the first question,

00:37:55.855 --> 00:37:58.219
what makes our brain human-specific?

00:37:58.219 --> 00:38:00.909
You have heard a lot today
about the possibility

00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:03.680
that what makes our brain different

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.082
from our most common living relatives,

00:38:07.082 --> 00:38:11.275
like chimps and bonobos,
or to other higher mammals,

00:38:11.275 --> 00:38:14.554
would be brain size, or at
least the size of the cortex

00:38:14.554 --> 00:38:16.727
relative to the rest of the brain.

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:18.267
I would argue that despite the fact that

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:20.477
that's the question that most
people are interested in,

00:38:20.477 --> 00:38:24.584
it cannot be the entire
answer, for simple reason,

00:38:24.584 --> 00:38:27.639
which is that if you look
at brain size expansion,

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:31.277
including the increases
in neocortical size,

00:38:31.277 --> 00:38:35.003
many mammals have succeeded at this

00:38:35.003 --> 00:38:38.741
without any real gain in
cognitive abilities, right?

00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:43.628
In fact, brain size is best
correlated to body size,

00:38:43.628 --> 00:38:45.412
not to cognitive abilities, right?

00:38:45.412 --> 00:38:48.142
So, brain size and neocortex expansion

00:38:48.142 --> 00:38:51.892
were probably an important
step during evolution,

00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:54.889
and it happened many times
during mammalian evolution,

00:38:54.889 --> 00:38:57.128
but it can't be the only explanation

00:38:57.128 --> 00:38:59.169
for what makes our brain human-specific,

00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:02.003
at least in emergence
of cognitive abilities.

00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:06.209
So, you know many open
remaining possibilities.

00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:08.749
Neuronal composition, right?

00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:11.173
The type of neurons that are produced

00:39:11.173 --> 00:39:14.242
that Rick and others have
talked about earlier.

00:39:14.242 --> 00:39:16.870
Circuit connectivity, the
total number of synapses

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.537
made between neurons

00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:22.454
are things that will
influence circuit function

00:39:22.454 --> 00:39:24.674
and probably cognitive abilities.

00:39:24.674 --> 00:39:27.414
Something that very few
people have talked about,

00:39:27.414 --> 00:39:29.821
nonneuronal cells, astrocytes, microglia.

00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.478
Those could, there's actually
some very recent evidence

00:39:32.478 --> 00:39:35.045
suggesting that differences in composition

00:39:35.045 --> 00:39:38.823
or total number of nonneuronal
cells might be difference

00:39:38.823 --> 00:39:41.425
between human and non human primates.

00:39:41.425 --> 00:39:43.606
So, today I'm gonna try to convince you

00:39:43.606 --> 00:39:45.814
that we have evidence,
probably the first evidence,

00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:49.332
suggesting that a specific
gene duplication event

00:39:49.332 --> 00:39:51.999
has pretty significantly changed

00:39:52.864 --> 00:39:55.643
both the number of synapses
made between neurons,

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:57.712
and we think actually affects

00:39:57.712 --> 00:40:00.488
circuit connectivity and circuit function.

00:40:00.488 --> 00:40:02.170
So, how did we get
interested in this question?

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.872
We got interested in this question

00:40:03.872 --> 00:40:05.822
based on the work of several groups,

00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:09.489
including beautiful work from Evan Eichler

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:11.650
that you'll hear about just after me,

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.341
so I'm not gonna bore you with details

00:40:13.341 --> 00:40:15.017
about what Evan has did.

00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:19.166
But, back in early 2000s,
work from Jim Sikela,

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:22.333
and then refined and expanded by Evan,

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.574
identified gene duplication events

00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:28.983
that are specific to the human lineage,

00:40:28.983 --> 00:40:32.107
gene duplications, new gene
copies, that are not present

00:40:32.107 --> 00:40:35.311
in any other nonhuman primates
or in any other mammals.

00:40:35.311 --> 00:40:39.713
So essentially, what
Evan has done has shown,

00:40:39.713 --> 00:40:41.796
shown here on this graph,

00:40:43.427 --> 00:40:46.300
so what Evan has shown is that in humans,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.607
you have a whole list
of gene, about 30 genes,

00:40:49.607 --> 00:40:51.082
that have extra copies essentially.

00:40:51.082 --> 00:40:53.963
So those copies are specific to humans,

00:40:53.963 --> 00:40:56.755
they're not found in nonhuman primates.

00:40:56.755 --> 00:41:00.141
And unfortunately, or fortunately for us,

00:41:00.141 --> 00:41:02.977
most of those genes have
completely unknown function.

00:41:02.977 --> 00:41:04.668
That's not entirely true,

00:41:04.668 --> 00:41:06.824
there is one gene in at least SMN1,

00:41:06.824 --> 00:41:08.636
which is the gene that's mutated

00:41:08.636 --> 00:41:10.508
in spinal muscular atrophy.

00:41:10.508 --> 00:41:12.794
Turns out that humans, and humans only,

00:41:12.794 --> 00:41:14.929
have an extra copy of
this, and it's actually

00:41:14.929 --> 00:41:17.788
absolutely fascinating work
that's been done on this.

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:21.562
There's a drug treatment that
just emerged very recently,

00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:24.330
actually taking advantage
of the second copy,

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.400
the human specific copy of SMN1.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.379
If you're interested, I
can tell you more about,

00:41:28.379 --> 00:41:29.771
but for vast majority,

00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:32.031
all the other genes have
largely unknown function.

00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:35.335
And so, except that around the time

00:41:35.335 --> 00:41:38.209
when this first work was published,

00:41:38.209 --> 00:41:42.258
there was one gene in that
list, SRGAP2 listed here,

00:41:42.258 --> 00:41:44.958
that we were probably the only lab

00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:46.640
working on this gene at that time.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.346
And we had some interesting data

00:41:49.346 --> 00:41:50.996
suggesting that this gene was actually

00:41:50.996 --> 00:41:54.654
playing important functions
during brain development,

00:41:54.654 --> 00:41:57.139
at least the ancestral copy of this gene,

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:59.645
but when Jim Sikela and Evan Eichler

00:41:59.645 --> 00:42:01.741
published these results,
we were struck by the fact

00:42:01.741 --> 00:42:04.263
that there are human-specific
copies of this gene.

00:42:04.263 --> 00:42:07.863
And so, we embarked on
trying to characterize what

00:42:07.863 --> 00:42:12.483
those human-specific
duplications of SRGAP2 do.

00:42:12.483 --> 00:42:15.242
So as a paradigm, basically
many question arise

00:42:15.242 --> 00:42:19.233
from this observation that
there are human-specific

00:42:19.233 --> 00:42:20.740
gene duplicates from those.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.676
The first one is which of those genes

00:42:22.676 --> 00:42:25.851
are expressed in the human brain?

00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:28.307
The second question is
what is the function

00:42:28.307 --> 00:42:30.036
of the ancestral copy of this gene?

00:42:30.036 --> 00:42:31.729
As I mentioned, most of
those genes have completely

00:42:31.729 --> 00:42:33.939
unknown function during brain development,

00:42:33.939 --> 00:42:35.529
so we had to start with this.

00:42:35.529 --> 00:42:38.113
And the third question,
that's truly interesting,

00:42:38.113 --> 00:42:40.703
is the function of the
human-specific paralogs

00:42:40.703 --> 00:42:43.104
related to the function
of the ancestral copy,

00:42:43.104 --> 00:42:47.308
or are those new copies
basically acquiring

00:42:47.308 --> 00:42:49.567
some completely independent functions?

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.067
Some completely new functions,

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:53.863
independent of the function
of the ancestral copy, right?

00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:56.057
Both scenarios could be true.

00:42:56.057 --> 00:42:58.247
So, I'm gonna summarize here,

00:42:58.247 --> 00:43:01.747
essentially 11 years of work from our lab,

00:43:02.653 --> 00:43:04.242
from multiple people in my lab,

00:43:04.242 --> 00:43:06.067
and then during the rest of the talk,

00:43:06.067 --> 00:43:08.256
I'm gonna unpack and tell you a bit more

00:43:08.256 --> 00:43:11.423
about how we got to those conclusions.

00:43:12.528 --> 00:43:15.786
So essentially, SRGAP2A
is an adaptor protein

00:43:15.786 --> 00:43:18.053
containing three functional domains.

00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:19.337
This have bottom end

00:43:19.337 --> 00:43:21.255
which is essentially a
homodimerization motif,

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:23.978
a central domain called
the Rap-GAP domain.

00:43:23.978 --> 00:43:25.470
It's a domain that inactivates

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.269
a small GTPase called Rac-1.

00:43:28.269 --> 00:43:29.656
And then there's SH3 domain,

00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:32.186
that's essentially a protein
protein interaction motif.

00:43:32.186 --> 00:43:36.118
So, all mammals, from
rodents to nonhuman primates,

00:43:36.118 --> 00:43:38.285
and humans have this gene.

00:43:39.225 --> 00:43:40.974
It's expressed, it's highly
expressed in the brain.

00:43:40.974 --> 00:43:43.723
It's expressed largely in only neurons,

00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:45.566
and also I'll show you later on,

00:43:45.566 --> 00:43:48.554
it's actually very enriched at synapses.

00:43:48.554 --> 00:43:51.607
But it turns out that about
two to four million years ago,

00:43:51.607 --> 00:43:54.607
two gene duplication events at least

00:43:55.906 --> 00:43:59.906
made this new copy that's
human specific emerge,

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.337
that we had to call SRGAP2C,

00:44:04.337 --> 00:44:07.954
nd Evan will probably tell
you a bit more about that.

00:44:07.954 --> 00:44:11.175
And so, this coding sequence
is truncated actually.

00:44:11.175 --> 00:44:13.645
It doesn't express the full
length protein, it's truncated.

00:44:13.645 --> 00:44:16.395
It expresses 90 percent
of this bottom end,

00:44:16.395 --> 00:44:19.437
which remains able to bind
to the ancestral copy,

00:44:19.437 --> 00:44:22.320
and largely inhibits it function, okay?

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.657
So, its main function, so it turns out

00:44:24.657 --> 00:44:27.309
that we get essentially the same phenotype

00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:29.943
when we inactivate SRGAP2A,

00:44:29.943 --> 00:44:32.645
or when we induce the
expression of this gene, okay?

00:44:32.645 --> 00:44:36.538
And, the phenotypes we get
are delayed, excitatory,

00:44:36.538 --> 00:44:38.837
and inhibitory synaptic maturation,

00:44:38.837 --> 00:44:40.882
this phenomenon called neoteny,

00:44:40.882 --> 00:44:43.752
which is essentially defined by retention

00:44:43.752 --> 00:44:46.571
of immature features for
longer periods of time

00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:48.982
during development.

00:44:48.982 --> 00:44:50.815
We get increased density

00:44:50.815 --> 00:44:53.566
of both excitatory and
inhibitory synapses.

00:44:53.566 --> 00:44:58.468
And finally, we get increased
cortical connectivity.

00:44:58.468 --> 00:44:59.573
This is largely unpublished.

00:44:59.573 --> 00:45:01.673
I won't, I probably won't have time

00:45:01.673 --> 00:45:03.636
to tell you much about this.

00:45:03.636 --> 00:45:05.722
So, how did we reach these conclusions?

00:45:05.722 --> 00:45:09.783
So, the first that we did
a long time ago, in 2009,

00:45:09.783 --> 00:45:12.259
we published expression
pattern for SRGAP2.

00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:15.235
And this very simple
observation that the protein

00:45:15.235 --> 00:45:19.344
in mouse cortex is expressed,
actually peaks at P1,

00:45:19.344 --> 00:45:23.341
but is expressed largely
at postnatal time when,

00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:25.920
between, during the first
two weeks of postnatal life

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.164
when the animals are basically
forming a lot of synapses.

00:45:30.164 --> 00:45:33.297
And so, when this very talented post-doc,

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.746
Cecile Charrier, joined the lab,

00:45:35.746 --> 00:45:37.249
she discovered that in fact,

00:45:37.249 --> 00:45:40.608
SRGAP2 protein is very
enriched at synapses.

00:45:40.608 --> 00:45:42.173
This is high resolution images

00:45:42.173 --> 00:45:44.533
of individual synapses in mouse neurons.

00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.631
And I hope you can
appreciate the fact that,

00:45:46.631 --> 00:45:50.258
essentially there is very
little SRGAP2 in small synapses

00:45:50.258 --> 00:45:54.078
and lots of SRGAP2
protein in large synapses.

00:45:54.078 --> 00:45:55.947
Those synapses here are visualized.

00:45:55.947 --> 00:45:58.109
Those excitatory synapses are visualized

00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:00.227
by this protein, Homer1.

00:46:00.227 --> 00:46:02.890
And it turns out that, at
that time we didn't know,

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:06.737
but in fact those two
proteins in function interact.

00:46:06.737 --> 00:46:10.904
So, what is SRGAP2 function
in synaptic development?

00:46:12.843 --> 00:46:15.617
So, neurons are absolutely amazing cells,

00:46:15.617 --> 00:46:17.367
if you think about it, right?

00:46:17.367 --> 00:46:19.057
Those cells are gigantic.

00:46:19.057 --> 00:46:21.848
A fibroblast, that people
have talked about before,

00:46:21.848 --> 00:46:24.707
would be the size of this
size body here, right?

00:46:24.707 --> 00:46:26.371
So they're gigantic cells.

00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:30.084
And, a graduate student in
the lab, Daniel Lascone,

00:46:30.084 --> 00:46:33.612
has developed some new
methodology to actually,

00:46:33.612 --> 00:46:36.087
at single-cell resolution in vivo,

00:46:36.087 --> 00:46:39.427
visualize the presence and the topography

00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:42.452
of all synapses, excitatory
and inhibitory synapses,

00:46:42.452 --> 00:46:44.434
made into a single neuron, okay?

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:47.832
And so this allows us to understand both,

00:46:47.832 --> 00:46:50.947
to have very quantitative ideas

00:46:50.947 --> 00:46:53.374
of where synapses are
localized in neurons,

00:46:53.374 --> 00:46:54.807
how many they form.

00:46:54.807 --> 00:46:57.153
And you know, for a
typical neuron like this,

00:46:57.153 --> 00:46:59.816
this layer, two, three
pyramidal neurons in a mouse

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:02.209
forms somewhere between four

00:47:02.209 --> 00:47:04.722
and 6,000 excitatory synapses

00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:06.627
and somewhere between 1,000

00:47:06.627 --> 00:47:09.416
and 1500 inhibitory synapses.

00:47:09.416 --> 00:47:12.601
Right, so staggering numbers
for just a single cell, right?

00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:16.158
And so, if you zoom up on those green dots

00:47:16.158 --> 00:47:17.060
that you see here,

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.133
those are individual
spines, dendritic spines.

00:47:19.133 --> 00:47:22.753
I'm gonna talk a lot about
those in the rest of the talk.

00:47:22.753 --> 00:47:25.659
Those protrusions, those micron,

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:28.166
this is a, the scale is one micron here,

00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:30.085
so they're tiny protrusions,

00:47:30.085 --> 00:47:32.998
essentially constitutes
individual synapses.

00:47:32.998 --> 00:47:36.984
If you look at an EM pictures
of a single spine like this,

00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:38.601
these protrusions, this is the site,

00:47:38.601 --> 00:47:41.307
basically a single spine
constitutes a single synapse.

00:47:41.307 --> 00:47:43.046
It's the postsynaptic receiving end,

00:47:43.046 --> 00:47:44.520
basically, of a synapse.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.303
So this is an axon,

00:47:46.303 --> 00:47:48.587
with those neurotransmitter
filled vesicles here,

00:47:48.587 --> 00:47:51.104
that release neurotransmitter
in the synaptic cleft,

00:47:51.104 --> 00:47:54.761
that then activate the
postsynaptic receptors here.

00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:57.293
So essentially, those
synapses are the basis

00:47:57.293 --> 00:47:59.218
for neuronal communications, right?

00:47:59.218 --> 00:48:02.821
And, decades of work by hundreds of labs

00:48:02.821 --> 00:48:06.496
have identified essentially
a zoo of proteins,

00:48:06.496 --> 00:48:08.181
hundreds of proteins that are localized

00:48:08.181 --> 00:48:11.335
pre and post-synaptically
here at the dendritic spines.

00:48:11.335 --> 00:48:14.220
Those proteins, the main
job of those proteins,

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.235
including these Homo
Shank-interacting proteins

00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:19.191
that I'm gonna tell you in a second,

00:48:19.191 --> 00:48:21.318
is to basically create
a very complex scaffold

00:48:21.318 --> 00:48:23.133
to anchor and stabilize

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:25.239
the neurotransmitter receptors here

00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:28.367
that sends neurotransmitter release here.

00:48:28.367 --> 00:48:31.886
And so, we discovered that SRGAP2

00:48:31.886 --> 00:48:34.981
is actually directly
reacting with Homer here.

00:48:34.981 --> 00:48:38.005
And in fact, I'll show you later on,

00:48:38.005 --> 00:48:42.849
SRGAP2 seems to control
the scaffolding properties

00:48:42.849 --> 00:48:46.883
of those proteins and controls
the rate of accumulation

00:48:46.883 --> 00:48:49.253
of those neurotransmitter receptors,

00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:52.336
such as AMPA receptors during development.

00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:53.725
So how did we discover this?

00:48:53.725 --> 00:48:56.199
Takayuki Sassa, the first post doc

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:57.561
who was involved in this project,

00:48:57.561 --> 00:48:59.486
started by making a knockout for SRGAP2A

00:48:59.486 --> 00:49:01.297
for the ancestral copy in mice.

00:49:01.297 --> 00:49:04.117
So, we made this knockout in order

00:49:04.117 --> 00:49:06.747
to ask what happens when
we delete this gene.

00:49:06.747 --> 00:49:08.439
And the main thing that happens

00:49:08.439 --> 00:49:11.312
when you delete this
gene is essentially that,

00:49:11.312 --> 00:49:13.471
if you look at those spines.

00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:15.707
The size of the spines,
I forgot to mention,

00:49:15.707 --> 00:49:18.072
is proportional to how mature it is,

00:49:18.072 --> 00:49:19.941
how many postsynaptic receptors

00:49:19.941 --> 00:49:21.757
have accumulated there.

00:49:21.757 --> 00:49:24.525
If you look at an animal
three weeks after birth,

00:49:24.525 --> 00:49:25.837
a wild type animal.

00:49:25.837 --> 00:49:27.425
Those spines are already mature,

00:49:27.425 --> 00:49:29.853
so they have mature synapses.

00:49:29.853 --> 00:49:34.380
There's a lot of data
has, that has shown this.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.683
But then if you look at the heterozygous,

00:49:36.683 --> 00:49:39.303
so if you delete one copy
or two copies of the gene,

00:49:39.303 --> 00:49:42.928
you have significantly smaller spines

00:49:42.928 --> 00:49:44.593
at this juvenile time point.

00:49:44.593 --> 00:49:46.047
They have longer necks,

00:49:46.047 --> 00:49:47.939
so the neck that connects this spine head

00:49:47.939 --> 00:49:50.462
to the dendrites is longer.

00:49:50.462 --> 00:49:52.444
And most interestingly,

00:49:52.444 --> 00:49:54.164
there's a pretty significant increase

00:49:54.164 --> 00:49:55.886
in density of the spines,

00:49:55.886 --> 00:50:00.868
but interestingly enough,
this size effect is transient.

00:50:00.868 --> 00:50:04.409
So if you look at P65,
about 40 days later,

00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:06.749
those spines reach maturation.

00:50:06.749 --> 00:50:08.609
So, it's just a delay in maturation.

00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:11.577
Those spines, when you inactivate SRGAP2

00:50:11.577 --> 00:50:15.355
seems to be much slower
at reaching maturations.

00:50:15.355 --> 00:50:18.749
Instead of being mature at
P21, they're mature at P45.

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.155
But in the adult basically,

00:50:20.155 --> 00:50:22.671
the spines remain having a longer neck

00:50:22.671 --> 00:50:25.838
and very significantly higher numbers,

00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:30.398
basically a significantly higher density.

00:50:30.398 --> 00:50:32.601
So, what happens if we
humanize mouse neurons

00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:34.328
for SRGAP2C, right?

00:50:34.328 --> 00:50:36.758
I briefly mentioned before that our model

00:50:36.758 --> 00:50:39.941
based on studies we published before,

00:50:39.941 --> 00:50:41.738
was that the truncated version,

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:43.804
the human-specific version of this gene,

00:50:43.804 --> 00:50:45.722
would bind to and inhibit

00:50:45.722 --> 00:50:47.941
the function of the ancestral copy, right?

00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:49.422
So the prediction would be,

00:50:49.422 --> 00:50:51.767
that if we express SRGAP2C
in the mouse genome

00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:53.994
that expresses SRGAP2A,

00:50:53.994 --> 00:50:56.822
we would get phenotype that
look exactly like this,

00:50:56.822 --> 00:50:58.832
and that's exactly what we found.

00:50:58.832 --> 00:51:01.836
Essentially, if you look at
juvenile animals control,

00:51:01.836 --> 00:51:04.907
or SRGAP2C humanized mouse neurons,

00:51:04.907 --> 00:51:07.750
you get this delayed maturation, right,

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:11.917
but they actually reach
maturation at P65 instead of P21,

00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:16.491
and they retain longer necks
and higher spine density.

00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:18.720
So this was a very interesting
result for us, right?

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.242
This says, because essentially

00:51:20.242 --> 00:51:22.282
we know that those three features,

00:51:22.282 --> 00:51:25.541
delayed maturation, longer neck,

00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:27.613
which actually has very
important function,

00:51:27.613 --> 00:51:30.664
and higher density are three
phenotypes that are known

00:51:30.664 --> 00:51:32.146
to characterize human neurons

00:51:32.146 --> 00:51:35.693
compared to either mouse
neurons or nonhuman primates.

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.558
So, beautiful work from Javier DeFelipe,

00:51:38.558 --> 00:51:42.382
Raphe Yuste, my colleague at Columbia,

00:51:42.382 --> 00:51:45.197
have shown that if you look
at spine density for example,

00:51:45.197 --> 00:51:47.339
between human or nonhuman primates,

00:51:47.339 --> 00:51:48.968
or if you look at spine density

00:51:48.968 --> 00:51:50.640
between human and mouse neurons,

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.640
you essentially get 30
to 50 percent more dense,

00:51:55.623 --> 00:51:57.396
higher density of spines,

00:51:57.396 --> 00:51:59.697
and those spines have longer necks.

00:51:59.697 --> 00:52:02.630
And we also know that synaptic development

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.096
in humans is profoundly neotenic.

00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:07.414
So basically, very prolonged maturation,

00:52:07.414 --> 00:52:09.108
very delayed maturation.

00:52:09.108 --> 00:52:10.687
So, this is interesting, right?

00:52:10.687 --> 00:52:13.821
Essentially with just
introducing a single gene

00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:15.939
that's human-specific in mouse neurons,

00:52:15.939 --> 00:52:18.274
we phenocopy three major aspects

00:52:18.274 --> 00:52:19.612
of synaptic development,

00:52:19.612 --> 00:52:22.094
delayed maturation, higher density,

00:52:22.094 --> 00:52:24.841
and changing the morphology
of those spines, right?

00:52:24.841 --> 00:52:26.536
But we have a problem,

00:52:26.536 --> 00:52:29.997
which is that we know that changing

00:52:29.997 --> 00:52:32.746
and increasing the density
of excitatory synapses

00:52:32.746 --> 00:52:34.693
cannot be the only explanation,

00:52:34.693 --> 00:52:38.680
since beautiful work from
Javier Defelipe and many others,

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.184
have shown that there's an amazing degree

00:52:41.184 --> 00:52:44.576
of conservation in the
ratio between excitatory

00:52:44.576 --> 00:52:48.753
and inhibitory synapses
in the cortex, right?

00:52:48.753 --> 00:52:52.646
So we know that, if that's the
only thing SRGAP2 is doing,

00:52:52.646 --> 00:52:55.508
increasing the number
of excitatory synapses,

00:52:55.508 --> 00:52:57.094
we would have a problem.

00:52:57.094 --> 00:52:58.797
We would have major imbalance

00:52:58.797 --> 00:53:01.434
between excitation and
inhibition, which is a landmark

00:53:01.434 --> 00:53:04.654
of many neurodevelopmental
disorders, for example,

00:53:04.654 --> 00:53:06.904
such as autism or epilepsy.

00:53:07.828 --> 00:53:10.793
So, either SRGAP2 was doing the job

00:53:10.793 --> 00:53:12.618
and was coordinating the maturation

00:53:12.618 --> 00:53:15.045
of both excitatory and
inhibitory synapses,

00:53:15.045 --> 00:53:16.918
or some other genes,

00:53:16.918 --> 00:53:19.027
maybe some of the other gene duplications

00:53:19.027 --> 00:53:21.198
that I mentioned before, would do the job.

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:24.628
It turns out that nature
has selected SRGAP2,

00:53:24.628 --> 00:53:26.403
probably for a reason.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.783
It's because SRGAP2 does
exactly the same thing

00:53:28.783 --> 00:53:31.969
it does at excitatory synapses
at inhibitory synapses.

00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:34.265
So we discovered this
because, more recently,

00:53:34.265 --> 00:53:37.759
because now we can actually
visualize inhibitory synapses

00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:40.092
with amazing accuracy using,

00:53:41.047 --> 00:53:43.968
for example, this gefyrin-GFP.

00:53:43.968 --> 00:53:46.425
Gefyrin is a protein that's
exclusively localized

00:53:46.425 --> 00:53:47.898
at inhibitory synapses.

00:53:47.898 --> 00:53:49.569
And using single cell technology,

00:53:49.569 --> 00:53:51.811
single cell genetic labeling technology,

00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:53.663
we can not only visualize,

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:57.287
with some micron precision, spines,

00:53:57.287 --> 00:53:59.831
we can actually localize
those inhibitory buttons,

00:53:59.831 --> 00:54:02.627
even the ones that are made
on dendrite shaft here,

00:54:02.627 --> 00:54:04.489
or even more rare buttons

00:54:04.489 --> 00:54:06.889
that are made directly
on spine heads, here.

00:54:06.889 --> 00:54:09.032
I can tell you more about this later on.

00:54:09.032 --> 00:54:13.182
And remarkably, we find
that the same thing happens.

00:54:13.182 --> 00:54:16.306
Then for spines, if you
look at inhibitory button,

00:54:16.306 --> 00:54:19.391
if you down regulate this
SRGAP2A, the ancestral copy,

00:54:19.391 --> 00:54:22.550
or if you introduce and
humanize mouse neurons

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.756
for a SRGAP2C expression,

00:54:24.756 --> 00:54:28.431
you get higher density
of inhibitory clusters.

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:32.257
Those inhibitory synapses
are much smaller early on,

00:54:32.257 --> 00:54:35.810
but ultimately reach maturation at P65.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.341
And, there's a change in
their actual localizations,

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.599
a striking increase in the ones,

00:54:40.599 --> 00:54:44.655
the inhibitory synapses made
onto the spine heads here.

00:54:44.655 --> 00:54:47.970
So, increased density
and delayed maturation,

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.615
it's pretty remarkable.

00:54:49.615 --> 00:54:53.015
In fact, if you plot the
normalized increase in density

00:54:53.015 --> 00:54:55.965
for spines and for inhibitory synapses

00:54:55.965 --> 00:54:58.304
between control and
humanized mouse neurons,

00:54:58.304 --> 00:55:01.341
we get remarkably similar effects, right?

00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:04.426
So the conclusion here is that nature

00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:07.058
has selected a gene duplication event,

00:55:07.058 --> 00:55:10.390
that of a gene that essentially controls

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:15.219
the coevolution of inhibitory
and excitatory synapses.

00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:17.604
This is really, I think, a very important

00:55:17.604 --> 00:55:20.133
take-home message right here.

00:55:20.133 --> 00:55:24.044
So, I will finish here by taking a minute

00:55:24.044 --> 00:55:27.672
to recap everything I've told you today.

00:55:27.672 --> 00:55:30.422
We've identified a gene, SRGAP2A,

00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:36.395
which in its ancestral form
expressed in all mammals,

00:55:36.395 --> 00:55:38.812
controls three very important

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:42.581
aspects of synaptic development.

00:55:42.581 --> 00:55:44.577
It controls the density of excitatory

00:55:44.577 --> 00:55:45.953
and inhibitory synapses.

00:55:45.953 --> 00:55:48.146
Through work I didn't
have time to show you,

00:55:48.146 --> 00:55:51.717
we're actually able to do
structure function analysis

00:55:51.717 --> 00:55:54.252
in vivo using gene replacement strategies.

00:55:54.252 --> 00:55:57.465
And so, we can actually
dissociate how SRGAP2

00:55:57.465 --> 00:56:00.406
regulates spine density and
inhibitory synapse density,

00:56:00.406 --> 00:56:02.748
from how it controls the maturation

00:56:02.748 --> 00:56:06.006
of excitatory or inhibitory synapses.

00:56:06.006 --> 00:56:07.328
And we discovered,

00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:10.286
that the human-specific copy of this gene,

00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:12.250
which is this truncated form,

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:14.914
which remains able to
bind to the ancestral copy

00:56:14.914 --> 00:56:16.378
and inhibits its function,

00:56:16.378 --> 00:56:21.285
inhibits all three major
functions of SRGAP2, right?

00:56:21.285 --> 00:56:26.259
So what are the future
directions on this project?

00:56:26.259 --> 00:56:29.965
So, there are three future directions.

00:56:29.965 --> 00:56:31.543
The first one is, what are the

00:56:31.543 --> 00:56:33.663
upstream regulators of these proteins?

00:56:33.663 --> 00:56:36.409
I didn't tell you anything
about how this gene is regulated

00:56:36.409 --> 00:56:38.499
and how the protein itself is regulated.

00:56:38.499 --> 00:56:42.335
We have some evidence of
what's upstream of this.

00:56:42.335 --> 00:56:44.090
The second, very important question,

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.595
is where is this increased

00:56:46.595 --> 00:56:48.472
number of connections coming from, right?

00:56:48.472 --> 00:56:50.139
This gene basically,

00:56:51.093 --> 00:56:53.276
the emergence of this human-specific copy

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:55.419
increases the total number of synapses

00:56:55.419 --> 00:56:57.915
by 30 or 40 percent,
which is very significant.

00:56:57.915 --> 00:57:01.222
Where are those connections
coming from, right?

00:57:01.222 --> 00:57:04.764
We have some ideas about this already.

00:57:04.764 --> 00:57:06.691
And finally, probably the most important,

00:57:06.691 --> 00:57:09.945
is what aspect of circuit
function has been affected

00:57:09.945 --> 00:57:13.351
by the emergence of this
human-specific copy?

00:57:13.351 --> 00:57:15.968
That's something that's much
more difficult to approach,

00:57:15.968 --> 00:57:18.028
but believe it or not, we actually have

00:57:18.028 --> 00:57:21.887
some very interesting
new results about this.

00:57:21.887 --> 00:57:23.691
So finally, the people who did the work.

00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:25.161
The work was largely carried out

00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:27.786
by a very talented postdoc
in my lab, Cecile Charrier,

00:57:27.786 --> 00:57:29.305
who now has her own lab

00:57:29.305 --> 00:57:32.770
at Ecole Normale Superieure
in Paris, in France,

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.292
but she was assisted by many people

00:57:35.292 --> 00:57:37.956
and many people in my lab,

00:57:37.956 --> 00:57:39.990
at least there's four people listed here

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:43.115
are involved in current
aspect of the project.

00:57:43.115 --> 00:57:46.053
And finally, I'm excited
since I moved to Columbia

00:57:46.053 --> 00:57:47.520
about four years ago,

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.155
Columbia's creating a
third campus actually,

00:57:50.155 --> 00:57:51.997
called Manhattenville.

00:57:51.997 --> 00:57:54.454
And very recently, we went
from an architectural sketch,

00:57:54.454 --> 00:57:58.832
to an actual building
that will host 55 labs,

00:57:58.832 --> 00:58:00.009
about 1,000 people.

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.867
So, this will become a mind,
brain, and behavior institute.

00:58:02.867 --> 00:58:04.594
We are very excited to
move into this building,

00:58:04.594 --> 00:58:06.099
hopefully this fall.

00:58:06.099 --> 00:58:07.460
Thank you for your attention.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.710
(applause)

00:58:10.782 --> 00:58:13.365
(upbeat music)
