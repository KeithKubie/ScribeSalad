RETO MEIER: Hello.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.090
I'm Reto Meier for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.430
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.230
news from Google.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.910
We recently pushed
the source code

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.920
for the 2018 version of the
Santa Tracker Android app,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.329
including its 17 mini games,
Santa tracking feature,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.280
wear app, and more.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.290
This year included lots
of code improvements

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.760
that you can check
out, including

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.730
increasing the minimum
SDK version to Lollipop,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.880
migrating from the Support
Library to Android X, reducing

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.500
the file sizes of
the game assets

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.860
by switching to modern
formats, and much more.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.350

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.790
below.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.580
Chrome 72 is now
available in beta.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.140
With it, creating public
class fields in JavaScript

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.960
is now much cleaner.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.660
You can see the page has been
activated with the new user

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.440
activation API, and localizing
lists becomes way easier

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
with the Intl format API.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.590
More info and example
code are on the post.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.120
Upgraded Places SDKs for Android
and iOS are now available.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.940
They're designed to make it much
easier for you to use and scale

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.160
with our rich Places data by
providing the same reliability,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.240
security, and customer support
as our other Google Maps

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.010
platform products.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.700

guides are in the post.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700

database is now
generally available.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.710
It's also now available
in 10 new locations

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.330
with a significant
price reduction

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.640
for regional instances
and integration

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.160
with Stackdriver for monitoring.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.360

the sunset of consumer
Google+ on April 2nd.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.440
All Google+ APIs
are shutting down,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.360
including Google+ sign-in
and requests for Google+

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.850
[INAUDIBLE] scopes.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.120
The wind-down process
has already begun,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.510
so you may notice intermittent
API failures leading up

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.000
to the March 7th deadline.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.100
Kubernetes Operator

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.220
helps you easily manage your
Spark applications natively

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.480
from Kubernetes.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.000
And it's now available in
beta from the GCP Marketplace

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.500
for Kubernetes.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.830

documentation are on the post.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.789

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.060
Yeah.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.316
You know, I don't have quite the
belly, but I'm working on it.
