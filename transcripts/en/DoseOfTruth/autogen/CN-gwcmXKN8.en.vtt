00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880
program and get yourself a plan and
start to implement it and every time you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
start to implement it and every time you
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.690
start to implement it and every time you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
fall astray then get back at it and you
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.890

know you may have to build up your

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
know you may have to build up your
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.230
know you may have to build up your
conscientiousness over a number of years

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
conscientiousness over a number of years
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.640
