00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.590
Now it's time to construct
and preprocess the corpus.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.980
So we'll start by loading the
tm package with library(tm).

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.600
And now that we'll
have done that,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.150
we'll construct a variable
called corpus using the corpus

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.000
and vector source functions
and passing in all the emails

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.630
in our data set,
which is emails$email.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.460
So now that we've
constructed the corpus,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.220
we can output the first
email in the corpus.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.290
We'll start out by calling
the strwrap function to get it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.660
on multiple lines, and then we
can select the first element

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.950
in the corpus using the
double square bracket notation

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.400
and selecting element 1.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.680
And we can see that
this is exactly

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.580
the same email that
we saw originally,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.990
the email about
the working paper.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.480
So now we're ready to preprocess
the corpus using the tm map

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.640
function.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.180
So first, we'll
convert the corpus

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.560
to lowercase using tm map
and the two lower function.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.510
So we'll have corpus =
tm_map(corpus, tolower).

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.340
And then we'll do the exact
same thing except removing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.840
punctuation, so we'll have
corpus = tm_map(corpus,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.630
removePunctuation).

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.050
We'll remove the stop words
with remove words function

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.759
and we'll pass along the stop
words of the English language

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.270
as the words we want to remove.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.120
And lastly, we're going
to stem the document.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.820
So corpus = tm_map(corpus,
stemDocument).

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.770
And now that we've gone through
those four preprocessing steps,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.690
we can take a second look at
the first email in the corpus.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.740
So again, call
strwrap(corpusstrwrap(corpus{[1]).

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.040
And now it looks
quite a bit different.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.900
We can come up to the top here.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.510
It's a lot harder to
read now that we removed

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.829
all the stop words and
punctuation and word stems,

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.490
but now the emails
in this corpus

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.490
are ready for our machine
learning algorithms.
