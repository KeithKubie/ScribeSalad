00:00:00.452 --> 00:00:02.588
- [Voiceover] We know that
if we had five people,

00:00:02.588 --> 00:00:05.456
let's say person A, person B, person C,

00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:08.474
person D, and person E,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.492
and we wanted to put
them in five different,

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:14.012
let's say, positions, or chairs,

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:16.879
so position one, position
two, position three,

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.177
position four, and position five.

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:23.020
If we wanted to count
the number of scenarios,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.319
or we could say the number of permutations

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.000
of putting these five
people in these five chairs,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.112
we could say, well, we
have five different ...

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:34.879
If we seated people in order,

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.214
which we might as well do,

00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:37.782
we could say, look, five different people

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:39.418
could sit in chair one.

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:41.055
So, for each of those scenarios,

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:44.236
four different people
could sit in chair two.

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:45.978
Now, for each of these scenarios, now,

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.638
so we have 20 scenarios.

00:00:47.638 --> 00:00:50.343
Five times four, we have 20 scenarios

00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:54.615
where we've seated seat one and seat two,

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:57.137
how many people could we
now seat in seat three

00:00:57.137 --> 00:00:59.354
for each of those 20 scenarios?

00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:01.351
Well, three people haven't sat down yet,

00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.336
so there's three possibilities there.

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:07.098
So now, there's five times
four times three scenarios

00:01:07.098 --> 00:01:08.978
for seating the first three people.

00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:11.555
How many people are left for seat four?

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.378
Well, two people haven't sat down yet,

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:15.119
so there's two possibilities.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.710
So now there's five times four times three

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.949
times two scenarios of
seating the first four seats.

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.050
For each of those, how many possibilities

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.838
are there for the fifth seat?

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:24.476
Well, one.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.717
For each of those scenarios,
we only have one person

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:29.793
who hasn't sat down left,
so there's one possibility.

00:01:29.793 --> 00:01:32.695
So the number of permutations,
the number of ...

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:33.613
Let me write this down.

00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:37.328
The number of permutations, permutations,

00:01:37.328 --> 00:01:40.790
of seating these five
people in five chairs

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.344
is five factorial.

00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:46.908
Five factorial, which is
equal to five times four

00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:50.704
times three times two times one,

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.357
which, of course, is equal to, let's see,

00:01:52.357 --> 00:01:55.943
20 times six, which is equal to 120.

00:01:55.943 --> 00:01:59.275
We have already covered
this in a previous video.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:02.340
But now let's do something
maybe more interesting,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.476
or maybe you might find
it less interesting.

00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:09.033
Let's say that we still
have these five people,

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:10.786
but we don't have as many chairs,

00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:13.084
so not everyone is going
to be able to sit down.

00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:15.348
Let's say that we only have three chairs.

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:17.786
We have chair one, we have chair two,

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:19.551
and we have chair three.

00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:22.592
How many ways can you have five people,

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:24.310
where only three of them
are going to sit down

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.611
in these three chairs, and we care

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.189
which chair they sit in?

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.383
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about it.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.798
I am assuming you have had your go at it.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:35.528
Let's use the same logic.

00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:39.667
If we seat them in order,
and we might as well,

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:40.967
how many different people,

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.569
if we haven't sat anyone yet,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.460
how many different people
could sit in seat one?

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.422
Well, we could have, if no one sat down,

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:48.583
we had five different people,

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:52.402
five different people
could sit in seat one.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:54.225
For each of these
scenarios where one person

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.165
has already sat in seat one,

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:58.365
how many people could sit in seat two?

00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:02.061
In each of these scenarios,
if one person has sat down,

00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:03.942
there's four people left
who haven't been seated,

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:06.879
so four people could sit in seat two.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.259
So we have five times four scenarios

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.439
where we've seated seats one and seat two.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.028
For each of those 20 scenarios,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.232
how many people could sit in seat three?

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.539
Well, we haven't sat,
we haven't seaten or sat

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.898
three of the people yet,

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.266
so for each of these
20, we could put three

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.718
different people in seat three,

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:33.362
so that gives us five times
four times three scenarios.

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:36.404
So this is equal to five times four

00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:40.119
times three scenarios, which is equal to,

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.046
this is equal to 60.

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:43.857
So there's 60 permutations

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:47.978
of sitting five people in three chairs.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:50.938
Now this, and my brain, whenever I start

00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:52.877
to think in terms of permutations,

00:03:52.877 --> 00:03:54.758
I actually think in these ways.

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:56.336
I just literally draw it out

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.577
because I don't like formulas.

00:03:58.577 --> 00:03:59.982
I like to actually conceptualize

00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:01.781
and visualize what I'm doing.

00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:03.580
But you might say, hey, when we just did

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.902
five different people in
five different chairs,

00:04:05.902 --> 00:04:07.818
and we cared which seat they sit in,

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:09.478
we had this five factorial.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.636
Factorial is kind of neat
little operation there.

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:17.335
How can I relate factorial
to what we did just now?

00:04:17.865 --> 00:04:19.561
It looks like we kind of did factorial,

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:20.891
but then we stopped.

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:24.555
We stopped at, we didn't
go times two times one.

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:27.817
So one way to think
about what we just did,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:31.334
is we just did five times four times three

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:33.854
times two times one, but of course

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:36.070
we actually didn't do the two times one,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.892
so you could take that and you

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:40.674
could divide by two times one.

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:42.427
If you did that, this two times one

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:43.890
would cancel with that two times one

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.456
and you'd be left with five
times four times three.

00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:47.814
The whole reason I'm writing this way

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.171
is that now I can write
it in terms of factorial.

00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.504
I could write this as five factorial,

00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:57.981
five factorial, over two factorial,

00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:00.812
over two factorial.

00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:01.719
But then you might have the question

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.403
where did this two come from?

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.005
I have three seats.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.944
Where did this two come from?

00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:07.686
Well, think about it.

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:10.311
I multiplied five times four times three,

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:12.527
I kept going until I had that many seats,

00:05:12.527 --> 00:05:14.547
and then I didn't do the remainder.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:17.849
So the things that I left out,

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.843
the things that I left out,

00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:21.641
that was essentially the number of people

00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:23.707
minus the number of chairs,

00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:26.543
so I was trying to put five
things in three places.

00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:30.024
Five minus three, that
gave me two left over.

00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:32.185
So I could write it like this.

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:34.038
I could write it as five ...

00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:36.004
Let me use the same colors.

00:05:36.004 --> 00:05:39.712
I could write it as five factorial

00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:42.021
over, over

00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:47.128
five minus three, which of course is two,

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:49.788
five minus three factorial.

00:05:50.223 --> 00:05:51.345
Another way of thinking about it,

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:53.574
if we wanted to generalize,

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:57.823
is if you're trying to figure
out the number of permutations

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:00.180
and there's a bunch of
notations for writing this,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.757
if you're trying to figure
out the number of permutations

00:06:02.757 --> 00:06:06.623
where you could put n people in r seats,

00:06:06.623 --> 00:06:09.200
or the number of permutations

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.998
you could put n people in r seats,

00:06:11.998 --> 00:06:13.647
and there's other notations as well,

00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:16.654
well, this is just going to be n factorial

00:06:17.106 --> 00:06:20.961
over n minus r factorial.

00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.884
Here n was five, r was three.

00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:27.926
Five minus three is two.

00:06:27.926 --> 00:06:31.166
Now, you'll see this in a
probability or a statistics class,

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:34.160
and people might memorize this thing.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.505
It seems like this kind of daunting thing.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:37.736
I'll just tell you right now,

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:39.442
the whole reason why I
just showed this to you

00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:40.604
is so that you could connect it

00:06:40.604 --> 00:06:41.916
with what you might see in your textbook,

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.122
or what you might see in a class,

00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:44.817
or when you see this type of formula,

00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:49.043
you see that it's not
some type of voodoo magic.

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:52.201
But I will tell that for me, personally,

00:06:52.201 --> 00:06:54.859
I never use this formula.

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:56.427
I always reason it through,

00:06:56.427 --> 00:06:58.040
because if you just memorize the formula,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.968
you're always going, wait,
does this formula apply there?

00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.466
What's n? What's r?

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:02.823
But if you reason it through,

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.287
it comes out of straight logic.

00:07:04.287 --> 00:07:05.564
You don't have to memorize anything.

00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:06.921
You don't feel like you're just memorizing

00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:08.107
without understanding.

00:07:08.107 --> 00:07:11.185
You're just using your
deductive reasoning, your logic.

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:14.107
That's especially valuable
because as we'll see,

00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:17.880
not every scenario's going fit
so cleanly into what we did.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.506
There might be some tweaks on this,

00:07:19.506 --> 00:07:21.317
where like maybe only person B

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.000
likes sitting in one of the chairs,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.999
or who knows what it might be?

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:25.844
Then your formula is going to be useless.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:27.887
So I like reasoning through it like this,

00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:29.257
but I just showed you this

00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:30.906
so that you could connect to it a formula

00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:33.760
that you might see in a
lecture or in a class.
