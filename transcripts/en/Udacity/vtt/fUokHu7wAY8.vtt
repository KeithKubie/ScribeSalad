00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.710
We've now had an overview of how
standards have evolved over the years,

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.120
in terms of their structure,
purpose, and technology.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.350
You should think about the difference
between simple classifications such as

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.440
NDC, CPT, and ICD, prior to version 10,
and a complex ontology such as snowman.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.440
The standards community
has been divided for

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.650
decades over the choice
between perfection,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.490
standards that can represent medicine
in all its detail, and practicality,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.630
standards that can actually be
deployed and used in the real world.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.480
We'll look at this more
specifically in lesson 6,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.090
when we review EMR design challenges.
