00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.555
This lesson is about sorting in
a distributed memory system.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.192
[SOUND] I know, I know.

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:10.960
&gt;&gt; Why we gotta sort all the time?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.512
&gt;&gt; Sorting is worse than
oatmeal cooked with water.

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:19.009
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorting is

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.706
the opposite of fun.

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:23.220
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'd rather jab myself in the eye with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.235
a hot poker than learn yet
another sorting algorithm.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.360
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Sorting gives me a rash.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.250
&gt;&gt; Sorting.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.740
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.090
Are you done whining?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240
Sorting is really important.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.250
Not because you're going to go through
life with people asking you to write

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.410
sorting algorithms all the time.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.160
It's partly because it's
a fundamental primitive.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.150
for example, every time a map reduce
computation executes somewhere,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.280
data is being sorted.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.450
But more importantly, you should pay
attention to the sorting lesson because

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.140
it's good practice, for learning how
to think about algorithms in general.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.200
And since it's a core part of CS101,
I think it's really helpful for

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.660
you to see how to sort in
different computing environments.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.840
For example, sorting sequentially,
versus sorting for

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.070
a vector parallel system, versus sorting
for a shared memory system versus,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.450
of course, distributed memory systems.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.250
So, please do your best and
stick with it.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.660
I think you'll be pleased to learn some
really neat ideas, especially when you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.320
compare them to the ideas about sorting
that you probably already know.
