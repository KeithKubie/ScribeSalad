00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.614
What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.614 --> 00:00:04.450
is introduce you to the
idea of a budget line.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.534
Actually, probably isn't a new idea.

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.902
It's a derivative idea of what you've seen

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:11.945
and often in an
introductory algebra course

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.875
where A, you've gotten a
certain amount of money

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.469
and you can spend it on a
certain combination of goods.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:17.990
What are all the different possibilities

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.395
that you can actually buy?

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.866
That's really what a budget line is.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.200
Let's say that you have an income

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.751
and I'll do it both in the abstract

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:25.834
and the concrete.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:27.065
I'll do it variables

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:29.330
and then I'll also do
it with actual numbers.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.603
Lets say your income, your
income in a month is Y

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:38.264
and lets say that you
spend all of your money.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:43.421
Your income is equal to your expenditures.

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:45.332
Assuming in our little model here

00:00:45.332 --> 00:00:47.268
that you're not going
to be saving any money.

00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:51.270
To show how overly simplified
we can make a model

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.094
we are going to only assume

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.100
that you can spend on two different goods

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.667
and that's so that we can actually plot

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.073
all the combinations on
a two dimensional surface

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:00.401
like the screen over here.

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.600
Obviously, most people buy many more

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
or they at least are
choosing between many,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.018
many more than two goods.

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:08.270
But let's say you can
choose between 2 goods

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.190
and let's just take goods
that we've been doing

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.552
using in recent videos.

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:16.727
That 2 goods that you buy are
either chocolate or fruit.

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:18.049
You could buy chocolate by the bar

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.596
or fruit by the pound.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:20.989
What are going to be your expenditures

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.889
assuming you spend it all
on chocolate and fruit?

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:26.311
Well, there's going to be the amount

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:27.262
that you spend on chocolate

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:28.604
will be the price of chocolate

00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:30.732
times the quantity of chocolate you buy

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:31.938
which is the number of bars.

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:34.464
And then the amount you spent on fruit

00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.357
will be the price of fruit per pound

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:40.026
times the quantity of fruit.

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:49.046
For example, if Y = $20 a month

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:52.583
and the price, actually
we'll plot this in a second,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:58.136
the price of chocolate
is equal to $1 per bar

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:04.258
and the price of fruit
is equal to $2 per pound.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:05.798
I think these were the prices I used

00:02:05.798 --> 00:02:07.802
in a per pound of fruit.

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:09.789
Then all of a sudden, you
would know what this is,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.528
you would know what this is and this is.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:13.949
You know what the Ps are and the Y

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.495
and then you could
actually graph one of these

00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:19.456
quantities relative to the other.

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:21.413
What we can do is, and let's do that,

00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:27.491
we can graph the quantity
of 1 relative to the other.

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:29.082
Why don't we put the quantity of chocolate

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:32.993
on this axis over here and
let's put the quantity of fruit

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:34.416
on this axis over here.

00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:37.782
First, if we wanted to
graph it I like to put it,

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:38.991
since I've put quantity of chocolate

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.327
on the vertical axis here,

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.923
I'd like to solve this equation
for quantity of chocolate

00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:45.456
as a function of quantity fruit

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.525
and it should make it pretty
straight forward to graph.

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:48.489
Let's try that out.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.743
First, I'm just going to rewrite this

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.659
without expenditures in between.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.598
We have our income,

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:57.741
our income Y = price of chocolate

00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.151
times the quantity of chocolate

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:05.993
plus the price of fruit
times the quantity of fruit.

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:09.522
Now, I want to solve for
the quantity of chocolate.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.592
Let me make that orange

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:13.986
so we know that this is
this one right over here.

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.884
If I want to solve for that,

00:03:15.884 --> 00:03:19.402
the best way I could isolate
it one side of this equation.

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:22.154
Let me get rid of this this
yellow part right over here

00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:23.330
and the best way to do that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.073
is to subtract it from both sides.

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:27.740
Let's subtract the price of fruit

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.397
times the quantity of fruit

00:03:29.397 --> 00:03:31.407
and I could substitute
the numbers in first

00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:32.926
and that might actually
make it a little bit

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:33.928
easier to understand

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:35.392
but I like to keep it general first.

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:38.260
You see, you don't have to
just use with these numbers

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.125
you could just see the
general result here.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.070
I'm going to subtract it
from the left hand side

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.659
and the right hand side

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.659
and the whole point is to get rid of it

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.317
from the right hand side.

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:49.568
This cancels out, the left hand side

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:54.406
becomes your income
minus the price of fruit

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.527
times the quantity of fruit.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:59.067
This is going to be equal
to your right hand side

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:00.565
which is just the price of chocolate

00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:02.329
times the quantity of chocolate.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.657
Now if we want to solve for
the quantity of chocolate

00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:09.585
we just divide both sides
by the price of chocolate

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:12.024
and then you get it,
and I'll flip the sides.

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:13.210
You get the quantity of chocolates,

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.395
is going to be equal to your income,

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:22.084
your income divided by
the price of chocolate

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:28.525
minus the price of fruit
times the quantity of fruit

00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:31.728
all of that over the price of chocolate.

00:04:31.728 --> 00:04:34.801
All over that over the price of chocolate.

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.882
We can actually substitute
these numbers in here

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:39.798
and then we can actually
plot what essentially

00:04:39.798 --> 00:04:42.046
this budget line will look like.

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:47.190
In our situation, 20, Y = 20,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.861
the price of chocolate is equal to 1.

00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:51.731
Price of chocolate is equal to 1.

00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.466
This term right over here,

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:57.395
$20 per month divided by $1 per bar

00:04:57.395 --> 00:05:00.133
which would actually give
you 20 bars per month

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.395
if you work out the units.

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:04.319
This term right over here
just simplifies to 20.

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.891
This is actually an interesting term,

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.058
your income, your income in
dollars divided by the price

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.794
of an actual good or service.

00:05:10.794 --> 00:05:12.731
You could view this term right over here

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:17.106
as your real income.

00:05:17.106 --> 00:05:18.394
The reason why it's called real income

00:05:18.394 --> 00:05:20.922
is it's actually pegging
what your earnings

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:22.590
to what you can buy.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.063
It's pegging it to a certain real goods,

00:05:24.063 --> 00:05:26.992
it's not tied to some
abstract quantity like money

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:29.332
which always has a changing buying power.

00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:32.130
What you could buy for $20
in 2010 is very different

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.968
than what you could buy for $20 in 1940.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:38.061
Here, when you divide your income,

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:40.599
divide it a by a price of some good

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.664
it's really telling you your
income in terms of that good.

00:05:43.664 --> 00:05:46.397
You could view your
income as $20 per month

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:47.885
or you could view your income

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:49.467
if you wanted your
income in chocolate bars.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:50.729
You could say my income is,

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.798
I could buy 20 chocolate bars each month.

00:05:53.798 --> 00:05:56.465
So I could say, my income
20 chocolate bars per month.

00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:57.588
They would be equivalent to you

00:05:57.588 --> 00:05:58.964
assuming that you could
sell the chocolate bars

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:00.192
for the same price you could buy it

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.190
and that's somewhat of an assumption.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.797
But you could say I have
the equivalent income

00:06:03.797 --> 00:06:05.197
of 20 bars a month.

00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:06.329
You could have also done it in fruit.

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:09.329
I have the equivalent
income of 20 divided by 2,

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:12.256
10 pounds of fruit a month.

00:06:12.256 --> 00:06:14.259
It's trying your income to real things,

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.862
not the abstract quantity like money.

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:18.591
Anyway, this is going to be equal to,

00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.134
let me write it over here.

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:22.585
My quantity of chocolate

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:27.533
is going to be equal to this
term right over here as 20.

00:06:27.533 --> 00:06:28.460
If you wanted to do the units,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.125
it would be 20 bars per month

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.126
and you could do a little
bit of dimensional analysis

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:33.288
to come up with that.

00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:34.663
You could treat the
units just like numbers

00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:36.129
and see how the cancel out.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:40.946
20 bars per month minus the price of fruit

00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:42.731
divided by the price of chocolate.

00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:45.202
$2 per pound of fruit.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.738
The price of fruit is going to be $2

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:50.427
and I actually want to look at the units

00:06:50.427 --> 00:06:52.063
because that's interesting.

00:06:53.954 --> 00:06:55.410
Let me write it here.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.536
The price of fruit is
equal to $2 per pound.

00:07:01.536 --> 00:07:03.495
Let me write it this way.

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:09.065
$2 per pound of fruit,

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:10.826
I'll show you how the units cancel out.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:13.833
Then we're dividing that
by the price of chocolate.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.198
Dividing it by the price of chocolate

00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:23.268
which is equal to $1 per bar of chocolate.

00:07:23.268 --> 00:07:24.995
Now, obviously the math is
fairly straight forward.

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:27.999
We just get 2, but the units
are a little bit interesting.

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.746
You have a dollar and the
numerator of the numerator

00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:32.330
and a dollar, the numerator
of the denominator,

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.729
those will cancel out.

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:35.202
You could actually view this as,

00:07:35.202 --> 00:07:36.673
this is going to be the same thing

00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:37.934
just to look at the units.

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:39.129
This is going to be,

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:42.933
this is the same thing as the
numerator times the inverse

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:47.084
times the reciprocal of the
denominator right over here.

00:07:47.084 --> 00:07:52.499
You could say $2 per pound times,

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.201
the reciprocal of 1 is just 1,

00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:59.501
times 1 bar per dollar.

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:01.411
Then the dollars cancel out

00:08:01.411 --> 00:08:11.227
and you are left with 2
bars per pound of fruit.

00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:12.882
What we've actually done over here,

00:08:12.882 --> 00:08:14.401
this term right over here,

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:18.262
it gives us bars of
chocolate per pound of fruit.

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:21.864
It simplifies to 2 bars of
chocolate per pound of fruit.

00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:24.141
It's actually giving
you the opportunity cost

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:25.724
of a pound of fruit.

00:08:25.724 --> 00:08:27.468
It's saying hey, you
could buy a pound of fruit

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:29.998
but you'd be giving up
2 bars of chocolate.

00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:32.807
Because the price, you could
get 2 bars of chocolate

00:08:32.807 --> 00:08:34.600
for every pound of fruit.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.788
You could view this as the relative price,

00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:44.468
this right over here is the relative price

00:08:44.468 --> 00:08:46.330
of fruit in this example.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.459
It's telling you the opportunity cost,

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.323
it's telling you how much fruit cost

00:08:49.323 --> 00:08:51.453
in terms of chocolate bars.

00:08:51.453 --> 00:08:53.388
Regardless, that number is
fairly straight forward,

00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:55.129
it was just a 2.

00:08:55.129 --> 00:09:01.796
Minus 2 times the quantity of fruit.

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:03.903
This is fairly straight forward to plot.

00:09:03.903 --> 00:09:06.659
If the quantity of fruit it 0,

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:09.925
our quantity of chocolate is 20.

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:11.928
This is going to be 20 over here.

00:09:11.928 --> 00:09:14.720
This is 20 and this is going to be 10.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.056
This is 15, this is 5.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.529
This is a point on our
budget line right over there.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:22.805
There is multiple ways that
you could think about this.

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:26.997
One way you could say is
if you buy no chocolate,

00:09:26.997 --> 00:09:28.466
if the quantity of chocolate is 0,

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:30.800
what is going to be the quantity of fruit?

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.058
Then you could solve this
or you could just say,

00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:34.059
"Look, if I have $20 a month

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:35.328
"then I'm going to spend it all on fruit.

00:09:35.328 --> 00:09:36.789
"I can buy 10 pounds of fruit."

00:09:36.789 --> 00:09:40.661
So to say that this right over here is 10.

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:43.928
Let's say this right over
here is 10, this is 5,

00:09:43.928 --> 00:09:46.156
so this is also on our budget line

00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:48.132
and every point in between

00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:50.220
is going to be on our budget line.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.599
Every point in between is
going to be on our budget line.

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:54.800
Another way you could have done this

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.925
and this comes straight
out of kind of your typical

00:09:56.925 --> 00:09:57.878
algebra 1 course.

00:09:57.878 --> 00:10:01.739
You could say, in this case,

00:10:01.739 --> 00:10:02.638
if you view this as the Y axis,

00:10:02.638 --> 00:10:03.889
you say your Y interceptor,

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:06.303
you say, "My chocolate
quantity interceptor is 20

00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:09.322
"and then my slop is negative 2.

00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:10.553
"My slope is negative 2."

00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:13.471
For every extra pound of fruit I buy

00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:18.136
I have to give up 2 pounds of chocolate.

00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:20.803
You could also view this as
the opportunity cost of fruit.

00:10:20.803 --> 00:10:23.721
You see this slope as we go forward,

00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.053
if we buy one more pound quantity of fruit

00:10:26.053 --> 00:10:31.384
we're giving up 2 bars of chocolate.

00:10:31.384 --> 00:10:32.599
One statement I did just make,

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:36.968
I said every point on
this line is a possibility

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:38.971
and I can only say that if we assume

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.257
that both of these goods
are divisible goods

00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:45.386
which means we can buy
arbitrarily small amounts of it,

00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:47.322
that we could buy 10th
of a bar of chocolate

00:10:47.322 --> 00:10:49.320
on average especially.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.066
Or we could buy 100th of a pound of fruit.

00:10:52.066 --> 00:10:54.468
If they weren't divisible,
they're indivisible

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.990
then only the whole quantities

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.218
would be the possibility points.

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:00.655
We'll just assume they're divisible,

00:11:00.655 --> 00:11:02.990
especially even if the store only sells

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.519
indivisible bars of chocolate.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.261
If you buy one bar of
chocolate every 4 months,

00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:11.634
on average you're buying .25
bars of chocolate per month.

00:11:11.634 --> 00:11:14.142
Even that, on average, almost anything,

00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:16.721
almost anything here is divisible.

00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:18.976
This line right over here shows

00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:21.189
all of the combinations we can buy.

00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:22.471
All of the combinations

00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:24.325
of the divisible goods we could buy

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:26.136
if we spend all of our money.

00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:29.120
That right over there is our budget line.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.325
That is our budget line.

00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:36.886
That is our budget line.

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:42.278
And any combination out
here is unaffordable.

00:11:42.278 --> 00:11:44.340
We don't have enough money for that.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.019
Any combination down here is affordable.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.675
Actually, we would end up with extra money

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.464
if we're below the budget line.

00:11:50.464 --> 00:11:52.471
This isn't all that
different than what we saw

00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:54.248
with the production
possibilities frontier.

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.649
Remember, we had a curve
that really showed all of the

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.047
if we were producing 2 goods,

00:11:58.047 --> 00:12:00.223
what combinations of
goods we could produce.

00:12:00.223 --> 00:12:01.385
Anything on that curve

00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:03.984
for the productions possibility
frontier was efficient.

00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:06.385
Anything outside of it was unattainable

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:09.947
and anything inside was
attainable but inefficient.
