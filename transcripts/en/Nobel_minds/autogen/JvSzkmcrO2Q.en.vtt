in Basel and it was conjectured many

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
in Basel and it was conjectured many
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.620
in Basel and it was conjectured many
years ago by theoreticians and then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
years ago by theoreticians and then
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.800
years ago by theoreticians and then
around 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 I think

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
around 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 I think
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.899
around 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 I think
these coalesce and into cages and these

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
these coalesce and into cages and these
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910
these coalesce and into cages and these
cages may we're pretty sure we've got

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
cages may we're pretty sure we've got
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.570

to the mad lab we're shown that there

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140
to the mad lab we're shown that there
 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.280
to the mad lab we're shown that there
are definitely species with 28 carbon

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
are definitely species with 28 carbon
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.800
are definitely species with 28 carbon
atoms which are cages there's the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810
atoms which are cages there's the
 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.809

circumstantial but nevertheless pretty

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819
circumstantial but nevertheless pretty
 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.979
circumstantial but nevertheless pretty
definitely cage structures so at that

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989
definitely cage structures so at that
 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.530
definitely cage structures so at that
point have you've got these little

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540
point have you've got these little
 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.879
point have you've got these little
balloons if you wish I think what

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889
balloons if you wish I think what
 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.729
balloons if you wish I think what
happens then is carbon atoms and carbon

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739
happens then is carbon atoms and carbon
 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.030
happens then is carbon atoms and carbon
molecules coalesce into this and are

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
molecules coalesce into this and are
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.240
molecules coalesce into this and are
sort of ingested into this network

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
sort of ingested into this network
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.659
sort of ingested into this network
through a neck network in to see for

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669
through a neck network in to see for
 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.119
through a neck network in to see for
4050 and so on and when they hit c60

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129
4050 and so on and when they hit c60
 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.440
4050 and so on and when they hit c60
they hit the first stable structure the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450
they hit the first stable structure the
 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.509
they hit the first stable structure the
see 60s the first state will full ring

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519
see 60s the first state will full ring
 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.610
see 60s the first state will full ring
and then that point is a cul-de-sac and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620
and then that point is a cul-de-sac and
 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.709
and then that point is a cul-de-sac and
so a lot get locked into that some go

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719
so a lot get locked into that some go
 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.039
so a lot get locked into that some go
shooting on 270 and others too high ones

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049
shooting on 270 and others too high ones
 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.869
shooting on 270 and others too high ones
and we get something like carbon plasma

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879
and we get something like carbon plasma
 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.420
and we get something like carbon plasma
as you get the issue and you extract

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430
as you get the issue and you extract
 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.780
as you get the issue and you extract
them ten percent of the cert which large

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790
them ten percent of the cert which large
 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.240
them ten percent of the cert which large
particles are in the form of fluorines

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
particles are in the form of fluorines
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.330
particles are in the form of fluorines
and sort of like minus 80 to 90 percent

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
and sort of like minus 80 to 90 percent
 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.069
and sort of like minus 80 to 90 percent
of c 60 about 10 percent c 70 and a few

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079
of c 60 about 10 percent c 70 and a few
 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.949
of c 60 about 10 percent c 70 and a few
percent and now all the others with more

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959
percent and now all the others with more
 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.809
percent and now all the others with more
and more carbon atoms then of course now

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819
and more carbon atoms then of course now
 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.069
and more carbon atoms then of course now
achieves and many other things so

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079
achieves and many other things so
 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.050
achieves and many other things so
basically i think that you have this

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
basically i think that you have this
 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.530
basically i think that you have this
cage forming for other smaller levels

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
cage forming for other smaller levels
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.559
cage forming for other smaller levels
and then others being ingested into this

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569
and then others being ingested into this
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.009
and then others being ingested into this
structure and they stop when they get to

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019
structure and they stop when they get to
 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.059
structure and they stop when they get to
see 60 and that's why 660 is strong so

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
see 60 and that's why 660 is strong so
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.860
see 60 and that's why 660 is strong so
hand waving and i think that's about as

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
hand waving and i think that's about as
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.839
hand waving and i think that's about as
far as i'm prepared to go it's just very

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849
far as i'm prepared to go it's just very
 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.539
far as i'm prepared to go it's just very
very complicated and people have been

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549
very complicated and people have been
 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.699
very complicated and people have been
looking at combustion process for 50

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709
looking at combustion process for 50
 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.110
looking at combustion process for 50
years and fearing theorizing and doing

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120
years and fearing theorizing and doing
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.039
years and fearing theorizing and doing
experiments and they miss C 60 so I'll

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049
experiments and they miss C 60 so I'll
 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.369
experiments and they miss C 60 so I'll
sure they got it right but I don't know

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379
sure they got it right but I don't know
 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.099
sure they got it right but I don't know
it's it's very complicated and I think

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109
it's it's very complicated and I think
 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.770
it's it's very complicated and I think
the best theory is my rule of theory

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780
the best theory is my rule of theory
 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.860
the best theory is my rule of theory
where it all comes together best I can

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870
where it all comes together best I can
 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.139
where it all comes together best I can
do
