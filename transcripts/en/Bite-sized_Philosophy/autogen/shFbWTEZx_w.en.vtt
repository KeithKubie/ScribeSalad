00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.340
 There is an idea in Christianity that we have just discussed, 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.340
 that the judge and the savior are the same person. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.780
 Well, you know that in the book of Revelation, you know this or you don't know, 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.640
 Christ comes back as a judge and he has a sword coming 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.280
 it's a revealing vision, that book, it's very strange. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.620
 It is the last thing you would expect conservative Christians to believe. 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.080
 And believe me, it's such a visionary hallucination, the book of Revelation. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.000
 But Christ returns with a sword that comes out of his mouth and he returns as a judge. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 He divides the cursed from the saved. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.140
 And most are cursed, some are redeemed. It is very very coarse. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.180
 Jung believed that the figure of Christ in the gospels was too pleasant, too merciful, 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.720
 turned too much to grace, and that referred to an opposing force. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.880
 And that was the opposing force of judgment. A very interesting hypothesis. 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.500
 But then there is the merging of the two ideas, 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 That the judge and the savior are the same person. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.980
 Okay 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.840
 A young man told me that his life was short 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 purpose and focus and meaning and that he was nihilistic. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 Before he started - he had read the "zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance", 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060
 what a book I actually really like. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.560
 I have read it three times in three different decades of my life. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 And one of the things that is very interesting about the book is that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 it is an investigation of the idea of â€‹â€‹quality, the idea that there is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 are qualitative differences between things and that we have the instinct to create qualitative differences. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.160
 And so a qualitative difference is simply "This is better than that", 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.920
 that's a judgment. 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.760
 Okay, well what Ratzinger suggested is that the person 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.500
 You know what the modern idea is that you simply have to accept yourself. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.840
 -I think that is a bad idea.- 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.940
 Really, I can't come up with a more nihilistic idea with "You're all right!" 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.600
 Because, no, you are not! 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.418
 And the reason that you are not 'ok' is that you can be so much more than you are! 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.680
 So what do you want to be? 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.920
 Do you want to stay the way you are or do you want to work towards a better version of yourself? 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.740
 And this young man, an Australian, he said reason that "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.040
 such an impact on him was because he was not happy with his current state of well-being. 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.180
 And he didn't think the way he expressed himself was right. 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 And the fact that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.560
 the author of "Zen", that was Pirsig, had made the remark that you could make qualitative differences. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.320
 And that there really is a difference between good things, bad things, good things and bad things. 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.640
 It gives you a direction. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.360
 It gives you the opportunity to move up. 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 And Ratzinger noted that at least a certain amount 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.440
 People are not satisfied with themselves and they have to move up. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.360
 And so they must conceptualize something of the highest form of "good," and then they must strive for it. 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.240
 And the thing is that there is no difference between conceptualizing the good and being judged, 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.580
 because if you start conceptualizing the good and strive for it, 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.460
 what you have to do is separate yourself from all the things that are not good and you must leave them behind. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.240
 And that is why the savior and the judge are the same thing. 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.700
 And one of the two is very attractive. 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.220
 I think about the modern world that we reject the existence of qualitative differences. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.240
 You say, "Well, we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying that one is better than the other." 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.860
 And okay, that's reasonable, it's not nice to be cast off with the cursed ones, that's guaranteed. 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.160
 But if people are not satisfied with their current state, 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.120
 whatever appears to be the case, try to find someone who is not. 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.360
 And if you deny that the chance of qualitative differences because you promote radical egalitarianism, 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.980
 then you also promote the chance of redemption because there is no pursuit of the good. 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.140
 And it seems to me that it is catastrophic to sacrifice good for 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.600
 Well, it is catastrophic to sacrifice the good for the same. 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.700
 Because if we were all equal, 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.400
 then we would all be just as free and miserable. 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.060
 And thus.. 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.440
 *applause*
