00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
So, let's say we created lots of right triangles. What if I made another

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.584
triangle here and another triangle here and another one here? And we could keep

00:00:10.584 --> 00:00:15.606
going and make another right triangle here and another one right here. Now, the

00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:20.026
points along the outer edge represent the end of the string when making any one

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:26.358
right triangle. What shape would all these points, that represent the position

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.730
of the end of the string, make?
