00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.380
You know what's weird?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.700
- Now the NSA can't see what I'm doing.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.660
- I don't really think the NSA cares about whatever it is you're doing.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.200
I'm pretty sure they have more pressing concerns.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.160
[phone rings]

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.960
Oh, I have to take this. Hello?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.260
- Ms. Akana, this is the National Security Agency.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.100
[dramatic music]

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.340
Oh, hey Wendy, what's up?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.060
So your ex called his best friend yesterday and I have so. Much. Tea.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.140
Tell me everything. 
- I'm brewing a pot now.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.160
Which means that I'm emailing you the transcript.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.340
- You're the best. 
- Anything for you boss.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.160
Oh, can you also tell your friend to hide the one on her phone?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.080
She does some really weird stuff when she's alone, and we don't have the ability to turn off the cameras.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.240
I was having a conversation about self-worth with a friend the other day when she said,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.280
"Yeah, if my career disappeared tomorrow

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.540
I'd be a hundred percent okay."

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.600
And I was like, [record scratch]

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.260
"Wow. Yeah, uh. Definitely-- I would not feel that way at all."

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.709
One of my resolutions for this year,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.260
and for the rest of my life really,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.540
is to not tie my self-worth to my productivity.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.240
And it's not that I don't want to be productive

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.559
But I also don't want to feel like a terrible human being when I'm not producing professional results.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.699
But that has made me wonder. How do you even define self-worth, right?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.400
Because obviously the ideal is having your own internal measure of success that is based on an unshakable

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.240
faith in your worth that no external factors could possibly affect it.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.790
But really how do you implement that in your life?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.280
Because I usually value myself based on my positive contributions to the world:

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.020
how helpful I am to humans and animals, and the strength of my support system.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.280
But if all of that fell away,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.660
would I still feel like I am worthy?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.720
No, absolutely not.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm a potato.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.320
And I have to really think and ask myself this question like,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.640
What would I need to feel totally okay if everything was taken away from me?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.880
And after a lot of thinking I came to the conclusion that I would need to feel that, at my core,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.860
I am enough.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.560
Just me as is.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.150
No fancy career, no loving friends, no passions, no art, no multi-cat family --

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.499
If I had none of that to feel like I'm enough, I would need full self-acceptance and compassion and self-love.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.480
But it's like, how do you even achieve that?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.580
And that's an even more difficult question.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.700
And I realized, after a lot of internet, and hunting, and book reading, and article reading

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.960
that it comes down to taking total responsibility for your life, your circumstances, and your problems.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.340
And it means acknowledging that we have the personal power to shape our reality in the image that we want,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.420
to stay true to our values,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.460
to live in authenticity as much as we can, and to forgive ourselves for our flaws while simultaneously

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.380
striving to live wholeheartedly and be our best.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.820
It means having your inner world be so solid

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.340
that the outside chaos can't even sway your belief in yourself and your inherent value.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.300
[deep inhale] No big deal. You just do that.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.620
And obviously like I'm not there, or I would be Buddha

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.280
But it has been a very interesting phase in my life

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.700
Where I'm consciously thinking about how I want to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.240
shape my belief system to serve me as I move into my 30s.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.380
And the tangible steps that I am taking to reach a level of self-worth that is

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.480
[chuckles] much higher than my own,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.560
is to cultivate habits outside of achievement, because I am such an achievement ho.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.360
So I'm trying to do activities that are purely for fun.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.420
And welcoming stillness and relaxation as necessary instead of a giant waste of time.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.760
Dealing with my issues instead of avoiding it through

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.740
scrolling through social media endlessly, or binging TV or alcohol.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.320
And really connecting to my values. And even defining what those are and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.540
what they look like and how I implement them.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.040
Self work to self-worth is really hard,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
and what I find most annoying about personal growth is that it never ends.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.299
I mean once you feel like you have a good handle on your stuff, you're like, oh wait

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.360
There's another room in this house full of stuff I didn't even know existed.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.640
But I also know that growing is a... big part of being a happy human.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.240
So.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.580
What about you? I mean, what do you think it would take for you to feel worthy

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.120
if every external factor in your life fell away?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.800
And how are you gonna get there?

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.420
