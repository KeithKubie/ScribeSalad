00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.200
One, two, three, go.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.760
These soap powered boats are great fun to race,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.580
and a brilliant way of getting your kids to think scientifically whilst playing.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040
Okay Alby we're going to do a little test,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.740
and it's a test of how much superhero power you have inside yourself.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.280
Pick a finger, a pointing finger. Alright.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.710
Now, you've got to summon up all your superhero powers into that finger.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.960
Okay, and place it right in the middle
that water.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960
Get ready, get ready.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.000
Summon it up, summon it up. All the superhero power right in the middle of the water.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.910
Nothing's really happened has it?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.809
Right, shall I have a go?

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.589
I'll summon up, summon up, summon up all my superhero power. 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.329
Keep looking at the oregano, keep looking at the oregano.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.600
What?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.320
The oregano was so scared of my superhero powers,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.920
that it ran to the edges of the plate.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.810
Why is there green?

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.470
What's that green? 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.640
That is the washing up liquid that I secretly had on my finger.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550
Now why is that happening?

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.070
Imagine, if you would, a balloon.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.660
You've got that very thin skin of rubber all round the outside of the balloon.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.140
You've got air all squeezed together on the inside of the balloon.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.640
It's basically pushing the skin of the balloon tight.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.660
Well if you take a pin,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.980
then what you've done is you've weakened the skin of the balloon.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.400
Essentially, all of those rubbery molecules that make up the balloon

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.590
are holding on to each other really tight.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.360
And then you give it one little tear and the whole thing rips apart.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.640
The surface of our water has this thing: surface tension.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.440
When we have that surface tension, all those water molecules are holding onto each other really tightly;

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.480
but what washing up liquid does is it
breaks that surface tension.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.820
So if you break the surface tension in
the middle of that water

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.860
the other molecules all pull away from
where the surface tension is broken,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.800
and when they pull away they drag the oregano with it.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.800
Can we use that important scientific discovery to have fun?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.600
Yes we can!

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.640
Alby. 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.140
Yes?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.120
I thought we could try it with a few different things,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.150
and see which one is the best.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.060
Okay!

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.040
So we've got ten things here in a little ice cube tray.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.580
What one would you like to try first?

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.180
Hand sanitizer.  

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.660
What do you think might happen?

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.220
I think they'll just go to the side again maybe.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.540
The molecules will pull the oregano out to the side.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.940
You're right!

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.920
It's not the best because last time it was like really squished.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.480
Okay, so why don't we write this down?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.920
Now, the truth is, it doesn't matter if you understand all the real high brow science to this.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.800
But it doesn't really matter if you can explain it to your kids either.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.180
The important thing about this is that
what we are gonna be doing is testing.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.400
Taking an idea, trying lots of different versions of it, seeing what works best.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.360
That, my friends, is the scientific method.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.560
It's the underpinning of everything that's brought us

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.200
shoes, cars, penicillin.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.950
it's about having a way of thinking
about the world that allows you not to be

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.300
taken for a ride.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.320
Frankly, what better thing is there to give your kids than that?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.460
Woah!

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.920
Wow!

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.620
So what thing is best at breaking surface tension?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.580
Washing up liquid.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.560
Definite? Definite.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.220
Should we put that to the test? Put it to the test!

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.420
So, Alby.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.200
What I've done, is I've gone to the RI website, and I've downloaded templates to make these little boats.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.620
Alright? Alright.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.360
So what we're gonna do, is you're gonna have a boat on this side and I'm gonna have a boat on that side.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.540
We're gonna take some of this stuff we've already experimented with

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.280
and use it as our fuel.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.780
Righty ho!

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.380
Alright, ready? Yep.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.390
You're going to use washing up liquid, I'm going to use hand soap,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.390
which, you scored nine out of ten.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.160
One, two, three, go.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.780
Yeah, yours absolutely cruised up that end!

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.840
Look, I'm gonna have to help mine along.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520
So washing up liquid was the winner? Yes.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.100
Alby was the winner? Yes!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.180
But Alby, was science the real winner? Yes.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.440
Nice!

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.640
If you would like to try this experiment in your house

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640
with your own actual child.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.550
Then, why not go to the RI website?

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.880
All of the bits and pieces you'll need, some of the science explanation, that's all there.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.640
Alternatively, Alby, people could subscribe to this channel.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.919
Mind blown, right, mind blown.
