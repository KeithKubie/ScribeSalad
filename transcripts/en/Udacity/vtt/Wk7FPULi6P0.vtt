00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.614
These two lines are parallel. We can solve each equation for y, so we can

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:09.884
compare the two equations. Let's solve this one for y. I can subtract negative 2

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:14.782
x from each side of the equation, and I get negative 3 y is equal to negative 2

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:19.434
x plus 6. Then, I divide each side of my equation by negative 3 to get y is

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:24.092
equal to two-thirds x minus 2. These two equations are in different forms, but

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:28.407
represent the same equation. I can see that my original two equations have the

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:32.907
same slope, and different y-intercepts. This must mean that they're parrallel.
