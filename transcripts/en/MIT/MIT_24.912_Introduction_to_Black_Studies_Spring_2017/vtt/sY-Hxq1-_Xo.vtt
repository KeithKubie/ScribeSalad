MICHEL DEGRAFF: So why the
personal in this course?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.583
Well, at every occasion
when the students present

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.166
their discussions--
because they often

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.707
have a friendly discussion-- or
when they write their essays,

00:00:17.707 --> 00:00:21.960
I do ask them to include
some personal information

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.980
in what they write.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.300
In fact, one essay was
strictly about that,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.900
about their linguistic
biographies.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.180
Because I feel
that often students

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.790
can be overly ambitious.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.610
Of course, there's this
earnestness that we appreciate,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.760
but often they want to
go after global changes

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.009
like changing the
environment or changing

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.050
the outcome of elections.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.450
But those are the kind of
changes that you often cannot

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
make, especially not in
a one semester course.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.330
But if they are able
to understand the way

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.470
those global patterns affect
their own personal lives

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.680
in their own small
social groupings,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.320
and if they can actually try
to integrate what they learn

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.105
in the course to actions
in these localized spheres,

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.230
then there's a better chance
that they can actually

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.260
make those changes.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.180
So I like to tell them
that the change that they

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.130
can make in themselves
resolving those issues

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.050
are also affecting
the wider world.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.540
Because if each person
can affect themselves

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.850
in their small
groups and, in turn,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.090
if everyone in that small
group can also affect changes

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.510
in their own small groups,
then the effect is exponential.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.490
You see?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.920
And I think by the end of
the course they do appreciate

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.530
being able to share their
personal experiences

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.720
through essays, through
their presentations.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.060
And also they can see
the effect that this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.980
has on their own
classmates, because some

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.590
of their classmates come from
very different backgrounds.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.640
So they get to understand
how someone, say,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.940
from Guatemala
who came to the US

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.240
with parents that
emigrated without papers

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.551
and how that life
experience can be inspiring,

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.550
because if you can make
it to MIT with that kind

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.680
of background and then
you can actually share it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.971
with others while you are
actually succeeding as an MIT

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:05.150
student, that can be life
changing for some of us.
