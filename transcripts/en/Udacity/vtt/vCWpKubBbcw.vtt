00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.510
Now, we know how to measure and compare

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.530
performance. And we also know that overall performance improvement

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.090
requires a careful balance between improving one aspect of

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.750
the design and not messing up on the other

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.520
aspects of that design. We're ready now to

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.320
look at more advanced techniques for improving performance and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.910
efficiency. And we will look first at pipelining, one

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.500
of the most important and generally applicable techniques in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.840
a computer architects bag of tricks.
