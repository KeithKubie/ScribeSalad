00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.290
Jocko as a leader, at what point am I allowed to go to others and say,

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.030
I need you because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing toward forward on my

3
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:10.600
own,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.140
or should that be an instance where I need to take a step back and apply more

5
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.490
discipline to my life and find a way to push forward by myself? Okay.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.740
<v 1>You are allowed to say that to your team member immediately that you need them.</v>

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.930
Absolutely. If you,

8
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.790
of course you need your team because if he didn't need your team,

9
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.450
why would they be there? If you can do everything yourself,

10
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:35.200
then you don't have a team, right? You just do everything yourself.

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.190
So while you of course should be working harder,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.450
you should be applying discipline as a leader.

13
00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:45.451
It's your job to actually lead things and to let other people support and make

14
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:47.930
things happen. And there's nothing wrong with that.

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.250
And also you don't want to be stuck in the weeds doing minute things. So

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.223
<v 2>it,</v>

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.170
<v 1>if you're not capable, I think what might be holding this individual back,</v>

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.280
there's two things.

19
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.550
Number one is I feel like I should take extreme ownership of everything.

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.130
I feel like I should just do everything myself.

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.870
That is not what extreme ownership is.

22
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.880
Extreme ownership isn't doing everything yourself.

23
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.810
And also what can come into play is your ego because you don't want to ask

24
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:17.600
people for help and that's not a good sign.

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.650
There's nothing wrong with asking people for help if you need it. In fact,

26
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.420
that's the humble thing to do. Hey, echo,

27
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.210
I don't know how to quite finish out this. Uh, you know,

28
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.670
this thing of this project and working out. Can you give me a hand with this?

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240
I don't know how to work a video recorder. Can you show me how to do that?

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.710
Right? Whatever. Um, so, so there's no problem with that. You're allowed to ask.

31
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.540
You can, you can say that immediately. In fact,

32
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.690
your team should feel that you are counting on them and relying on them.

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.820
They should know that. And then put your ego aside, ask for help.

34
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.980
No problem. That doesn't mean you're giving away.

35
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.660
That doesn't mean you're not taking ownership.

36
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:52.220
That doesn't mean you're not applying discipline.

37
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.250
It means you're working as a team together to accomplish mission. Again,

38
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.340
if a t if a mission is so easily that you can accomplish it yourself,

39
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.630
you don't need a team, why do you have them?

40
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.810
If you can do it all yourself just by applying discipline. Cool.

41
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.000
You don't need anyone else if you're your,

42
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.390
but your mission should be larger than one human being could accomplish.

43
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.930
So that's why you have other people on board to help you out. Yeah, no problem.

44
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.900
<v 0>You know, like I always think when, when that happened,</v>

45
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.380
we made it out of that question. Go ahead. No, but you know,

46
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:24.381
like let's say it's like something that's just a pain in the ass and you don't

47
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:29.010
really need help, but you just don't want to do it by yourself. Oh, okay.

48
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.370
What I'm saying then? Yeah, then you got to do that by yourself. Oh yeah.

49
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.240
So that's kind of where this is coming from ultimately, because it's like,

50
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:38.430
I'm not saying that if you're the,

51
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.700
<v 1>if you're,</v>

52
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700
if you have a position in a company where you shouldn't be doing some sort of

53
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:50.161
task because it's not financially efficient to have,

54
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.671
you know,

55
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:56.671
a person that's making $150,000 a year doing a task that someone that's making

56
00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:01.780
$10 hour should it be doing [inaudible] so, so you shouldn't do that.

57
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.230
That's not what I'm advocating. And the company won't, won't be doing well.

58
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.830
Yeah.

59
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.300
If you're paying people $150,000 a year that you could get someone to do for $10

60
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.840
an hour. I'm not saying that, so don't get me wrong. Yeah.

61
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.720
But that's why we have a team so that you can focus on going forward and

62
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.650
whatever it is you need to be focused on and somebody that's below you in the

63
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.311
chain of command,

64
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.190
that's a member of your team that's getting paid $10 an hour can do some of the

65
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.120
stuff that you need them to do.

66
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.330
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And the question actually is,</v>

67
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.960
is really clear because it's because quote unquote,

68
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.340
because I recognize I'm not capable of pushing you. You know, it's kind of like,

69
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.780
ah, it's obvious to you that you need help. It's not that you're, you know,

70
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.550
raking leaves and I don't want to do this all by myself, so hey, you know,

71
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.200
you tell your brother, come help me. It's not that it's different.

72
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.020
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.310
And if you need to get the leaves raked and you need them done by Monday so you

74
00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:02.480
can get them in the bags so that the dump truck can come and take the leaves

75
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:06.770
away and you can't physically get it done, then you say to your brother, Hey,

76
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.581
can you give me a hand?

77
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.650
I need to get these done tonight before the sun goes down.

78
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.250
I'm not gonna be able to make it in time. Can you give me a hand? Yeah.

79
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.670
Your brother says, absolutely. Got Your back.
