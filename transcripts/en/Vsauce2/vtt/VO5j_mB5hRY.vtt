Artist Zheng Chunhui made this world record
longest continuous wooden sculpture. It's

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.310
a replica of the famous painting Along the
River During The Qingming Festival and it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.660
took four years to create and is about 12
meters long, 3 meters tall, and 2.4 meters

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.140

an art show.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.530

the rooms can be anywhere from 1 to 4 hours.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.060

Life and turns them into something new by

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.840

amazing hyper realistic large scale mixed

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:45.729

his father, mother, grandfathers, and&nbsp;grandmothers.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.579
Each one took over 70 hours to create and
he used water-based colored pencils, dry pastel,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.579
and tattoo color.
