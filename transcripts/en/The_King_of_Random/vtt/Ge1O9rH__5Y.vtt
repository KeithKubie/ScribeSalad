Most people probably wouldn't consider butter
a flammable substance, and it's not really.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.740
But it could be. In this project, we're making
emergency candles that will burn for hours,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
from a piece of toilet paper, and a stick
of butter.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.780
For this project I got into my wife's baking
supplies and found this 4oz stick of butter.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.230
The butter can be placed on top of a few squares
of toilet paper and now it's ready to cut

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.630
in half. You can use a sharp knife to cut
cleanly through the paper, and holding it

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.170
with the folds at the top will help prevent
the paper from binding and ripping as you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.690
push down through the block. Alright, we've
got our two halves, now let's make the wick.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.540
Take one square of toilet paper and some scissors,
and cut it into quarters so you end up with

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.920
a little square like this. Now this can be
folded down diagonally and twisted tightly

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.360
to give it support. I've folded this one at
the bottom for two reasons, height and convenience.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.120
When it gets placed into the butter, there
will only be 1/4" of the wick sticking up

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.749
at the top and that's about all we want. Using
something like a toothpick or a skewer, poke

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.490
a hole in the center of the butter all the
way to the bottom. Now set your wick over

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.119
the hole, and use the skewer to push it down
into place. A little twist should release

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.399
it, and it looks like it's set. Now, we'll
need to add a little starter fuel to the wick,

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.679
and that's done by rubbing it around in the
butter until it's got a nice coating. At this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.079
point your candle is ready to go. When you
strike your match, hold it near the base of

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.539
the wick so that it helps heat the butter.
If your butter was frozen like mine, it might

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.719
take a few seconds before the flame is fully
self sustaining. But there it is, a dairy

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.520
powered candle. Not only is this butter candle
easy to make, but each half will burn for

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.609
about 4 hours. As the butter gets melted,
the liquid is wicked and released as a vapor

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.289
into the flame, and it's the vapor that you
see burning. Dropping your candle into a glass

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.790
will help keep the flame steady, as well as
set a nice ambience for the room. It doesn't

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
get much simpler than this, but if you decide
you need a firmer wick, try straightening

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.670
a paperclip and wrapping your wicking paper
around that for support. This will prevent

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.780
your wick from falling over when the fuel
burns down and liquifies. Well there's how

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.760
to make a simple emergency candle using some
toilet paper and a bit of butter. If you like

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.410
this project, perhaps you'll like some of
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
