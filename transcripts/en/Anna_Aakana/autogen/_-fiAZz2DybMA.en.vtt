00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.520
I'm at an age where all of my friends are settling down

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.480
and getting married and having kids

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.040
and every time I hear the news:

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.040
"I'm getting married!"

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.260
Though I say:

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.160
"Congratulations!"

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.940
All I can think is:

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.660
What's wrong with me?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.800
Why isn't anyone proposing to me?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.160
I've never been proposed to before.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.900
What if I die alone?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.380
What if no one ever wants me in the end?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.340
Maybe I should be a feminist

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.440
and propose to my boyfriend.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.020
No, that's weird.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.940
I'm self-aware enough to know that this like

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.760
pressure to feel like I want to get married

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.400
comes from like Fairy Tale books and Disney movies

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.240
and reading the vampire trilogies when

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.200
I was 13 years old.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.040
But even though you know all of that

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.920
you can't help but feel like:

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.400
I want to get married.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.760
But I'm also self-aware enough to know that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.400
I don't want to get married because I want to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040
declare my eternal love for someone.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.520
No, I just want to get married because I want the party.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.360
I want a giant cake, and an expensive dress

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.060
and a whole day where it's all about me.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.800
It's like your birthday but bigger!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.460
One day, you're going to get married

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.600
and that means you get to get

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.860
a really expensive, nice dress

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.120
and all of your friends have to come

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.700
and be nice to you, and give you gifts,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.660
and then you have a big feast and you share this day

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.620
with somebody, but that person doesn't matter

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.180
as much as you because this is your day.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.360
And it's kind of weird because when you about

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.420
actual marriage.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.480
That going you're going to settle down with someone

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.900
and spend your entire life with them.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.620
It seems really dumb to get married after

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.560
only knowing someone for a couple of years.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.560
Right?  You should spend a lot of time

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.040
with that person so you know that you can tolerate

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.840
each other.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.260
I want to kill you, but I wont.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.740
It's what love is, baby.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920
And yet we put so much pressure on getting married.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.420
You know?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.220
Like even as we get older, if we're not

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.380
married we kind of think that person is like weird

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.120
or not worthy of love.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.960
And like I haven't fully decided like

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.480
whether or not I want to get married.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.460
Because you know there's that whole debate

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.940
of like whether or not monogamy is even feasible

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.600
in today's world where we're going to live till 120

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.680
and people change all the time

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.720
and we're getting more open to different views.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.060
I haven't really like nailed down my

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.860
thoughts on marriage.  Much less kids--

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.820
That's like a whole other video I don't even want to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.860
get into right now.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.180
But I just kind of wanted to talk about it

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.180
and see what people thought like:

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.900
If you got married really young, did you get divorced?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.120
Do you agree with marriage?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.360
Is that what you're looking for?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.060
Are you like me?  And you just really want to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.380
get married because the idea of it is really cool.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.100
And you get to have a really dope party

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.360
where everyone just gets fucked up

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.460
in your name.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.300
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.000
Although now I'm in Ant Man so I should

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.500
probably be more supportive of the Marvel Universe.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.940
So, stay...

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.400
Marvelous!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.360
I'm Anna Man.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360
I'm Anna Man.  Stay Marvelous.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.600
I'm getting married!

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.120
*gasps*  Congratulations!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.760
I know!  You will never believe how he proposed

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.040
So we went to the Taj Mahal.  And it was just amazing.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.700
And I'm so excited for the wedding.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.320
I'm going to have pigs in a blanket and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720
I'm thinking about maybe we're going to have

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.660
3 kids.  We're going to have 2 girls

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.580
and then a hermaphrodite.  It's going to be so great!

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.320
And their names are going to be Billy, Jilly , and Lilly!
