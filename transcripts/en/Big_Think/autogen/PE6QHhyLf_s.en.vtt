to in biology you have to memorize

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
to in biology you have to memorize
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130
to in biology you have to memorize
things because biologists by long

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140

who doesn't love a Golgi body okay and
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.969
who doesn't love a Golgi body okay and
so on there's some memorization involved

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979
so on there's some memorization involved
 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.850

and written de reticulum I'm sorry man

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
and written de reticulum I'm sorry man
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.399
