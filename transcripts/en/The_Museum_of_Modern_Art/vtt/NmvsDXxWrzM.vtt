00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.090
So I think today our goal is to really figure
out these image selections.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.910
Based on the ones that you guys sent, I went
through and did a preliminary edit because

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.350
I think you sent about 22 and we can only
use maybe 15 to 16.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.380
We put together all these group shots and
we started to feel like we needed some scale

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.590
shift, so I pulled some portrait shots as
well that we’re feeling like we kind of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.780
want to mix in a combination of, you know,
maybe the primary players in the show with

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
these groups.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.940
I don’t mind that idea, but if we do that
we need to be sure to mix the players more.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.010
For sure, yeah.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
So how do you feel about where we are right
now?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
This is really just sort of an update from
last meeting where we wanted to confirm

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.390
a couple things just to make sure that we’re on the right track.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.630
You know, the basic idea I like, but it looks
a little composed.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.070
I think the bluing works against the excitement
of it.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.140
So, what’s the positive?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.659
Maybe we’re getting to the slightly scrappier
feel, maybe even shifting the colors among

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.299
the photos a little bit so some are maybe
more sepia.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.340
I don’t know if that’s possible?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.549
Maybe the clustering a little bit less like
a word cloud and a little bit more like it

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.159
is scattering the photos.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.909
What about carrying the photos over?

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.109
Love that!

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.299
Did you want to see any more archival photos
from Made Thought just while we’re teaming

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.299
up?

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.799
I would love to see if you want to show us.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.920
That’s a nice one of Cy Twombly.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.110
What’s different between these two?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.110
Well, he made an inventory of silk screens—about
120—and then he would recombine the images

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.110
in different ways.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
So you know, you can imagine it’s trying
to think digitally before you have digital

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.030
capacity, so instead he has a stack of screens
and he can combine the screens.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.030
That’s very cool.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.050
Okay this is him…

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.180
This is nice!

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180
What is he doing?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.970
He’s taking paintings in Venice to install
at the Venice Bienalle.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.050
Whoa, on a boat?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.050
On a gondola.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.370
That’s how you install art in Venice.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.590
Beautiful, right?

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.379
Is that his island?

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.620
Yeah, that’s his island!

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.901
Okay, I think that’s where we are.

00:02:58.901 --> 00:03:04.030
There are very few that if you look through
and think it might work that we would say no

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.030
to, so…

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.530
Great!
