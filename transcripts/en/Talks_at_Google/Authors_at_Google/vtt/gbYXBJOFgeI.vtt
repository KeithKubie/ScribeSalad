00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.750
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I first met Cory Doctorow in
1986 when he was working for Metallica and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.170
trying to anticipate the coming Napster wars.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.490
People don't know this about him, but he is
a fervent defender of the RIAA and the MPAA.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.250
This has all been just a big lie, he says,
[laughter] to make people feel that he's one

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.250
of us.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.050
Recently, actually, I ran into him in Washington,
DC, and he was telling me, "You guys do the

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.620
legal minimum of compliance with the DMCA.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.960
We think that you're just pirates."

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.250
I said, "You've been working for the RIAA
now for 16 years.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.039
I don't see how you can possibly say that
with any sort of honesty."

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.239
Then I realized who I was talking to, of course.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.570
[laughs] [laughter]
Realistically, I met Cory when he was doing

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
sugar water.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.570
Right?

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.789
For the first time.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.870
&gt;&gt;Cory Doctorow: [inaudible]

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.870
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yeah.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.210
And then Zelig-like, I noticed as he rose
as an author.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.450
I actually don't want to spend much time introducing
him.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
So I won't.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.080
Everyone, please welcome Cory Doctorow.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.350
[applause]

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.170
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Hi folks.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.710
I give-- I write science fiction novels and
stories.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.890
You've got some of my short story collections
there in front of you.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.729
They all relate, in one way or another, they
kind of circle these issues.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.009
I feel like science fiction stories put the
sinew and the marrow into the argument.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.930
Before George Orwell came along, if you wanted
to talk about surveillance, you could say,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.420
"I kinda feel like it might change my behavior
if I were being watched all the time in some

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.070
abstract way."

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.640
And someone else might say, "Yeah, but if
we knew everything about you, we could provide

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.600
services to you and we could know when bad
things were going to happen" and so on.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.580
And now we have this great word we can use
to describe what that means.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.759
You can say it's Orwellian.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.950
So there's now a lot of muscle on the bone
when you talk about this stuff.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.619
That's what I do in the fiction.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.190
But I don't want to stand here and read stories
to you, although I have a podcast where you

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.190
can hear me read stories.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.180
What I'm going to do today is the argument
that the books that you're holding in your

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.120
hand are the blood and sinew for, and take
it from there.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.350
The talk runs 35 minutes.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.660
And then there's time for Q&amp;A.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.710
The one thing I want to say as a caveat to
this: I've given this talk twice now.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.820
I gave it at the Long Now Foundation and I
gave it at DEFCON, both in the last week or

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.270
ten days.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.160
Both times, there was a little bit of feedback.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.410
There's a hypothetical, technical solution
I propose, and I'll tell you when I get there.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.421
I want to clarify that it is purely hypothetical
by way of example, and not a thing that I

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:46.980
think we should do.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.800
With that said, [laughter] I'm going to get
to it.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.450
I gave this talk in late 2011-- Ha.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
Ah!

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.490
There we go.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.210
I gave this talk in late 2011 at the 28C3
in Berlin called "The Coming War on General

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.360
Purpose Computation."

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.040
In a nutshell, the hypothesis of that talk
was computers and the internet are everywhere,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.290
the world is increasingly made of computers
and the internet.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.030
We used to have these separate categories
of devices like washing machines, VCRs, phones,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.780
and cars, and now we just have computers in
different boxes.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.640
Cars are computers we put our bodies into.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.340
747s are badly secured Solaris boxes connected
SCADA controllers.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.180
[laughter] Hearing aids, pacemakers, other
prostheses: computers we put in our body.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.430
That means that from now on, all of our socio-political
problems in the future are going to have a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.560
computer in the middle of them.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.090
That will beget a regulator who says, "Can't
you just make me a computer that solves the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.090
problem?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.850
Can't you make me a self-driving car that
can't be programmed to drag race?

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.400
Can't you make me a bioscale 3D printer that
doesn't print out an organism that puts the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.910
human race at risk or blows Monsanto's quarterly
profits?"

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.410
That is, "Can you make me a general purpose
computer that runs all the programs except

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.380
for the one that pisses me off?"

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.040
[laughter]
Now, we don't know how to make that computer.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.180
We don't have a theoretical model for Turing
Complete minus one.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.760
Our closest approximation to a computer that
runs every program except for the one that

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.630
abets a criminal or evinces a social problem
is a computer with spyware on it when it comes

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.630
out of the box.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.030
That is, a computer that watches everything
that you do all the time, so that when the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.250
moment comes, it can say, "I can't let you
do that, Dave."

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.510
A computer that runs secret programs that
the user isn't supposed to even know about.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.630
If the user finds out about it, the user can't
terminate these processes, even if the user

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.820
really thinks that they run contrary to their
interests, and even if the computer that they're

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.380
running on belongs to the user.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.080
In other words, digital rights management.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.680
Now, digital rights management's a bad idea
for solving social problems for at least two

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.930
significant reasons.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.260
The first one is that it doesn't actually
solve the problem.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.380
Breaking DRM isn't hard for bad guys.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.710
As the copyright wars have shown us, digital
rights management is a solution that ends

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.710
within 24 hours.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.470
As soon as a bored Norwegian teenager encounters
the DRM, it goes away.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.360
DRM only works if the "I can't let you do
that, Dave" program remains a secret.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.720
Once the most sophisticated attacker in the
world finds out that secret and puts it on

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.280
the internet, everybody else on the internet
has the secret, too.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.220
Now, the second reason is that DRM not only
has weak security, but it weakens security.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.400
In order to be secure, you need to be certain
about what software is running on your computer.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.210
You can't secure the software on your computer
if you don't know what software is running

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.540
on your computer.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.400
When you design the "I can't let you do that,
Dave" facility into a computer, you create

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.000
this enormous security vulnerability.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.080
You now have a program running that users
aren't even supposed to know about.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.910
If they know about it, they can't find details
of or terminate or override.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.150
When some bad guy hijacks this, they can do
things to your computer that, by design, your

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.370
computer doesn't show you.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:16.670
You probably remember, Sony BMG put root kits
on 51-- no, 6 million CDs, 51 audio CD titles,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.139
and distributed them to their customers.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.960
They stealthily installed malware.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.670
The root kit made any process or file that
was prepended with dollar sign SYS, invisible

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.240
to the file manager and process manager.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.760
Immediately, malware writers started prepending
dollar sign SYS to their program files and

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.800
their processes because if they ever found
themselves on a computer whose immune system

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.560
had been blown by the Sony root kit, that
immune system would no longer even be able

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.050
to see their process.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.360
Now, once governments solve problems with
DRM, there's this perverse incentive to make

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.350
it illegal to tell people things that might
override the DRM, things like "This is how

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.160
the DRM works" or "Here's a flaw in the DRM
that might allow an attacker to secretly activate

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.550
the microphone or turn on the camera or grab
your keystrokes."

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.889
Now after I gave this talk at 28C3, I got
a lot of feedback from various civil libertarians

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.800
and other people, including some very distinguished
computer scientists.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.180
I got a very thought provoking email from
Vint Cerf after I wrote this, which really

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.930
made my day.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.290
It led me to the conclusion that within the
fields of civil liberties and technology and

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.110
policy, there's a kind of good guy consensus
that if you own your computer, you should

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.740
be in charge of what's running on it, at least
as between you and corporations, or you and

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.740
the government.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.790
That mandating what software you may or may
not run on your computer is just not a good

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.360
idea if it belongs to you.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.810
Now, most computers-- Let's examine, for a
minute, what it would mean, as an owner, to

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.040
be able to absolutely control the software
that was running on your computer in an adversarial

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.010
relationship against, not an advanced persistent
threat, but at least against script kiddies

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:07.430
or griefers or just your garden variety deputy
dog cop who wants to screw with your computer.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.600
Most computers today are fitted with these:
TPMs, trusted platform modules, a secure code

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.080
processor mounted on the motherboard.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.720
The specification for TPM is published.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.210
There's an industry body that certifies that
devices that advertise a TPM actually have

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.960
a real TPM in them and not a fake TPM.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.300
To the extent that that spec is good, and
to the extent that these people are diligent

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:36.190
in doing their jobs and sue people who list
a device as having a TPM when it doesn't,

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.560
it's possible to be reasonably certain that
if you think you have a TPM, you do have a

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.870
TPM, and that it faithfully implements the
spec.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.589
TPM is secure.

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:48.540
One of the ways in which it's secure is that
it has some secrets.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.510
But it's also secure in that it's designed
to be tamper evident.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.070
If you try to extract the keys from a TPM,
it's supposed to be really obvious that something

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.620
has been done to your computer.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.250
Someone takes your real TPM out and puts a
fake TPM that they 3D printed or cooked up

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:08.290
in their hack lab or made down in Quantico
and sticks it in your computer, it's supposed

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.610
to be really obvious that it's happened.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.730
There's a TPM threat model that crooks or
governments or police forces or some other

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.760
adversary try to compromise your computer,
and TPM tamper evidence lets you know when

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.190
that's happened.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.830
But there's another TPM threat model.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.410
It's that a piece of malicious software infects
your computer.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.720
Now, all the censors—.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.130
When that happens, all the censors that are
attached to your computer, --the mic, the

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:36.320
camera, the accelerometer, the fingerprint
reader, the GPS, and so on--, can be switched

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.030
on without your knowledge, and the data can
be cached on the or can be sent to a bad guy

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.030
or both.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.490
Not only that, of course, all of the data
on your computer-- your sensitive files, your

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.290
stored passwords, your web history-- can also
be harvested and sent to a bad guy, or harvested

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.279
and cached for a later retrieval, as can all
your keystrokes.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:57.760
All the peripherals that are attached to your
computer can either be subtly altered, turned

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.140
off, or turned on to do bad things.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:06.360
Today, those peripherals might be your printer,
your scanner, your SCADA controller, your

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.030
MRI machine, your car, your avionic, your
3D printer.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.910
You can understand why that would be a bit
freaky, but of course, in the future, those

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.690
peripherals might also include your optic
nerve, your cochlea, and the stumps of your

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.690
legs.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.300
When your computer boots up, the TPM can ask
your bootloader for a signed hash of itself

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.550
and verify that the signature of the hash
comes from a trusted party, someone you trust.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.460
Once you trust the bootloader to faithfully
perform its duties, you can ask it to check

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.790
the signatures on the operating system, which,
once verified, can check the signatures on

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.860
the programs that run on it.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.550
And so on and so on up the stack, ensuring
that you know which programs are running on

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:47.050
your computer, and that any programs running
in secret have gotten there by leveraging

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.350
a defect in the bootloader or operating system
or the other components, and not because this

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.370
computer was designed to actually hide things
from you.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.980
Now, this story always reminds me of Descartes:
he starts off by saying that he can't tell

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.600
what's true and what's not true, because he
doesn't know if he can trust his senses, he

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.220
doesn't know if he can trust his reason.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.850
He does some mental gymnastics, which I won't
get into here, although that's generally the

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.080
thing people find interesting about him, but
what's interesting to me is that once he establishes

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.529
this tiny little nub of certainty, a kind
of mental gymnastic exercise that says, "Well,

00:11:17.529 --> 00:11:20.140
I can trust my reason, I can trust my senses."

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.530
Then he is able to erect this stable edifice
of a worldview on it.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.470
He knows one thing to be true, and everything
else can be hung off of that one thing.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.780
He can build it up.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.260
Now, a TPM is like that.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.780
It's a nub of stable certainty: if it's there,
it can reliably inform you about your bootloader,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.830
and thus, your operating system, and thus,
the processes running on your computer.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.300
Now, you may find it weird to hear someone
like me talking warmly about TPMs.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.510
After all, these are the technologies that
make it possible to lock phones, tablets,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.810
consoles, and even some PCs so that they can't
run software of the owner's choosing.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:00.000
Jailbreaking usually means finding a way to
subvert a TPM.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.850
Why on earth would I want a TPM in my computer?

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.230
As with everything interesting in tech and
policy, the devil is in the details.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.500
Imagine for a moment that there's two different
ways of implementing a TPM.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.750
There may be more, but imagine these two.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.350
The first one we'll call lockdown.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:21.000
In the lockdown world, your TPM comes with
a set of signing keys it trusts, and unless

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.700
your bootloader appears in that list-- is
signed by one of those signing keys, it won't

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.700
run it.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.280
It won't boot, the operating system won't
run.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.580
You're just stuck there in whatever it is
that people who installed the bootloader on

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.520
your computer want you to run.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.089
You can't change that.

00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:42.870
There's another mode that I'll call certainty.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.860
In the certainty mode, you tell your TPM which
signing keys you trust.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.450
The first time you turn your computer on,
you initialize it with some authentication

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:56.450
token-- whoops-- like a key or a password
or some other thing.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.290
A biometric that it knows so it knows who
it belongs to.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:04.900
Then you, the owner, are the only person who
gets to say what it trusts.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.839
You can say, "I don't trust this person's
operating system" or "I do trust that person's

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:08.980
operating system."

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.110
"Only run operating systems that are signed
by Cononicle, EFF, ACLU and Wikileaks.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:23.390
[laughter] Approximately speaking, these two
modes correspond to, of course, iOS and Android.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.510
iOS only lets you run the code that's been
approved by Apple.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.810
Android lets you tick a box and say, "I'm
a grown up.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.710
Let me choose who I trust”.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.500
Critically, Android lacks an important facility:
it lacks the facility to verify that what

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.380
you think you're running is what you are running.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.660
It's freedom without certainty.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.720
Now, freedom without certainty is a big deal
in a world where the computers we're discussing

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.390
can see you and hear you, where we put them
in your pocket and take them into the toilet,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.029
where they sit by your bedside, where they
fly airplanes, where we put our bodies into

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:57.110
them, and they drive our cars around, which
is why I like the idea of a TPM, provided

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.600
it's implemented in the certainty mode and
not in the lockdown mode.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.910
Now, if that's not clear, think of it this
way: there's the war on general-purpose computation,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.040
and that's what happens when control freaks
in governments or companies decide that they

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.779
should have the final say in what you do on
your computer.

00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:21.029
There's also-- And then there's this: there's
the counter position, which is that defenders

00:14:21.029 --> 00:14:25.480
against those people are also control freaks,
but they're control freaks like me.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.779
We want to be people with the ultimate destiny
over what we install on our computers.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:35.029
Both sides want control, they just differ
in where the nexus of control should be.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:36.540
Control requires knowledge.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.019
If you want to be sure that songs that are
moved onto an iPod, stay on the iPod, and

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:46.970
don't come off of the iPod, the iPod needs
to know that the instructions that it's getting

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:51.850
are coming from an Apple-approved version
of iTunes, and not one pretending to be iTunes.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.730
Otherwise, you don't get the roach motel.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:15:00.830
If you want to be sure that my PVR won't record
a watch-once, video-on-demand program, or

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.040
if it does record a program, that it won't
output it to anything except something that

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.280
will honor whatever business rules came along
with it.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.220
You have to be sure that you know what programs
I'm running and what they do.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.180
But if I want to be sure that you aren't watching
me through my webcam, I need to know what

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.490
firmware is running, and I need to know that
the little green light always comes on when

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.730
my webcam switches itself on.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.470
If I want to be sure that you aren't capturing
my passwords through my keyboard using a software

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.580
keylogger, I need to know that the OS isn't
lying when it says there aren't any keyloggers

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.279
resident in the system.

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:36.450
Whether you want to be free or whether you
want to enslave, you need control and you

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.990
need knowledge.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.730
That's the coming war on general purpose computation.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.769
Now I want to investigate what happens if
we win it.

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:47.730
That's the civil war over general purpose
computation.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:52.040
Let's stipulate that we have a victory for
the "freedom side."

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.630
It means that we have computers where owners
always know what was running on them, because

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.459
the computers would faithfully report the
hash and the associated signatures for any

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:03.970
bootloaders they find, and control over what
was running on computer's ghost to you, because

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.680
the computers would allow their owners to
specify who was allowed to sign their bootloaders,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.200
operating systems, and so on.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.860
There are two arguments that we can make in
favor of this victory, why this victory would

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.860
be a good one.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.970
The first one is a human rights argument.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.410
If your world is made of computers, then designing
computers to override their owner's decisions

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.830
has significant human rights implications.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:29.339
Today, there are people who worry that the
Iranian government might demand import controls,

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:35.350
so that all the computers that come in have
UFE-style bootlocker that only boots operating

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.100
systems that have lawful interception back
doors built in.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.100
You can move the spying right to the edge,
to the user of the computer, the owner of

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.300
the computer.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.399
But tomorrow, it may be that I live in the
UK, and it may be that our Home Secretary

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:52.290
says, "If the NHS gives you a cochlear implant,
it has to intercept and report all the extremist

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.260
speech it hears."

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.430
The human rights stuff is easy to understand.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.600
The second argument comes from property rights.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.000
The doctrine of first sale is a very important
piece of law.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.490
It says once you buy something, you own it.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.550
You should have the freedom to do anything
you want to it, even if it gores the ox of

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.039
the person who sold it to you.

00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:14.679
DRM opponents like me, we love the slogan,
"You bought it, you own it."

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:18.169
Property rights are an incredibly powerful
argument to have on your side, anywhere.

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:22.730
But they're especially powerful to have on
your side in a nerd fight, because you can't

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.399
swing a cat in Silicon Valley without hitting
someone who thinks that property rights are

00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:30.289
an important way of solving most social problems.

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:33.499
But it's not just nerd fights.

00:17:33.499 --> 00:17:37.519
Copyfighters get really pissed off about the
term "intellectual property," because property

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:41.190
is also a really good way to win arguments
in policy circles.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.600
Before the term "intellectual property" came
into prominence, we had other terms like "creators'

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600
monopoly".

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.899
It's very hard to go to a regulator or a lawmaker
and say, "My monopoly isn't large enough",

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:55.919
but going and saying, "My property rights
are being not respected enough or need to

00:17:55.919 --> 00:18:00.090
be expanded so that I can make sure that they're
policed adequately," that's a very powerful

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.989
argument to have on your hand.

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:05.169
That's where the civil war part comes in.

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:09.369
Human rights and property rights both demand
that computers not be designed for remote

00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:13.419
control by corporations or governments.

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:17.869
Owners be allowed to specify their OS and
the programs running on them to freely choose

00:18:17.869 --> 00:18:23.440
that nub of certainty in the void that allows
them to build their whole stable edifice of

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.630
certainty on.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.940
Now, remember that security is relative.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.129
You are secured from attacks on your ability
to freely use your music if you can control

00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:32.320
your computing environment.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.909
But, if you can control your computing environment,
the Recording Industry Association of America

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:42.820
is now vulnerable to attacks on their ability
to rent you music on a single-use basis.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.360
We have this notion of streaming, this consensus
hallucination that there's a difference between

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.529
a stream and a download, as though there's
some means of transmitting a stream of bits

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:54.150
to someone's computer without actually having
them download that stream of bits, like the

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.889
internet is made of mirrors and speaking tubes.

00:18:56.889 --> 00:19:02.309
[laughter] We say "Stream", we mean "I think
that your receiving software doesn't have

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.600
a 'save as' button."

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.490
Now, if you get to choose the nub from which
the scaffold dangles, you get control and

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.870
power to secure yourself against people who
attack your interests.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.289
If the Recording Industry Association of America,
or the government, or Monsanto get to choose

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:22.009
the nub, then they get control and the power
to secure themselves against you.

00:19:22.009 --> 00:19:25.429
So we all agree that at the very least, owners
should control what runs on their computers,

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:27.230
or I'll ask you to stipulate that.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.990
Now, what about users of computers?

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.100
Users of computers don't always have the same
interests as the owners of computers.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.779
Increasingly, we will be users of computers
that we don't own.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:44.091
Where you come down on the conflict between
owners and users of computers, I think, is

00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:48.059
going to end up being one of the most important
both technological and moral questions of

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:49.779
the coming decades.

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:54.480
There's no easy answer I have, no bright line,
for when users or owners should trump one

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.580
another when it comes to computers.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.701
Let's start with a position I'll call "property
maximalism": "If I own my computer, I should

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.879
have the absolute right to dictate terms of
use to anyone who wants to use it.

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:08.700
If you don't like it, find someone else's
computer to use.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.700
This one's mine.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.909
I set the rules."

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.450
How would that work in practice?

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.331
Well, you got some combination of an initialization
routine where you set the root of trust, tamper

00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:19.980
evidence, law, and physical control.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.379
For example, you turn on your computer for
the first time, and you initialize a good

00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:28.049
secret password, possibly signed by your private
key, and without that key, no one is allowed

00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:33.080
to change the list of trusted parties who
are allowed to sign your bootloader.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.239
We can make it against the law to subvert
this for the purpose of taking control away

00:20:36.239 --> 00:20:37.239
from the owner.

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:43.630
That makes writing malware that hijacks your
computer extra special, super duper illegal,

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.539
but it also makes stealthy DRM installation
even more illegal.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:52.190
We can design the TPM so that if you remove
it, or tamper with it, it's really obvious.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:57.289
You give it a fragile housing, so that when
it's changed out, you can tell at a glance

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.289
that it's happened.

00:20:58.289 --> 00:21:02.080
Then, if you still trust physical locks, you
can put it under lock and key, too.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.490
Now, I can see a lot of benefits to this,
but there are unquestionably some downsides

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.789
to giving owners absolute control over their
computers.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:11.479
One wedge issue is probably going to be a
self-driving car.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.739
There's a lot of these around already.

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.789
They come out of places like this and other
places.

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:21.570
It's easy to understand, on the one hand,
why self-driving cars would be insanely great.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.130
We are terrible drivers.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.929
Cars totally kill the shit out of us.

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:31.779
[laughter] They are the number 1 cause of
death in America for people aged 5-34.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:33.350
I saw my friend, Katherine [indistinct], last
night.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.559
She pointed out that it's also the number
1 way for humans to kill other humans.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:41.989
If you kill another person in your life, you're
almost certainly going to do it with a car.

00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:43.019
I've been hit by a car.

00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:44.270
I've also cracked up a car.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.299
I'm willing to stipulate that humans have
no business driving.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:52.470
It's also easy to understand how we might
be nervous about the prospect of people homebrewing

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.989
their own self-driving car firmware.

00:21:54.989 --> 00:21:59.710
On the one hand, we do want the sourcecode
for these cars to be open, public, and subject

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.759
to scrutiny so that defects can be discovered,
so that hidden features that may act against

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:07.510
their owners' or users' interests can be quickly
found out.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.260
You'd want to know it if there's a kill switch
built in.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.229
You'd want to know it if your car secretly
drives you past more McDonalds when the kids

00:22:14.229 --> 00:22:16.809
are in the back seat.

00:22:16.809 --> 00:22:20.919
It's going to be plausible, I think, to say,
"Cars are safer if they have a locked bootloader

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:28.169
and if that bootloader only runs a firmware
that's been signed by the Department of Motor

00:22:28.169 --> 00:22:31.200
Vehicles or by the FTC”.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.899
But now we're back to you, whether you get
to decide whether your computer is running

00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:37.460
the software that you want it to run.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.789
Now, there are two problems with this solution,
the solution of giving the state a veto over

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:44.649
your self-driving car.

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:46.399
The first one is that it won't work.

00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:54.799
As the copyright wars have shown us, firmware
locks aren't effective against dedicated attackers.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:58.610
People who want to sow mayhem with custom
firmware will be able to.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.700
We need a security model that doesn't believe
that all the other cars on the road are going

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.700
to be well-behaved.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.600
If that's our security model, then we are
all dead meat.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.609
Self-driving cars must be conservative in
their approach to their own conduct, and liberal

00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:16.870
in conduct they expect from others, a venerable
principle familiar to people who work in computers,

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.830
and also, the advice that you got on your
first day of driver's ed.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.109
And it remains good advice today.

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:26.200
Now, the second problem with this is that
it invites some pretty sticky parallels.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.200
Do you remember the information superhighway?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.470
Now, if we can justify securing physical roads
by demanding that the state or a state-like

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.889
entity gets to certify the firmware on our
cars, how would we articulate a policy explaining

00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:46.109
why the devices on our equally vital virtual
roads, our information superhighways, shouldn't

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:51.639
also be locked with comparable firmware locks
for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices?

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.990
After all, we have a general-purpose network
now.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.320
That means that MRIs, space-ships, and air-traffic
control systems share the information superhighway

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.390
with Game Boys, Arduino-linked fart machines,
and the dodgy voyeur cams sold by spammers

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.549
from the Pearl River Delta.

00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:09.549
In addition to that, you're going to have
more wedge issues.

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:12.919
You'll have things like avionics and power-station
automation.

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:14.289
These are a lot trickier.

00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:19.899
If the FAA mandates a certain firmware for
a 747, it's probably going to want those 747s

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:25.929
designed so that the FAA and the FAA alone
gets to choose what runs on it.

00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:29.239
Just as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
is going to want the final say on the firmware

00:24:29.239 --> 00:24:32.440
for a reactor pile.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.700
This may be a problem for the same reason
that a ban on modifying firmware in self-driving

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.119
cars is.

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:43.359
Once you start saying it's the place of government
to sign and certify firmware on computers

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:48.419
that they don't own, it invites people to
find other computers that they should send

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:49.700
the firmware for.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.429
But on the other hand, cars and nukes exist
in a completely different regulatory framework

00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:57.779
to most of the other computers we use.

00:24:57.779 --> 00:24:58.999
Or rather, planes and nukes.

00:24:58.999 --> 00:25:02.139
Remember, a 747 is just a Solaris box.

00:25:02.139 --> 00:25:09.519
A nuke is just a specialized computer as well,
with a particularly exotic housing.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:13.169
It may be that since these things already
exist in this regulatory regime where they

00:25:13.169 --> 00:25:17.490
have no-notice inspection and so on, that
adding signed firmware locks is not going

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:22.259
to be something that invites comparisons to
all the other computers in the world.

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:24.500
But there's a bigger problem with owner control.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.960
What about people who use computers, but don't
own them?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.850
This is not a group of people that the IT
industry as a whole has a lot of sympathy

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.850
for.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:39.649
We spent an enormous amount of energy as a
group, devoting ourselves to stopping non-users--

00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:43.419
or non-owners from harming owners.

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:47.359
Users can do things like inadvertently break
the computers they're using, they download

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:51.529
menu-bars, they type random shit they find
on the Internet into terminals, they plug

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:57.090
malware-infected USB sticks into their computers,
they disable the firewalls, they install plugins

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.379
or add repositories or add certificates to
their machine's root of trust, they punch

00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:05.399
holes in the network perimeter by accident,
and they accidentally cross-connect networks

00:26:05.399 --> 00:26:09.429
that are absolutely, positively not supposed
to be cross-connected.

00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:13.330
We also try to stop users from doing deliberately
bad things, like installing keyloggers and

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:19.510
spyware to attack future users, misappropriating
secrets, snooping on network traffic, deliberately

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.369
breaking their machines, deliberately punching
holes in the network perimeter, deliberately

00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:27.799
disabling their firewalls, deliberately interconnecting
networks that are supposed to remain secret--

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.299
separate, rather.

00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:31.149
There's a kind of symmetry here.

00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:35.609
DRM and its cousins are deployed by people
who believe that you can't and shouldn't be

00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:39.779
trusted to run the computer you that you want
on your own computer.

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:44.789
IT systems are deployed by computer owners
who believe that computer users can't and

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:48.950
shouldn't be trusted to set policy on the
computers that they use.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.700
Now, as a former systems administrator and
a former CIO, I'm not going to pretend that

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.840
users aren't a terrible challenge.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.479
But I think that there are good reasons to
treat users as having rights to set policy

00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:02.769
on the computers that they don't own.

00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:05.929
Let's start with the business case, because
I think that's the easy one to make.

00:27:05.929 --> 00:27:10.769
When we demand freedom for owners, we do so
for lots of reasons, but one of them is the

00:27:10.769 --> 00:27:17.149
possibility that programmers won't have anticipated
all the contingencies that their code might

00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:18.149
run up against.

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:23.840
There may be a day where the code says no
and the owner needs to say yes.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.679
Owners sometimes possess local situational
awareness that can't be captured in nested

00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:32.249
"if-then" statements, no matter how deeply
you nest them.

00:27:32.249 --> 00:27:36.479
This is where communism and libertarianism
both converge.

00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:41.580
This guy, Hayek, thought that expertise was
very diffuse, and that you were more likely

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.440
to find the situational awareness necessary
for good decision making very close to the

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.100
decision itself.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.330
Devolution gave you better results than centralization.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:55.179
And then there was this guy, Marx, who believed
in the legitimacy of workers' claims over

00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:58.799
their working environment, saying that the
contribution of labor was just as important

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:03.091
as the contribution of capital, and demanding
that workers be treated as the rightful "owners"

00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:06.369
of their workplace, with the power to set
policy.

00:28:06.369 --> 00:28:12.519
For totally opposite reasons, they both believed
that the people at the coal-face should have

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:15.929
the first cut at running the operation.

00:28:15.929 --> 00:28:21.849
The death of mainframes was attended by an
awful lot of Sturm und Drang and hand-wringing

00:28:21.849 --> 00:28:25.570
and concern over users and what they were
going to do to the enterprise.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.649
In those days, users were even more constrained
than they are today.

00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:33.769
They could only see the screens the mainframe
let them see, and only undertake the operations

00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:36.639
the mainframe was programmed to let them undertake.

00:28:36.639 --> 00:28:42.009
When the PC and Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3 appeared,
employees risked being fired by bringing these

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:47.049
machines into their offices, or bringing home
office data to use with these machines.

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:51.469
They did this because they had a computing
need that couldn't be met within the constraints

00:28:51.469 --> 00:28:56.380
set by their employer and its IT department,
and because they didn't think that the legitimacy

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.000
of their request would be recognized.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.930
The standard response to a request from an
employee to do something that the IT department

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:08.899
doesn't like is one or more of: "A regulatory
compliance prohibits you doing the thing that

00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:12.880
you think will help you do your job better"
or "If you do your job that way, we won't

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.370
know if you're doing it right" or "You only
think you want to do your job that way" or

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.499
"It's impossible to make a computer that works
the way that you think it does" or "Corporate

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:23.159
policy prohibits you doing it."

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:26.289
Now, these may be true, although sometimes
they aren't.

00:29:26.289 --> 00:29:30.059
And even when they are, they're the kind of
"soft truths" that we pay bright young things

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:35.059
millions in VC money to try to falsify, while
if you're a middle-aged admin assistant, you

00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:38.659
merely get written up by HR for doing the
same thing.

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:42.869
The personal computer arrived in the enterprise
through the back door, over the objections

00:29:42.869 --> 00:29:46.950
of the IT department, without the knowledge
of management, at the risk of censure and

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:47.970
termination.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.559
It made the companies that fought it trillions.

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:55.860
The reason that giving workers more powerful,
more flexible tools was good for firms is

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.899
that people are generally smart, and they
generally want to do their jobs, and because

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:02.010
they know stuff that their bosses don't know.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:08.479
As an owner, you don't want the devices you
buy locked, because you might want to do something

00:30:08.479 --> 00:30:10.609
the designer didn't anticipate.

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:14.440
And employees don't want the devices that
they use all day locked, because they might

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.149
want to do something that their bosses didn't
anticipate.

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:21.409
This is the soul of Hayekism: that we're smarter
at the edge than we are in the middle.

00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:26.440
The business world pays a lot of lip service
to Hayek's 1940s ideas about free markets.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.370
But when it comes to freedom within the companies
they run, they're stuck a good 50 years earlier,

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:36.210
mired in the ideology of Frederick Winslow
Taylor and his notions of "scientific management":

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.629
The idea that workers are just particularly
unreliable kinds of machines whose movements

00:30:40.629 --> 00:30:44.789
and actions should be scripted and constrained
by all-knowing management consultants, who

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:48.630
would work with the equally wise company bosses
to find the one true way to do their jobs.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:53.460
In other words, the exact same ideology that
let Toyota cream all three of Detroit's big

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.789
automakers during the 1980s.

00:30:56.789 --> 00:31:00.489
Letting enterprise users do the stuff that
they think will allow them to make more money

00:31:00.489 --> 00:31:05.080
for their employers often results in making
more money for their employers.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.249
For the record, scientific management is about
as scientific as trepanation and Myers-Briggs

00:31:10.249 --> 00:31:11.249
tests.

00:31:11.249 --> 00:31:14.580
[laughter]
The business case for user rights is a good

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.029
one, but I really wanted to just get it out
of the way so we could dig into the real meat

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:21.039
of the argument: the human rights case.

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.980
This may seem a little weird on its face,
but bear with me.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.009
This is a guy named Hugh Herr, and I saw him
give a talk earlier this year.

00:31:28.009 --> 00:31:33.570
He's the Director of the Biomechatronics lab
at The MIT Media Lab.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.169
You may have seen him do a TED talk.

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:38.230
There's a bunch of them on YouTube.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.009
It's electrifying to see him give these talks.

00:31:40.009 --> 00:31:41.980
You should go and watch one after this.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.849
He starts out with a bunch of slides of cool
prostheses his lab has cooked up.

00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:50.710
There's legs and feet, and hands and arms,
and even this awesome thing that if you have

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:56.479
untreatable clinical depression, they stick
your head in a magnet, and the magnet suppresses

00:31:56.479 --> 00:32:00.779
activity in the parts of your brains that
are overreacting, and people with untreatable

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:02.940
clinical depression become treatable.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:08.669
It changes their lives and brings them from
the brink of suicide back into a happy place.

00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:11.210
Then he shows this slide of him, and he's
climbing up a mountain.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.179
You can see he's clinging to the mountain
like a gecko.

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:15.179
He's super buff.

00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:16.219
He clearly knows what he's about.

00:32:16.219 --> 00:32:21.500
And he doesn't have any legs, he just has
these awesome mountain climbing prostheses.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.450
Now, he's been standing at a podium like this.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.340
In fact, he does it wearing a little lav mic
or an ear mic, and he walks up and down while

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.340
he's giving the talk.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.179
Then he stops and he says, "Oh yeah, didn't
I mention?

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:34.289
I'm robot from the knee down.

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:36.649
I lost my legs to frostbite.

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:38.659
These are my legs."

00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:39.659
Then he does this cool thing.

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:42.549
He runs up and down the stage, jumping up
and down like a mountain goat.

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:45.989
It's the coolest thing you've ever seen.

00:32:45.989 --> 00:32:49.799
When I saw him give this talk, the first person
who asked a question stuck their hand up and

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:51.529
said, "So what do those cost?"

00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:55.599
He named a price that would buy you a brownstone
in Manhattan or a nice terraced Victorian

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:57.019
in Zone One.

00:32:57.019 --> 00:32:58.690
A pretty penny.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.309
The second question that was asked was, "Whose
going to be able to afford these?"

00:33:02.309 --> 00:33:04.289
And he said, "Well, of course, everybody.

00:33:04.289 --> 00:33:09.109
If it's a choice between owning legs and owning
a house, you'll take the 40 year mortgage

00:33:09.109 --> 00:33:10.600
on your legs."

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.889
Which is by way of asking you to consider
the possibility that there are going to be

00:33:14.889 --> 00:33:19.700
people, potentially a lot of people, potentially
you someday-- remember, we are only temporarily

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.879
able-bodied-- who are "users" of computers
that they don't own, where those computers

00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:27.389
are going to be parts of their bodies.

00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:31.989
I think that most of the tech world should
be able to understand why you, as the owner

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:35.909
of your cochlear implant, should be legally
allowed to choose the firmware that runs on

00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:36.909
it.

00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:41.629
After all, when you own a device that is surgically
implanted in your skull, it makes a lot of

00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:45.049
sense that you have the freedom to change
software vendors.

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:49.039
Maybe the company that made your implant had
the best algorithm for signal processing at

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:53.139
the time that they were stuck in your head,
but what if a competitor patents a superior

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:54.700
algorithm next year?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.119
Should you be doomed to inferior hearing for
the rest of your life or the 20 year span

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:00.479
of the patent, whichever comes first?

00:34:00.479 --> 00:34:04.830
This is a problem that can't be overcome merely
by escrowing the code of important embedded

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.830
systems.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.639
That might help you if the company goes bust.

00:34:07.639 --> 00:34:13.370
It also can't be helped by code publication,
the thing you would want anyway for your cochlear

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.760
implant, just to make sure that it was good
code.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.030
This is a problem that you can only overcome
by having the unambiguous right to change

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:23.880
the software, even if the company that made
your implant requires you not to.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.060
So that helps owners.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.170
But what about users?

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.960
Consider the following scenario: you are a
minor child and you have deeply religious

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.390
parents who pay for your cochlear implants.

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:36.810
They ask for the software that makes it impossible
for you to hear blasphemy.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:42.480
You are broke, and a commercial payday loan
company wants to sell you ad-supported implants

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.490
that listen in on your conversations and insert
contextual ads that trigger discussions about

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:49.620
the brands you love.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.720
Or your government is willing to install cochlear
implants, but they want to archive everything

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.090
you hear and review it without your knowledge
or consent.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:01.500
It sounds far-fetched, but remember, the Canadian
border agency, just a few months ago, had

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.720
to be slapped down from its plan to put hidden
microphones through the entirety of all of

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.930
the country's airports, so they could listen
in on and record all the conversations taking

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.290
place in every airport in real time and later.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.960
Will the Iranian government, will the Chinese
government, will other repressive governments

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.700
take advantage of this if they get the chance?

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.790
Speaking of Iran and China, there are plenty
of human rights activists who believe that

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.470
boot-locking will be the start of a human
rights disaster.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:32.430
It's no secret that there are high-tech companies
who have been happy to build "lawful intercept"

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:37.590
back-doors into their equipment to allow for
warrantless, secret access to their communications.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.460
These backdoors are now standard, so even
if your country doesn't want the capability,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.460
it's still there.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.340
In Greece, for example, there is no lawful
interception requirement, but of course, all

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.750
the telecoms equipment they buy is made for
jurisdictions in which there is.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.260
They just don't turn on lawful intercept.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:59.090
During the 2004/5 Olympics bid, someone, we
don't know who, broke into the Greek telecom

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:03.380
switches, turned on the lawful intercept capability,
listened in on the conversations at the highest

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.400
levels in government, turned it off again,
and walked away.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.550
It's only because they didn't erase the logs
that we know about it.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.800
Surveillance in the middle of the network
is nowhere near as interesting as surveillance

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.320
at the edge of the network.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.960
As the ghosts of Misters Hayek and Marx will
tell you, there's a lot of interesting stuff

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.060
happening at the coal-face that never makes
it back to the central office.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.350
Even so-called "democratic" governments know
this.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:29.780
This is why, for example, last year, the government
of Bavaria started illegally installing the

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.500
"Bundestrojaner", or the state-trojan, on
people's computers, when they were of interest,

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.340
something that allowed them to access cameras,
microphones, hard drives, and so on.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.710
And of course, it was very badly written,
so it allowed anyone else to do that, too.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.220
Once you were infected, you were infected
for everybody.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.100
It's a safe bet that the totalitarian governments
will happily take advantage of boot-locking

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.480
and move surveillance right into the box.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.930
You may not import a computer into Iran unless
you limit its trust-model so that it only

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:57.410
boots up lawful intercept operating systems.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:01.160
Now, assume that we get an owner-controls
model, wherein the first person to use the

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.600
machine gets to initialize its root of trust.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.350
You still get the problem, because in Iran,
every computer that comes into the country

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.460
is first opened by the customs authority,
who installs a root of trust that's run by

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.740
the government.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.320
Because it's tamper-evident, even if you figure
out how to override it, the next time a snitch

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.190
or a policeman looks at your computer, they
can tell that you've been up to something

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.710
naughty and locking the government out of
your computer.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.200
Of course, repressive states aren't the only
people who like this.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.380
There are four major customers for the existing
complexive censorware, spyware, and lockware.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.990
There's repressive governments, there's large
corporations, there's schools, and helicopter

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.990
parents.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.990
That is to say, the technical needs of protective
parents, school systems, and enterprises are

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:46.140
convergent with the governments of Syria and
China.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.770
I don't mean that they have the same ideological
grounds, but they have awfully similar technological

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.160
means to attain their ends.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.260
We are very forgiving of any institution that
pursues those ends, provided that they're

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.910
doing so in order to protect either shareholders
or children.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.870
For example, you may remember that there was
widespread indignation, from all sides, when

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.710
it was revealed that employers were asking
prospective employees to turn over their Facebook

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.180
login credentials.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.300
Employers argued that they needed to be able
to review your list of friends, what you said

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.870
to them, and what you did with them, in order
to make sure that you didn't have any skeletons

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.090
in your closet that would compromise your
ability to work for them.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.820
Facebook logins were fast on their way to
becoming the workplace urine test of the 21st

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.820
century.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.390
A means of ensuring that your private life
didn't have any unsavory secrets lurking in

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.090
it, secrets that might compromise your work
life.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.030
Now, the country wasn't buying this.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:40.130
From Senate hearings to op-eds, the country
rose up against this practice.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:45.420
But no one seemed to mind that many employers
routinely insert their own intermediate keys

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.150
into their employees' devices-- their phones,
their tablets, and their computers-- that

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.370
allows them to spy on their employees' Internet
traffic, even when it's "secure", with a little

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.210
lock showing in their browser.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.460
This gives your employer access to all the
sensitive sites you access while you're on

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.520
the job, from your union's message board to
your bank website to your Gmail to your HMO

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.900
or private repository managed by your doctor's
office to Facebook.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:13.540
Now, there's a wide consensus that this is
okay because the laptop, the phone, and the

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.540
tablet that your employer issues to you are
not your property.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.210
They are company property.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.140
And yet, the reason that employers give us
these mobile devices is because there is no

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.900
longer any meaningful distinction between
home and work, between personal life and professional

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.940
life.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.030
Corporate sociologists who study the way that
we use our devices have found consistently

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.850
that employees are not capable of maintaining
strict boundaries between "work" and "personal"

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.850
accounts and their devices.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:42.900
And of course, in America, we have the land
of the 55+ hour work week, where few professionals

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.830
take any meaningful vacation time, and when
they do get away for a day or two, they bring

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.940
their Blackberry along.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:54.420
Even in the old, predigital, traditional workplace,
we recognized that workers had human rights.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.260
We didn't put cameras in the toilets to curtail
employee theft.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.620
If your spouse came by the office on your
lunch break and the two of you went into the

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:06.080
parking lot so that she or he could tell you
that the doctor said the cancer was terminal,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.690
you would be rightfully furious to discover
that your employer had been listening in on

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.570
the conversation with a hidden mic and watching
through a hidden camera.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:18.600
But if you take your laptop on your lunch
break and access Facebook and discover that

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.400
your spouse has left you a message saying
that the cancer is terminal, you're supposed

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.540
to be okay with that because the laptop is
your employer's property.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:33.710
There are plenty of instances in which not
just peons, but important and powerful people,

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:38.560
not kids and corporate employees, are going
to find themselves users of computers that

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.120
they don't own.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.090
Every car-rental agency would love to be able
to lo-jack the car they rent to you.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.250
Remember, cars are just computers you put
your body into.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.660
They'd also like to log all the places you've
been for "marketing" purposes and analytics.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.410
And there's lots of money to be made in finagling
the way your GPS roots you around to make

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.240
sure that you drive past certain billboards.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.420
But in general, the poorer and the younger
you are, the more likely you are to be a tenant

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.040
farmer in some feudal lord's computational
land.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.800
The more likely it'll be that your legs will
cease to walk if you get behind on payments

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.190
on them.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.150
That means that any thug who buys your debts
from a payday lender could literally — and

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:20.310
legally — threaten to take away your legs
(or your eyes, or your ears, or your arms,

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:25.020
or your insulin, or your pacemaker) if you
don't come up with the next payment.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.370
Before, I discussed how an owner override
might work.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.520
You have some kind of combination of physical
access-control and tamper-evidence, designed

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.270
to give owners of computers the power to know
and control what bootloader and OS was running

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.100
on their machine.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.040
How will user-override work?

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.400
I think an effective user-override has to
leave the underlying computer and its programs

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.280
intact, so that when the owner takes it back,
she can be sure that it was in the state she

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.480
believed it was in when she handed it over.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.660
In other words, we need to protect users from
owners and owners from users, as well as users

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:56.390
from other users.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.390
Here's one model for that.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.390
This is the hypothetical.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:03.310
I'm not suggesting we do this, I'm suggesting
it by way of example.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.770
Imagine that there is a bootloader that can
reliably and accurately report on the kernels

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.530
and OSs it finds on your computer.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.960
This is a prerequisite for all the scenarios
we've discussed: the one in which the state

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.511
controls your computer, the one in which the
owner controls your computer, and the one

00:42:16.511 --> 00:42:19.830
in which users may be able to control their
computers some of the time.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:24.420
Now, give the bootloader the power to suspend
any running operating system to disk, encrypting

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:29.770
all its thread and parking them, and the power
to select another operating system from the

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.450
network or an external drive.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:36.490
So I walk into an Internet cafe, and there's
an OS running that I can verify.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:40.890
It has a lawful interception back-door for
the police, it stores all my keystrokes.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:46.110
It stores all my files, all my screens in
an encrypted blob that the state can decrypt.

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:50.671
Now I'm an attorney, or a doctor, or a corporate
executive, or just a human being who doesn't

00:42:50.671 --> 00:42:55.650
want all of his communications being available
to anyone who can bribe a cop.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.850
So I do some kind of three-finger salute on
my keyboard.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:03.770
It drops into a minimal bootloader shell,
and I can give the net-address of an alternative

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.450
operating system, or insert a thumbdrive.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.860
Now the cafe owner's operating system gets
parked.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.250
I can't see inside it.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:14.030
But the bootloader can assure me that it's
dormant and not spying on me as my operating

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.030
system fires up.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.100
When it's done, all my working files are trashed,
and the bootloader confirms it.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.540
Not just because this keeps the computer's
owner from spying on me, but it keeps me from

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.860
spying on the computer's owner.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.680
Now, there will be technological means of
subverting this.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.340
You could make a thing that looks like the
bootloader but isn't the bootloader.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.130
But there is a world of difference between
starting from a design spec that aims to protect

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:40.340
users from owners and vice-versa, and one
that says that users should always be subservient

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.470
to owners.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:45.010
Now, human rights and property rights often
come into conflict with one another.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:50.130
For example, landlords aren't allowed to enter
your hotel without adequate notice-- or your

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.900
home without adequate notice.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.660
In many places, the hotelier can't throw you
out if you keep paying for your room, even

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.750
if you overstay your reservation.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.880
Repo men can't take away your car without
serving you a notice and giving you the opportunity

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.310
to dispute it.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.170
When these laws are streamlined, we get all
kinds of bad effects.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:11.020
Robo-signers taking away people's houses even
though they've paid their mortgage or don't

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.790
even have a mortgage.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:18.380
The potential for abuse in a world where everything
is made of computers is, of course, much greater.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.290
Your car might drive itself to the repo yard.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:25.720
Or your high-rise apartment building may switch
off its elevators and its climate systems,

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.940
stranding thousands of people until a disputed
license payment is settled.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.740
Now this has already happened with a parking
garage.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:41.720
Back in 2006, there was a 314-car Robotic
Parking model RPS1000 garage in Hoboken, New

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.970
Jersey, whose owners believed that they were
up to date on their software license payments

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.720
and whose vendor disagreed.

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.110
So the vendor shut off the garage and took
314 cars hostage.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:56.310
The owner said that they were paid up, but
they paid again because what the hell else

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.000
were they going to do?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.350
Now what will you do when your dispute with
a vendor means that you can go blind, or deaf,

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:07.130
or lose the ability to walk, or become suicidally
depressed?

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:13.030
The negotiating leverage that accrues to owners
over users in this scenario is total and terrifying.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.370
Users will be strongly incentivized to settle
quickly, rather than face the dreadful penalties

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.470
that could be visited on them in the event
of a dispute.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.190
And when the owner of the device is the state
or a state-sized corporate actor, the potential

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.240
for human rights abuses skyrockets.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.760
Now, this is not to say that owner override
is an unmitigated evil.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.450
There are lots of reasons why you might not
want users to override their computers.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.390
Think of a smart meter.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:42.080
Smart meters need to be able to turn down
your building's temperature by a couple of

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.770
degrees, otherwise we have to keep using dirty
coal because it's the power source that we

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:48.200
can raise and lower on demand.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:53.160
Now, that works best if users can't override
the meter on their wall.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:59.040
But what happens if there's a big freeze,
and a griefer or a crook or a government turns

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.240
off your heat?

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:07.840
What happens if the HVAC in your house is
cranked to 110 degrees during a heat-wave

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.650
and you can't override it?

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:14.290
Once we create a design norm of devices that
users can't override, how far does that end

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.490
up creeping?

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:21.820
Especially risky would be the use of owner
override to offer payday loan-style services

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:22.900
to vulnerable people.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.870
If you can't afford artificial eyes for your
blind kid, we'll subsidize them, but you have

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.130
to let us redirect your kid's visual focus
to sponsored toys and sugar-snacks when you

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.980
go to the grocery store.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:38.360
But foreclosing on owner override probably
means that there will be poor people who won't

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.710
get offers that they would get otherwise.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:44.780
I can lease you something, even if you're
a bad credit risk, if I know I can repossess

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.510
it handily.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.460
But if your legs can decide to walk away to
the repo depot without your consent, you will

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:56.350
be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists,
griefers, and the secret police figure out

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.030
how to hijack that facility.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:02.850
It gets even more complicated, of course,
because you're the user of many systems that

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:08.310
you aren't-- in the most transitory of ways:
the subway turnstile, the elevator, the blood-pressure

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.840
cuff at the doctor's office, public buses
and airplanes.

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:16.390
It's going to be hard to figure out how to
create "user overrides" that aren't nonsensical,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:20.610
although we can start by saying that "users"
are someone who are the sole user of a device

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.870
for a meaningful amount of time, although
we'd then have to define "meaningful."

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:26.860
This is not a problem I know how to solve.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.940
Unlike the War on General Purpose Computers,
the Civil War over computers seems to present

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.600
a series of conundra without any obvious solutions,
at least, obvious to me.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.240
Which is why I'm talking about them to you.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.490
These problems are a long way off, and of
course, they'll only arise if we win the war

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.950
on general purpose computers first.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.230
But come victory day, when we start planning
the constitutional congress for the new world,

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:53.351
where regulating computers is acknowledged
as the wrong way to solve problems, let's

00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:57.340
not paper over this division between property
rights and human rights.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:01.220
This is the sort of division that, while it
festers, puts the most vulnerable people in

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.450
our society in harm's way.

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:06.240
Agreeing to disagree on this one is not good
enough.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.610
We need to start thinking now about the principles
we'll apply when the day comes.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:15.970
Because if we don't start now, it may be too
late.

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:19.580
Thank you.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.390
[applause]

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:26.300
So I've got some time for questions now.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.750
You don't have to ask me questions about this.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.410
You can ask me questions about books and stuff.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:31.130
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I have a question.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:39.270
So one thing usually people don't talk about
is why we should not allow people to inspect

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:40.270
what we're doing.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:44.910
If you're not doing anything wrong, why do
you care?

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.780
I've only seen an argument to this once, when
people said, basically, it violates a fundamental

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:56.250
expectation of humans to be individuals rather
than part of a collective ant hive or ant

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:57.250
colony of some sort.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.520
Now I wonder if you could speak to that.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.520
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Yeah.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.170
I mean, there's-- I think that that argument
starts by presupposing that everything private

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.300
is secret, and everything secret is private.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.200
We say, "Oh, well, it's not a secret what
you're doing, so why do you need to keep it

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200
private?"

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.840
But I can make a pretty good guess about what
you do when you go to the toilet.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.680
I'm pretty sure I knew what your parents did
to get you here.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:21.600
But it takes a pretty special kind of person
to want to do that in public.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.840
There are behaviors, and not nefarious ones--
In fact, some of the most important ones,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.910
the ones that, you know, are the origin of
all life and the reason you don't explode

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:35.170
in a shower of poo, that we habitually do
in private, and that aren't the same when

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.170
you have to do them in public, particularly
if you're coerced to doing them in public.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:47.330
The modern concept of privacy is pretty new,
but there are elements of our privacy that

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.990
are quite old: the privacy of thought, the
privacy to make mistakes.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:54.920
I mean, remember this notion that if you want
to double your success rate, you triple your

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.040
failure rate.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.920
It's very hard if you have to make all your
mistakes in public.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.530
You may-- Does anyone here work on Blogger?

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:07.040
I mean, before Blogger was a really big deal,
when it was a little deal, it was running

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.450
on an NT box that Ev found somewhere.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:12.200
It went down all the time.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.620
And no one cared, because he wasn't in the
public eye.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:21.010
Now, you guys can't afford to experiment with
the Blogger backend the way Ev could.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.400
Ev could refactor his code altogether, take
it offline for two days, and then put it back

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.410
on again.

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:31.010
He was able to innovate really, really fast,
in a way that you guys can't, because you

00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:32.760
don't have privacy in what you do.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.780
What you're doing is public.

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:40.570
If you've ever watched a kid play, and play
in a way that's sort of pushing at their boundaries,

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:45.380
they do this thing where if they don't know
you're watching, they make a lot of mistakes,

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.990
and they just keep pushing through them.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:50.550
But if they catch you secretly watching them
while they make mistakes, they put the thing

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.430
away and they walk away from it.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.360
It just kills their play.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.290
As a father, it's the thing that breaks my
heart when I do it, because it's very tempting

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.780
to look over at your kids when they're doing
something awesome and intense.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.790
But then, you humiliate them and you embarrass
them.

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:12.720
So there's something about us that wants to
have vulnerable moments not take place in

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.040
public, that wants to choose the moment of
disclosure.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:21.170
I think that that's-- that doesn't change
just because we have Facebook, or just because

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.650
we can track user behavior with 1x1 pixel
gifs.

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:25.690
You know?

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:26.690
Yeah?

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.640
&gt;&gt;Male #2: You've published a lot under the
Creative Commons license.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.840
So I was curious, from the point of view of
someone who's incredibly cynical and just

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.020
wants to make a living writing things, would
you advise it?

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.300
Will it catch on?

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:43.210
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: So if you want to make a living
writing things, I would advise you to stop

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:48.110
trying, because [laughter] that's a bit like
saying, "I want to make a living buying lottery

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.770
tickets."

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:50.830
It's like--.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:54.120
That sounds like a great plan if you can find
the winning lottery tickets, but if you don't

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:59.640
have a plan B for earning a living, you have
the wrong career.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:04.710
Writing is a very, very high-risk entrepreneurial
venture that almost everybody who tries it

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:05.990
fails at.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:11.140
Some fraction of the people who try it succeed
using Creative Commons, and some fraction

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:15.010
succeed without using Creative Commons, but
they're rounding errors against all the people

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.650
who try to earn a living with writing.

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:22.330
So for me, the reason to use Creative Commons
is not just commercial, although I think in

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:29.240
my case, it enhances my commercial fortunes,
because people who get the book for free then

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.450
go on to buy the book.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.130
That may not be true of everyone.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:34.340
There isn't a kind of global theory about
this.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.010
But there's two other dimensions to it.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.720
The first one is moral, and then the second
one is artistic.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.270
The moral case is that I copy all day long,
you copy, everybody copies.

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:48.960
If it wasn't for mix-tapes, I would have been
a virgin until my mid twenties.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.390
You know.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:51.390
Copying is what we do.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:54.360
If I were 17 years old today, I would have
a giant hard drive and it would have a copy

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.060
of everything.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.410
So I--.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:05.110
To pretend that when I copy, it's like part
of a legitimate, artistic adventure that allows

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:09.240
you to assemble your influences and recall
them as you need them, but when you copy,

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.970
you're just a thief, that's just dumb, right?

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:17.100
And moreover, it leads to all these crazy
consequences, where we're talking about three

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.451
strikes rules in New Zealand, for example,
where they're saying if you-- I know that's

00:53:21.451 --> 00:53:25.310
an Australia shirt, but very close to Australia,
where they're saying--

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.410
&gt;&gt;Male #2: We don't think very much of the
Kiwis.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:28.410
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: I understand.

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.030
It's like Canadians and Americans.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:35.900
But they, you know, they're saying if you
are accused of three acts of copyright infringement,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:40.170
we take away your internet access and all
the stuff that comes with it, and that's partly

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.950
being driven by people who say, "Well, if
you copy my stuff, it hurts my fortune."

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:49.190
Being able to give my stuff away means that
I'm not part of the rubric for Draconian network

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.190
policy.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.030
But then there's a third dimension, which
is the artistic dimension.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.010
It's the 21st century, and if you're making
art that you don't intend to have copied by

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:02.060
people who like it, you're not making contemporary
art, because the realpolitik is if someone

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.200
likes it, they'll just copy it.

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.200
Right?

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.200
I mean, we put DRM on ebooks.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.200
This is crazy.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.800
It's like they've never heard of typists.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.100
[laughter] It's like there have-- It's like
they don't know that we live in the moment

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:16.600
with the largest number of skilled typists
in the entire history of the world, you know?

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.680
This is an amazing--.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.251
My grandmother was like a 75 word per minute
administrative assistant, and she was like

00:54:21.251 --> 00:54:22.630
a circus freak.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:28.550
Today, she's not even in the top quintile.

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:29.900
Everybody can type.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.910
If you're making art that you don't intend
to have copied, you're not making contemporary

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:33.910
art.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:34.910
That's cool.

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.660
I mean, if you want to be the blacksmith at
Pioneer Village or reenact the Civil War,

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:38.730
that's awesome.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.000
Go follow your weird.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.490
But I'm a science fiction writer, so I'm supposed
to make at least contemporary work, if not

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.490
futuristic work.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:46.980
It gives me great satisfaction to allow it
to be copied.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.220
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So, a question about the average
user.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:53.960
So if somebody is sitting out watching this
broadcast on YouTube, and they think, "I want

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.510
to be a part of the solution", it doesn't
feel like there's a great avenue for them

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:01.730
to express the need for digital freedom other
than disobedience.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.500
Do you have any suggestions as to what people
might do?

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:10.650
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Well, the first talk, the 28C3
talk which is on YouTube, ends with a pretty

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:13.990
good, compact call to action for people of
all stripes.

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:22.280
If you're a hacker, get involved in things
like Free Software Foundation and policy stuff

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.910
that the Free Software Foundation does, or
get involved with the Electronic Frontier

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:26.910
Foundation.

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:30.420
If you're a lawyer, join the Cooperating Attorneys
list for EFF and get involved in other groups

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.960
like FSF and so on.org, or Nets Politique.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.860
Bits of freedom all over the world: we have
them.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.340
If you're an artist, use Creative Commons.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.480
And so on.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.430
I actually think that there's a lot of venues.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:48.380
Today, we have, between Defective By Design
and Fight for the Future, who led the SOPA/PIPA

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.380
fight.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.990
We have so many different groups that are
doing really exciting things that need people

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:57.030
to do everything from send an email to their
congressman at the right moment to design

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:02.380
logos and packaging and write copy and put
the word out and blog and give talks to their

00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.380
school.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.280
If you're a student, you can join Students
for a Free Culture.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.280
That's all great.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.010
I think we don't have that answer for the
civil war thing yet.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.010
We don't.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.010
And we kind of—.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:16.560
And my point about the civil war is that we'll
get to the civil war pretty quickly after

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.450
we win the war.

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:23.200
We get to the thing where as soon as you give
owners total dominion over their computers,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.310
you immediately get to the moment where users
can't trivially change what's on their computers.

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:33.990
I would be really nice if, as we sit here
advocating for owners having total control

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:37.820
over their computers, that we start thinking
about when users should be able to change

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:38.820
that.

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:45.360
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So you gave some examples comparing
and contrasting physical devices versus electronic

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.490
goods, and devices that are used by many users
and may be only one user.

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:56.290
And you said, "Well, some of these policies,
there's analogies between physical and electronic

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.950
that you should use, and some of them don't
really make sense.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:59.950
There's a discord."

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:05.990
Are you saying that, overall, we should go
by case-by-case in order to examine: does

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.990
this make sense?

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.990
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: No.

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:09.830
I mean, I hope that's not what we end up having
to do.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:12.900
I mean, that was the point at the end and
the beginning.

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.340
I don't know how to solve this one.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:19.560
And it would suck if, basically, you solved
this with nested if-then loops.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:24.480
It would be really nice if we had a nice,
generalizable case that we could say, you

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.760
know, "If it's not a nuclear power plant,
anything goes"?

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.100
Or something else.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.100
Right?

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.310
I mean, if every single thing that is Turing
Complete has a different set of rules for

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:39.210
when users and owners get to control it, that's
going to be a really big rule book.

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.740
So I would love to have a better one.

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.250
I don't know what that is yet.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:47.380
Maybe, after I've given this talk for another
year or two, between all the feedback I get

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.300
from people like you, I'll be able to propose
a solution.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:53.210
&gt;&gt;Male #5: It was interesting that you talked
about having a user override mode where you

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:55.700
could change what the employer was doing and
come back.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.070
I don't know if you followed much of it, but
[beep] Chrome OS does that now.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:02.250
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Yeah, I just heard that at the
weekend that there's a user override.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.660
And it's funny, because the first email that
got me thinking about this was Vint Cerf saying,

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.090
"Why shouldn't Google be able to choose what
software runs on my Chromebook if they bought

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:10.090
it?"

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.090
&gt;&gt;Male #5: And we don't, and I work on that.

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:12.320
I'll be happy to talk to you about that.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:18.220
And for the rest of you guys, I'm about two
months away from having a way that you can

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.920
put your own keys on it, so you can sign your
own images and boot your own stuff.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.369
Right now, you have to turn the security off.

00:58:24.369 --> 00:58:27.550
But we're doing that, and I would love to
do more.

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:29.240
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: I think that's a really cool model.

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.240
I'm done.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.430
Of course, the really challenging thing is
going to be computers that don't have interfaces,

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.430
like your legs.

00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:39.380
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So this is a little tangential,
but we are reaching the point where a lot

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:44.230
of third parties can maintain public databases
of public information about you.

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:48.890
So, like the American Credit Report is one
of the original settlers.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:53.300
So is there any legal theory that would give
you rights over the database?

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.830
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Is there a legal theory that gives
you rights over that database?

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:59.360
I don't know, but I like the fact that you
said rights instead of property rights, because

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.380
I think that we have started-- We have the
best of intentions sometimes.

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:10.860
We created property rights and facts, or property-like
rights and facts, about you that don't make

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:11.860
any sense.

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.980
Like, you know, the Well, which is very old,
and now endangered.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.770
Salon just put it up for sale, this online
conferencing system.

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:21.380
It's motto is "Yoyow", "You own your own words."

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.140
And that sounds like a really cool idea, but
it has all these weird fraud things, like

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:30.630
if we're in a conversation and I quote something
you said, do you get to tell me to not quote

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.630
it?

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.450
I mean, this is a contract, not fair use.

00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:36.020
This is what our contract says.

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:41.690
And the European data norms are starting to
move towards ownership of your personal information.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.340
But what does it mean to own your phone number?

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.340
You know?

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.610
Does that mean that if your phone number happens
to contain the first seven digits of pi that

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:52.140
other people can be enjoined from writing
pi?

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.790
And it's funny because we do actually have
ways of expressing value about things that

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:58.880
aren't property that we may be able to bring
in here.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.230
We talked about interests a lot.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:06.100
My daughter is not my property, she's pretty
important to me.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:09.970
And if you kidnap her, the charge isn't theft.

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:14.770
But we can acknowledge that my daughter has
an interest in herself, that I have an interest

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:19.200
in her, that my wife has an interest in her,
that her grandparents have an interest in

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.310
her, that the state has an interest in her,
that her friends have an interest in her.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:25.650
That's what it means to be a person in a society.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.390
We need to start, I think, talking about information
that way.

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:32.270
It's crazy, I think, to talk about things
like phone numbers or your address.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.260
This is where I think, you know, even though
I'm a privacy advocate, I think the Germans

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.070
were crazy about saying you own the likeness
of the front of your house.

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:40.310
I mean, that's just dumb to me.

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:44.230
'Cause it means that, like, as you move through
time and space with prostheses that record

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:48.430
the world, you can't record your neighbor's
house.

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:53.000
You can't record your kid's first run down
the street on her bicycle without the training

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.600
wheels because she rides past your neighbor's
house and they own the likeness of their house.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600
Right?

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
That's just dumb.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600
We need to be able to express--.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.440
And property is a bad organizing metaphor
for a thing that a million people own.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440
Right?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:08.960
You end up with, like, shareholder corporations
or, you know, there's this whole Spider Robinson

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.720
aphorism when 700 people share an apple, no
one benefits, especially the apple.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:14.720
You know.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:21.350
[laughter] That's true of physical, rivalrous
property, but non-rivalrous information doesn't

01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:22.680
have that characteristic.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.410
We still may want to give exclusive access
or semi-exclusive access to certain parties.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:31.390
Like, the image of your colonoscopy may be
something between you and your doctor.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.150
But to call it your property is the wrong
thing.

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:36.450
It doesn't organize well that way.

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.680
I don't know what does, but I know what doesn't
work.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.580
&gt;&gt;Male #6: No, but the point I'm making is
that, let's say ten years from now, somebody

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.310
could run a background check on your without
your opting into it?

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:48.380
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: They can already do that.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.740
I mean, they already can.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Okay.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.990
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Yeah, I mean, it would be-- So
Lessig talks about four ways of organizing--

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.990
of regulation.

01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:00.400
He talks about law code markets and norms.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.480
So we don't have a lot of code to help people
protect their privacy.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.810
Like, when you fire up your laptop, it doesn't--
So here's an example.

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:15.330
If you had a browser that, every time you
turned it on, loaded the-- checked to see

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:23.670
whether it was being asked to load the Google
Analytics JavaScript, and suppressed it, but

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.460
implemented all the features, all the libraries
locally so that pages didn't break.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:37.590
That would be code out of the box that treated--
that defaulted to treating privacy as though

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.590
it's valuable.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:42.230
And so now, if Google wants to get your private
information from you, information about where

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:47.960
you are on the internet, they have to offer
something of value to you that is inextricably

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.030
linked, because that is extricably linked,
right?

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:53.140
You can-- We can, in fact, conceptually understand
how you divide it.

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:58.390
So, like, if my Android phone, when I installed
an app like my daughter's Connect the Dots

01:02:58.390 --> 01:03:02.910
app, it said, "In order to use this app, you
need to tell us where you are all the time."

01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:09.160
If it let me say, "Tell this programmer where
I am all the time, but make it up", then the

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.030
program would actually have to devise an offer
where where I am was actually a piece of using

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.030
it.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.680
So I use another Android app all the time
called Hailo, for hailing black cabs in London,

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.080
which are a pain in the ass to get when it's
raining and so on.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.109
And Hailo knows where I am all the time, and
so Hailo has an offer where if everybody else

01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:29.400
couldn't get my location trivially just by,
like, getting me to download a Connect the

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.780
Dots app for my kid, Hailo would be sitting
on a giant asset.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.500
And you'd have real privacy markets.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.359
Like right now, we have this idea that we
know what your privacy is worth, and it's

01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:42.000
worth nothing because you trade it for zero.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.730
But you don't have the option of not trading
it for zero.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.830
So you could imagine--.

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:50.900
One way that you could stop people from being
able to do background checks on you really

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.760
trivially is if all the devices that you have
didn't hemorrhage information about you all

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.300
the time, as though it had no worth.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.840
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Okay, change of gears to a fluffy,
lighthearted thought experiment.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Sure.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.990
&gt;&gt;[Male #8]: Since you mention the Norwegian
script kiddies, imagine the Marcus Yallow

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.260
Memorial Pentathlon.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.840
Which countries take gold, silver, bronze
there?

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.050
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Oh, wow.

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:16.109
I'd like to think-- I mean, without being
ideological about their governments and just

01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:22.619
thinking about their track records, I would
think that you'd get the four brick countries

01:04:22.619 --> 01:04:24.680
plus Israel, probably.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:29.050
Brazil, Russia, India, China, Israel.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.170
Without endorsing or condemning any of those
governments.

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:33.170
&gt;&gt;Male #8: All right.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.170
Thanks for coming.

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:38.550
It seems like you're looking for sort of an
overall rule for what people can and can't

01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.370
do with their devices.

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:43.830
But I'm afraid it's going to end up just a
whole pile of special cases, kinda the way

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:44.830
it is now.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:49.359
Like, if you look at your car, what hardware
and software you can do, some things are legal,

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:54.510
some things violate smog laws, some things
violate safety laws, some things will be charged

01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:58.130
with criminal negligence if something goes
wrong, some things you'll get sued if something

01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.130
goes wrong.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.450
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Are you saying that if you modify
the firmware, or if you modify the firmware

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:03.950
and then something bad happens?

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:08.790
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Well, you know, with the smog law,
just modifying the firmware, I believe, is

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:09.790
illegal.

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:10.790
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Is that right?

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:11.790
I didn't know that.

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:13.010
&gt;&gt;Male #8]: Well, I think in California.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:19.040
You know, there's other things you can do
that-- If I decide to reprogram my brake system

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.670
and I crash into something, I'm likely to
get either sued or go to jail.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:29.230
But other parts of the system, you know, it's
probably okay for me to redo-- if I want to

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:32.280
put in a new engine, but in new shock absorbers.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:36.580
So it's-- I think these issues apply to both
the hardware and the software and firmware.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.940
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: So, it makes a certain amount
of sense to me.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.800
I think you're describing after the fact,
largely, modulo this question about whether

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:48.490
changing the way your car is smogged gets
you in trouble or doesn't.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:51.520
I think, mostly, you're describing after the
fact stuff.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:57.720
So in the same way that if I program my nuclear
power plant so that it melts down, I'm held

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.100
liable for having written bad code.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:06.710
Or, if I program my software to find radio
so it turns into a spark app generator and

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:12.950
blows all the RF in my region, again, I have
done something bad and I'm punished for that,

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:15.690
but it's not against the law to write my own
software to find radio code.

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:21.600
You can check code in and out of GNU radio
on GitHub without breaking the law.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.230
If you use that code in a way that ends up
breaking something, that may be illegal.

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.380
And that's kinda what I'm talking about here.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:35.910
It may be that users take control of their
legs to run up to someone and kick them in

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:36.980
the face.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.510
And I don't think that-- I think that writing
code that lets you take over your legs is

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:41.510
good.

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:44.710
I think that, having taking over your legs,
to kick someone in the face is bad.

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.720
And I think that we can punish the one without
punishing the other.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.130
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Okay, that seems fair.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:51.130
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Yeah.

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:56.600
&gt;&gt;Male #9: You touched earlier on the concept
of an illegal number, which is something that

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.580
I've thought about a lot, because all information
can be a number.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.700
Which raises the question, which I think is
central to all of this, of where you draw

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.700
the line.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.700
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Sure.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.600
&gt;&gt;Male #9: And obviously, to anyone who has
studied any kind of mathematics, there is

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.300
no line in numbers.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.180
So the question is: why is there a line in
anything?

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.180
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Right.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.520
&gt;&gt;Male #9: In essence, why do you believe
that this problem is at all soluble?

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:24.610
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: [inhales] [laughter] Let me find
my illegal number here.

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.220
There we go.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.220
Yeah.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.500
That's a really good question.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.520
You're right.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.760
Everything can be encoded as a number.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.820
I mean, now we're getting into girdle and
incompleteness and whether numbers are special.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:43.730
&gt;&gt;Male #9: That was just an example, though,
of why it seems a priori that this is likely,

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:44.950
technically, not soluble.

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:46.450
So the question is: why?

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:49.540
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: So I think it's soluble in time
scales.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.330
It's not soluble in infinity.

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:56.470
So, for example, we may say that--.

01:07:56.470 --> 01:08:04.570
So today, we have a bunch of rules about locking
and unlocking that are largely governed by

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:11.430
the copyright office, because the relevant
law is the DMCA and anti circumvention rules.

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:15.790
And so you may have heard that in the triannual
review, it was made legal to unlock phones

01:08:15.790 --> 01:08:23.259
and tablets, iPhones and tablets, and also
to unlock phones so that they can switch carriers.

01:08:23.259 --> 01:08:25.409
That's a thing that works for now.

01:08:25.409 --> 01:08:32.120
It won't work against more robust bootlockers
and it doesn't help certain classes of users.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:36.719
But, I mean, I don't think we pass technology
laws that are supposed to last through the

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:37.719
ages.

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:41.909
I think we pass technology laws that are supposed
to last, we hope, through the half life of

01:08:41.909 --> 01:08:43.309
the technology.

01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:48.569
You're right that there will come a time when
the rainbow table of all numbers exists, and

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:50.650
all possible decodings for them exist.

01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:55.480
I mean, it may occupy all the hydrogen atoms
in several parallel universes to ours.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.440
But it's at least within the realm of contemplation.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.670
But that doesn't mean that between now and
then we should try not to have any rules about

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.249
how numbers are used.

01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:08.249
You know.

01:09:08.249 --> 01:09:17.700
I mean, you might say, "Well, the specifications
necessary to get your AR15 to go full auto

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:20.279
can be expressed as a series of numbers."

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.849
That's a bad example, because you don't suppress
the rule about the specification.

01:09:22.849 --> 01:09:25.819
But, like, the 3D meshes.

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:27.670
That currently exists as a 3D mesh.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:28.670
I think that was uploaded to Thingiverse.

01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:30.279
I think they've taken it down.

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.920
That converts AR15s from semi to full.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:40.299
I may not agree with regulating that, but
I wouldn't disagree with it on the grounds

01:09:40.299 --> 01:09:41.299
that it's impossible.

01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:42.299
Right?

01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:52.539
Like, that it's impossible to say-- telling
people-- giving people AR15 automatic modification

01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:57.900
kits can't be made to work, or shouldn't be
made to work, because those numbers might

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.650
also be poetry or something.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:04.480
Like, it just seems like, although that's
true, it's true in some sense that the law

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.880
can safely ignore for a while.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.210
Does that sound right?

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.210
It's hard.

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:14.320
&gt;&gt;Male #9: It's good enough that I don't want
to take up any more time following up.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.320
Thank you.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
&gt;&gt;Doctorow: Okay.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320
Thanks.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:17.322
