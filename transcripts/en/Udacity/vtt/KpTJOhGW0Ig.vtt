[Evans] The answer is the cost per bit for a hard drive

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is approximately 0.01 nanodollars per bit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Remember a nanodollar is a billionth of a dollar,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so this is a cent of a billionth of a dollar per bit.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The latency distance, though, is quite high.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's 2098 kilometers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So that means accessing data from the hard drive

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is like traveling between Munich and Moscow.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a pretty big difference between accessing data from the DRAM memory,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
which is only about 3 meters away, about what you can reach with your arms,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which is again very different from accessing data from the CPU,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is the distance between your thumb and your finger.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So when people write programs and they care about performance,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you really have to think about memory quite a bit.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You have to make sure that the data that you access frequently

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is stored in these close, fast-to-reach places,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
not in the hard drive, which is like traveling between Munich and Moscow

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to get to your data.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And no one is storing data in light bulbs.
