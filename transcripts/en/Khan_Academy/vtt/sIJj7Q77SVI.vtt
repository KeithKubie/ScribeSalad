00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.379
- [Narrator] In other videos,

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:03.678
we've done linear regressions by hand,

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:05.886
but we mentioned that most regressions

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:09.721
are actually done using some
type of computer or calculator.

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:11.231
And so what we're going
to do in this video,

00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:14.280
is look at an example of
the output that we might see

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.122
from a computer, and to
not be intimidated by it,

00:00:17.122 --> 00:00:19.194
and to see how it gives us

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:21.393
the equation for the regression line,

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:23.971
and some of the other data it gives us.

00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:27.114
So here it tells us,
Cheryl Dixon is interested

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:30.373
to see if students who
consume more caffeine

00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:33.215
tend to study more as well.

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:36.480
She randomly selects 20
students at her school,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.652
and records their caffeine
intake in milligrams

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:42.363
and the number of hours spent studying.

00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:47.156
A scatterplot of the data
showed a linear relationship.

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:49.809
This is a computer output
from a least-squares

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.796
regression analysis on the data.

00:00:52.796 --> 00:00:55.484
So we have these things
called the predictors,

00:00:55.484 --> 00:00:58.162
coefficient, and then we
have these other things,

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.292
standard error of coefficient, T and P,

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:03.116
and then all of these things down here,

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:04.918
how do we make sense of this

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.496
in order to come up with an equation

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.320
for our linear regression?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.046
So let's just get
straight on our variables.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:16.230
Let's just say that we say that Y

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.691
is the thing that we're trying to predict,

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.086
so this is the hours spent studying,

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:23.336
hours studying.

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:29.186
And then let's say X is

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:31.299
what we think explains the hours studying,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.908
or is one of the things that
explains the hours studying,

00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:37.202
and this is the amount
of caffeine ingested,

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:38.785
so this is caffeine

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:43.300
consumed in milligrams.

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.858
And so, our regression
line would have the form

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:52.170
Y hat, this tells us that
this is a linear regression,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.842
it's trying to estimate the
actual Y values for given Xs,

00:01:55.842 --> 00:01:58.759
is going to be equal to, MX plus B.

00:02:01.485 --> 00:02:04.262
Now how do we figure out what M and B are,

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:06.785
based on this computer output?

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:08.301
So when you look at this table here,

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.177
this first column says predictor,

00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:13.600
and it says constant, and it has caffeine.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.346
And so all this is saying is,

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:18.759
when you're trying to predict
the number of hours studying,

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.862
when you're trying to predict Y,

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:23.570
there's essentially two inputs there.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.141
There is the constant value,
and there is your variable,

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:30.822
in this case caffeine, that
you are using to predict

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.098
the amount that you study.

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:35.370
And so this tells you
the coefficients on each.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.699
The coefficient on a
constant is the constant.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:39.845
You could view this as

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.854
the coefficient on the
X to the zeroth term.

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:45.299
And so the coefficient on the constant,

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.082
that is the constant,

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.165
two point five four four.

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:54.140
And then, the coefficient on the caffeine,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.796
well, we just said that X
is the caffeine consumed,

00:02:57.796 --> 00:03:00.668
so this is that coefficient,

00:03:00.668 --> 00:03:02.668
zero point one six four.

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:05.710
So just like that, we actually have

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.195
the equation for the regression line,

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.729
that is why these computer
things are useful.

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.706
So, we can just write it out,

00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:14.123
Y hat is equal to

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.162
zero point one six four X plus

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:22.541
two point five four four,

00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.790
two point five four four.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.060
So that's the regression line,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.471
what is this other
information they give us?

00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:30.470
Well, I won't give you a
very satisfying answer,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.343
because all of this is actually

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:35.168
useful for inferential statistics.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:36.502
To think about things like,

00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:39.192
well, what is the probability
that this is chance

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:41.716
that we got something to fit this well?

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:45.133
So this right over here is the R squared,

00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:48.568
and if you wanted to
figure out the R from this,

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:50.863
you would just take the square root here,

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.941
we could say that R is going
to be equal to the square root

00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:57.862
of zero point six zero zero three two,

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:00.428
depending on how much precision you have.

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:02.014
But you might say, well how do we know if

00:04:02.014 --> 00:04:04.845
R is the positive square
root, or the negative

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.605
square root of that, R
can take on values between

00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:09.804
negative one and positive one.

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:12.647
And the answer is, you would
look at the slope here.

00:04:12.647 --> 00:04:14.902
We have a positive slope,
which tells us that

00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:16.516
R is going to be positive.

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:17.604
If we had a negative slope, then R,

00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:21.123
then we would take the
negative square root.

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:23.847
Now this right here is
the adjusted R squared,

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.928
and we really don't have
to worry about it too much

00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:28.626
when we're thinking about
just bivariate data,

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.188
we're talking about
caffeine and hours studying

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:32.370
in this case.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.313
If we started to have more variables

00:04:34.313 --> 00:04:36.933
that tried to explain the hours studying,

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:40.017
then we would care about
adjusted R squared,

00:04:40.017 --> 00:04:42.338
but we're not gonna do that just yet.

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:45.146
Last but not least, this S variable.

00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:47.876
This is the standard
deviation of the residuals,

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:49.774
which we study in other videos.

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:51.187
And why is that useful?

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:55.162
Well that's a measure of
how well the regression line

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.571
fits the data, it's a
measure of, we could say,

00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.071
the typical error.

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.747
So big takeaway, computers are useful,

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:04.915
they'll give you a lot of data,

00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:07.475
and the key thing is how
do you pick out the things

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:09.669
that you actually need, because
if you know how to do it,

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.304
it can be quite straightforward.
