just playing Easter bananas fan by by
 

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.250
just playing Easter bananas fan by by
herself that's that's random certainly

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.260
herself that's that's random certainly
 

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.290
herself that's that's random certainly
like you can't predict that something

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300
like you can't predict that something
 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.350
like you can't predict that something
like that's gonna happen

00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360
like that's gonna happen
 

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.630
like that's gonna happen
unless your weed is so powerful you see

unless your weed is so powerful you see
in the future you can actually predict

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:05.430
in the future you can actually predict
 

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.410
in the future you can actually predict
this yeah yeah I think the writers of

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420
this yeah yeah I think the writers of
 

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.170
this yeah yeah I think the writers of
this show could predict it like so but

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180
this show could predict it like so but
 

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.930
this show could predict it like so but
but but with it being so random like

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940
but but with it being so random like
 

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.040
but but with it being so random like
that it's like you know there is

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.050
that it's like you know there is
 

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.990
that it's like you know there is
technically context might be too heavy

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000
technically context might be too heavy
 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.819
technically context might be too heavy
of a word but it's not like there's no

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:22.829
of a word but it's not like there's no
 

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:24.920
of a word but it's not like there's no
context that that happened it's just

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:24.930
context that that happened it's just
 

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.019
context that that happened it's just
like okay I can envision that happening

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:27.029
like okay I can envision that happening
 

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:31.340
like okay I can envision that happening
in that instance it's not where is like

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.350
in that instance it's not where is like
 

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.100
in that instance it's not where is like
I

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:32.110
I
 

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.790
I
where is like something surreal they

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800
where is like something surreal they
 

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.069
where is like something surreal they
just wouldn't be fluid at all it would

00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079
just wouldn't be fluid at all it would
 

00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:39.480
just wouldn't be fluid at all it would
just be a string of stuff that doesn't

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:39.490
just be a string of stuff that doesn't
 

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.130
just be a string of stuff that doesn't
really tie in together and there's

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.140
really tie in together and there's
 

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.620
really tie in together and there's
really not like just loud noises loud

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:43.630
really not like just loud noises loud
 

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.130

else I could be a my bright and colorful

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.380
else I could be a my bright and colorful
 

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.050
else I could be a my bright and colorful
and stuff like that yeah is that the

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.060
and stuff like that yeah is that the
 

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.720
and stuff like that yeah is that the
hard thing with really like random out

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:57.730
hard thing with really like random out
 

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.670
hard thing with really like random out
there humor is there relies a lot on

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680
there humor is there relies a lot on
 

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.550
there humor is there relies a lot on
surprise and just being random and yeah

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560
surprise and just being random and yeah
 

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.590
surprise and just being random and yeah
when you get into formula that it it's

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600
when you get into formula that it it's
 

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.300
when you get into formula that it it's
hard to keep it going like even money

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:06.310
hard to keep it going like even money
 

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.490

know like in the show like after white

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920
know like in the show like after white
 

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.380
know like in the show like after white
you start to predict some of these jokes

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.390
you start to predict some of these jokes
 

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.060
you start to predict some of these jokes
like even though her all over again make

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.070
like even though her all over again make
 

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.259
like even though her all over again make
you think it's going this direction but

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:16.269
you think it's going this direction but
 

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:18.300
you think it's going this direction but
goes another you're like you cannot

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:18.310
goes another you're like you cannot
 

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.460
goes another you're like you cannot
predict what the hell is gonna happen we

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.470
predict what the hell is gonna happen we
 

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.199
predict what the hell is gonna happen we
have to stuff in these characters so I

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:22.209
have to stuff in these characters so I
 

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:24.480
have to stuff in these characters so I
mean and that is harder than it sounds
