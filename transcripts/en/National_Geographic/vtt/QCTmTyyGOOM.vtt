00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:02.867
So, Mr. Secretary.

00:00:02.867 --> 00:00:04.233
It's great to have you on.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.233
Good to be with you.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.500
I always thought
the military should--

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.300
once airplanes became important,
the Air Force was invented.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.433
But now we have space.

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:14.500
Why isn't there a space force?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.934
Oh, there is a space force.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.200
They're under the
Air Force, I guess.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.800
They're a space force
under the Air Force.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.934
But the Army and the Navy and
the intelligence community

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:27.600
also build, operate satellites.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.100
Many of them are as
big as a school bus.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.133
One called the Hubble
Space Telescope.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.934
Excellent.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.133
And cousins.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.500
Well, we have cousins of
that that point downward.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.333
Uh-huh.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.967
But they're really big.

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.567
I wave to them, actually,
every now and then

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:42.467
when I'm out on the street.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:43.266
Good for you.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.333
Good for you.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.200
We'll say hi back.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.100
OK.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.433
[pinging]

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:54.800
[laughter]

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Wow.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.433
Was that your satellite?

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.500
The one you're waving?
-Oops!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.300
LEIGHANN LORD: OK.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.667
Oops!

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.900
So I'd like to
wave to satellites

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.266
in case they're looking at me.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.734
Can I believe, for real, that
they can resolve the fingers

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.166
in my hand as I wave?

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.600
Not quite yet,
but you never know

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.233
where technology is heading.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.367
What do you mean,
you never know?

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.367
LEIGHANN LORD: That
was not an answer.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.567
You do work for the government.

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: A,
that was not an answer.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.233
B--

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:19.900
LEIGHANN LORD: This is a
government guy for real.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.467
--I may never know.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:21.734
But you know.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.266
But he may not be
able to tell you.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.066
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: OK.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.600
Or then he has to kill you.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.967
Do you have people for that?

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.100
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Because
you watch any Hollywood movie,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.233
the satellite is, you
know, first it's fuzzy.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:32.600
You say, enhance.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.800
Which we know is all BS.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.767
But enhance, enhance.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:35.734
Oh, that's not real?

00:01:35.734 --> 00:01:36.934
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: No.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:39.166
If you start with a photo
that's low resolution,

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.467
you can't just say
enhance and have

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.934
some algorithm show
detail where there

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:44.133
wasn't detail there before.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.233
Unless you invented
it to put it in there.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:47.467
That's all BS.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.867
The technology that the
United States military

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.233
and many other militaries
have is amazing

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.600
and can do amazing things.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.633
And you can get great resolution
from space looking at things

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.734
happening on the Earth.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.433
But you're going to
have to wait for a while

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.900
before contemporary
technology is going

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.233
to be able to pick that up.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:07.834
Plus, while I'm waving there
has to be a satellite right

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:08.867
there who's looking at me.

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:09.934
MICHAEL HOROWITZ: Right.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:11.633
And unless it's
geosynchronous satellite,

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:13.867
it's got to be passing
over for that to happen.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.266
Coverage is one of the
biggest issues with satellites.

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.700
In the movies, a satellite
is always available on demand

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.867
exactly when you need it
to look at the bad guy.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.333
In reality, it sometimes
can take some time.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.300
Sort of like in the movie "The
Martian" when they're trying

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.300
to get the satellites
in position

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.033
to see where Matt
Damon's character is.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.033
So that was intelligently
written in that regard?

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:32.834
Absolutely.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:33.834
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Right.
