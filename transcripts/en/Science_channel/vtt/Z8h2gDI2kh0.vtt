♪♪

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.334
Narrator: TESTING THE MYTH
THAT A CAR FULL OF AIR

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:09.000
FRESHENER COULD BE COMBUSTIBLE,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.601
ALLIE, JESSE, AND VALERIE
GOT A BIG SMALL-SCALE RESULT

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:17.767
USING A SPARK FOR IGNITION.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.167
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.901
Narrator: NOW THEY'VE MOVED ON
TO THE SECOND SCENARIO,

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:27.033
A SLOWLY LEAKING CAN
WITH A LIT CIGARETTE.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.300
Allie: EVEN BUSTER DOESN'T
LIKE CIGARETTES.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.701
Narrator: THEY'VE BEEN WATCHING
AND WAITING

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.467
FOR ALMOST TWO MINUTES

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:33.767
AND THAT'S LONG ENOUGH.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.767
-THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.
-MNH-MNH.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.901
BUT WE DO KNOW OUR AIR
FRESHENER IS FLAMMABLE.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.534
Narrator:
THE RATIO OF AIR TO FUEL

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:42.501
IS CRUCIAL FOR COMBUSTION.

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.267
WORKING ON THE PREMISE
THAT THEY DIDN'T LEAK

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:46.100
ENOUGH AIR FRESHENER,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.100
THIS TIME THEY START THE SPRAY
A FULL MINUTE BEFORE IGNITION.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.534
LIGHTING IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:56.767
[ OBJECT WHIRS ]

00:00:56.767 --> 00:00:58.033
Narrator:
THE LIGHTER IS WORKING,

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.701
BUT SO FAR NO BOOM.

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:02.567
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TOO WET
IN THERE.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.467
MAYBE IT'S TRYING TO COME ON,

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.767
BUT SINCE IT'S SO WET,
THEN IT'S NOT ABLE TO.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.767
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP TRYING
AND EVERY FIVE SECONDS

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:11.634
TRY IT AGAIN, JUST TO SEE
IF IT WILL DRY UP AND EXPLODE.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:13.434
-THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
-SOUNDS GOOD.

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:15.667
Narrator: BY LETTING THE SPRAY
DISPERSE AND SETTLE,

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:18.534
THEY'RE HOPING TO DIAL
IN THE PERFECT EXPLOSIVE RATIO

00:01:18.534 --> 00:01:20.634
OF FUEL TO AIR.

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:24.767
AND JUST A FEW CLICKS LATER...

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.701
-OH, MY GOD!
-OH, MY GOODNESS!

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.501
-GEEZ!
-WHOA!

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.100
THAT WAS OUT OF NOWHERE!

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.167
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.934
-OH, I FELT IT.
-OH.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:40.801
THAT WAS SO AWESOME.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.734
I WAS LITERALLY JUST ABOUT
TO SAY, "IT'S NOT WORKING."

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.234
Narrator:
IT'S A SAFE BET THAT'S EXACTLY

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.601
WHAT VALERIE WAS THINKING, TOO.

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:51.534
BOOM, THE TOP FLIES OFF,
AND VALERIE IS LIKE,

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:55.133
"OH, MY GOD, MY HEART."

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.634
I THINK IT SCARED HER.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:02:01.734
YOU WOULD STARE AT IT FOR, LIKE,
10 SECONDS, AND YOU'D LOOK AWAY,

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:05.934
AND AT THAT EXACT MOMENT,
IT WOULD EXPLODE.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.100
MORAL OF THE STORY?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.100
DON'T EVER TURN YOUR BACK
ON SCIENCE,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.400
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT'S AN EXPLOSION.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.767
-THAT'S SO PRETTY.
-OH, MY GOD.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.234
Jesse: LOOK AT THE LID.

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.234
OH, MY GOD, AND RIGHT
AT THAT MOMENT

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:19.367
WAS WHEN MY HEART DROPPED.
YEAH.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.100
RIGHT THERE WAS WHEN I HAD
A HEART ATTACK.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.467
WAH.
