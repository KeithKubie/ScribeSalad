00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.733
This is you, this is your family tree and

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.999
this is Your Family Tree Explained.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.366
You have parents, and your parents have

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.166
parents. These are your grandparents, who also

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.332
have parents - your great grandparents.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
Keep adding parents, keep adding "greats".

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.832
For every "G" in the name there is one

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.499
generation in between you and that person.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.833
Grandparents? One "G", one generational

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:22.599
in-betweener.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.433
Great, great, great grandparents?

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.666
Four G's, four in-betweeners.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.732
Continuing with the basics, you have siblings,

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.866
and so do your parents. These are your

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.832
aunts and uncles.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:34.199
Up the tree, you may call these people your

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500
great aunts and uncles, but your grandparent's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.333
siblings are also your grand aunts and uncles.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.066
Greats are reserved for the levels above grand.

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.066
Your great grandparents' siblings are your great

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.766
grandaunts and uncles.

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.066
Now down the tree, your siblings' children are

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.766
your nieces and nephews, collectively - niblings,

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.599
and you are their aunt or uncle.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.700
Their children are your grand nieces and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.300
nephews, and you are their grand aunt or uncle.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.266
We've gone up and we've gone down, and it's

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.699
time to go sideways.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.333
When you get married, you get everyone's

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.633
favorite in-laws. You are on the same level of

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.199
the family tree as your spouse's siblings.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
You are kind of "pseudo-sibling". All the new 
families'

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
relationsips to you are the same as to your 
spouse,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.833
but they get the in-law prefix [suffix].

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:17.633
It's pretty straightfoward except for one case:

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.766
Your spouses' siblings are your siblings-in-law

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.632
but are your siblings in-law spouses also your

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.899
siblings-in-law? It's a little unclear.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.600
Alright, enough with the in-laws, it's onto the 
reason

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.366
you're probably watching this video. Cousins?

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.666
Your aunt's and uncle's chidren are your 
cousins, 

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.266
but there are many kinds of cousins and to

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.599
better understand them we need to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.566
simplify this family tree, and think downward.

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.566
Here is you, your children and your 
grandchildren.

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.066
Your grandchildren are your first cousins to each 
other,

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.366
and their children, your great grandchildren,

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.066
are second cousins to each other, and so on.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.799
The cousin number is the same as the "G" rule:

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.733
it tells you how many in-betweeners until the 
connection

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:56.899
on the family tree.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.533
Fourth cousins? Four in-betweeners, and a 
shared

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.599
great, great, great, grandparent.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.666
According to the rule, your first cousins

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.899
and you connect at your grandparent.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.300
And second cousins share a great grandparent

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.866
connection.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.632
Just match the cousin number with the number

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.933
of G's, and you are all set. Simple!

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.533
Side note here: Continuing this rule in reverse,

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.866
means that siblings can technically call each

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.866
other 0th cousins, which they totally should,

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.499
and you are your own -1 cousin? Weird.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.800
(Side note end)

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
All done here now, nothing more to talk about ...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300
oh right, the once removed thing.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.966
You may have noticed these cousins are on the 
same level.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.499
Removed just describes how many generations 
apart people are.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000
For example: what's the family connection 
between these two?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.633
Start by taking the smaller cousin number

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:44.233
first cousins, and count the levels apart, once 
removed.

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:47.433
These are 1st cousins twice removed, thrice removed.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.066
And these are second cousins, once removed.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.132
Doing all this on our simplified drawing of your

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.266
descendence is a bit too easy as most family 
trees look

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:56.432
more like this.

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.933
The rules are still the same - first cousins, second cousins and the removed,

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.999
but it is a bit harder to tell quickly who exactly is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
your second cousin twice removed or your great grandaunts-in-law?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.700
To help, there is a chart you can download

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.866
which will both make it much easier to figure out

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.532
what grandnibling or cousin removed are to anyone at

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:16.266
the next family reunion and obviously, show

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.632
how cool you are.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.266
Now we're really done. Unless, you start thinking

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.766
about the math of all of these family members.

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.899
Just how many great, great, great, great granparents

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.733
do you have? 64?

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:31.899
And those ex-grandparents had kids giving you a whole lot of cousins.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.266
This chart happens to stop at 10th cousins

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:37.032
of which you have more than 2,000?

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.133
Which seems like way too many,

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.433
but these numbers both have big, possibly unsettling asterisks

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.466
attached to them, which we will talk about more

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:47.099
in Part 2: Family Genetics Explained.
