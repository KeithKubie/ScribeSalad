00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:01.878
- [Instructor] So my apologies.

00:00:01.878 --> 00:00:05.117
I just had a deviated
septum surgery yesterday.

00:00:05.117 --> 00:00:07.249
What we're going to
talk about in this video

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.249
is the notion of an ion.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.823
So before we talk about ions

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:18.132
we're just going to talk
about the idea of an element.

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:22.552
For example, if I have
carbon, carbon is an element.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.504
And let's say I have one atom of carbon.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.697
What do we know about
that one atom of carbon?

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:32.864
Well, by definition an atom
of carbon has six protons.

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:36.743
So it's going to have six protons.

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:38.438
And if it is neutral carbon

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.700
it is going to have the
same number of electrons.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.007
It is going to have six electrons

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:46.735
and that's what makes it neutral.

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:48.144
You have the six positive charges

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.561
and the six negative charges.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.526
Now you could have a carbon ion,

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.571
although they aren't that typical.

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.787
The way you get an ion
is if you don't have

00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:04.965
an equal amount of protons and electrons.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:08.132
So for example, if you had six protons

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.007
and five electrons what would that be?

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.725
Well, we still have six protons.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:21.590
And remember, protons are
what define what element

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.753
we're dealing with.

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:25.412
So we're still dealing with carbon,

00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:27.525
but now we have one more positive charge

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.986
than we have a negative charge.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:32.924
So this will be carbon, you
can write it with a one plus

00:01:32.924 --> 00:01:37.338
charge like that or you could
even write it like this.

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:41.057
And this you would just
view as a carbon atom.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:44.058
This you would now call an ion

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:46.356
because it has that net charge.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.652
It has a different number
of protons and electrons.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.533
What if you were to go
the other way around?

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.700
What if you were to have five protons,

00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.644
five protons and six electrons?

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:02.712
What would this be?

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:04.421
Well remember, protons define

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.067
what element you're dealing with,

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:11.376
so now if you look at what
element has five protons

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:13.419
we're dealing with boron.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.880
So this is going to be boron.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.037
Neutral boron would have five
protons and five electrons.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:22.696
But this one has one extra electron,

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:25.946
so it has one extra negative charge.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.985
So you can write it like this, one minus.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:31.717
Or you could just say it
has a negative charge.

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:34.967
So this is a boron ion right over here.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.113
As soon as you have an imbalance

00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:40.772
between protons and
electrons you no longer would

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:44.855
call it an atom, you would
call it an actual ion.

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:50.555
Now let's do an example
question dealing with this.

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.805
So our question tells us...

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.689
Our question ... our question tells us ...

00:03:04.967 --> 00:03:09.449
An atom of platinum has
a mass number of 195.

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.884
So let's just look up platinum
on our periodic table.

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:17.051
Platinum is sitting right
over here if you can see it.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.313
So an atom of platinum
has a mass number of 195.

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.796
And 195 looks pretty
close to that atomic mass

00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:27.526
we have there.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:29.943
And it contains 74 electrons.

00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:32.525
74 electrons.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.336
How many protons and
neutrons does it contain

00:03:35.336 --> 00:03:37.253
and what is its charge?

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.551
Alright, so let's think
about this a little bit.

00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.914
So we're dealing with platinum.

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:50.081
So by definition platinum has
78 protons, so we know that.

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:53.012
It has 78 protons.

00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:59.695
They're telling us it has 74 electrons.

00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:00.778
74 electrons.

00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:09.340
So just from that we see
that we have four more

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.257
protons than electrons.

00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:15.719
So you're going to have
a positive four charge.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.211
Four more of the positive thing

00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:19.538
than you have of the negative things.

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:23.705
So you could write this as
platinum with a plus four charge.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.845
This is a platinum ion,
a positive platinum ion.

00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:34.167
The general term when we're
talking about a positive ion,

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:36.584
we're talking about a cation.

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:39.415
That is a positive ion.

00:04:43.513 --> 00:04:47.095
Up there when we talked
about boron being negative,

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:49.845
a negative ion, that is an anion.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.627
This is just to get ourselves

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.294
used to some of the terminology.

00:04:56.923 --> 00:04:59.303
But we're not done answering the question.

00:04:59.303 --> 00:05:03.911
They say an atom of platinum
has a mass number of 195

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:06.257
and contains 74 electrons.

00:05:06.257 --> 00:05:09.760
How many protons and
neutrons does it contain

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.982
and what is its charge?

00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:12.731
We figured out its charge.

00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:14.732
We know the protons.

00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:17.678
By definition platinum has 78 protons.

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:20.743
But what about its neutrons?

00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:24.160
Well protons plus neutrons is going to be

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:30.185
equal to our mass number.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:33.246
It's going to be equal to 195.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.822
So we have 78 protons plus
I'll say N for neutrons

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.155
is equal to 195.

00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:44.440
Subtract 78 from both
sides and what do you get?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.773
The number of neutrons is equal to 1 ...

00:05:50.858 --> 00:05:54.191
let's see if I subtract 70 I'll get 125,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.487
minus eight I have 117 neutrons.

00:06:01.323 --> 00:06:03.990
So 117 neutrons, and we're done.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.435
But the big idea is, and we
say atom when we have the

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:14.047
same number of electrons and protons,

00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:16.625
that's when we are neutral.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.634
But as soon as we become non-neutral,

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:21.733
we have either more
electrons or more protons,

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:23.591
and this is true of an atom or a molecule,

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.563
we will then call it an ion.

00:06:26.563 --> 00:06:29.093
And if you wanna be a
little bit more specific,

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:32.039
a positive ion is called a cation

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.206
and a negative ion is called an anion.
