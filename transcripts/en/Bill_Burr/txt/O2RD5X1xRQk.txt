Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn his time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday. Uh, June 25th, 2018 what's going on? Oh, whoa. Yo, how you doing? How are you doing with the summer? The summer's here, right? We're in the, we're in the twenties of June. Somewhere along the lines. The first day of summer, you know, back in the day you used to know it, right? Because there wasn't as many channels and you would watch the local news and they'd bring it up. Today's the first day of summer. Tell us, Jack, what can people look forward to weather wise? While I'll tell you a bike. We got a low pressure system. [inaudible] don't inflate those fucking above ground pools. Yes. Yep. Um, and then they'd laugh for no reason. Your weekend's going to suck. Um, anyways, uh, it's gotta be a summertime, right? To fucking son's out. There you go right there.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Global warming. Um, what'd you do this weekend? I have a couple of cores. Like that's this generation's Budweiser. Right? Cause like they're crushing it. You know, Peyton Manning's fucked up. You notice the second Peyton manning fucking bought Budweiser. Now it's second place. You know, you didn't buy it. He bought into it the second he fucking got it. I bet he started pointing fingers at everybody. You know, we, we, we, we had some hops issues, right. And all of a sudden, nobody's getting along over there. And of course life now cause lights ahead. Right? I Bet Tom Brady invested in course light. Sorry. Why would I do this? I like Peyton manning now that he's retired. You know, I could look back and be like, you know what? That fellow was said quite a quarterback, but when they're playing against your team, you hate him. It's stupid. You know, you don't hate them.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       You just hate him. It's weird. Um, anyways, uh, the summers here I am back from vacay shawl and a, I'm getting ready this weekend. Oh, freckles. Shaking off the cobwebs. I'm going to be in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in Detroit, Michigan. Okay. Couple, uh, Joe, six pack towns. You know, where they put their pets on one leg at a thought. Uh, looking forward to that and a, so I'm going to be around La doing a bunch of spots, shaking off the dust among the elliptical work enough to Crosol panel shock a lot. I never had any of those, you know, my wife's into those fucking things. I, I like, I like the plain old boring white guy croissant. I don't need any flavor. Uh, anyways. Oh my God. Um, I don't want to talk about this early on, but I have to out of respect, uh, to sad, sad, sad, sad day.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Uh, the passing of the Great Vinnie Paul, um, drummer of obviously Pantera damage blend and hell yeah, good Lord. What a, what a loss. Can't even, can't even put it into words. And I was lucky enough to meet him. He was a big comedy fan and I remember the first time I met him, I was opening for the late Great Charlie Murphy. This is what happens when you get older. Like half of your stories is like pap the people in a moment like fucking dead. It's sucks. Um, but anyways, yeah, me, Charlie and don l or on tour. And we did the Addison Improv and, uh, I remember that that was one of those shows, one of the few times I ever, I went over without even realizing it. I always knew when I was going over, but I did like 40 minutes and I was supposed to like 25.

Speaker 1:          00:03:44       It just one of those stages where there was talking and I don't know what happened and, um, Charlie was cool with it, but I was embarrassed because I never do that shit. And it's a real country thing to do and it's something, you know, makes the headliners job more difficult because you ate up all of that extra time where an amount and all of that shit. So, uh, I do remember that from that weekend, but one of those shows, it wasn't the show when I went over, but, uh, I was standing after the show selling my cds. This is how long ago this was. It was right around, uh, was 2004. His brother was still alive. Um, and I was just standing there and I just looked up and he, and he was standing right there. Finney fucking Paul. And, you know, it wasn't like he was Vinnie Paul offstage.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       He just was Vinnie Paul. He had the fucking cowboy hat on, you know, this shirt with flames on it and shit, these crazy cowboy boots. And he was just standing there with a big smile on his face. And I was just like, oh, I mean this guy, he's like, guys saw on the cover of modern drummer. I couldn't believe it. I was like, I was like, Holy Shit, you fucking Vinny Foley. He just started laughing and you know, was super complimentary about the show and all that. And then he invited us out. Uh, he had his own club out there, gentleman's club, then we all went out there and he was nice enough, I actually sat with him in his club for like 45 minutes, like a total drum nerd and asked them all of these questions about, um, drum parts that he did. And, and, um, like, who were the guys that he listened to?

Speaker 1:          00:05:30       And, uh, and you know, I asked, I was like, you know, who do you think only one of the underrated drummers out there? And he was like, Oh, Alex van Halen, you know, and we went, went on and on about him. And it's kind of ironic because I really feel that Vinnie and Dimebag worthy, Eddie and Alex, I should say Alex and Eddie of their generation. And um, it just sucks man. He was just such a nice guy. And then after that, uh, he probably came out to two or three other shows and he always was, always was just the greatest, nicest guy. And, um, it's, I don't know, one of the reasons why I never got into double bass playing was because so many people, I just felt like once, like they all live, fills, everything was just the, their fucking feet in their hands stunk.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       And it didn't groove. It just was going nine zillion miles an hour. And, you know, it was impressive to look at, but it didn't, it didn't give me, the chills did make me want to do it. And he was a guy that changed that. And I, when I listened to him play, um, my younger brothers who were independent, Tara, I fucked up. I never saw him. Um, a member, one of my brothers went to go see him, was telling me how amazing the show is. But to be honest with you, like I, I just, you know, concerts with different, back then you could get fucked up at a concert and there was no cell phone footage, you just got fucked up and that was it. And there was like mosh pits. Like it just, it had changed and I got a little bit older. I was in my mid twenties, basically when they came around and I had already started doing standup and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:07:01       And um, you know, I remember going to a couple of, uh, you know, concerts like ACDC and shit and people were doing blow and it was, you know, it was a little fucking, you know, there was, you had to be like a certain level of fucked up just so you could stay relaxed so you could kind of navigate it, you know what I mean? You couldn't be sitting there looking fucking nervous. And I want, you know, and that was just like ACTC, which was always like a fun show. So like put this pan, Tara came in, it was a new level of aggression and anger. Certainly, you know, with Phil singing, I had never heard anything like that. And um, you know, just the way I was just, I just had this feeling my, I was, I was too afraid I was, I'm like fucking got to go down there, my fucking orange hair trying to grow it out and it just gets bigger and bigger and it looked like Bernie from room to 22 and there's a mosh pit, I'm going to get the Sh, you know how I always got over with people was making them laugh and the show is going to be too fucking loud.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       So if they would just kind of look at me the way I looked, I mean, I, I just felt like it wasn't going to go well.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       So I was a fan from afar and I really fucked up by not seeing those guys. And um, I remember when Vinny came down on the show, he said, hey, you know, I got this, this new, uh, this new band. I think it was. Yeah, it was, it was damaged plan. He said would play in New York. And he said, he goes, he goes, I'll hook you up. I said, really? He said, dude, he goes, you can fucking stand right behind me while I play the whole show. And of course, um, I had some fucking road gig when they came to town. I think Florentine went cause I remember talking to him about it and I was so fucking envious that he got to go and I didn't get to go. So I never saw him play live. But, um, you know, since doing that Dean del ratio or I had to learn how to play a butcher the song, but I tried to learn how to play that song by Molly crew livewire, which had the double bass, you know, basic thing in there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       Since then, I've just kinda gotten addicted to it. And I was listening to all of the pan terrorists stuff in a whole nother like level and um, you know, cowboys from Hell and fucking, um, um, broken and this love, just loving the, the drum parts are just so fucking perfect in all of those. And I was just talking, I was talking to my drum teacher literally that day of how great, um, Vinnie Paul was, um, with his work in that band and, and then like, fuck, it was so weird that night. Then all of a sudden I got that text, I couldn't fucking believe it. And I'm Super Sad. But, um, I don't know. Like the only good thing I could say is the got the mark that the guy left his, he, he won't be forgotten. And obviously his brother hasn't been. So anyways, that's my little, my little point of view on a truly one of the great artists that I ever heard of or got to, I don't know, listen to whatever hang out with or anything.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       So, so that sucks. And that's sad. So I don't know where the fuck to go from here. How do you, how do you turn it back to being funny? You know? Um, can I talk about the Germans playing the Swedes in the fucking, uh, do they play Sweden? Is that what it was at by the, the, the shirts for the same colors if flagged. So, um, I always fucked that up. Sweden and Switzerland because I'm an American and we never, they never taught us geography like that. And I remember one time I did a Gig in Sweden and I said, hey, it's great to be here in Switzerland. And they all laughed thinking I was joking and I honestly fucked it up and I just rolled with it. I was just like, Hey, just fucking with you. They both start with sw, but I did that the whole, thank you Cleveland. Whatever the fuck it was a spinal tap thing.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       I gotta get back there. I haven't done, um, what would you call that? Hitler's ranch up there. Norway, Sweden and Finland. All those places when he used to look across the was at the Baltic Sea. I don't know what the fuck it is. It's just looked across that water. They're on disaster is what people should look like. Yeah. Frolicking in the garage. Um, anyways, um, fellow swing, did you know, they, they, they were noncommittal a World War II ended up being a great fucking move. Not socially. It wasn't a good move, but it was a great fucking move financially. Cause just for the fact that they were still standing after World War II and never got bombed, you know, let the, let the, let the crowds fucking use their trades that go into Norway. Um, they stood there, they're fucking Applebee's was still open at the end of it, you know? So, I mean, I, if I guess you can learn something from Sweden when, when shit is hitting the fan and you need to stand up and make a stand, don't let other people do it. Just kind of sit back and see who wins it. Add a carry on.

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       Anyways, so the Swedes have play in Germany. All right. I'm mostly German, so I usually root for Germany.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       But whatever. Or I just root for an underdog like Iceland. I mean, I ain't fucking roof Iceland and Poland and shit like that. You know, I'm rooting for all any anybody other than the powerhouses that always seem to be in and I don't know shit about soccer, so this is, boy, it's going to make it funny. But anyway, so I'm watching this fucking game and this Swedish dude, right? Yeah. He's on a fucking break away. Once you going, God, he's all alone. Right. And then there's Jay guy in the German team, a black dude, which is hilarious. You know what I mean? I was always just sitting like, like how conflicted would Hitler be Germany one, but the lots of foods is that outsell. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       He comes down and goes to not only went to like trip the guy, he also cut, like just pushed him from behind and like a fucking referee and the WWE, somehow this guy didn't see it. I mean, I, I think it happened in the box, in the painted area, whatever the fuck they call it in that sport. And I think that that should've just been one of those fucking penalty kicks with a goalie. Just dives and guesses one side. Um, but anyways, the Swedes ended up going up one nothing than Germans tied it up. And then this guy, he did the old bend. It like Beckham. You did the old fucking, uh, around about there. I don't know how to talk about the sport. Uh, but I gotta tell you something. I actually, I love making fun of soccer, but I have to watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       No, didn't make fun of it. And now having watched it, I'm actually, I kind of love it now and I kind of understand the beauty of the game. Finally. I'm starting to get it. And it is really cool that it is so hard to score that when it happens that people absolutely lose their fucking minds. So I am on board. I'm going to continue to make fun of it. I had it on in the background and you know, I had like fucking two weeks a male here that I was going through and um, and I, the amount of times that I just kept looking over at the TV because he knows he'd be like,

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       I already fucking, yeah. Oh, oh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       he's going to be shit. So I was sitting at the table going like, oh my God, hey, something almost happened. That's what it just seemed like. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       But it really is a great game. Uh, GI bill. Yeah. You really, uh, you know, you, the rest of the world is right, Bill. And you might be wrong on this one. Um, but I missed it today. A good friend of mine wrote in a Protean sent me a text and I'm in podcast mode. She sent me a text message and asked me if I had saw the, um, England played today. I guess they played a great game. And I heard Mexico had a pretty scrappy game with the Koreans. I heard it was getting a little nasty. They're like, the Koreans would desperate. Like, we don't give a fuck. You know, we can't score unless we have the ball. And uh, you know, I guess Mexico's fast. That's what I know. And I promise you this week I'm going to neglect all my responsibilities and I'm going to try to watch some of this shit cause uh, it is, it is fun. Go once every four years, the entire world gets together to play for an actual world championship is pretty, that's pretty sick. You know, I just wish I could use their hands. You just see that one Connie fucking jumped over the guy and accidentally kicked him in the face. I mean that's gotta be like,

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       kicking a guy on the ground in the face, in the realm of like losing your man card forever. Like who fucked, who does that?

Speaker 3:          00:16:00       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       With your shoes on, Alicia could be barefoot, so maybe make you foot staying a little bit. Um, I would be so disappointed if I had a fucking son and he ended up playing soccer. First of all, I'd be happy for his brain, but you know, if that's what he did, you're going to frolic down the field and jump in the air like some baby deer and then kick somebody in the face. Um, no, only the guy does. He takes out a yellow card to hit the way they take it out and the guy just stands up in front of the guy, the stupid thing up in the air, like he's bidding on a fucking Shelby. Um, anyways, congratulations to anybody who won a, I got to get into it. Sorry. I did watch the, uh, the F one. Finally I was in town. I got to watch her watch the French GP.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Congratulations to Lewis Hamilton. Max for stabbing was fucking hilarious in the press conference afterwards. Uh, cause federal slammed into botox back. She's going, you know, I think he needs, you guys should tell him he needs to adjust his style because they would given Max Shit, you know, beginning of the year, I forget. He took out his own teeth, took out a, what's his face there? Um, Daniel Ricardo and they gave them all this shit. This does, he need to adjust his style. All these fucking assholes who don't drive for a living. So he was trashing all of them going, you should tell Vettel. Yeah, you should tell him he needs to adjust his style and then he shouldn't adjusted at all the way I didn't adjust my style and now here I sit three races in a row or whatever on the fucking podium. You fucking cunts Kimmy regulated. They kept bringing up the, this is his 25th to 26 podium without wedding or race.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       It's like this cause fucking Lewis Hamilton went because Louis had was something my kids sleeping. It's cause fucking Lewis Hamilton winds every God damn week. Okay. That's like giving somebody shit. Who played when Michael Jordan was at the height, his powers. He never got a ring. Nobody got a ring. You know, I've got to ring Elijah. One would fucking, Jordan was playing basketball and then when he was a little out of shape the next year, other than that, everybody got shut the fuck down. All right. That's what happens. So what, what, what needs to happen is the next, uh, the next street great driver has to come around. And also for one of my, what I little know about this sport is they got fucking get with either Mercedes of Ferrari, basically Mercedes, it seems to have the fastest car out there. Cause I think, what's this? I think Daniel Ricardo's gonna fucking, he's going to jump somewhere, right?

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       That's what they said. Um, by like both those drives. Hey and I'll put the yanks. How'd the Americans will be in like six to seventh? We've got some points and our gray cars are overcast cars. Um, what else did I do here? Oh, I get back on my fucking diet. This has been tough. It's been tough to get back on the Diet. I felt the cakes I fucking eat over in France, you know, had a couple of slip ups. But at back to the keen wa I'm hitting the elliptical. Oh God. The first two minutes of getting on the elliptical at my age, Jesus Christ. After that I just kind of go numb and then it's fine. I listen to my fucking songs and then it's over. But, um, I finally got the shoulder thing B and uh, I have, I think I have to join a gym though because in order to rehab my shoulder where I can do pull ups again, I got to do those, those fucking lat pull downs with like 20 pounds and then 30 and work my way up to my body weight and then I can attempt to do like a pull up because what I did last time when I rehabbed it was I then got these like those help or bands, you know, that you stand on and make the pull up easier.

Speaker 1:          00:19:39       But I was still, you know, trying to pull up, you know, 9,100 pounds with the weight and I fucking Jack my shoulder against, so I get to do what I don't want to do. I've got to go join a fucking gym, so I got to find a local gym, not a fucking, uh, a chain one. Cause those are the ones that they get your credit card and then you can't fucking get out of it. Ever tell you that Tamar went to Bally's. I joined Bally's and there was like trying to fucking lead AOL. He just couldn't do it. They go, okay, send in a $100 cancellation fee. And then I sent it in and then they go, oh yeah, yeah. But there's another, there's another gym within like a five mile radius. So you can't cancel like, oh, and I was to put the fucking, you just, you just took $100 from me.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       I should have sued the fucking shit out of him. And I, and I didn't. So I just didn't pay him. I just, you know, I did, I cancelled the credit card. That was the only way up. And it was, it was quiet for months. I didn't hear from anybody. And then all of a sudden this collection agency called me up. He was like, yeah, and can I use William Bernie here, please. [inaudible] Mike this, hey. They're like, Hey, this is showing show from the show and show collection agency. Uh, we bought your debt from Bally's total fitness and would like to discuss it with you. And I just just like, well, I don't know what the hell you did that for. You know, I didn't pay them. What, what the hell, but why would I pay you? I don't even know you,

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       this is your business. You actually earn a living doing this shit, buying debt that other people can't fucking collect. And then, so she was like, you know, giving me Shit, telling me I had to click. I'm not doing it. You know, I go, I go, I have perfect credit. I've paid everything. Okay. I really don't think that someday in the future when I go to buy a house, they're going to be like, you know what? We really want to let you know, give you a couple of hundred thousand dollars a loan here, but you owe $300 to a gym. And she's like, oh my God. You know, we just had a client who just called us up and said, please, please, please, I have to pay off. You know, this $400 that I owe you because I'm trying to buy a house and they won't let me. And I was like, wow. I go, that's incredible. That's almost the exact same scenario that I just presented to you. It's almost like you made it up. Right. And then she got fucking mad at me and then I just started hitting on her and she started saying it was harassment and I just gay. How old are you? You know, you live around here, you know, you got a boyfriend right thing. And she, she ended up page. She got so mad, she hung up on me. You know, I'll probably get me to get over that.

Speaker 4:          00:22:22       And ever since then I've been afraid of the phone. Every tiny rings when shake my cell phone's always on styling.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       Um, anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       what do we got 22 minutes in here? Is it time to fucking say? And, and you know what I gotta admit, they just kept harassing me, harassing me. I just got sick of it. It was only 300 bucks, so I just fucking paid him.

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       I shouldn't have, there's a couple people that I shouldn't have paid and I did, but I just, I didn't like the, uh, the stress, you know, I couldn't put it into perspective and I just got sick of them calling me and I, you know, I had fun with them. Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       Hitting on them or are saying that I'd gotten into some horrible accident. That was another big one that I just said. I don't know how many times I have to tell you I lost my leg in a car accident. What kind of Pete went? Oh my God, sir. I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, are you, this is like the third time. I'm literally sitting here right now with my stump elevated so I don't bleed out because the sutures have come loose again and here you are harassing. This is what you do. And then they would, you know, it was that thing. Um, and I just ran out of ways to have fun with them.

Speaker 2:          00:23:39       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       and then I, I think I just finally fucking paid him. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       Yeah, I've done that a couple of times. I gotta fucking landlord that stole from my apartment or manage your stuff. My pubs on the road and I came back and uh, was on the road for three weeks. I was on the road for so long when I came back, like most of the water had evaporated on the toilet and they had this check the smoke alarm. So legally they could go into my apartment when I wasn't there without my consent because if there was a fire it could affect the other units. That's what they said. And uh, all of a sudden I noticed there was a camera missing. They picked through my cds was a hip hop fan. And um, so I went down and I talked to the guy about it thinking that the manager was going to be like, oh my God sir, we got to get to the bottom of this.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Agent says, I don't appreciate you coming down to exceed you accusing me. And he started saying all this shit, I have the power. He kept saying I have the power. So it was like, oh yeah, you got the power. I buddy. And I just stood outside the office in anytime anybody new came. I stood out to you for two hours. I was like, yeah, don't run from these people. They, uh, they stole from my apartment and all that. That's just like, dude, I'm a comedian. I can do this all day. I will be down here every single fucking day. And it was bullshit because the next day I went on the road and I just, I just didn't have it in me and um, I should have get a, hey, come on in here. The lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh, we will know. Come here. Okay. What's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       No, I was just talking to them, Bob collection agencies and all of that type of stuff and all the crap I've gone through. Um, I haven't had a lot of that stuff, but you know, David's, I that I, that time that woman called me up, they know, knows bally total fitness and they, and I just started hitting on her and she got mad at me, said it was harassment. I ended up, I ended up getting her to hang out those up on me. There was like the highlight. What's the matter with you? I as Amazon, they might teeth. Oh, you do?

Yesterday I went to a music festival. All right. I went to go see the pretenders when I was in England. Um, the great Chrissy hine came down with some of her friends, some of the band members and stuff that came down to my show. That's the second time she's come to one of my shows over there. So I was like, next time you come to the u s I'm going to your show. You got me. I'm going and she said, cool, guess what? I'm going to be there a few days after he come back.

Speaker 1:          00:38:20       So I was like, all right, done, done deal. So I figured they're going to be playing like some theater or some shit out here. You know, I'm an old band. I'll sit down in his seat, get myself assessed Barilla. That'd be once in a while, stand up and wave my fist and feel like I've contributed as an audience member. But now they were doing a music festival and I get the email from her manager and there's a map and it's to the rose bowl. I'm like, Holy Shit. Who the fuck is on this bill? And it was, it was Neil Young, Jack White, the pretenders, the smiths, and a bunch of other people that I'm sure I missed in that will fucking amazing, right? So I'm like, wow, this is going to be, I never saw a concert at uh, at the fucking Rosebowl. This is going to be amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       So, you know, I walk in there, I walked right where it's, you know, the Rosebowl logo. I'm having all of these flashbacks of how many times have been they're hammered. Going to the rose bowl game kind of struck me as funny to be walking the golf course. It's a big golf course outside the stadium, by the way. I'm finally doing it sober. So I'm walking in there and the first thing I try to go into the main entrance into the, uh, the Rose Bowl stadium. They're like, Nah, you gotta go around, you've got to go around. And I'm like, well of course she got to go around. They always make you go the longest fucking possible way. Why do I gotta go around? Why don't fuck do I gotta do that? You fucking assholes. And then I go in there and then we got to make a left turn and then a, right now I'm going to cut across the bridge, the stadiums right fucking there and I go to go cross bitch guns. Sorry sir. This is one way. It's a, it's one way for walking.

Speaker 1:          00:39:57       Are you worried there's going to be a head on collision with the fuck do I have to judge guy? You've got to go up there right now, I'm losing my shit. And then I'm looking around, there's all these tents and all this shit and all of a sudden he finally fucking dawns on me that the concert is not in the rose bowl. It's all over this giant golf course. So the whole time I'm trying to go in the stadium, there's nothing going on in the stadium fucking moron. Right. And uh, and also I'm trying to keep my cool because somebody told me the other day said like, dude, you do not handle stress well. And that of course hurt my ego. I'm like, what are you talking about? I don't handle stress. Well, I'm a standup comedian. I've performed at Madison Square Garden. I dealt with doing five minutes of stand up on, on the Dave Letterman show when it was like 30 below with the air conditioner.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       Okay. One of the most intimidating things ever. And I was able to set aside that fucking stress and get through it. And uh, then the person's like, all right, all right, Geez. You know, just saying, you know, and then I realized it's like, you know, thinking about it the next day actually snapping again over something fucking stupid. That of course, five minutes later I figured out, probably three minutes later I actually realized that this person was right. That I, it's not, I don't handle inconvenience. Well, and then I turn it into like, what's going on in Hawaii right now with the lava pouring out and all this shit. So

Speaker 1:          00:41:22       I don't know. I've done this so many times. The last couple of days, you know, except for the festival when they, I was doing well with the stress until they told me the bridge where people were walking was one way. You know, I just all right. I mean if I even taught, say that one more time you guys, I'm going to lose my shit again. So anyways, I drove in traffic yesterday. I was completely relaxed, but I've done this a million fucking times. 1 million times is somebody says something to me about it. It makes me want to change. And then for two, three days I'm okay. And then gradually I just go back to the way I was, you know, flipping the fuck out. So, uh, I think I want to start talking about it on the podcast the way I do with my booze and cause that keeps my booze in and check to tell you guys if I'm on the wagon, I'm off or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       And then you guys give me shit, a Billy booze bag, a Billy fucking fat tits and all that Shit. It makes me, all right, fuck these people. I'm going back to crushing waters. Um, so anyways, I'm s I finally, I figured out that this festival is, uh, outside and now, you know, I don't know where the fuck I'm going and the pretenders are going to be on. They were on in the afternoon, five 25. Right. Right at dusk or should've been dusk. Different time of year would have been dusk. Right. And, um, I was looking like, what the fuck do I do here? I've got to get some booze. Right? So, you know, they're doing these little fucking, you know, they're not pulling home port. So I got like two whiskeys and I'm walking around one of my stupid Little Cup, right. And I see this fucking guy even older than me.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       He must've been like 63. It's actually still in pretty good shape. But he had the long gray hair. He had his shirt off, you know, just that guys been going to concerts forever, you know, and the pretenders start up and I'm trying to find where the uh, you know, the best place where I can watch it. And he starts doing like that, you know, that like that, that fucking hippie surfer, spiritual white guy dancing. It was a touch a Tai Chi in there, you know, he's doing that fucking dance and you know, it's the same dance he does to all music. I don't even know what it is. And they always have like this look on their face. When you look in this smiling, they always look at you like they have life figured out. Like they know what, what makes they like, hey man, like, you know, they going to say all this spiritual bullshit to you that you could find on the side of a fucking Dixie Cup.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       You know? Um, then whoever that guy is, I want to thank you. I fucking was laughing my ass off. Uh, just a faggy had his shirt off. I got to sit. He was still doing the, I got him, he was still doing the pushups so he didn't have the man boobs. But still it's like, come on man, these young people here, they don't want to see that cover yourself up. This whole fucking pride in your age and everything, you know, or how you look is all well and good, but you know, you know what it's Kinda disappeared is common fucking courtesy for your fellow man. Good Lord. You know, I just, it just blows my mind. It really doesn't. It doesn't. Cause you know what? I think that guy was a baby boomer, you know, and there's never, you know, you know, right before the baby boomers, sorry, you gotta plug my headphones back in right before the baby boomers was the greatest generation according to Tom Broka, they're the greatest generation.

Speaker 1:          00:44:55       Like I think the baby boomers in like the most selfish and like maybe cause there's so many of them that they had such an influence on the culture and they think every fucking thing that happened during their time was just so God damn important. They're just, I dunno, I think, and I think that there were just so up their own ass about themselves that now that they're old and all wrinkly, they just can't, they can't, they just can't let it go. Can't let it go. You know? I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm fighting aging by trying to work out and stay in shape and eat right and all that type of stuff. But yeah, I stay covered up.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       I have empathy for people in their twenties. They don't want to see it. So anyways, um, I go by the spiritual dancing guy and I worked my way up as close to the stage as I possibly can and I have to tell you something, man, have Chrissy hine and the paternity is fucking murdered. She sounded like she once again, two weeks in a row. I've seen great concerts. She sounded is great as the albums that I grew up listening to. And um, the song she opened with was on her, her new album. It was just about being a loner and liking not being in a relationship and shit. And uh, the lyrics are hilarious and I'm almost a little ashamed that like how much I relate to the song. I told her afterwards, I was like, I fucking love that song.

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:27       Um, but they just fucking murdered and she's such a Badass total rock star, like the real deal paid her dues, all that shit. You just see all of that when you watch your performance was tremendous and she gets off stage and then next up was Jack White. Jack fucking white. Right. I get to see him come out with this new lineup. The new sound that he has. He was fucking unbelievable day. You know, there's another guy, if you go see him, it's like, when have you ever seen that guy even remotely take a show of like half a second off during the show? Forget about a show. That guy never is the antithesis of phoning it in. Whenever I see that guy perform live, I always get inspired as a comedian. Like I could be working a little harder.

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       I can be trying to give people a better show here. So, um, his set ended and um, I walked over to go see the smiths who I remember my, one of my brothers listened to them. Everybody I knew listen to better music than I listened to in the 80s. I just was listening to like, I mean I listened to some good shit, but I was listening to a lot of fucking hair metal, you know, which is why I missed out on Pantera and fucking all those bands that came out like I was, I was, I was too far the other direction, like a role who's has it stored and all this. I was like, Pauly Paul Shad, right? I'm just like, what the fuck is this? This is, you know, I'm as cynical as the next guy, but Jesus Christ, that's another thing. I started listening to that Iowa album that slipped not shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:08       And like I always liked the, uh, the heretic day. People leave. We'll shit. I was, it was kind of funny. Um, but I never like, I don't know, it was just too much going on. And now I'm listening to a fucking 20 years after it came out going like, this fucking album is unbelievable. Um, but I mean, have, you know, there's only so much fucking music he can lead. You gonna miss something, right? I got to figure out myself on some level. So anyways, uh, I went over and I saw the smiths and I remember that one, that one song that crossed over that even like a fucking mainstream Charlie like me heard where it was a, that stopped the med Zuno Rab, uh, that stuff. It's up to your future, right? Anyways, I watched those guys that band fucking murdered and did the impossible. I felt it had like 10,000 white people all dancing for their entire fucking set. It was ridiculous. Um, how hard they killed. And then they ended their stair set. Such a cool way they had this crowd do, was sing along as the band was started playing a little more quiet, a little more quiet, a little more quiet. And the lead singer was like roasting people in the crowd go, great job, great job. You don't sound like good, you sound like you've got bronchitis.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       And everybody's laughing. And then the band just sorta, just gradually stopped playing and the crowd one more time sang, uh, or does it the chorus. And then they said, thanks a lot. Good night. It was so fucking cool. And um, and then Neil young starts playing. I got to walk across the golf course again and my back was fucking killing me and I was jet lagged and all of that shit. And I just, I hate to say this, I've never seen Neil young and concert. I just, I couldn't make it, you know, and I had to get home, you know, I got a kids getting up and shit and it's just like, I don't want to fuck it. See Neil young standing outside with my backbone, fucking

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       You know, talking to me next to some fucking 60 year old guy doing his tight. She fucking, hey man, dance. I want to see this guy in a theater. So I stood there and I watched him play one song. Um, so I could say, or at least most of the first songs, he didn't even sing. It was just like him playing guitar and Shit. I think his experience was like, all right, I got to get all those people that were just over at the Smith's time to come over. I'm sure people's feet hurt, their backs hurt. I mean, he's probably doing me a favor, but I just, you know, I dunno. I just said to my friends, I was like, guys, I gotta, I gotta go home. I can't, um, and I ubered here and it's just going to be a thousand fucking people too. And I just know how I'm wired.

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       I have to find that one way bridge that's going to allow me to get the fuck outta here. And I actually left, um, during one of my favorite singers of all time during his fucking set. Um, but anyways, it's a great show and all that. If you're younger, definitely check it out. If you're older, definitely stretch, you know, try to keep your shirt on. Um, I saw these two people on my God, these two fucking whales, these two fed people, like one of those fat couples and they were just asleep on their picnic blanket. Like both in like the spooning position, but faced opposite. It was like a fat Yang Yang.

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       They would just lay in there. You know what they look like, you know, like at the zoo when they tranquilize like, uh, one of those big cats, one of those predators. And then it's just like, all right, now that we knocked it out, we need to bring a fucking machine over here to pick this thing up. It weighs like 600 fucking pounds. Um, and I don't know. They, they were oddly adorable, like goes way like it must be fun. You know what I mean? Like you like those commercials come out and you see like dominoes or like Papa Ginos we'll have like a fucking some deal, like get two pizzas for seven bucks and if you get that we'll throw in the fucking chocolate chip cookie pie with the whip cream and ice cream. Right. And I always make fun of that Shit and I always make fun of it because this a big part of me that just wants to order that it take the ride, you know, have the salt fucking take me down to the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       Right. And that thought is, I think I'm going to fucking, you know, sink into the rug like that dude and trainspotting. Then he started eating the fucking cookie pie and you start coming back like Hulk Hogan. You know when he, when they went to drop his hand that last time and it didn't go down and all of a sudden you eat the cookie thing and you start shaking your head, you start strutting around. Right? But you don't, you don't. And they get, they get to live that life. They get to sit there like I bet they get one of those, you know those, you know those big fucking couches that on either side there's the recliner but it's still like a sofa. I bet they got one of those, right. And then in the middle of it, the thing comes down. Remember that it was basically, it was a fat fuck couch.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       They used to make this thing before, like the biggest loser and everything came out. It was like catering for people who were fat fucks or were, their goal in life was to become a fat fuck because on either side of this big couch like you, you could pull a lever and your feet could go up and then in the middle of this thing would come down. There's a place for you drinks and like a fucking pizza and you just sit there with you, with your girlfriend, you know, watching the TV with your feet up, get the AC crank and just destroy, like just destroying the fucking planet in your absolute like Utopia. I mean, I don't know if you guys believe in an afterlife and which I've thought about, but a lot when Vinnie past, you know, there was all that talk about, now he's reunited, reunited with his brother.

Speaker 1:          00:54:16       And I was definitely thinking, you know, I really hope that that happens, you know? Um, so let's say that it does. Okay. If you're a fat couple and you have one of those couches and you're watching one of your favorite shows on Netflix or Hulu, whatever the fuck you do, and you sitting there with your feet reclined eating a pizza and he got that cookie fucking pizza thing coming next, drinking your favorite drink, it's just like, what could the afterlife offer you that's going to be any better than that if you truly love one another. You know, when you got the AC going, you know, you've got your toes out. I mean, I dunno, I think I'm selling a lifestyle right now here. I think it was selling some couches. Um, anyways, but I had a great time and uh, if you get a chance, you know, like I said, definitely check out that festival.

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       And I feel really bad that I had to leave to. I left during Neil Young. The fuck is wrong with me. I have to, I have to fix that in the future by seeing him.

By now, I'm sure that you heard that Vinnie Paul passed away last Friday. Uh, much like you talked about Malcolm Young after his death. I feel like Vinny was another one who just lived an amazing life. One of the great drummers to ever get behind the kid. I got to tell you, like all everything that I saw on Twitter from all these big time rockstars, it over and over and over again.

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       Other than stating the obvious what a monster, amazing drummer he was. Everybody just talks about what a, what a nice guy he was. Um, anyways, he said I was too young and Penn. Tara was leaving their mark on the metal scene through the 90s, so I never got to see pat terra played live before they disbanded. However, I did get to see Vinny play with hell yeah, back in the day, back in 2016 at, uh, Rockville festival in Jacksonville, Florida. He was quite simply incredible. Oh, this is a cool story. I read this before, um, the podcast, something I never do, but I saw it said, Vinnie. Paul said I wanted to read it. I said, I remember being pretty close to the front of the stage and Vinnie was the first band member to come up before the show started. When he stood up behind the drum kit, he had this smile on his face.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       Like he was just really happy to be there. He twirled his drum stick at the whole crowd. A crowd saluted by putting his fist in the air and then the madness begin. But for most of the show, I couldn't take my eyes off of him because of how good he was. Oh, that's awesome. And even though he was that good, the biggest memory I have of him was that he was smiling the whole show. Like he just loved playing and see, seeing people enjoy themselves as much as he was. He will be missed by more. You will be missed by more than we know. I don't know if that sentence makes sense. Um, if you remember, please crank a pan terrorists song as loud as you can today. I'm sure Vinnie, we'll hear it best, which is, um, a, I, um, best wishes in competent it said, um, they'll hours already listened to the fucking shit every day and he was, you know what, you know, it's a great album, great live album. Is there 101 proof? I'm such a bad sl. One of my favorite things is when they play on broken. And Phil as Phil's doing the intro video. Vinnie's already counting in the song, just how tight they were. Always our world shore route or north called our broker. [inaudible] of course job brown Al Bag. I get paid. Oh, alright. Coco the gorilla. Oh, I saw this too at fucking sweetheart of a gorilla.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       Um, did I did the bit above a hey bill, I saw you, you live last year and I love you special. We talk about teaching gorilla sign language. I was watching clips of cocoa interacting with people like with flee from the Chili peppers and Robin Williams. I watched those. I was still nervous and I just saw a flea laying down and there's like a fucking gorilla right next to him. Um, I dunno, I get you're shooting the shit with it. You can kind of, I dunno. Um, um, the, it made me nervous. You know, I wonder if it made me nervous just because I'm such a big fan of flee and I didn't want to see anything happen to him. Like it was a bass player from a band. I didn't give a shit about them. And if they go, look at this guy, this could get interesting. Um, anyways, it was, it was charming as hell. I was wondering if you ever set down with cocoa, if ever given a chance. Well, no, not after the bid I did. They probably, this guy's a fucking asshole. You could have asked him why the chicken crossed the road and wait for a chuckle or tried to explain humor to him.

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       Five a sat down with that gorilla. I in that thing, actually, if that wasn't a party trick, if it actually knew how to do sign language, I imagine it would sign to me. You seem nervous.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:37       And hours and back. Yeah. Well you're a fucking gorilla. Um, anyways, kids show recommendation. Um, hey there Billy barnacle balls. I want you to, I want, if you want a show to watch with your girlfriend, checkout. Okay. I thought it said octo nuts, like something with eight balls. Octo nuts. Is it an octopus in outer space? I watched it with my girls and kids and I actually learned some stuff. All right, well that was about as vague as the, uh, what was it that was that movie way back in the game, the silent game or the, there's something game or the something or other. Remember David Spade had that joke? I'm going to tell the time. I'm going to tell you guys the secret of the crying game and he goes over rated.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       All right. Hair transplant, depression. Oh No. Hey old freckled Dick. I'm a 21 year old man. I recently got a hair transplant surgery. Well, you must be a hairy motherfucker, man. You went bald that are soon. Um, the surgery went great. Good. Good for you. But I now hate that I have a huge scar in the back of my head. I don't they do it now where they just vacuum the shit out so you don't have to have that smile on the back of your head. He goes, every time I cut my hair, you can see it. Could you give me some advice on what I should do?

Speaker 1:          01:05:13       Well, yeah, don't cut your hair so fucking short. Now that you've get back on top of your head, grow your hair out, you'll be fine. That was an easy one. What are you doing? You got hair plugs yet? I'm hacked the back of your head. Then he got fucking hair plugs and now you're shaving your head down to the point where you can fucking see it anyways. What was the point? Um, I don't know. I would just, I guess I would just grow my hair out a little bit. I don't think it has to be that long to cover the scar. As long as it's long enough that you can't see your scalp, I think he should be all right. Right. Anyways, pit bull problems, dear g OBA RSF Hasif oh, Billy. Easy shave butter. Oh, facilities face right now. That's easy. Facilities easy.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       I Dunno, I have no idea. I suck at that shit. As he former pitbull owner, I'd like to ask your advice on a problem I'm having. My wife comes home from, uh, my wife comes from a large family and they get together at her parents every month for Sunday dinner and family hangouts. The last two times. My brother in law has brought is recently a duck is recently adopted pitbull. It's a rescue dog and he doesn't think it was abused or used to fight because it's so good with kids. According to him it's a large family. So there, there are about 50 kids ages three to 11 running around. And my four year old daughters, one of them, she loves dogs and likes this one in particular, but both times he brought my dog. My daughter has come running to me in tears because it got over excited and jumped onto her too rough.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       Well that's the thing about pities man, they just a big fucking awesome ball of muscle. And when I used to wrestle with my dog, I used to have to lay my neck over the top of his neck. He had to get inside because she was lightening quick and she would turn around and hit her head was like a wrecking ball, godliness, that fucking dog. I still get to see her every couple of months, but I really miss that. Um, anyways, he goes, I don't hate dogs, but I don't love them either. And I don't trust pitbulls. Well, you have to validate all of that. Okay. To be quite honest, I'm kind of afraid of them. I'd never forgive myself if something happened to my daughter. If I say something to my inlaws, I looked like a killjoy asshole, but I'm too stressed out to enjoy the family gathering because I'm hovering over a constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       So my wife's response has been to treat me like I'm overreacting and dismissed my concerns. It's bothering me so much. I've considered just keeping my daughter home next time. But am I making too big a deal about this? I think it's a recipe for disaster. I don't feel like it's my place to tell my brother in law to keep it at home and my wife's not supporting me. Please tell, please let me know if you have any ideas. Uh, may see ava. Got to fair for two. Thank you. Thank you. And I imagine that saying go fuck yourself. Um, I know advise and go to is you [inaudible] all right. Anyways. Uh, I would say this dude, you have to like, if that's what you're feeling, you don't have to tell anybody to leave a dog home on it. You just have to communicate this to people.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       All right? Say you don't hate dogs, you don't love him either and you don't, I don't trust pitbulls. Okay. And just tell them that rather than be like, keep the fucking lunatic. Just tell them that. All right. And I would sit down with your wife and say that, you know, I don't feel like you're hearing me all right. She's my daughter and I'm concerned and I have to be honest, you know, if you had these concerns, I would listen to them and you're not validating what I'm feeling and it's really bothering me and I can't enjoy when I go over there. I don't want to be this killed joy, but I'm hovering over our kid and I just, you know, it's bothering me. You married me, you love me. I'm telling you something's bothering me. We need to talk about it. You can't go there because that'd be up and you fucking talk to me about this.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       That's what I would do. Keep it in the register. I was just in all right. And don't stop having the conversation until there's a solution that you're satisfied with. It should daughter. Okay. And uh, you know, dogs are abused, right? And if a dog snaps, you know, it's a bad thing around a kid. And then when you have a pit bull, the thing about a pitbull is its capability. You know what I mean? Some dogs that like a little water pistol and other dogs, or like a fucking bazooka. That dog is a bazooka. So not saying the breed is bad, I'm just saying if somebody fuck that dog up and it does snap, the results are, you know, gonna be really bad. So, and you have to address that that's being, or you're being a responsible parent and these people need to listen to you and a, you need to speak up.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       You've got to stand up for yourself there, buddy. Boy, it's my advice. All right, good luck. Okay, lady, lady manager. Crossing the line. Dear bill or William Butler, will you call yourself below? Hello Wall? I'm a 23 or 23 year old lady who just started working in an office. I love when women write in. It's always guys, God bless you for right now, who just started working in an office for a big company. It's a boring job. But while I figure out what to do with my life after graduating, it's all right. Well there you go. That's not bad. You're 23. You get your whole life ahead of you. Uh, I got promoted with the recommendation from my former manager at this 40 something year old woman who I thought was quite nice. Uh, now she's not my manager anymore, although she still senior to me.

Speaker 1:          01:11:16       She has been a little inappropriate with me. And after an office Christmas party, me and my colleagues went to a club. Uh, I came out of the club bathrooms and she was waiting. She didn't even come with us. Well, that's weird. She waved me over to sit next to her and asked me if I was gay. I said, no, I'm not. And she went fine. It didn't speak to me for the rest of the night. All right, well she needs a better opening line that she's a little blunt. You know, she's in business. She got right down to brass tacks. Uh, she said I was a bit uncomfortable with the question because what business is it of hers? Oh, I thought she was gay. She wanted to hook up with you. Cause what business is it of her? So I told one of my work pals what had happened.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       Uh, they had been at the company longer than me went. Wow, you're her new one then. Oh boy. Oh, G G. I asked them what they meant and a guy said, well, I may look at her right now. She's filming you and she, Sarah enough. What? Ensure enough she was, she was, when I turned around, she hid her phone as I was a little bit too drunk and under the influence. I was already paranoid. So I decided to leave because I felt so gross. Since then, she's pulled me aside to say that I looked delicious and scrumptious oh, what a crape. Whenever she sees me at the end of the day, she taps her cheek and demands that kiss. Oh yeah, what the fuck is this per she and, oh, that's [inaudible]. That's like a gross relative. She asked a girl who works for me to take pictures of me and to send it to her when we're at a pub.

Speaker 1:          01:13:11       I consider myself and assertive girl, but there's something about how public about her actions, which makes me so timid, so I go along with it. Now I'll do that. You think you would think that because she's not my manager anymore. Now that I've been promoted, it wouldn't be a problem, but it is because my new manager is their best friend. I don't want to cause a riff in this new job, but it's really stressing me out. Am I within my rights to tell her to stop? Absolutely. You are. How do I tell it? Is that no, I don't want to kiss her on the cheek every time I see you without looking like a bitch. Listen, the way you're looking at this is fucking crazy. You're, you're sitting here looking at like how like you're being an asshole. You're not. This person is completely out of line. She said, a few of my friends thinks it's a funny situation, but I don't, and if you don't, then it isn't. You've got to validate that if this was a male manager, he'd be reported. I love your stuff so much and I wish I could come back. You'd come back to Glasgow someday from a fellow fellow pasty redhead. Um, all right, dear fellow fucking pasty. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:14:24       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14:24       this is what you gotta do. She asked for a kiss. You tell him no, and I just stare at, I mean, listen, you have all the fucking power in the world or if you just want to go to the manager and say, listen, I don't want to cause some me to scandal or any of that shit. Can You keep this weird old fucking bag away from me and tell her to be professional? I mean, that's the proper way to do it. Those are the proper channels, but I have to do it that way.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Do it that way. Okay. Do it that way. And, and, and document that this has been happening. You have all these witnesses about them filming her and all of this type of shit. If they ever tried to fire you, I mean that you don't have a problem at this. This kind of thing needs to stop and uh, you know, in a perfect world you'd go to her, cause I don't like that whole telling on a thing, but that's how the business world works. Um, you know, in a perfect world when she fucking goes like pointed to or cheek. Yeah, that's right where you should punch her.

Speaker 2:          01:15:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       Fucking blast or right in fucking face.

Speaker 3:          01:15:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       Yeah. I mean if you're ever at a bar again and she's doing that Shit, I would fucking dump a drink right over her fucking head. Like that's just creepy behave. I would just, mmm, you got to stop this Timothy. Cause if you're timid someone like that, it's, it's gonna. It's like a magnet. They're going to go right towards you. You've got to step up to her and tell her what a fucking creep she is. And if I catch you take a video or, or, or, uh, pictures of me or any of this other fucking creepy sexual shit that you're doing, I'm going to report you, okay? And you think you're going to get together with you, fucking manage your friend. Okay? All I gotta do is go on social media and your fucking world is over. The fuck is my phone.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       What the fuck is mine anyways, but don't do that. That's all anger. Listen you, but you know, you are, you seem like a really like overly nice people pleasing person at 23, which I was where you're like, is it me? That the way I'm dressing, that's attracting this, it's not you. It's that person. Okay? So whatever the fuck I said before I got upset, uh, just go, listen, I got an issue and don't be listening. I don't want to come to the family. They go in there fucking flat footed and look right at that person and say, listen, I got an issue with her. She's coming at me in weird sexual ways and I'm getting sick of it and I'm sick of it. I want to come here and go to work and do a great job. I don't need that. Okay. I would like to file an official report on her harassing me. Okay. And that's the deal. And I want it to stop. It stops right now. Are we clear? That's it. That's it. There's no, don't go in there fucking hat in hand. You don't have to be a, can't just go in and just say, look, this is happening and it needs to stop immediately. Okay.
