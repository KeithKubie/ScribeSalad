00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
think this is not a big shock um but I
 

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.329 align:start position:0%
think this is not a big shock um but I
thought<00:09:48.990><c> the</c><00:09:49.259><c> way</c><00:09:49.410><c> they</c><00:09:49.649><c> did</c><00:09:49.920><c> it</c><00:09:50.100><c> and</c><00:09:50.189><c> the</c><00:09:50.279><c> way</c>

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
thought the way they did it and the way
 

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:51.559 align:start position:0%
thought the way they did it and the way
they<00:09:50.519><c> explained</c><00:09:50.850><c> to</c><00:09:50.970><c> it</c><00:09:51.089><c> whether</c><00:09:51.240><c> it</c><00:09:51.360><c> was</c><00:09:51.389><c> very</c>

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:51.569 align:start position:0%
they explained to it whether it was very
 

00:09:51.569 --> 00:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
they explained to it whether it was very
well<00:09:51.930><c> handled</c><00:09:52.139><c> um</c><00:09:53.809><c> so</c><00:09:54.809><c> yeah</c><00:09:55.050><c> I</c><00:09:55.079><c> think</c><00:09:55.920><c> that</c>

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:56.129 align:start position:0%
well handled um so yeah I think that
 

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.189 align:start position:0%
well handled um so yeah I think that
sort<00:09:56.550><c> of</c><00:09:56.670><c> sums</c><00:09:57.029><c> up</c><00:09:57.240><c> you</c><00:09:57.389><c> know</c><00:09:57.509><c> who</c><00:09:57.899><c> would</c><00:09:58.050><c> like</c>

00:09:58.189 --> 00:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
