In this homework assignment, we have a puzzle, which is similar to the zebra puzzle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm calling it the floor puzzle.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We describe a five-floor apartment building in which there are five residents,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and there's various constraints on them.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What I want you to do is just write the code to return the proper floor assignment

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for each of the five inhabitants in that order.
