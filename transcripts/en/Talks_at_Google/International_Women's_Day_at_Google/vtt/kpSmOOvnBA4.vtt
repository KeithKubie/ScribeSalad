DEIRDRE MCINTYRE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.520
Thanks to everyone who
has come to this talk.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.870
So my name is Deirdre McIntyre,
and it's my great honor today

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.040
to host Dr. Kate
Granger at Google.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
I actually came across
Kate's Twitter account

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.000
a couple of years ago.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.490
And it really struck
a chord with me.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.890
And so I've kind
of kept in contact

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.600
and tracked her over the
last couple of years.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.270
For anyone who
doesn't know Kate,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.510
Kate is an accomplished
doctor, writer,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.180
and she also has an MBE,
which is pretty cool.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.950
So on top of doing all those
things, in her spare time

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
she started a global campaign
to basically make sure

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.910
that being a patient
in a hospital

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.370
is a bit more kind
of a human thing.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.269
So today, she's going to talk
to us about that campaign.

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.310
And she's going to talk
to us about her learnings

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.240
from kicking it off.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.722
So please welcome
Dr. Kate Granger.

00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:02.849
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:05.390
KATE GRANGER: So thank you for
that really kind introduction,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.410
Deirdre.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.990
Hello, my name's Kate.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.980
The reason I'm using that
phrase will become apparent

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.570
as we go through my story.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.759
And I'm going to tell
you a story today.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.050
It's probably going to be
quite different from anything

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.390
you might have heard
before at a Google Talk.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.690
So here goes.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.390
So I'm just one girl who
had one simple idea which

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.290
brought about a global change.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980
And you might think, well,
how's that girl from the UK

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.590
managed that?

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.230
And I guess I need to tell
you my story to get there.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.130
So I don't know if anyone
can spot me in this picture.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.170
This is my graduation day
from [INAUDIBLE] University.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.080
And I'm just there.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.820
That's 10 and 1/2 years ago
when I graduated as a doctor.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.790
A very proud day for me, started
my career working in the NHS,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.860
working throughout
specialties in medicine.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.380
And eventually,
working my way up

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.275
to becoming a consultant in
medicine for older people,

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:09.110
which was kind of my lifelong
professional ambition.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.690
And a week after
that day graduating,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.250
I got married to my lovely
husband, Chris, who's with me

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.640
today.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.480
And we had a very
special wedding day.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.550
And it was just
how we wanted it.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.180
And we started our
personal lives together

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.250
as husband and wife.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.380
Moved into a flat,
started working,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.240
and everything seemed absolutely
perfect with our lives.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.590
So if we fast forward a
few years, it's July, 2011.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.490
And Chris and I have decided
that we need a holiday.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.510
We've been working really hard.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.770
Everything's been manic.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.820
At work, I've been
doing all my exams.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.320
And Chris has been
working his way

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.450
up the management
ladder at Asda, which

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.832
is the UK version of Wal-Mart.

00:02:57.832 --> 00:02:59.830
And we thought we'd
take a holiday.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.710
Very lucky that Chris'
auntie and uncle

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.560
live in Santa Cruz,
just down the coast.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.420
So this is us on a
beach in Santa Cruz,

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.430
looking like we don't
have a care in the world.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.630
We've both got good
jobs, no money worries.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.330
We're thinking about
having a family.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.640
And life is just idyllic.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.410
But for the fact that I
just don't feel very well.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.300
And I haven't felt very well
for maybe a couple of weeks

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.640
in the run-up to the trip.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.520
But I'm being your typical
doctor and just ignoring it.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.560
And I got off the plane and
I started with this kind

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.150
of niggling pain in my side.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.780
And it just wouldn't go away.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.870
And nothing was really
working to make it better.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.290
I was just popping Paracetamol
hoping for the best

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.340
and procrastinating about it.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.980
Well, unfortunately my symptoms
got worse and worse and worse,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.370
until Chris took
charge of the situation

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.130
as a non-doctor in
our relationship

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.990
and decided actually it was time
to seek some medical attention.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.270
So we ended up in the emergency
room, the Dominican Hospital

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.570
in Santa Cruz, where after
relatively little tests,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.202
they'd found out that
I was really very sick.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:11.110
My kidneys had failed.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.880
And they did some scans to
find out the reason for that.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.779
And unfortunately,
those scans showed

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.839
that I was riddled with cancer.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.344
I had tumors throughout
my pelvis and my abdomen.

00:04:22.344 --> 00:04:25.050
I had lymph nodes everywhere.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.980
They were blocking the
tubes between my kidneys

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.500
and my bladder, which is
why my kidneys had failed.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.410
And I was really
desperately ill.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.490
So I got patched
up in the States.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.647
They popped some
stents into my ureters

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:39.980
to get my kidneys working again.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.040
And thankfully, that worked.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.050
And we took the decision
that we wanted to come home.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.380
They kind of wanted to
transfer us to Stanford

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.070
and do operations and things.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.110
But I knew if we did that,
we'd be in the States forever.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.820
So I just wanted to go home.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.420
So as soon as I was well enough,
we hopped back on a flight

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.310
to the UK and started my
journey as a patient in the NHS.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.990
I was admitted quite soon after
we got home with my presumed

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.200
ovarian cancer.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.440
And we started what was
a disastrous journey.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.830
Actually, it was
really catastrophic.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.750
Everything that could
go wrong did go wrong.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.890
So my kidneys failed again.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.990
I ended up with
nephrostomies, which

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.040
are tubes that stick
out of your back

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.290
and drain your urine into bags.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.925
I had to have that
done on both sides,

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:34.870
so I had two bags to carry
around all the time with me.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.790
You can imagine getting
in and out of bed.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.612
It was horrendous.

00:05:38.612 --> 00:05:41.750
I developed a really
severe infection

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.610
on my left kidney, which
took ages to get better.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.750
And during these first few
weeks of being a patient,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.430
they were trying to work
out what was wrong with me.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.160
Because they knew
from the time they

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.550
put the biopsy
under the microscope

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.430
that I didn't have
ovarian cancer.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.450
They knew it was
something much rarer,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.920
but they weren't sure what.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.235
So they came back to me
with a group of tumors

00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:10.500
that it belonged to as the
small round blue cell tumors.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.090
And I was like,
you're joking, right?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.170
They can't be called the
small round blue cell tumors.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.710
That is so unimaginative.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.270
I wanted like a proper name,
juicy name for a tumor.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.250
But no.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.860
And you can see lots of
small round blue cells,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.990
I grant them that.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.580
But it took a lot of
immunohistochemistry and fancy

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.870
cytogenetics to actually
come back with a diagnosis.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.240
And that was given
to me four weeks

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.360
into my journey as a
desmoplastic small round cell

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.955
tumor, which is an incredibly
rare type of sarcoma.

00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:46.730
It affects just 1 in 2 million
people, usually teenage boys.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.910
So why it was picking
on a middle-aged woman,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.450
I don't know.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.930
And that was me.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.960
It spread to my
liver and my bones.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.230
So I was in a palliative
non-curative situation

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.320
from the outset.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.390
We had a lot of big decisions
to make at that point about what

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.383
we did.

00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:07.390
This tumor does respond to
chemotherapy in some cases.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.220
And in some cases, it has
absolutely no response

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.050
to chemotherapy.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.930
So if I had gone for treatment
and it hadn't worked,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.190
then I could have ruined the
last few months of my life

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.980
with medical intervention.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.922
And if I did go for
it, then I could

00:07:22.922 --> 00:07:29.070
have got a really good outcome
and lived for a long time.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.870
We went for chemotherapy.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.870
It was a really
hard, long journey.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.640
Initially, I had five cycles.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.230
It was very tough.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.730
I was in and out of hospital.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.800
My bone marrow kept failing.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.990
I kept getting really
serious infections.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.800
I kept bleeding.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.140
I needed multiple transfusions.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.530
Life was really very tough.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.010
But on New Year's Eve, 2011,
I'd been through my fifth cycle

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.590
and I was just back
in hospital after it.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.660
And I just kind of
came to the decision

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.940
that the burden of what
I was going through

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.820
was outweighing any
benefits it was giving me.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.385
So we kind of took
the decision together

00:08:11.385 --> 00:08:15.830
that we were going to stop
chemotherapy at that point

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.760
because I wanted
to do one thing.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.150
And this might sound a
bit crazy for somebody

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.350
who's got a terminal
cancer diagnosis,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.860
but I wanted to go back to work.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.960
I had been told I wasn't
going to work again.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.280
And I was absolutely desperate
to prove my oncologist wrong.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.880
So three weeks later,
after I made that decision,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.789
I was back on the wards looking
after patients who had stroke.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.230
And really, loving my career.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.480
So then I was well
for 18 months,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.260
which is really unheard
of in this tumor.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.500
People normally get
three, six months,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.140
that kind of time scale.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.420
So 18 months was really
prolonged well time.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.290
And we did loads of
things during that time.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.440
We took lots of items
off the bucket list

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.820
and really enjoyed life.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.920
Until September/October
time, 2013,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.764
when things started to
progress again quite quickly.

00:09:09.764 --> 00:09:14.620
I noticed a lump in my neck and
I was getting a lot more pain.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.440
And then obviously,
bigger decisions

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.690
about chemotherapy,
no chemotherapy.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.260
Knowing how tough
it was going to be,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.790
but knowing that it could give
me lots more quality time.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.586
So we went for
chemotherapy again.

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:28.375
I had four further cycles.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.210
I had a good response.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.990
I got 12 months more good time.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.200
And since then, I've had two
further courses of just two

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.790
cycles each time, just
to try and keep me

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.750
well for as long as possible.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm just recovering from that
fourth course of chemotherapy

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.480
now.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.010
And it's taken me a few
weeks to get back on my feet.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.120
But obviously, I'm well
enough to come to America.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.450
So things are all
good at the moment.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.720
So that's my story.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.410
During that time, I've
been through a huge amount

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.150
of health care.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.240
I've had multiple
operations on my kidneys.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.790
I've had radiology
interventions.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.606
I've had so many scans
I can't count them.

00:10:11.606 --> 00:10:14.680
I've been to loads of
primary care appointments.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.160
I've been to loads of
oncology appointments.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.110
I've been in lots of
different hospital wards.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.910
And during that
time, it's given me

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.000
a lot of time to reflect
about what being a good doctor

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.220
is, what makes a good
nurse, what is care,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.296
why does compassion
matter in health care.

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:37.910
And I've sat inside rooms
by myself reflecting

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.660
on these things an awful lot.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.200
And during that time, I've
written about them as well.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.750
And I started by writing
a couple of books,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.870
and then I started blogging
and tweeting and sharing

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.880
my experience of health care.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.090
Primarily, as something
to do with my time

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.250
that was productive.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.460
But also, that I'm a really
avid medical teacher.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.680
It's part of my role
that I do an awful lot

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.640
of medical teaching.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.940
And me sharing my
experience is kind

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.450
of me teaching in a
funny sort of way.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.320
And during that time, I sort
of distilled my thoughts

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.040
about care into four values.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.150
Now, I don't know if you
have organizational values

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.820
at Google.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.560
We have them in
our organization.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.974
Chris has them at Asda.

00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:22.390
But I think it's
important to have

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.960
your own personal values,
things that matter to you

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.170
as a professional.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.830
But for me, also as a patient.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.000
And the things that matter
to me are that people

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.880
communicate with me properly.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.150
When communication is good,
I tend to have a good patient

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.876
experience.

00:11:38.876 --> 00:11:40.250
And when it's not
so good, that's

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.390
when things tend to break down.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.840
The little things
are really celebrated

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.750
and just people
take care of them.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.210
And when I say
the little things,

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.730
I mean when somebody
comes into a hospital room

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.820
and they stand over
you, it's really

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.520
horrible and intimidating.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.180
And somebody could just sit down
and you're on the same level.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.770
That makes a huge
difference to me

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.080
when I'm a patient and
feeling vulnerable.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.140
Or somebody holding your
hand when you're upset

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.850
and breaking all these
horrible news stories to me.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.710
It's really nice
if somebody offers

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.210
that tactile reassurance.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.710
Even somebody getting you a
drink or just those tiny acts

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.690
of kindness, they
really matter to me.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.960
And the third thing
that matters is that I

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.460
am at the center of my care.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.290
All too often as a patient,
you can find yourself just

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.060
somewhere out on the periphery.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.520
And people are working really
hard to try and make you

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.810
better, but those decisions
are just whirring around

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.290
and you're not part of them.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.830
And if anybody knew
anything about me,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.010
it's that I'm a
slight control freak.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.000
And that I really want to
be involved in my decisions.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.900
And it's really
important to me that I'm

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.240
at the core of what's happening.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.530
So person-centered
care is something

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.950
that I really aspire to when I'm
working and trying to find out

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.980
what my patients want.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.470
And that kind of leads me
on to my fourth value, which

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.690
is about seeing me as a person.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.650
I don't want to be seen as
that girl with the rare cancer,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.330
or Bed Seven.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.130
I want to be seen as Kate,
who's the doctor, who's

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.990
a wife to Chris, who is an avid
baker, who plays a flute, who's

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.510
got three nephews
and a gorgeous niece.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.220
All these things about my life
are so much more important

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.550
than the fact I've got cancer.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.040
And I think finding
out about those things

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.850
before you become a patient.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.300
So finding out about the
person who's got the illness

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.200
is much more important
than focusing right

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.290
in on the condition
that people have.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.610
So these are my stents, the
tubes that drain my kidneys.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.440
And they're very
important to me.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.680
They mean that I have to live my
life with those tubes sticking

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.720
out of my back,
which is horrendous.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.490
And I can get on planes
and go to America.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.870
And I can do all good
things, like jumping out

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.690
of airplanes and such like.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.010
But they do need to be
replaced every so often.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.730
And that's a small operation.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.930
And I had that operation
done in August, 2013.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.470
Everything went very smoothly
and I was home the same day.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.390
Unfortunately, 36 hours later
at home, I started shivering.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.270
And I had a fever.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.950
And I was dragged back to
hospital kicking and screaming

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:37.940
by my husband.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.025
You can kind of see
the story going.

00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:46.680
I'm always the irrational
one when I'm unwell.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.780
Anyway, dragged back to the
emergency room by my husband,

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.620
where we met a number of people.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.830
We met a doctor who
was one of the doctors.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.510
And it was really hard to
extract his name and his role,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.910
which is important to me.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.870
I need to know who
I'm talking to.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:10.300
And then, a health care
assistant, a clinical support

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.800
worker.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.133
I'm not sure which because
she didn't introduce herself.

00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:17.030
Came to do my blood and
put a cannula in for me.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.560
And then a nurse came
to put my antibiotics up

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.250
and she didn't interact
with me at all.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.890
In fact, she was
talking to another nurse

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.730
about another patient
the whole time she

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.960
was putting my antibiotics up.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.365
So I just felt like one
of those mannequin arms

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.420
that people practice
doing blood tests on.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.270
You know, that's
what I felt like.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.790
And then I met Brian.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.290
And Brian restored
my faith somewhat.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.970
He was a porter.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.670
He was really nice.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.700
He had a name.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.780
He recognized that
I was in pain.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.910
In fact, he was the
first person to recognize

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.440
I was in pain out of all these
health care professionals.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.910
He got me an extra pillow
and a blanket to make sure

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.520
that I was comfortable.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.170
And then he took extra
care pushing the trolley

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.020
over the bumps in the
corridor so that he

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.920
didn't exacerbate my pain.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.630
And the whole time, Brian
was talking to me and Chris

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.280
just about everyday stuff.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.380
But it really mattered
to me because I

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.270
hate being pushed
around the hospital

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.480
that I know very well
knowing that at every turn

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.780
I could bump into somebody.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.140
Or [INAUDIBLE] that
don't recognize me

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.710
when I'm in patient role.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.290
Or they'll have a really
awkward conversation with me,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.190
neither of which are pleasant.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.060
And Brian just took away
all that anxiety and phobia

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.180
about hospital, just by
being nice and attending

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.140
to those little things I
was talking about before.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.650
And I was in hospital
for just under two weeks.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.130
And I met lots of
people during that time.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.610
I would say the vast majority
didn't introduce themselves.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.640
It was an expectation that
you just put your arm out

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.050
to have your blood
pressure taken

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.500
and people would just do that
task and not kind of focus

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.660
on you being a person with an
arm who's got a blood pressure.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.099
Or, people give me antibiotics.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:08.630
I put tablets in front of me and
have very little interaction.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.940
Now, it sounds very
strange because you're

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.660
surrounded by people all
day, but being in hospital

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.900
is actually,
really, very lonely.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.359
Because you have your loved ones
restricted by visiting times.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:26.720
So you're there and you're
having these very brief

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.670
interactions with people
that often feel meaningless.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.430
And it can be
really very lonely.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.680
So one evening, I was
sort of talking to Chris

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.280
about everything
that was going on.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.500
And I was kind of
reflecting on the fact

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.530
that I thought introductions
should be present.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.370
I thought they were
really important.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.430
And they're the first thing
we're taught at medical school.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.610
When you approach a
patient, you say who you

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.140
are, what you're going to do.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.150
You ask them what they
want to be called.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.330
And you start the
interaction that way

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.660
so that you get off
on the right footing.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.320
And I just felt like
something had gone wrong.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.290
In the whole process of care,
something had gone wrong.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.100
I call it passionately
reflecting,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.270
but Chris calls it ranting.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.430
And that evening, he
kind of inspired me

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.410
because he told me to stop
winching and do something.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.550
So we did.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:30.490
So the initial idea was to use
my already significant presence

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.670
on social media to get
a conversation going

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:38.680
about introductions in health
care and why they're important.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.386
And get people just
reflecting on it.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.010
And when people
reflect, sometimes they

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.160
change their behavior.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.670
If you're going to do
anything on social media,

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.600
you need a catchy
hashtag, don't you?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.820
Chris came up with
#hellomynameis

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.290
and off we went on
a strange journey

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.130
that's taken all over the
country and all over the world.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.730
And yeah, it's been
rather exciting.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.220
This is the first tweet I
ever sent about the campaign.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.550
So if I step aside a little
bit and consider social media.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.430
When you think
about social media,

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.730
I think about the
banality of it.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.615
So you've got Justin
Bieber, haven't you?

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:22.270
He doesn't say anything very
useful a lot of the time

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.290
and yet he's got,
how many followers?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.920
69.1 million followers.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.480
So he's like one of the
most followed people.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.220
The president's just
got involved, hasn't he?

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.120
He's just started
his Twitter account.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.941
He's only sent 159 tweets and
has already amassed himself

00:19:40.941 --> 00:19:43.440
5 million followers, but not
quite as many as Justin Bieber.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.000
But people have used social
media for charity things

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.390
and for positive things as
well as the banality of it.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.110
And I'm sure you had the ice
bucket challenge in the US.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.250
It was certainly a
big thing in the UK,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.050
raising money for
motor neuron disease.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.290
And I think you
guys call it ALS.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.000
So that was a big thing.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.490
It raised millions of
pounds for charity.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.080
We had the no makeup selfie
in the UK, which raised money

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.850
for Cancer Research UK.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.830
So a lot of people took to
Twitter, including celebrities,

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.500
without their makeup and
donated money that way.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.810
But can you actually use social
media to change behavior?

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.470
Because I guess that's what
#hellomynameis is about.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.960
We're trying to induce a change.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.860
I was trying to
think of things that

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.430
had used social media
in a positive way

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.580
to change behavior.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.280
And this is a campaign
that was run in the UK

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.330
by Public Health England, trying
to get women exercising more.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.100
So it's called This Girl Can.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.330
And the hashtag went quite
viral over in England.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.680
And there was an ad
campaign that went with it

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.546
and lots of social
media activity.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.280
So it kind of brings me
back to #hellomynameis

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.120
and what we did with it.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:17.210
So I decided that we needed
to give it a visual identity.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.670
So we had got a
conversation going.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.940
There were lots of
people tweeting about it.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.220
My experience was
not unique, which

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.390
gave me even more motivation
to get something going.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.450
Because there was lots
of patients saying to me,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.860
yes, this has happened to me.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.750
Yes, this really matters to me.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.330
There were all sorts
of stories, like women

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.800
having babies, getting
vaginal examinations by people

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.520
they didn't know during
labor, and really

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.730
horrible things happening
to people out there

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.240
across the world.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.200
And I was like, yeah, this
really needs to change.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.430
We need a mind change to make
us think of patients as people

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.640
first and foremost.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.620
And you have to think of
the person in front of you

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.940
as a person.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.940
If you share names, you
make that connection.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.600
It's part of how we're
brought up socially.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.800
It's common courtesy.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.330
So we gave it a visual
identity with a logo,

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.040
which included a smile.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.730
Because it's not just
about saying those words.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.030
It's about how you say them.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.140
And a smile is an instant
anxiety reliever as a patient.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.895
If a health care
professional smiles at you,

00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:30.660
you instantly feel
better about whatever's

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.720
going to happen to you.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.490
So that's why the
smile is there.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.980
I blogged about the
campaign and invited people

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.260
to kind of pledge their support.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.790
My clever IT geek brother
designed us a website so we

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.320
could collate
resources and things

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.800
that were happening
with the campaign.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.310
I got it on Facebook.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.080
Because obviously, not
everyone uses Twitter.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.520
So I thought I'd try and get
it on another social media

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.100
channel.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.320
So Facebook page was born.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.050
And if you go to YouTube,
you'll find lots and lots

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.010
of videos about #hellomynameis.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.170
Videos that have been done
trusts, videos by students,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.970
videos across the
world actually.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.520
There's things from Australia,
New Zealand, the US.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.770
And I'm just going to show
you a little video now

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:32.338
of my own trust where I work
doing their little pledges.

00:23:32.338 --> 00:23:33.334
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:33.334 --> 00:23:37.318
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:16.162 --> 00:24:16.839
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:18.380
KATE GRANGER: That
video always makes

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.440
me smile because there's
some of the people

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.470
that I work with who are really
important to me professionally.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.020
But when people
smile at you, it does

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.210
make you want to smile
back, doesn't it?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.430
So if you have a simple idea
that takes hardly any time,

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.100
costs no money, and
improves patient experience,

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.650
then politicians want to
get involved, don't they?

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.960
So these are some of our
politicians in the UK

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.760
supporting the campaign.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.330
So we got our prime minister.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.260
And we're at number 10
Downing Street there.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.860
This is our health secretary
supporting the campaign.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.870
And then, that's the first
minister of Scotland.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.460
But we've also got some
slightly more famous people.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.380
Politicians might
not be that famous,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.657
but Chris and I have met all
sorts of people on our journey

00:25:05.657 --> 00:25:07.365
while we've been
ticking the bucket list.

00:25:07.365 --> 00:25:09.950
And Chris meets lots
of people at his work.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.010
And he's always there ready
with his #hellomynameis sign.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:18.390
Now, you might think this is
a bit geeky or a bit gimmicky,

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.870
but I think it's a really
good way of raising

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.110
the profile of something.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.190
And if you get people
talking about something

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.570
on social media, then
you spread a message.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.980
And so I'm quite proud
of our little celebrity

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.100
haul, which includes
Kylie Minogue and Drew

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.220
Barrymore to include others.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.340
But we've kind of taken
this out of social media

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.060
now, which is the
wonderful thing.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.090
It spread right across
our health service.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.810
We've got 112 NHS trusts onboad
supporting it, promoting it

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.070
with their staff, and
trying to get that behavior

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.880
change that we all want.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.880
And one of the things
we've done to kind of help

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.955
push that along a bit and keep
the momentum of the campaign

00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:04.400
going is going on tour,
which sounds kind of rock

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.190
[? chickish, ?] doesn't it?

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.910
We went on tour in June.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.270
And we visited 16 health
care organizations.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.550
We went 2,000 miles
and met 2,000 people.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.100
And the reception at every place
was really, really inspiring.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.380
And this is a clinical
commissioning group

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.280
near [INAUDIBLE] in [INAUDIBLE]
in the north of England.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.790
There were lots of people
wanting to come and hear

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:35.620
my story, and using
it in their teaching

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.650
and in their own health care
practice, which was amazing.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.510
But the beauty of
when you send a tweet

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.470
is that you don't just
reach your own country.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.651
You reach the world.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:53.100
So #hellomyname is has
caught on in other places.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.970
We have Italian versions
of it, Spanish versions,

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.670
French versions,
German versions.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.890
It spread right
across Australia.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:04.660
In fact, one of
the people that I

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.710
used to work with who now
works in Sheffield has just

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.170
gone to Australia to do some
talks and he tweeted me to say,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.810
Kate, it's everywhere.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.870
I can't believe
you're so global.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.410
And it spread right
across New Zealand.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.920
We're working on the US.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.990
We're getting there.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.570
It's been slightly
slower to get going,

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.800
but I think we're
starting to get there.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.600
But also, in places
you might not expect.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:36.190
So the volunteers who
looked after patients

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.940
who were suffering with
Ebola in Sierra Leone

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.820
decided that they
wanted to support

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.574
the campaign in some way.

00:27:42.574 --> 00:27:44.240
And one of the things
they thought about

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.270
is putting a picture
of themselves

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.460
on their protective equipment,
and then writing their names

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.670
on the helmet.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.260
Because they've got
so many barriers

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.330
between them and their
patients, that they really

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:56.750
thought about it.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.370
And I thought that
was an amazing way

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.785
of expressing the campaign.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.260
So I thought I'd Google
#hellomynameis and see

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.140
how many results I got.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:12.590
So 109,000 results.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.070
The first, I think, 20
pages are all things

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.078
to do with my campaign.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.310
It's very difficult to measure
these things, isn't it?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.300
I can't go into every
health care organization

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.160
and see if these things
are happening every time.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.200
Although, some junior
doctors are using it

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.470
as a driver for quality
improvement projects

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.770
and are doing exactly that, are
recording how many times people

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.470
introduce themselves,
promoting the campaign,

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.610
and then going back and
trying to see a change.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.090
People have seen changes
in their patient experience

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.760
surveys after they've
introduced the campaign.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.610
And they think a
lot of it is around

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:53.550
how it changes a culture.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.540
And what I was saying about
seeing your patients as people.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.320
So it's not just necessarily
introducing yourself.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.130
It's that mind shift to
change how you actually

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.880
think about people.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.680
But we can measure on
social media how much people

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.470
are talking about a topic.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.600
So recently, we
reached our 1 billion

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.260
Twitter impression mark,
which I'm very proud of.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.710
And it equates to
six tweets an hour.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.250
If anyone tweets
in the audience,

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:29.070
but tweet away and push those
numbers up a little bit.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.630
So as Deirdre mentioned
in her introduction,

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.230
I went to the palace in
June to receive my MBE.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.330
And that was, obviously,
a very special day.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.190
But the reason I went
there to get an MBE was

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.120
because my services to the NHS
and to improving care globally

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.490
and being recognised-- and
that was just completely

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.110
overwhelming and an incredibly
special day for Chris

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.070
and my parents.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.550
And me.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.200
So I guess I'm going to come
back to what I started with.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.210
So one person can
have one simple idea

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.200
and make a global change.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.990
So I thought I'd leave
you with a question.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.970
What could you change?

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.200
I'm just a normal
girl from Yorkshire

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.100
who brought about a
change in health care,

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.350
but everyone's got that
potential within them.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.550
So I'll leave you
with that thought.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:24.356
Thank you for listening.

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:27.667
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.150
AUDIENCE: Thank
you, first of all.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:41.200
I think I saw a study
recently that correlated

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:48.210
a person's actual health with
the empathy of their caregiver.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.550
Am I getting this right?

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.341
KATE GRANGER: Yeah.

00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:52.616
AUDIENCE: So did you start that?

00:30:52.616 --> 00:30:55.860
KATE GRANGER: I didn't,
but that study-- there's

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.510
several studies out there, that
the better the relationship you

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.660
have with your
health care provider,

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.440
the better your outcome.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.000
And it's been repeated in
sort of surgical settings,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.580
in cancer settings.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.180
And I think that's why this
is so important, that we've

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.190
got to start those
relationships and consider

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.620
those relationships as
therapeutic in themselves.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.240
That whatever the treatments
we give, or the surgeries or we

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.800
do, or whatever we do as
health care professionals,

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.380
we have to think
of the relationship

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.480
we have with our patients as
kind of the first building

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.910
block of whatever
we're going to do.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:37.670
Because if you
think about it, you

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.760
are going to comply with what
your doctor recommends more

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.310
if you trust them and you
believe in what they're saying,

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.230
and you've worked together
and collaborated on whatever

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.890
the treatment plan is.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.940
So I think that's probably
why the outcomes are

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.490
better for people who
have better relationships.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.120
And you build
better relationships

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.910
if you're more empathic.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.660
AUDIENCE: I know that you've
seen more hospitals in the UK

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.930
than in the US.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.230
Did you have any impression
about whether there

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.840
was a big difference in the
culture of the hospitals

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.220
between where you were
in the US and the UK

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.410
with regard to introductions
and being patient centered?

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.220
KATE GRANGER: So
obviously, my experience

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.690
of being a patient in
the US is fairly limited.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.270
What I noticed was that the
nurses had much more time

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.020
for you than they do in the UK.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.530
And the doctors were kind
of a bit more distant.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.080
So the relationship
that you have

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.890
with your nurse when you're
in inpatient in the US

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.500
seems to be really important.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.330
That seems to be the central
thing that's going on.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.410
And the doctors are just
kind of on the periphery

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.330
doing the orders
for the treatments,

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:54.340
and then the nurses are
cracking on with it.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:58.700
But in the UK, we're a
little bit more collaborative

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.670
in the sense.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.600
But I don't know about culture.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.440
It's difficult.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.640
From what people have said
on Twitter and things,

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.360
I think there are cultural
difficulties with building

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.240
relationships in the US.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.680
And there is that distance, the
doctor wearing the white coat

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.970
and being the person
who is in power.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.622
You know, in the
powerful situation.

00:33:20.622 --> 00:33:23.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks so
much for coming and sharing

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.675
your story.

00:33:24.675 --> 00:33:27.780
It was very inspirational.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.900
So I think my question
is somewhat related

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.530
to the last question, which
was-- you mentioned that

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.620
even though the campaign is
slowly but surely picking up

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.520
steam here in the States.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.990
I guess, what are
some of the barriers

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.930
that you're coming across
that-- I mean, maybe

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.730
even not barriers.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.870
But you know, what
sort of factors

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:54.750
are making it slower to come
to shape here in the US?

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.130
And maybe, how can
we, as Googlers,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.390
and how can the viewers help
sort of pick up that steam here

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.190
in the States?

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.410
KATE GRANGER: So I think
one of the barriers

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.710
that people often talk about
is "we do that already."

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.250
We don't need to be told
something so obvious

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.489
as that because we
do that already.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:18.409
Now, I think if you went and
looked, videoed every health

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.860
care interaction that a
doctor has with a patient,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.999
they wouldn't necessarily
introduce themselves

00:34:23.999 --> 00:34:24.540
all the time.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.500
They just think they do.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.880
And I think that
sort of arrogance

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.920
almost is really a very
big barrier in this.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.159
We have a campaign in
the UK called the 6 C's,

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.120
which is for nurses.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.239
And it's like Commitment
Compassion, Courage Competence,

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:47.900
the things that you need
to be a really good nurse.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.389
And that got criticised as
well for being too simplistic.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.340
We don't need to be
told these things.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.290
But actually, we do.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.070
We need to go back
to the basics of care

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:02.820
and really sort of foster
those relationships.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.220
And then we can worry about
all the complicated things

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.600
that come after.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.470
So in terms of what
Googlers could do,

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.900
I think it's all about
spreading a message.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.620
So you're in a very powerful
social media presence

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.530
in the global setting, really.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.700
And I think anything
anybody can do

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.130
to spread this message
is really important.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:29.170
We're all patients at
times in our lives.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.965
Our children are patients.

00:35:32.965 --> 00:35:36.100
Our elderly relatives
are patients.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.962
And we all come into
contact with health care

00:35:38.962 --> 00:35:39.670
during our lives.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.790
And the experience of that has
to be better than it is now.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:44.790
DEIRDRE MCINTYRE: Great.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:45.890
Well, Kate, thanks again.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.056
And I hope you enjoy the
rest of your day at Google.

00:35:48.056 --> 00:35:50.690
KATE GRANGER: Thank you.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.240
[APPLAUSE]
