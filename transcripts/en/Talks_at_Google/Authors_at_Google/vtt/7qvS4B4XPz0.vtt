00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:02.800
LAURIE WALLMARK: So my
name is Laurie Wallmark.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.290
And I wrote this book
called "Ada Byron Lovelace

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.220
and the Thinking Machine."

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.802
I did not illustrate the book.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:09.760
I am not that talented.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.590
I had a very
talented Illustrator.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.902
Her name was April Chu.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.830
And here's the
dedication to the book.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310
I dedicated it to my
daughters, Kim and Lisa, who

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.190
love math as much as Ada did.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.410
Now, a funny thing
about this dedication

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.790
is my illustrator's dedication.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.400
She dedicated it to
her husband, Toby.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.090
My husband's name is Toby,
so as far as I'm concerned,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.730
I dedicated it to my children
and my husband, Toby.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.230
OK.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.310
So one of the things I need you
people to help me with-- I'm

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.730
going to be asking
questions along the way.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.690
And one of the things
I want you to notice

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.560
is look here in the corner here.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.620
We have gears.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170
You're going to
see a lot of gears,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.210
because we're talking
about machines.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.050
So let's get started.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.750
I'm going to read and then
maybe ask you a few questions

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.780
to help me out.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.360
"Ada was born into
a world of poetry,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.310
but numbers, not words,
captured her imagination.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.190
Her mother, Lady Byron,
had a passion for geometry.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.900
In fact, her nickname was the
Princess of Parallelograms.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.330
But her famous father
dominated the household.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.400
Beloved for his romantic
poems, Lord Byron

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.920
was a celebrity
throughout the world."

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.850
So my first question
for you is how do we

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.400
know that mom liked math?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.038
Yeah.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:43.918
AUDIENCE: Well, she had--
wait, I can't say the shape,

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:46.084
but I can-- there's a picture.

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:48.500
LAURIE WALLMARK: So he's holding
a geometric shape, right?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.047
AUDIENCE: Yes, I can't--

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:50.880
LAURIE WALLMARK: OK.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.570
How else?

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.110
How do you think she
knows what math is?

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.090
How do you think she knows that
she loves math, not that she--

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.930
AUDIENCE: She has a
passion for geometry.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.240
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.781
Well, I wrote those
words, but what's

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:05.050
in the picture that
tells you that?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.370
AUDIENCE: That there's this
bird and it has [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.340
LAURIE WALLMARK: Mm-hm.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.260
It's got these
numbers over the crib.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.130
And the blackboard.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.810
One of the best things
about picture books

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.810
is it's not just the author.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.270
You also get an Illustrator.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.530
So the Illustrator gets to
add things to the story.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.030
OK.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.740
So how about dad?

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.531
How do we know that
he likes writing?

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:30.030
Yeah.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.499
AUDIENCE: He is holding a poem.

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.040
LAURIE WALLMARK:
He's holding a what?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.762
AUDIENCE: Poem.

00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:36.470
LAURIE WALLMARK: Oh,
he's holding a poem.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.210
Yes.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.440
His poem is called
"Epitaph for a Dog."

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.640
That was one of the real
poems that Lord Byron

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.240
wrote, and here's a dog.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.700
"Unfortunately,
Lord Byron was also

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.580
notorious for his
scandalous behavior.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.730
So scandalous that Lady
Byron bundled up her new baby

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.010
and fled London to her parents'
home over 100 miles away.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.065
Ada never saw her father again.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.280
Now Ada could only know her
father through his books.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.180
And Ada was lonely.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.520
Her journals filled with pages
of inventions and equations

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.270
kept her company.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.250
The best part was when her
sketches flew off the page

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.310
and became real."

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.060
So do either of you see
something funny in the birds?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.726
Yeah.

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.100
AUDIENCE: There's
a machine bird.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.766
LAURIE WALLMARK:
There's a machine bird.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:29.150
Do you think that
really existed?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.890
No, I think that
was her imagination.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.110
Inventors have to have
a good imagination

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.870
to be able to think
up some things.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.000
And then I'd like to introduce
you to Mrs. Puff, her cat.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.500
You're going to see a lot
of Mrs. Puff as we go along.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.570
"Ada's latest invention
was a flying machine.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.540
She had built a
set of real wings,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.030
but could they actually fly?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.990
First, Ada needed to
compute the wings' power.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.930
She broke the problem
into steps-- surface area

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.410
and weight, wind
speed and angles.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.120
Multiplying and dividing
over and over again.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.240
Ada loved numbers, but these
calculations seemed endless.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.630
Wasn't there an easier way?

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.530
Writing for so long
made her fingers hurt.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.500
She wiggled them and
returned to her numbers.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.270
15 times 12 equals 180."

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.770
So what in this picture shows
us how much she liked flying

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.636
and wanted to invent
a flying machine?

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.626
What do you see?

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.412
AUDIENCE: She has
a flying horse.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.370
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right,
she has a flying horse.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.570
And in fact, that's
how she thought

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.230
it would work-- putting
wings on a horse.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.366
Yeah.

00:04:41.366 --> 00:04:43.836
AUDIENCE: A horse with
wings is called Pegasus.

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:45.086
LAURIE WALLMARK: That's right.

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:47.430
A horse with wings
is called Pegasus.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.930
Right.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.920
And now you can see her
drawing a Pegasus and then

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.940
some of the wings.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.090
[COUGHS]

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.810
"The sky darkened
and thunder crashed.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.430
Rain pounded on the roof and
pelted through the open window.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.870
Ada jumped up to
latch the shutters.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.390
The curtains flapped
in and out like sails

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.920
billowing in the wind.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.740
Sails?

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.660
Sails were like wings.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.520
Ada could use the wind to do
an experiment for her flying

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.460
machine.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.260
She grabbed her
journal and charged out

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.300
into the howling storm."

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.790
What is her expression?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.314
What do you think
she's thinking?

00:05:26.314 --> 00:05:27.200
AUDIENCE: Smiling.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.491
LAURIE WALLMARK: She's smiling.

00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:30.010
What's she thinking, though?

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.640
Yeah.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.015
What do you think
she's thinking?

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:33.995
AUDIENCE: She's thinking that
that storm will [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:34.990
LAURIE WALLMARK: Mm-hm.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.560
How about Mrs. Puff, though?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.245
What's Mrs. Puff thinking?

00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:41.120
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.036
LAURIE WALLMARK: Yeah.

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:43.640
AUDIENCE: No, don't do that!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.598
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right.

00:05:44.598 --> 00:05:46.880
Cats don't like
water, and Mrs. Puff

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.610
is not at all happy about
what's happening here.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.110
"Again and again, Ada
launched her model sailboat

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.650
across the pond.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.490
Each time, she
adjusted the sails

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.300
and studied the effect on
the little boat's speed.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.460
A storm of numbers
and calculations

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.720
whirled in her mind and
spilled onto her pages."

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.360
What's happening
with Mrs. Puff now?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000
AUDIENCE: She is under
the bed, and she does not

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.642
like water like most cats.

00:06:13.642 --> 00:06:14.600
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.452
She does not like water.

00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:18.910
She is waiting to
get out of there.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.880
That's for sure.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.760
This is my favorite
drawing in the whole book.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.610
"Night fell, Ada
returned home muddy,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.110
dripping wet, and triumphant.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.180
When Nannie saw
Ada, she scolded her

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.550
for being out in such
dreadful weather.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.020
She sniffed that she didn't
care what Lady Byron thought.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.520
Girls should not
waste their time

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.630
with math, and science,
and experiments,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.100
and other such nonsense.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.910
But to Ada, it wasn't
nonsense at all.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.190
Numbers were her friends.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.650
After dinner, she sprawled on
the floor with her puzzle book.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.730
Her head was hot and achy.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.830
The numbers squirmed
about on the page,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.120
and her eyes felt as
if they were filled

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.380
with sand from the pond."

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.240
Now, there's something
on this page that's

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.340
a little funny that I didn't
notice till a friend of mine

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.730
pointed it out.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.394
What's something funny
happening on this page?

00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:13.237
AUDIENCE: Frog.

00:07:13.237 --> 00:07:15.778
LAURIE WALLMARK: There's a frog
coming out of the boot there.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.196
Yeah?

00:07:20.196 --> 00:07:21.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.740
LAURIE WALLMARK: You're right.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.115
You know what I
think it probably

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:32.430
is is it's the inside versus
the outside of a shoe.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.240
But I never noticed
that before just

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.180
like I hadn't noticed the frog.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.380
AUDIENCE: How could
you not miss the frog?

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.360
LAURIE WALLMARK: I don't know.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.380
Like I said, illustrators bring
an awful lot to picture books.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.630
That's what's really
nice about them.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.240
"By morning, Ada
had a high fever.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.160
Nannie didn't scold now.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.810
She was worried.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.650
She cabled mama to
come home right away.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.170
Ada had the measles.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.330
For many long days
and nights, mama

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.600
read Ada her favorite books.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.290
The fever finally
broke, but the measles

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.340
left her paralyzed and blind."

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.485
Do you know what "paralyzed"
and "blind" mean?

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:14.280
AUDIENCE: I think it means like
"blind" means your eyesight is

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.225
just [INAUDIBLE] away, and
then "paralyzed" mean you can't

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:19.540
move your head or something.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.748
LAURIE WALLMARK: What do
you think "paralyzed" means?

00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:24.886
AUDIENCE: Well, I was gonna
say that when you're blind,

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:26.610
you can't see
anything [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.860
LAURIE WALLMARK: That's right.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.660
AUDIENCE: I read a book
about Helen Keller.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.780
She's blind and deaf.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.530
LAURIE WALLMARK: That's
right. "Paralyzed"

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.280
means that that part of
your body can't move.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.330
So for Ada, it was her legs.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.890
She couldn't move her legs.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.840
"To keep Ada's mind sharp, mama
quizzed her on math problems.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.670
How much was 82 minus 25?

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.790
18 times 47?

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.410
96 divided by 13?

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.140
Numbers chased each other around
and around in Ada's head."

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.630
And there she is with Mrs.
Puff keeping her company

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.090
through that long,
hard time of her life.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.090
"Mama posed ever
harder problems,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.060
and Ada solved them
all-- problems like,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.720
how long does it take
to travel to London?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.480
By carriage, it was
an overnight journey.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.100
But Ada's flying machine could
go much faster than a carriage.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.080
If Ada flew, she'd
be able to reach

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.550
London in only a few hours,
just in time for tea!

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.770
Ada's number
[INAUDIBLE] company.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.450
15 times 12 was still
180 and always would be,

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.940
whether Ada could see or not.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.850
Over the next few weeks,
her eyes got better,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.540
but it was three
long years before she

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.690
could put away her crutches.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.420
The girl who wanted to
fly could not even walk.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.400
But Ada still had her
numbers, numbers that mattered

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.520
to her more than ever."

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.810
OK, so in this picture,
there's some fantastical things

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.320
going on in this picture.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.590
What do you see?

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.998
AUDIENCE: There's a flying
angel and a flying machine

00:10:02.998 --> 00:10:06.477
[INAUDIBLE] flying machine.

00:10:06.477 --> 00:10:07.310
LAURIE WALLMARK: OK.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.190
So I think it's actually
a picture of Ada flying.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I said that.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.449
LAURIE WALLMARK: Oh, OK.

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:14.100
And what do you
see that's funny?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.780
AUDIENCE: There's a lot of tea--
there's a teapot and some--

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.196
LAURIE WALLMARK:
There's a teapot?

00:10:18.196 --> 00:10:20.180
AUDIENCE: And there's tea too.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.600
LAURIE WALLMARK: Like
creamer and sugar.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Yeah, those are not
normally buildings

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.590
that you see in town, right?

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.305
The illustrator put them
in to reflect the text.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.370
"Mama recognized her
daughter's passion.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.840
She hired tutors so
Ada could learn math

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.860
at an even higher level.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.000
Ada's favorite was Mary
Fairfax Somerville,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.090
the well-known scientist
and mathematician.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.120
Somerville was living
proof that girls

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.280
could do math and do it well.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.440
She had even written
books on the subject,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.840
another thing girls were
not supposed to do."

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.430
Now, the funny thing
about this picture

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.920
is-- see the three
women right here?

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.750
Which one do you think is Ada?

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.880
I thought it was
obvious, by the way.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.680
And clearly, it's not.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.396
So which one do you
guys think is Ada?

00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:14.970
OK, what color?

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.160
AUDIENCE: I think
it's probably blue.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.410
LAURIE WALLMARK: The blue one?

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.866
LAURIE WALLMARK: Why?

00:11:19.866 --> 00:11:21.837
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:22.670
LAURIE WALLMARK: OK.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.201
Who do you think is Ada?

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.843
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:26.967
LAURIE WALLMARK: Which one?

00:11:26.967 --> 00:11:28.350
AUDIENCE: The red one.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.200
LAURIE WALLMARK: OK.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.120
I thought it was the red one
also for several reasons.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.020
One, she's sort of
looking up to this person,

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.080
you know, like
listening to her talk.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.810
She's a little bit shorter,
and she's in front.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.760
But when I've read this
book to other kids,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.520
sometimes they say blue,
sometimes they say yellow,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.130
sometimes they say red.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.750
So something that I thought was
absolutely obvious, certainly

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.640
very true, how could anyone
believe anything else, well,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.850
they can.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.117
AUDIENCE: Which one's correct?

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.450
LAURIE WALLMARK: I have no idea.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.210
And every time I
do this, I think,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.690
I have got to email the
Illustrator and ask her.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.660
And then I forget by
the time I get home.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.111
AUDIENCE: OK. [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:17.250
LAURIE WALLMARK: [LAUGHS] I'm
sure she does know even though

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.530
I don't.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.750
"Somerville was so impressed by
Ada's sharp reasoning skills,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.340
she invited Ada and
her mother to a party.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:30.180
Not just a party for dancing and
dining, but for sharing ideas.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.740
The guests were scientists
like Michael Faraday, who

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.970
studied electromagnetism,
and Charles Wheatstone

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.810
who invented a device to display
three-dimensional images.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.230
But for Ada, the one
who mattered most

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.990
was Charles Babbage.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.400
He was a famous
mathematician and inventor,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.820
just like Ada wanted to be.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.950
Though she was only
17 and Babbage 41,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.150
Ada spoke about math with a
precision and understanding

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.950
that impressed him, so much
so that Babbage invited

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.820
her to visit his laboratory."

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.170
Funny thing about this spread
has nothing to do with my book,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.520
but has to do with
Google Boston.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.250
I was in Google
Boston two weeks ago

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.370
giving Take Your Child
to Work Day events.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.480
And I was in the
Charles Babbage room.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.592
They also have an Ada Lovelace
room and a Grace Hopper room.

00:13:23.592 --> 00:13:25.300
And I'm writing a book
about Grace Hopper

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.340
that comes out next year.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.830
But I was in the Babbage room.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.170
"Ada brought her journals to
show him her own experiments

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.450
and inventions.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.750
Their tea grew cold as they
talked about their love

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.140
of machines and mathematics.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.690
Babbage didn't see her
as simply a young girl.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.460
He treated her like the fellow
mathematician and inventor

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.380
she already was.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.590
Before, numbers had
been Ada's only friends.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.210
Now Babbage was a
friend as well."

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.710
OK.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:03.820
Ada's looking at a mechanical
doll that Babbage had.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.900
But look at her
magnifying glass.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.880
What do you see in that glass?

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.502
AUDIENCE: It's a bird.

00:14:09.502 --> 00:14:11.210
LAURIE WALLMARK: Just
a regular old bird?

00:14:14.012 --> 00:14:15.413
AUDIENCE: It's a fish bird!

00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:18.220
A flying fish.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.900
LAURIE WALLMARK: I think it is
a mechanical bird just like she

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.780
was dreaming of before.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.430
Now she's seeing a machine,
this mechanical doll.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.574
And in her mind-- yeah.

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:32.024
AUDIENCE: Why would
he make it and then--

00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:34.190
LAURIE WALLMARK: He didn't
make the mechanical doll.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.310
He had bought it.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.270
AUDIENCE: Who?

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.710
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.150
LAURIE WALLMARK: I don't know.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.550
AUDIENCE: What did he make?

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.990
He made the [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.900
LAURIE WALLMARK: No,
he made the machine

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.646
that we're going
to see in a moment.

00:14:46.646 --> 00:14:50.660
OK, so let's-- in fact, here
we are in the moment where

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.250
we're going to see the machine.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.350
"Babbage showed Ada
his difference engine,

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.060
a revolutionary
mechanical calculator.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.340
He knew Ada would understand
how his extraordinary invention

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.490
worked.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.460
Ada did more than understand.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.490
She couldn't wait to see the
difference engine in action.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.560
She chose to have the machine
solve a simple problem, one

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.030
she could easily do in
her head-- 15 times 12."

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.658
OK, so how big is a calculator?

00:15:18.658 --> 00:15:20.490
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.156
LAURIE WALLMARK: How
big's a calculator?

00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:22.822
AUDIENCE: Small.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:24.010
Enough to fit in your hand.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:24.968
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right.

00:15:24.968 --> 00:15:26.800
It's about hand size.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.220
It is certainly not this big.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's a--

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.553
LAURIE WALLMARK: But back then--

00:15:31.553 --> 00:15:33.224
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.640
LAURIE WALLMARK:
Back then, that's

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.330
what you needed to have just
something that could add,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.330
subtract, multiply, and divide.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.520
"Reaching inside the machine,
Ada rotated the metal columns

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.050
until the numbers
15 and 12 appeared.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.370
With a crank of the handle,
she powered the calculator.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.930
Gears clicked and turned,
cylinders pumped up and down,

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.140
small hammers clanked as
the number spiraled upward,

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.960
guiding the machine to
the correct solution.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.150
After a few turns of
the handle, the answer

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.820
appeared on the
final column-- 180.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.110
It was right."

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.020
Now, when I was doing
research for the book--

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.820
and I did a lot of research,
as you can imagine--

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.300
one of the things I
found was the Computer

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.790
Museum out in California had
built a difference engine.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.390
And they have,
speaking of YouTube,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.010
they have it on YouTube.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.900
You can see it in action.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.930
So that's how I knew about
things spiraling upward

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.240
and things clanking, because I
could see the machine that they

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.450
built.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.370
"Babbage told Ada he had
designed an even more powerful

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.720
device, a mechanical computer.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.270
His analytical engine
would solve harder problems

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.850
by working through
them step by step.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.700
It could even make decisions
all by itself, a true thinking

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.470
machine.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.550
The only trouble was Babbage
hadn't actually built it.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.280
In fact, he never built it.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.360
He ran out of money.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.986
Ada carried home a stack
of Babbage's lab books,

00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:13.455
30 in all, filled with notes
about the analytical engine.

00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:16.750
[INAUDIBLE] she studied
the technical descriptions

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.170
and pored over the diagrams.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.880
Ada quickly realized that
without instructions,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.450
the analytical engine would be
a useless pile of metal parts.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.850
It needed numbers
to make it work--

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.020
her numbers, her friends.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.180
Ada decided to
create an algorithm,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.990
a set of mathematical
instructions

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.990
for the analytical engine.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.080
The machine could follow
these instructions

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.150
and solve a complex math
problem, one difficult

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.650
to figure out by hand."

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:50.690
In this picture, do you see
something in this picture

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.850
that you see on me?

00:17:56.544 --> 00:17:57.960
AUDIENCE: The thing
on your shirt.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.585
LAURIE WALLMARK: The
thing on my shirt.

00:17:59.585 --> 00:18:02.480
This is a punched card,
and this was the way

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.750
that the machine would
receive instructions.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.320
It would just be
a card with holes

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.650
punched in the right places.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.149
Yeah?

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.149
AUDIENCE: Is that
why you picked these?

00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:15.799
Or is that why you
picked the shirt?

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:17.340
LAURIE WALLMARK:
Well, remember I had

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.190
nothing to do with the picture.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.542
The illustrator did the picture.

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:22.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but is that
why you picked that shirt?

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.110
LAURIE WALLMARK: Yes.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.651
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:18:23.651 --> 00:18:26.360
LAURIE WALLMARK: And the person
who made this shirt-- it also

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.701
says "Lovelace, 1815,"
which is when she was born.

00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:32.200
OK.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.540
So here's Mrs. Puff.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.250
What do you think
she's thinking?

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.250
Yeah.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.872
AUDIENCE: I need to go to bed,
because I'm still stretching.

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:43.080
LAURIE WALLMARK: I think
Mrs. Puff is a little bored.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.450
Watching someone else do
computer programming is not

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:47.770
the most exciting thing.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.270
Yeah.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.811
AUDIENCE: No.

00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:51.474
She has, like, a-- has
a happy face, like,

00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:54.925
uh, yeah, you do that,
I'm gonna fall asleep.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.880
Now [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.240
LAURIE WALLMARK: Oh, she
just doesn't need to do it.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.670
It's time for her to go to bed.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.248
I see.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.490
"She worked for months,
revising her instructions.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.540
Countless lines of
numbers and symbols

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.740
poured onto her journal pages.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.880
After checking and
rechecking her algorithm

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.560
through the night, Ada
finally laid down her pen.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.920
She hadn't found any errors.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.940
The world's first computer
program was complete.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.550
The gears of Ada's mind
whirred with possibilities

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.870
for future inventions,
all controlled

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.970
by computing machines.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.770
She imagined computers
would someday

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:35.780
design powerful flying machines
and majestic sailing ships.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.490
They would draw pictures
and compose music.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.530
And they would play games
and help with homework."

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.330
These are things that you're
used to computers doing today,

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.910
right?

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.890
But back then, it truly
was revolutionary.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.980
It was like science fiction
that someone would think this.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.990
Yeah.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.914
AUDIENCE: Why would she--
wait, did you just write that?

00:19:59.914 --> 00:20:02.550
Because that's what
I'm thinking right now.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.184
LAURIE WALLMARK:
She thought that up.

00:20:05.184 --> 00:20:07.345
AUDIENCE: No, you
made the lady up.

00:20:07.345 --> 00:20:08.970
LAURIE WALLMARK: I
made the writing up,

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.670
yes, but she is the one
who thought that computers

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.820
might be able to compose music.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.070
She is the one that thought
that they could be used

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.482
by engineers to design things.

00:20:18.482 --> 00:20:21.870
AUDIENCE: You are, because
you made her think that.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.100
LAURIE WALLMARK: Well, since she
was born in 1815, which was--

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.486
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but you made her.

00:20:26.486 --> 00:20:28.111
LAURIE WALLMARK:
[LAUGHS] In some ways,

00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:29.680
I made her come to life, yes.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.060
But the other thing I want to
point out on this page, here

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.270
are her notes where she
wrote the computer program.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.520
And it just says AAL.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.060
It stands for either Ada
Augusta Lovelace or Augusta Ada

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.770
Lovelace.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.390
And I can never
remember which one,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.410
and I always forget
to keep looking it up.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:53.090
But the important part is
it's only her initials.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.160
Why didn't she sign her name
to this very important work

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.914
that she did?

00:20:57.914 --> 00:21:00.152
AUDIENCE: Because she
didn't want to brag.

00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:01.860
LAURIE WALLMARK: She
didn't want to brag.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.720
That could be.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.470
What do you think?

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.478
Why do you think?

00:21:04.478 --> 00:21:07.522
AUDIENCE: Because
she didn't want to.

00:21:07.522 --> 00:21:09.520
You made her do that.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.394
Because you made her.

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.393
LAURIE WALLMARK: Uh-huh.

00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:12.926
Dads, why do you think?

00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:15.210
AUDIENCE: Maybe she didn't
want the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.500
LAURIE WALLMARK: They
didn't want-- she was afraid

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.210
if people knew she
was a woman, they

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.390
wouldn't take it seriously.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.500
They would think, oh, it's just
a girl, a woman who did that,

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.570
so it can't be right.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.400
But it was right.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.330
It was revolutionary back
in that time and even later.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.990
Do you people know, I assume,
the Harry Potter books?

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.150
Who wrote "Harry Potter?"

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.470
AUDIENCE: JK Rowling!

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.610
LAURIE WALLMARK: Or Jo
Rowling is her name.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.110
Right?

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.321
But she didn't use
her name either.

00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.134
AUDIENCE: I remember reading
the second "Harry Potter."

00:21:50.134 --> 00:21:51.009
LAURIE WALLMARK: Yup.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:51.940
AUDIENCE: That's how I know.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:52.898
LAURIE WALLMARK: Right.

00:21:52.898 --> 00:21:54.820
So even now, women
sometimes will just

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.246
use their initials
instead of their name.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.730
"Because Babbage never finished
building the analytical engine,

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.390
Ada never got to
see her program run.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.930
But the influence of
her work lives on.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.320
More than 100 years
before the invention

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.580
of the modern computer,
Ada had glimpsed the future

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.830
and created a new profession--
computer programming.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.350
Ada couldn't know that one
day a computer language

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.170
would be named after her-- Ada.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.900
And one of Ada's uses-- to
guide modern flying machines.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.350
The girl who needed crutches
ended up flying after all."

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.870
And that's the story of Ada.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.370
Yeah.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.837
AUDIENCE: I don't
know any computer

00:22:37.837 --> 00:22:40.742
stuff that has Ada in it.

00:22:40.742 --> 00:22:42.450
LAURIE WALLMARK: The
programming language

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.770
Ada was developed by the
Department of Defense.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.990
And for a while,
every program written

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.810
by people in the Army, the Navy,
the Marines, the Air Force--

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.410
AUDIENCE: They name
it Ada, though?

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.470
LAURIE WALLMARK: They named
it after Ada to honor her.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.290
LAURIE WALLMARK: She's real.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.830
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.371
LAURIE WALLMARK:
She's a real person.

00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:01.020
Absolutely.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.960
AUDIENCE: Wait, is
this the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.508
LAURIE WALLMARK: This is a
biography of a real person.

00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:07.900
AUDIENCE: Wait,
so does that mean

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.173
I could use this for a
biography [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:10.173 --> 00:23:11.506
LAURIE WALLMARK: Yes, you could.

00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:12.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.294
LAURIE WALLMARK: And if
you look in the back,

00:23:14.294 --> 00:23:17.340
there's a little bit more
information about her program

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.314
and some of her nicknames.
