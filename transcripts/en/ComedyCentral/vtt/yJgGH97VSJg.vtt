00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:06.240
- TURN TO THE RIGHT.
EYES FORWARD.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:15.315
- GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN.
I'M WARDEN SMALLS.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.819
- [stifles laugh]
- ELECTRIC CHAIR!

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.021
[electricity crackles]

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.791
ANYWAY, I RUN A FAIR AND
HONORABLE CHRISTIAN PRISON HERE.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.295
RULE NUMBER ONE--
NO SARCASM.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.564
- [sarcastically]
AW, THAT'S A GREAT RULE.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.667
- WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE GOT US
A REBEL HERE.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.836
TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.371
- OW!
WHY'D YOU HIT ME?

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.173
- BECAUSE AS THE BIBLE SAYS,

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.340
IT'S MUCH MORE PAINFUL

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:43.210
TO WATCH YOUR FRIEND SUFFER
FOR YOUR SINS.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.512
- [sarcastically]
OH, YEAH, IT IS.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.314
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
MORE SARCASM, BOY.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.448
- UNH!

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.450
- [sarcastically]
OH, NO, PLEASE, STOP.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.486
- I'LL BREAK YOU
OF THAT SARCASM, SON,

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.956
IF I HAVE TO BREAK EVERY BILLY
CLUB OVER YOUR FRIEND'S HEAD.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.858
- OW! HEY!
AH, STOP! OH!

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.793
GOD DAMN!

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.361
[sarcastically]
UM, HEY, WARDEN,

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.665
THAT'S A REALLY NICE TIE.
TAKE THAT, MALLOY!

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.066
OW!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.101
I THOUGHT MY FRIEND
HAD TO SUFFER FOR MY SINS.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.237
- I WAS BEING SARCASTIC,
IDIOT!

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.072
WELCOME
TO HAZELHURST PRISON.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.108
I GUARANTEE YOU BOYS
GONNA STAY IN LINE,

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:18.078
OR MY NAME ISN'T
WARDEN TINY SMALLS.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.982
- [stifles laugh]
- ELECTRIC CHAIR!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.117
[electricity crackling]

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.555
- SCARE ME STRAIGHT, HUH?
GOOD PLAN, WOODY.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:31.625
WHEN WE GET HOME, I'M GONNA
SPANK THE SHIT OUT OF YOU!

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.093
- YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME,
MALLOY.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.095
YOU'RE STAYING HERE
UNTIL YOU'VE LEARNED A LESSON.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.464
- OH, YOU'RE GETTING
AN ANGRY SPANKING NOW!

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.632
GET ME OUT OF HERE, WOODY.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.100
- WELL, I--NO!

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.636
NO, I MADE MY DECISION,
AND I'M STICKING TO IT!

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.671
GOOD-BYE, MALLOY!

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.640
BE STRONG, PAPA BEAR.
[sniffles]

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.908
DON'T LOOK BACK.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.443
IT'S CALLED TOUGH LOVE.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.812
[crying]

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.013
- OH, WHAT THE--

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.849
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?
LEAVE ME ALONE!
