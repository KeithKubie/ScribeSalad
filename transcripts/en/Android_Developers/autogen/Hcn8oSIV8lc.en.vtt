 focused video series plus one aspect 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 android application design since 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.119
 the design theme design first thing that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.250
 Do you know the android design? 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 we have a center is basically a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.410
 part of developer with 2 points with 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.320
 design bar where you find a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.860
 series of guides good practice references 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 all about android application design 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.329
 so you can go in there and get 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 within several sessions that we have

 practices and examples and everything else

 It's good to spend a little bit on each 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.579
 area that you can find in relation to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.649
 the design thing has a guide there that I 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 would spend if you're coming as 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.400
 android now coming from the platform comes from 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.720
 world or is starting to get 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 venture into the design part of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.700
 applications or even developer 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 wants to improve his skills there. 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 how to think nothing has developed a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 application has been and has been 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 show an overview of all 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 components as it organizes them from 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.570
 android 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 it's really worth seeing if you want 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.829
 Do you want to be inspired by some 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.509
 It's okay. 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.200
 besides that we have to worry 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.600
 with style is simply to do well 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 prettier make a chart also has 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 his own style involving style 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.049
 surrounds the icon that you use 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.259
 application involves the letter 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.420
 colors are then in this area of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.040
 style you will find several branches 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.460
 but several best practice tips for 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.380
 you apply to your application as well 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.899
 So if you want to participate, just 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.090
 designing your application is legal the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 your android crop looks like 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.659
 platform is escaped with the platform 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.000
 android is this is very important that 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.310
 the user is not confused to use his 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.509
 application for this we have from 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.430
 of uai standards 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.410
 including an example of how you can 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.540
 implement that pattern 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.130
 within your android application that is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
 very important so that you can 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.750
 so it's giving all user support 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.620
 so that it feels good to use your 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.970
 software 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 We're going to have some things. 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 leaving the action a bar as you have 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.690
 to use each of these types of 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.280
 good component is also important 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 when you are going to design an application 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 that you know which are the main 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 components so that it can be applied and 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.410
 combine your components 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.830
 for example some things about lists 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.670
 about tevez is under fragmente all vain 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.500
 understand 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.230
 using your share here of ours 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.210
 our design with a guide a guide on 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.290
 components that are in your 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.470
 disposition 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.450
 good but there intends to plan already 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.090
 know the patterns saw what are the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.030
 components you want to draw is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.490
 make a mockup of your interface is cool 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.130
 we have a session where I can download 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.410
 resources to be able to compose this 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.870
 interface is in your design software 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.090
 favorite or even if you want 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.920
 sketched on paper and then pass this 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.380
 question the software is very interesting 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.680
 to find various resources there 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.200
 available for download, you are good and 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.750
 But it's cool, I've read enough. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.790
 a little bit to feel some difficulty 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.220
 No problem, we have some videos. 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.010
 especially the last goal I'm here 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.530
 google and 2013 that will address several 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.530
 Today's themes go you can watch there 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.540

 attend the lecture takes your question and 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.230
 makes a top-of-the-line android app 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.620
 well keep an eye on the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.630

 it's ok you do not get disconnected from there 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.220
 It's only you can publish any 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.959
 application in our store
