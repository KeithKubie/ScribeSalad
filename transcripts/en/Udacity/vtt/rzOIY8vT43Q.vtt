00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.090
Well in fact, there's many variables that can influence the number of drowning

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.370
deaths. So I can swim here because I'm in a city where it's warm and near the

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.061
ocean. So location and climate can both influence the number of drowning

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.477
deaths. But they can also influence the number of ice cream cones people eat.

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:19.220
In fact, there's a ton of reasons why ice cream cone consumption can be related

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.440
to drowning death. But this correlation does not imply causation. So, how can

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.140
we determine whether one thing causes the other? We have to do what's called an

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.670
experimental study. So, why don't we head back to my office and see if we can

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.577
come up with a good experiment to do?
