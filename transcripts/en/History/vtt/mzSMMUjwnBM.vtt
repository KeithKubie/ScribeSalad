00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.130
I have been dealing with the
mice for up to a month now.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.930
They've just been waking
me up and making me nervous

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.000
about getting holes in my gear.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.370
I do not like mice.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.500
So I named my [inaudible].

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.300
This is one I've killed five
or six on, something like that.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.000
The first one in
Vancouver Island,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.470
the one that I was catching a
lot of them on, I named Slayer.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.500
This one is Slayer Number 2.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.270
I thought that was a
good name, Slayer 2.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.330
And this is the one
I just made that I

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.500
caught one on just today--

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.270
The Death Dealer.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.930
Man, I can't tell you what a
nice night it was last night

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.370
not listening to them.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.600
Believe me, I can sleep through.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.700
But when they're just
boring into your skull,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.830
it's just-- it's so
frustrating, man.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.700
And last night, I woke
up, it was just silent.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.430
I loved it.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.330
Here comes the rain.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830
Ah, there was just
a mouse right there.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.900
How many of these [bleep]
do I have to kill?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.270
[bleep]

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.730
[bleep]

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.770
Damn it!

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.100
[bleep] this place.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.900
Not [bleep] enjoying
myself anymore, man.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.270
[bleep] damn it, ya
[bleep] little bastards.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.230
I am not having fun anymore.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.570
Just one more day.
You can do it.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.430
Just one more day.
