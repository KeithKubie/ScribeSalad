00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.967
NARRATOR: Imagine
life in 12,000 BC.

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:08.467
There are no societies, no
protections, no guarantees,

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.767
just small bands
of nomads wandering

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:15.200
the woods of Eurasia trying
to survive in a hostile world.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.133
BRIAN FAGAN: These
people lived in very

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.233
predator-rich environments.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.400
Lots of animals who
regarded humans as prey.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.300
Fire was a deterrent.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.700
It protected you
against predators.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.166
[barking]

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:41.667
[non-english speech]

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:51.066
[barking and howling]

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.500
[crying]

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.900
NARRATOR: Imagine a
life so fragile, so

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.900
fraught with uncertainty,
only fire offers a chance

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.066
at survival moment to moment.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.567
[animal sounds]

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:19.100
[non-english speech]

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.734
[animal sounds]

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:42.133
NARRATOR: This is the moment in
time when life for Homo sapiens

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.667
depends on this trick.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.467
Take control of
the natural world

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.633
and create a weapon
to fight back.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.467
Fire gave us the
chance at a future.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.767
[non-english speech]

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.500
[growling]
