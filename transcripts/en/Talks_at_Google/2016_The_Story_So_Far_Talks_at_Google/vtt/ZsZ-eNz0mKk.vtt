00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:02.070
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.330
Thank you all very
much for coming.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.260
What a great turnout.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.510
My name is Artur Oliveira.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.360
I am one of the Chicago
leads for Talks at Google.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.610
I also work in people
dev on my daytime job.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.990
I am very happy today to
introduce to you Jerry Buting.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.890
He is a defense attorney
from Brookfield, Wisconsin.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.490
I think a lot of you
have heard of him

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.200
on Netflix's "Making a Murder."

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.790
Him and his partner in
that case, Dean Strang,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.630
are going on
national tour to talk

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.900
about justice, a
conversation on justice

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600
and the criminal justice system.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.530
So with that, if we
could please help

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.480
me welcome up Jerry
up to the stage.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.584
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.512 --> 00:00:44.488
JERRY BUTING: OK?

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:45.952
Hello.

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:46.550
Right here?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.425
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah.

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:48.040
This is for you.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.748
JERRY BUTING: OK.

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:52.430
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
Welcome to Google.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.880
JERRY BUTING: Thank you.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.340
Thank you.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.790
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank
you for being here.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.790
JERRY BUTING: Thanks,
everybody, for coming out.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.210
This is a beautiful afternoon.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.060
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: It
is a beautiful day.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.160
Summer should be here--
is here, I guess it is.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.993
JERRY BUTING: It is.

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:01.980
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.200
Well, Jerry, like I said,
thank you for being here.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.380
We know that you're on tour.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.991
You and Dean are going on tour.

00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.740
You've been on tour
for a couple of weeks.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.080
You have a few more
stops along the way.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.290
What brought about that tour?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.700
JERRY BUTING: You know, it
really sort of arose out

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.950
of what we saw happening after
the documentary came out.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.100
As the media would
ask us about it,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.810
they would interview us-- it
was the same sort of process

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.560
that we saw before
the trial, where

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.260
when we were interviewed or,
let's say, during those press

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.150
conferences that you saw
at the end of each day

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.990
in the documentary, we'd go
through 20 minutes, some 30

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.260
minutes of interview.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.190
And then two minutes
would end up on the TV,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.140
and what they would pick
would be sometimes silly,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.370
sometimes not.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.740
But in any event,
two minutes wasn't

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.790
enough to deal with the
really serious issues

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.119
that this documentary
brings to the forefront.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.410
And so we just talked about it.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.951
And I said, wouldn't
it be good if we

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.010
could have a forum where we
could actually-- unfiltered

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.979
from the media, people could
come, write their questions

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.980
down, have a moderator
ask them what's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.740
on people's minds, and not
just an individual reporter,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.260
and really have more of a
conversation about the issues,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.430
not just in this case,
but in lots of cases?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.870
And so that's what happened.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.860
And we promoted or suggested
we could do a couple shows.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.730
And then those
worked successfully,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.865
and then it kind of grew
into the national tour.

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:41.740
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Sure.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.040
That's really interesting.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.165
You're in Chicago
tonight, and thank you

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.650
for stopping by Google.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.330
And as I was thinking about the
opportunity to talk with you,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.570
specifically on the
criminal justice system,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.880
something that came
to mind right away

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.600
was something that
you said, actually,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.530
in the documentary when you
mentioned that we can always

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.850
say we're never going
to commit a crime,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.240
but we can never
guarantee that we'll never

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920
be accused of a crime.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.860
In that situation, good luck in
this criminal justice system.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.980
And that, to me, was a
very powerful statement.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.190
And so I wanted to bring it
up to you again and just ask,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.570
what are the implications of
that to us as private citizens?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.527
What is the implication
of that to our society?

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:29.860
JERRY BUTING: I can't say
that it's an original thought.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.500
It's a bedrock of our
criminal justice system.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.630
It's why we have a
presumption of innocence.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.040
It's why we have the state
with the burden of proof

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.970
and not the defendant, because
again, you just don't know.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.770
If somebody is going to
falsely accuse you, it's tough.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.800
And you hope that
people will give you

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.160
the benefit of the
doubt and apply

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.430
the presumption of innocence.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.560
The reason I said "good
luck" is because that's

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.440
shifting a little
bit in the last 20,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.380
30 years maybe, where I
think it's harder for people

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.410
to do that.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.490
There's much more of
a punitive attitude.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.550
Now, in the very recent year or
two, it's starting to change.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.329
But it's been more
difficult to get

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.080
people to put aside
their preconceptions

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.710
about-- particularly in
a high-profile case--

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.030
and really apply the
presumption of innocence.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.810
And what happens is a
judge sits up there,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.180
and they read and then
later give a packet

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.510
to a jury when they
go off to deliberate,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.830
a written list of
jury instructions.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.220
The definitions--
well, what does it

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.530
mean to be presumed innocent?

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.340
And what is the state's
burden of proof?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.047
And it's very dry, and
it's hard for people

00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:55.880
to apply it in their
own lives, because it's

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.390
different than what
you would do normally.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.950
If somebody-- I say
is with parents.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.980
If you have a child,
and one kid comes to you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.480
and says, he started it, and
the other one says, no, no, no,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.810
she started it, and
you're, well, you

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.260
want to hear both sides, and
you want to try and weigh one

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.490
against the other.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.290
That's sort of intuitively
what we do in our daily lives,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.410
but that's not what you're
supposed to do in a court,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.860
because you have to
presume the person who's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.150
been accused
innocent, and then you

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.590
have to make the state
disprove that, prove

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.210
to you that they're guilty.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.040
And it's something that's a
little bit counter-intuitive.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.129
And it's hard, if a judge is
just reading off some dry jury

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.920
instruction, for people
to really get that.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.100
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: When it comes
to the presumption of innocence

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.680
and putting the burden
of proof on the state,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.710
how has the evolution
of technology

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.150
and real-time communication
actually gets faster and faster

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.100
and more and more every
year, how does that

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.440
impact a defense case?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.430
JERRY BUTING: You know,
it's a real challenge.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.010
And it's probably
a bigger challenge

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.070
when the trial's
going on in terms

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.870
of jurors are not--
they're supposed

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.020
to base their decisions only
on the evidence in court

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.950
and not what someone tells
them outside of court,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.668
what they read in a newspaper,
or more likely, online.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.860
And it's difficult
to-- first of all,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.270
juries, by and large,
are not sequestered,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.100
like in the old days, where if
it was a serious homicide case,

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.660
the jury was
sequestered, they'd stay

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.240
in a hotel throughout the trial.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.640
And most of the time, it
doesn't happen anymore.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.250
They go home.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.890
They're told, don't watch
TV, don't look things up.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.570
And in this case, as a matter
of fact, in the Avery case,

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.050
I just happened to-- I was
going back through a transcript,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.250
and I saw that
there were things--

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.260
at the end of the
six-week trial,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.790
stuff was coming up
that some of the jurors

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.210
may not have been following
those instructions.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.340
And the judge went through
a whole question-and-answer

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.150
one-on-one of each juror.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.910
And we kind of suspected which
ones were maybe the offenders,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.830
but he brought them
all out, so that nobody

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.890
would be singled out.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.810
And one of them admitted
that her husband

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.150
had very strong opinions.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.330
And he'd watch the TV and
see what would happen.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.720
And he would tell us what went
on once we left the courtroom.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.230
And the juror denied
that but had admitted it

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.570
to another juror.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.660
And so it was kind of one
juror's word against the other.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.600
Another incident
that came up was

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.010
that they were talking about
how the judge said-- because

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.270
by then, even 8, 10 years ago,
judges were instructing jurors,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.750
don't go online,
don't look stuff up,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.610
stay off the computer.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.470
And now cellphones--
I mean, smartphones.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.120
As technology evolves, it's
becoming harder and harder.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.080
But one of the jurors was
asking questions about, well,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.520
nobody would ever know if you
deleted it off your hard drive.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.690
And another one was saying,
oh, no, you can't do that.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.200
It's there.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.850
They can still find it.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.091
And this juror who was
saying they would never

00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:37.090
find it all of a sudden
became white as a ghost.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.289
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.780
As if they had been doing that.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.039
And all of-- uh-oh,
I could get caught.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.720
So it is a challenge.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.410
And short of really,
really getting people

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.660
to promise and understand
why it's important

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.320
that they focus only on the
evidence in the courtroom,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.910
not something--
particularly nowadays.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.910
I mean, you go online,
you hear-- everybody's

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.090
got a point of view.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.970
So much of it is
just speculation.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.846
And it really wouldn't
be fair to anybody

00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:12.220
to go through a
process like that

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.620
and have your guilt or
innocence decided online

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.394
rather than in a courtroom.

00:09:17.394 --> 00:09:18.310
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Right.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.810
Yeah.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.930
No doubt.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.430
I think if any of
us found ourselves

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.471
in that situation, that's
what we would hope for.

00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:25.420
But people can't help
but comment sometimes

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.917
and make that decision.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:27.750
JERRY BUTING: Right.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.030
Gossip is a tough
thing to avoid.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.990
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Now, at the end
of any case involving a jury,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.970
a jury has to make
a decision, right?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:43.470
And when it comes to
the impact to society,

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.540
what would be more preferable?

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.370
Would it be a wrongful
conviction or would it

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.570
be a wrongful acquittal?

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.260
JERRY BUTING: Well,
you know, historically,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.070
an American system of
justice-- it really

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.710
goes back even beyond that.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.610
But there's an old
saying that it's

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.690
better the 10 guilty
people go free

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.920
than one innocent person
be convicted and go away

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.090
to prison.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.050
And that's been a
fundamental belief,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.370
I think, for a long, long time.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.660
I'm not so sure that it is
quite the same nowadays.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.930
I think there are, frankly,
some people who might think, ah,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:30.880
well, we got to crack down on
this-- look at Guantanamo Bay

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.070
or look at somebody who's
accused of terrorism.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.470
Would you rather 10 terrorists
go free or one wrongly

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.050
convicted person
who wasn't involved

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.930
in terrorism be imprisoned?

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.632
And a lot of it is
people are scared.

00:10:47.632 --> 00:10:49.090
They're worried
about their safety.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.070
Politicians take
advantage of that.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.310
They demagogue about it.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.870
They run on let's
get tough on crime,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:02.300
let's lock 'em up, throw
away the key mentality.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.740
And that is finally, I would
say in the last couple of years,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.910
starting to be
challenged by people.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.170
And for the first
time in my life,

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:19.180
I've heard both major parties--
the presidential debates talk

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.140
about criminal justice reform
and the mass incarceration

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.390
problem that we have
in this country.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.000
In my state, Wisconsin,
we now-- in fact,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.120
for the last few years,
we have surpassed--

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.480
the budget for Department
of Corrections, prisons,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.920
is bigger than the entire
University of Wisconsin system

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.640
statewide.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.309
All the branches, all
the different campuses.

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:45.100
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: As
someone who's an alumnus

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.770
from the University
of Wisconsin,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.540
it's really difficult
to hear that.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.590
JERRY BUTING: It's sad.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.440
But people are waking up, and
they're saying, wait a minute,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.680
this doesn't make sense.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.330
Why are we spending this much?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.350
I mean, way more than the rest
of the world, particularly

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.570
the English-speaking
world at least.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.840
And you know, with our
historical English common law,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.457
it has not been that
way until recently.

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:11.290
And it really, I think,
started in the '80s,

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:18.470
with the cocaine and crack
wars, and the mandatory minimum

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:23.250
prison sentences that resulted.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.880
But people are
starting to push back.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.580
And now I'm hopeful that
there's some reform of that

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.535
coming soon.

00:12:29.535 --> 00:12:30.410
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.810
It seems like the situation
in the prisons in this country

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.490
is starting to get
attention finally.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:43.790
And what are your thoughts
on the correctional facility,

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.800
as some people like to call it?

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.330
We've seen, as you
said, explosion

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.830
in the number of
prisons, we've seen

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.530
the privatization of prisons.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.750
How do you interact with
that idea as an attorney?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.346
JERRY BUTING: Well,
first thing you do

00:12:58.346 --> 00:12:59.720
is try and convince
the judge not

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.970
to send your client to prison.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.800
And often, we're
successful in that.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.330
Sometimes not.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.100
What's really hard
is when there's

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.280
a statute that has
a mandatory minimum,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.020
that if you're convicted,
you will go to prison.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.340
And they're getting rid
of parole by and large

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.530
in most states,
including Wisconsin.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:24.700
So you know, if they say "five
years," it means five years.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.250
Or if they say "25
years," it means 25 years.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.880
You don't get out
after a third or half

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.090
or-- and that's also
been part of the reason

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.790
that the prison population
has exploded like it has.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:42.390
But it's a very expensive
way to punish people,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.490
especially when you don't
have rehabilitation going on

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.760
at the same time.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.500
Because the vast majority
of people in prison

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.140
will be released back into
society at some point.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.120
And if they don't
have a helping hand,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.420
there are programs
now-- one famous one

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.680
is called Second Chance.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.340
It's very successful and I'd
like to see emulated more.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.110
But prisoners who get out and
back into society, particularly

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.709
if they've been in
5, 10 years, or more,

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:17.750
they need a helping hand.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.869
It's hard to get a job,
hard to get a place to live.

00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:22.660
Even if they want to
be law-abiding and try

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.120
and reintegrate into
society, it's tough.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.910
It's even worse for people,
whether you go to prison

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.780
or not, who are convicted
of sex offenses these days.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.330
The sex offender
registry has just

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.700
exploded beyond
anyone's original idea.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.720
The idea was that
there's a few-- a very,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.770
really small slice
of sex offenders who

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.420
might be dangerous to
others in the neighborhood

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.080
and that you should
have the right

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.690
to know if you've got
a sex offender living

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.720
in the block down or two
blocks away, if you've

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.030
got your children running free.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:03.210
But what people don't
realize is that 95% or more

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.520
of sex offenses occur not from
a stranger in the neighborhood

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.730
or a stranger who abducts
a child, particularly

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.430
child sexual assaults,
it's someone they know.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:19.800
95%, it's a stepfather, or a
father, an uncle, or brother.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.750
It's somebody that,
being on a sex offender

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.550
registry is not going
to make you any safer.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.600
And then when they expanded it
to include even teenagers who

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.120
have consensual but
still illegal sex,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.020
it's a sex offense.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.490
You know, there's
tens of thousands

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.627
of people on sex offender
registries in every state now.

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.710
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: And the
impact of that of not just

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.420
jobs, but apartments.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.550
JERRY BUTING: And the impact.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.950
They can't live.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.660
There are places--
this is really--

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.040
to show you how insane
it's gotten, in Milwaukee,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.470
as a lot of places, they passed
ordinances saying you cannot

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.330
live if you're a registered
sex offender within 1,000 feet

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.540
or 2,000 feet of a school,
park, playground, whatever.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.150
And it's gotten
to the point where

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.060
it covers the entire city now.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.570
And the Department
of Corrections,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.880
when they supervise
somebody, whether they're

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.860
on probation or
parole, they've got

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.710
to place these people somewhere.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.089
And so what they've done is
it said "you cannot reside."

00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:19.380
This was actually in the paper.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.430
What they've done is the
parole and probation agents

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.490
tell the clients,
stay, don't reside.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.010
Go stay with your
mother, or your sister,

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.720
or your brother for
three or four days.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.995
And then go live in a
park 'n ride parking lot--

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:37.870
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Geez.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.411
JERRY BUTING: --for
a couple of days.

00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:40.240
And then go back.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.150
And kind of move around like a
shell game, because you're not

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.390
actually residing anyplace.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.910
And now Milwaukee's
response is, well,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.160
we're going to change the
ordinance to say "you cannot

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.020
stay overnight in any residence
in the city of Milwaukee

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.140
or within 1,000 feet of schools,
which they overlap to the point

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.390
where there's no
place they can live.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.250
And therefore, I mean,
you've got homeless people

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.910
who are really no risk
to re-offend, probably

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.329
a bigger risk to
re-offend the more

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.630
ostracized and homeless they
become than if they are treated

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.089
more fairly to begin with.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.564
But that's just one example.

00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:23.480
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Right.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.631
Yeah.

00:17:25.631 --> 00:17:26.130
Yeah.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.838
And that's tough.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:30.120
That's a tough reality to face.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.650
And speaking of the
mandatory minimums,

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.680
how does that impact a
person's right to appeal?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.044
And how does that impact
their appeal process?

00:17:39.044 --> 00:17:40.960
And how has the appeals
process in the country

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.601
changed over the
last few decades?

00:17:43.601 --> 00:17:45.350
JERRY BUTING: Well,
the mandatory minimums

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.480
don't directly affect the
appeal process in any way

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.920
any more than
anything else does.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.350
But one thing that I think
people don't understand

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.250
about the appeals
system, they think

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:01.370
that if the jury gets it wrong,
that it'll be fixed on appeal.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.700
You have a right to an appeal,
and the Court of Appeals

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.510
will correct the jury's mistake.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.490
And it doesn't work that way.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.410
The appellate
system is much more

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.970
focused on what's called
finality of judgment,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.660
finalizing the
conviction if there's

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.070
a conviction in criminal cases
than it is in seeking justice.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:31.630
And so it becomes very
difficult. 95% of appeals

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.440
are not reversed.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.700
And there are many cases
where the court will say,

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:44.520
well, we might have ruled
differently than this jury,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.140
and we don't think this
evidence was that strong or that

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.430
compelling, but we're not
going to second-guess them.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.120
And unless you can
show that there

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.620
are errors of law
that the judge made,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.760
mistakes that they made in
evidence allowing or not

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.295
being allowed in,
you're not going

00:19:01.295 --> 00:19:02.420
to have a chance on appeal.

00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:09.800
Even originally when
DNA evidence came up,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.570
it was difficult initially
to try and get a new trial

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.440
even when you could show that
there was DNA evidence that

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.510
would exonerate you.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.785
I had a case I worked on
for 15 years in Wisconsin

00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:24.110
on an Innocence Project before
I could get this guy out.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.410
All of those 15 years, he
had at least one exoneration,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.440
or exclusion of DNA evidence
from the crime scene.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.660
And one wasn't enough.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.224
Suddenly, it became, well,
that wasn't important.

00:19:36.224 --> 00:19:37.640
Well, wait a minute,
at the trial,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.660
you said this was
critical evidence that

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.790
linked the real killer
to this crime scene.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.490
And now you're saying, because
the DNA evidence proves

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.310
it's not this guy,
that it's not relevant?

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.521
And that's what they do.

00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:52.270
They're allowed to do
that, unfortunately.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.200
And eventually, the courts--
we had so much evidence

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.380
that we were able to get his
case reopened and dismissed.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.467
But it's insane that it
should take that long.

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:06.050
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: 15
years to get there.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.810
JERRY BUTING: And he
spent 29 in prison.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.170
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Wow.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.640
That is stunning.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.540
And speaking of that, speaking
of wrongful convictions,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.410
the Innocence Project
and the amazing work

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.670
that the organization
does and other attorneys

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:25.540
do through the organization, why
is it that the criminal justice

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.070
system is not self-correcting?

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.050
Why do we need outside
third-party organizations

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.300
to come in and do
that kind of work?

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.720
JERRY BUTING: Part of
it is the lack of money.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.920
80% to 85% of
criminal defendants

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.270
are too poor to afford
their own lawyers,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.150
much less an
investigator or an expert

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.240
to talk about EDTA or
something like that, like you

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.990
saw in the "Making a Murder."

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.340
And despite the fact
that we continue

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.660
to prosecute primarily
poor people, criminalizing

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.080
poor people, we're not giving
the funding to defend them.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.100
Anywhere from only
a third to a half

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.110
of the money that
goes to prosecution

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.220
ends up for the defense.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.070
So it's really obscenely low.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.430
Again, my own state just
to the north of you here.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.060
And it's not that
much better anywhere.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.220
But Wisconsin now
has-- most states

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.310
have a public
defender staff that

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.530
handle maybe 2/3 of the cases.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.200
But the remainder get appointed
out to private lawyers

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.170
on a list.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.900
And they're paid by the hour.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.690
Wisconsin is the lowest
hourly rate in the country.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.040
Worst than
Mississippi, Arkansas.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.960
The deep south
traditionally was bad.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.770
Even worse-- what they do
is they pay $40 an hour.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.850
When I first started practicing
law in Wisconsin in 1981,

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:56.747
they paid $45 an hour.

00:21:56.747 --> 00:21:57.580
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Wow.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.430
JERRY BUTING: 1981.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:05.630
So you see the quality of
lawyers go down dramatically.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.430
The number of people willing
to take on these appeals,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.990
it's very hard to get
good-quality defense attorneys.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.420
And there are bad
trial lawyers, there

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.930
are bad appellate lawyers.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.220
And oftentimes, what
these Innocence Projects

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.250
have had to do is kind
of clean up the messes

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.670
of either the courts
or bad lawyering

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.080
that's happened beforehand.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.330
And so it shouldn't be that way.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.310
If we really care
about the Constitution

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:41.120
and we care about fairness,
it shouldn't depend on

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.161
whether or not you can
afford your own lawyer as to

00:22:44.161 --> 00:22:46.160
whether or not you're
going to get a fair trial.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.535
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:47.535 --> 00:22:49.730
JERRY BUTING: And
unfortunately, the reality

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.250
is that people-- it's hard.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.090
There doesn't seem
to be a constituency

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.650
for the legislators for somebody
who's accused of a crime.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.290
Why should we give
taxpayers' money

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.410
to defend somebody
accused of a crime?

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.677
Well, that's fine until it's
your son, or your husband,

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:09.510
or your neighbor, or
somebody you know who's

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:15.227
been accused, again, that
they never expected to be,

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.060
and suddenly they're
accused, and you're now

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:23.530
thrown to the wolves with a
really, really bad lawyer, some

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.822
of which you've seen depicted--

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.280
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: On
the documentary.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.130
JERRY BUTING: --on
the documentary.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.004
And unfortunately, that
happens all the time.

00:23:30.004 --> 00:23:32.660
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Right.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.234
I want to take a moment to
say Jerry will take questions

00:23:36.234 --> 00:23:37.900
from the audience in
just a few minutes.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.565
So if you would like to start
lining up by the microphones.

00:23:41.565 --> 00:23:46.152
And while people are getting
ready, I wanted to ask you,

00:23:46.152 --> 00:23:49.650
you mentioned this case that
you worked on for 15 years.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.769
And we've all seen
the Steven Avery case.

00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:54.060
I just wanted to hear from you.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.220
What is the personal
emotional impact

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.600
of working with someone who
is accused, of seeing them

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.680
very often, of interacting
with their family,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.170
seeing what their
family is going through,

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.840
and also of what the victim's
family is going through,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.960
two families that have been put
in a very difficult situation?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.070
JERRY BUTING: That's
one of the reasons

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.080
that Dean and I agreed to do
this documentary was that we

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.980
wanted people to see what
it was like to be a defense

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.180
attorney preparing for a
case, dealing with family.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.430
I didn't know that it was going
to-- what the filmmakers would

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.604
put in and not put in.

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:34.020
But one of the
things that I think

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.840
is really kind of unique
about this "Making a Murder"

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.500
documentary is you
really see what

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.310
it's like to be the defendant's
mother-- in this case,

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:49.230
two mothers going through a
lot of turmoil and heartache.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.080
And poor Dolores Avery.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.830
They show the map
of all these prisons

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.210
that she went to for 18 years,
visiting Steven while he

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.841
was wrongly incarcerated.

00:24:57.841 --> 00:24:59.840
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: One of
them in the south, right?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.440
Or just quite a
few-- several cases--

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.260
JERRY BUTING: One of them in the
South because of privatization.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.250
At one point, they were using
a Tennessee private prison

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.440
to house people
because they didn't

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.330
have enough space in Wisconsin.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.387
The solution was to build
more prisons in Wisconsin,

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:15.220
which is ridiculous.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.390
The solution should
have been not

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.700
send as many people to
prison or not as long.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.187
But this was back in
the '80s and '90s.

00:25:28.584 --> 00:25:30.000
So that's one of
the things I like

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.541
about the documentary
is that it does

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:34.340
show that kind of interaction.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.200
It's interesting because in
other parts of, like, the UK,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.500
for instance, they have two
different kinds of lawyers--

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.490
solicitors and barristers.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.010
And the barristers are
the ones that go to court.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.510
But the solicitors
are the ones that

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.210
interact with the client, and
the family, and all of that.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:55.040
And I've been written
by a lot of solicitors

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.670
who say, boy, that
must be hard to be

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.912
able to do that--
manage a family

00:25:59.912 --> 00:26:01.620
and all the things
they're going through,

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.190
and then also have
to go to court.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.800
But that's just the
way it is for us.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.170
And it's very, very
hard when you lose.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.880
This case was a devastating
loss for both Dean and I.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.800
And I've said this before.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.430
It's the hardest one for
me to disengage from.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.620
I had other cases that
were sort of waiting

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.380
while this case went on.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.930
And I needed to turn
my attention to them,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.140
but it was difficult,
because I just

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.524
kept thinking about what
could we do different?

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:33.940
What could we have
done different?

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.130
What could we still do to
try and right this wrong?

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.530
Despite your best effort, you
do get emotionally involved

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.980
to some extent.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:52.410
You can't let it get-- fall
into despair when you lose,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.940
because when you're
doing defense work,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.080
you do tend to lose.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.080
I mean, if the case is really
that weak for the prosecution,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.540
they can dismiss it.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:06.143
What cases go to trial are going
to be a closer call, generally.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.960
For me, it's always
been kind of a vocation.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.850
I'm partly motivated
by my faith.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.940
I believe that no matter
whether somebody's

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.520
really guilty of what
they're accused of or not,

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.920
there's dignity and worth
in every human soul.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.950
And you know, what they
might have done on one

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.790
particular day does not
define them in most instances.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.332
And when you go through
the court system

00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:41.790
as a criminal
defense attorney, you

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.870
need to let the judge understand
who that defendant is,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.210
and why they are a human
being and they are entitled

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.040
to be treated like
a human being,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.670
and punished if necessary
if it's appropriate.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.530
But not thrown out like garbage.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.190
And so I don't know
if that answers

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.600
all of the questions you
were getting at, but--

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.600
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: It does.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.080
Yeah, thank you
for sharing that.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.440
We appreciate it.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.500
And so with that, let's turn
it over to the audience.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.190
We have some people
at the microphones.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:17.775
If you'd like to go first.

00:28:17.775 --> 00:28:18.400
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.795
I'm curious about-- first of
all, thank you for being here.

00:28:20.795 --> 00:28:22.260
But I'm curious
about your thoughts

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.980
on professional juries.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.030
Like, would that be a step
in the right direction

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.490
in your opinion, to have people
that are trained in that,

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.550
so that they understand what
they should be looking at

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.920
and what evidence that's
outside their purview

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.050
that they should disregard?

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.091
'Cause I always see that.

00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:39.820
Like, it's crazy to me
when you have an objection

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.960
and the judge just says, OK,
disregard that that happened,

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.940
as if a regular person off
the street could just be like,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.110
oh, OK, that didn't happen.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.759
So I'm curious.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:51.300
Do you think that that would be
a step in the right direction

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.697
for us, something that we could
do to improve the process?

00:28:54.697 --> 00:28:56.780
JERRY BUTING: That's been
talked about quite a bit

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.580
in the last 20, 30 years
maybe, particularly

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.210
as science has entered more
and more into the courtroom.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.300
And can jurors
understand, really,

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.350
the science and
the technical stuff

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.770
that they have to deal with?

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.450
Like in patent
law, for instance,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.450
it's all done by judges who
are trained and really have

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.130
expertise in that.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.830
But if you do that, you
lose a couple things.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.020
You lose the idea of
a jury of your peers.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.330
They're no longer your peers,
they're professional jurors.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:32.760
And they're just as likely--
or just as great a potential

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.302
that they will become
jaded, as some judges have.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:45.920
Whereas I still prefer
the concept of jury duty

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.250
as a civic responsibility
we all have.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.392
We should not duck it.

00:29:51.392 --> 00:29:52.850
It's not the kiss
of death when you

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.183
get that summons-- oh, my
god, how do I get out of this?

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.650
You have a responsibility.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.025
You're defending
the Constitution

00:30:04.025 --> 00:30:08.670
and acting as a juror just like
somebody who goes off to war.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.890
But you're not in danger
of your life like they are.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.790
People shouldn't run
from it like they do.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.650
But along with that,
you really need

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.810
to have a judge willing
to take the time

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.810
to educate the juror and
lawyers willing to educate

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.450
the jurors about their
role, so that they

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.710
understand that some cases
they may not be right for.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.960
And it's OK to say that.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.717
I might be a good juror in
some cases, but not others.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.370
I think the focus
should be more on how

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:50.480
we make the voluntary jury,
civic-responsible jurors

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.535
of our peers more educated.

00:30:54.535 --> 00:30:55.660
You know, it's interesting.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.730
In this case, sometimes
it's flip-flopped.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:04.180
Sometimes the defense wants
jurors of a certain type.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.770
Sometimes the prosecutor
wants somebody just opposite.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:12.210
In this case, it was
interesting that, I think,

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.600
almost every juror that was
questioned by the prosecution

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.700
was-- they started
off with the question,

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.570
are you a puzzle person?

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:26.420
Do you like details, or are
you more of a big-picture guy?

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.090
And if you were a puzzle
person, you're gone.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.540
They struck anybody who
had any interest in looking

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.250
at the real details,
because that wasn't

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.291
going to help their case.

00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:39.380
[SCOFFS]

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.000
So we, on the other hand,
didn't have that luxury.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.040
We had to get rid of people
who were so biased already

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.720
that it was obvious.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.070
You get a certain number
of pre-emptory strikes,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.640
where you can get rid of
jurors for various reasons.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.790
And we had to use all of ours
on ones that, frankly, should

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.240
have been struck by the judge.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.330
So anyway, that's a long
answer for your question.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.074
Sorry about that.

00:32:04.074 --> 00:32:04.982
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:04.982 --> 00:32:05.890
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Over here.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:08.020
AUDIENCE: Was there anything
that the documentary

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.020
that you felt left out or may
have biased in a different way?

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.180
It seemed like if you were
in the town at the time,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.210
they were biased in one way.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.135
And I think if you
watched the documentary,

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:18.500
you might have been slanted
in the other direction

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.750
just naturally by the way
of the film was [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.625
So was there anything
you felt that it didn't

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.910
look at objectively
in the film or that

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.560
should have been left out
or should have been added?

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.560
JERRY BUTING: Well, they
had-- the filmmakers--

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.660
complete editorial control
over what was included and what

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.290
wasn't.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.090
And you know, I'm not
going to criticize them

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.030
for-- any filmmaker's
going to make choices.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.540
This was a six week-long trial.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.670
They had 10 hours for
the whole documentary,

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.320
and maybe three or four
of it was the trial,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.480
this particular trial.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.420
So yes, there was
a lot that was not

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.470
included, but from both sides.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.010
But I will say this.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:01.930
When it comes to the
evidence in the trial itself,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.440
I thought it was very
fair and balanced.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.760
There was definitely more of
a defense perspective because

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.420
of our willingness
to participate

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.440
and the prosecution's
decision not to.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.150
So you got to see us kind of
talking behind the scenes,

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.860
and what are we worried about,
and brainstorming how are

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.280
we going to deal this and that.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.250
You got more of the
defense perspective.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.880
But when it comes to the
evidence that the jury heard,

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.960
that was really
balanced and fair.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.750
There was other things
that weren't included

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.440
that would have
been, we thought,

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.020
were more important
for the defense

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.520
and that the special
prosecutor immediately

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.970
started crying foul.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.130
You didn't include this
side or the other thing.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.546
And he had this
whole laundry list

00:33:42.546 --> 00:33:44.020
of things that were left out.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.050
But what he ignored is that if
you go back and-- I say this.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.010
The easiest way to tell what's
really important to a lawyer

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.590
is to figure out how much time
they spend in their closing

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.190
argument on it.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.780
And you've heard
about the hood latch

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.550
DNA that was not in the
documentary that supposedly

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.010
was this very compelling
prosecution evidence.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.900
The prosecutor spent 15 lines
of his closing argument, half

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.310
a page, out of hundreds of
pages, hours long [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:18.409
And the reason is because it was
fully explained by the state's

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.780
own witnesses at trial.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.909
So it became neutralized,
and it was no longer

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:28.800
a big issue of contention,
because their own experts

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.469
admitted they were inside
the vehicle sampling,

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:37.120
had gloves on, went out,
wanted to check the odometer.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.120
The battery wasn't connected.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.699
Lifts up the hood
with the same gloves.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.040
And the amount of DNA that
was found on the hood latch

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.489
was very small, consistent with
that kind of innocent transfer.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.330
Like, if I shake your hand,
and you go off and rob a bank,

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.750
and my DNA might be on the
gun, but I never touched it,

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:54.650
that kind of thing.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.150
So there were those
sorts of things

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:01.110
that-- when it came down
to the real evidence that

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:05.310
was fought over-- the blood
in the RAV4, the magic key,

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.090
and the bullet, and
the bones, those things

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.980
were really as balanced
as I think they could be.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.340
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Now,
Jerry, we are at time,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.900
but do you mind sticking
around for one more question?

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.400
JERRY BUTING: Sure,
I'd be happy to.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.320
I mean, you can't do
it in two or three

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.560
minutes on the TV news.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.640
I know [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.947
We need a conversation.

00:35:24.947 --> 00:35:26.030
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.450
So we can go over here.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.960
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.849
If I remember correctly,
one of the things

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:33.140
in the beginning of the trial
they talked about was you

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.040
were not allowed to,
as the defense team,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.147
to start saying other people
could have done it, right?

00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:38.980
JERRY BUTING: Right.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.520
AUDIENCE: And I'm a
law novice, I suppose.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.200
But could you talk
a little bit about--

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.170
is that a typical thing?

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.090
Is that something you deal
with in every single case?

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.640
Or what is the thinking behind
that to the overall process?

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.590
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.970
Most states have a similar
kind of rule, which basically

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.790
is that they don't want the
jury to become distracted

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:09.390
about what's the real issue--
putting somebody on trial who's

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.430
not there to defend
themselves by pointing

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.860
the finger at a third party
and saying, he did it,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.180
or she did it.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.350
And so there's
always-- most states

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.070
have some kind of
controls or limits

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.850
on what you have
to show in order

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.907
to be able to present
that kind of evidence.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.520
Typically, in Wisconsin
until this case,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.160
you had to show that somebody
had access, opportunity

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.420
to have committed
the crime, what

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.160
they call a legitimate
tendency towards that.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.840
But you did not have
to also have motive.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.620
And in this case, the judge
made a ruling beforehand

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.700
that we had to have-- we
had all these people that

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.760
could have been the killer.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.680
They had just as much access
and opportunity as him.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.250
But because we couldn't
prove that they had a motive

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.340
to kill her, we weren't
allowed to point the finger

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.690
at that person.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.140
And we said, wait
a minute, the state

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.080
does not have to prove that
Steven Avery had a motive

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.420
to kill.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.126
The prosecution almost never
does all over the country.

00:37:15.126 --> 00:37:16.500
In a homicide,
they have to prove

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.810
intent to kill, but not
why, which is the motive.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:22.810
And so how unfair is that?

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.080
They're the ones that have
the entire burden of proof

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.250
in the case.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.620
We have no burden in the
case, and you're telling us

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.030
we can't even let the
jury know that there's

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:33.350
other suspects out
there, because we can't

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.110
prove that they had a motive?

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:40.020
And then what you end up with
is the accident, so to speak,

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.230
of if you happen to be
unlucky enough to be accused

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.790
of a homicide of somebody who
doesn't have a lot of enemies

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:52.450
who otherwise wouldn't
have a lot of people

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:57.130
that would have a motive to kill
them, like Teresa Halbach here.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:01.110
As far as we knew, it wasn't
anybody who had a motive.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.970
Part of that, though, is the
law enforcement never really

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.880
investigated her background--
I mean, her circle of friends,

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.880
and acquaintances, and
people in her life.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.620
Remarkably little
investigation in this case.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:21.080
But versus somebody
who's a drug dealer who's

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.160
been ripping people
off and maybe

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.160
has a lot of enemies,
which would be easier

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.150
to prove if you happen
to be accused of one

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.840
where there's not an obvious
motive, then you're screwed.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.380
He layered that on in
Wisconsin in our case

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.270
as an additional requirement
in order for us to do that

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.039
and said we weren't
allowed to use it.

00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:45.580
When the case was
affirmed on appeal,

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.180
that became the
law in Wisconsin.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.730
And now we have one of the
toughest in the country--

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.544
to be able to introduce
that kind of evidence.

00:38:53.544 --> 00:38:54.520
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.950
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.600
AUDIENCE: Hi, I got a two-part
question if you don't mind.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600
JERRY BUTING: All right.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.670
AUDIENCE: So firstly, I'm
thinking about the courtroom

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:09.670
and wondering if you think that
the setting of the courtroom

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.160
is really an optimal way
to align your evidence so

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.810
that the jury and the decision
makers can make a decision.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.650
Perhaps there are a lot
of factors like timing

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:25.410
and just randomness that
can really make or break

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.930
the case for your client.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:33.150
And if you don't think that
it's perhaps the optimal way

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:36.310
to go about bringing
justice, do you

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:40.530
think that there could
be an approved way

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.160
to really make that happen?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.170
JERRY BUTING: Well,
in America, we

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.010
have what's called an
adversary system of justice,

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:53.310
the idea being that a trial
is a search for the truth,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.850
but sometimes that's
elusive, particularly

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.860
when credibility of
witnesses-- who do you believe?

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.320
He says one thing,
she says another.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.420
Somebody else says
the third thing.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.930
If it's a bar fight where
people are intoxicated

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.900
and you have lots
of stuff going on,

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.520
you may get a
different perspective

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.480
from everybody who was there.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.120
The idea, though, with
the adversary system is

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.520
that witnesses come
into court, both sides

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:25.580
can question the witness,
and try and bring out facts,

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.750
like whether they were
impaired, and maybe you

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.510
didn't see this that clearly.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.310
And if the two sides
are relatively equal,

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.720
that the truth will be in
there somewhere and the jury

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.730
will be able to then
discern the truth.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:43.890
Unfortunately, the two
sides aren't always equal,

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.030
particularly nowadays, where
the defense is so underfunded,

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.600
particularly indigent defense.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.570
But there are other problems.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:59.300
It's not ideal for
jurors to try and think

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.660
about something that
happened very quickly that's

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:08.260
being exploded into little
microseconds of this, that,

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.090
and everything happening.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.930
But short of that, I'm not
sure how else you do it.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.660
There is an opportunity,
for instance,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.750
for jury visits to the scene of
a crime, where they can maybe

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:23.668
get a better perspective on
what the witnesses are talking

00:41:23.668 --> 00:41:24.167
about.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.242
You can't really do
reenactments of what happened.

00:41:32.242 --> 00:41:36.868
You see that on TV
and cable sometimes

00:41:36.868 --> 00:41:40.460
with scary music going on.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:46.160
So I don't-- you know, I still
think it's the best system that

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.770
you can come up with, but it's
not like it doesn't have its

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.270
flaws.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.270
And we see a lot of them
in this documentary.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.610
It's law enforcement.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.620
It's very difficult. If
you've got a case where

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.380
you think someone is being
framed by law enforcement, very

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.790
difficult to defend
against that,

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:08.650
because who knows better than
police how to frame somebody?

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.811
Think about it.

00:42:09.811 --> 00:42:10.560
What would you do?

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.230
How easy would it be if you
really wanted to do that?

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:20.300
And there's not a real
good solution to that other

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.070
than you need to
make sure you try

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:25.380
and hold your law
enforcement accountable just

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.320
like anybody else.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.740
And if you've got bad
cops, they shouldn't

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.810
be rewarded by taking
over the department,

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.185
moving up, and now being
the head of evidence.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.540
I still think the
best way to do it

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.560
is in the courtroom with the
adversaries on both sides.

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.540
But it definitely-- you
have to watch for the flaws

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.547
and remedy those
where you see them.

00:42:55.547 --> 00:42:56.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.865
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:42:57.865 --> 00:42:59.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:01.840
It sounds like the
prosecution is often

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.170
motivated to convict someone
as opposed to the right one.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.940
So is there anything to be
done about this problem,

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.460
or is this a symptom of
something else being wrong?

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.410
JERRY BUTING: Well,
it's interesting

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:19.200
that-- all lawyers are bound
by a certain code of ethics.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.330
Prosecutors, though,
have their own.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.320
And it's interesting
because they should,

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.060
because one of the
things that they're

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:32.060
supposed to do, ethically, is
seek justice, not a conviction.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.960
But that's oftentimes difficult,
because human beings--

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.690
you get into the
battle, you want to win.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:42.770
And sometimes they
can lose sight of that

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.290
and lose sight of justice.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:51.420
But I think most prosecutors
try not to do that.

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.670
But it's sometimes hard.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.400
For instance, the
case I mentioned

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.740
where I worked for 15 years.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.550
That same prosecutor
was on the case

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.920
from 29 years ago all
the way to the end,

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.930
almost to the very end.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:05.930
Finally retired.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:09.170
But he was not a guy
that was generally

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:15.930
considered to be a jerk, a
biased, corrupt prosecutor

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.040
at all.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.430
But I think it was difficult--
and you see this time and time

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.910
again on DNA exoneration cases.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.510
Prosecutors do get emotionally
involved with victims

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.670
and their families.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.390
And the idea that not only
did they convict the wrong guy

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.870
and send the wrong
guy to prison,

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:40.770
but that the killer or
the rapist went scot-free.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.920
It's hard for them to look
into a victim's family's eyes

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.410
and say, I'm sorry, we let
this guy go, we screwed up.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:49.250
And so humanly, it's
difficult for them

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.120
to step back and be objective.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.602
One way to maybe improve
the chance of something

00:44:54.602 --> 00:44:56.310
like that, at least
with post-conviction,

00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:00.700
is to try and make sure there's
a different prosecutor taking

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.810
over the case and examining it
with a little more objectivity.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:04.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:05.075
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:45:05.075 --> 00:45:05.420
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:05.920
Thank you.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.800
Jerry, thank you
so much for coming.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.180
JERRY BUTING: You're welcome.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.155
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We really
appreciated hearing from you.

00:45:10.155 --> 00:45:10.863
JERRY BUTING: OK.

00:45:10.863 --> 00:45:12.620
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good
luck on your tour.

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.050
JERRY BUTING: Thank you.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.070
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
conversationonjustice.com.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:15.570
And--

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.111
JERRY BUTING: And
I'm writing a book.

00:45:17.111 --> 00:45:17.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.400
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: All right.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.900
JERRY BUTING: And it's not just
about the Steven Avery case.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.000
In fact, the case I
mentioned will be talked

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.250
about in a lot more detail.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.920
And I tell people that as
bizarre as the Steven Avery

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.350
case is, you would think that's
the craziest one I've had,

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.860
and it's not.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.990
I've had crazier ones, just
as interesting, and yeah,

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:38.990
I've been really blessed
with that in my career.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.780
And so--

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.505
As a criminal defense
attorney, that's what you want.

00:45:43.505 --> 00:45:44.547
You want some challenges.

00:45:44.547 --> 00:45:46.004
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
We're all very much

00:45:46.004 --> 00:45:47.514
looking forward to the book.

00:45:47.514 --> 00:45:48.400
JERRY BUTING: Good.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:48.900
All right.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.983
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you.

00:45:49.983 --> 00:45:52.550
[APPLAUSE]
