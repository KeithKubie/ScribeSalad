00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.737
This was such a good idea, coming to Supper &amp; a Movie's.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.106
I-- I feel like
I'm in Hollywood.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.575
Yeah, but we're on
vacation in New York.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.609
Winning.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.778
Hey, guys!

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.281
So is that a wrap or do we
want to shoot a dessert scene?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.951
Oh, we are so full,
we're like the Klumps.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.619
Okay, well then,
you know what time it is.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:20.854
It's...

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.355
( imitating fanfare )

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.857
No way!

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.658
No way!

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.260
You guys ready to play?

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.295
All right,
here we go.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.132
In the movie "Forrest Gump,"
when Jenny lets Forrest

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.868
touch her,
what item of Jenny's

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:39.439
roommates does Forrest
ejaculate on?

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:43.743
( imitating Forrest Gump )
I may not be a smart man,
but I know the answer.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.045
Bathrobe, right?

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.347
Splooge!

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.050
Ha ha, you nailed it!

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.885
Do you really think that
that's an appropriate trivia

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.120
question to ask in front
of children?

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.355
Oh, well, I know it was pretty
hard, but I mean, you got it.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:56.689
Yeah, we did.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.892
Okay, next question.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.462
In the movie "Back to the
Future," who is the mean bully?

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.264
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.299
He tries to rape
Marty McFly's mom.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.134
He's like, "You love me,
you just don't know it yet."

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.903
Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.938
Come on, honey,
kids, you remember.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.873
He's trying to rape the mom
but the mom's all upset

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.975
'cause she's trying
to sleep with her own son.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.811
Okay, I don't want to hear
about people raping moms.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.746
Oh, I think you
guys will remember.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.848
It's like the hottest
scene in that movie.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.783
I don't-- I don't actually
see what's hot about that.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.717
Oh, you should watch
it again, it's great.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.752
Oh!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.228
It's Biff.

00:01:27.228 --> 00:01:28.321
Our son's name
is Biff, duh!

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.287
What a cool name, buddy.

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:30.207
All right, cool.

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:31.902
One more to go.

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:34.460
In the movie "Up,"
what objects lifted

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.463
the house containing
the old man

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.598
and the young
Asian boy scout?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.400
I know this one.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.535
Trick question, the boy
was not Asian,

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.242
he was retarded!

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.424
Balloons.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.940
The answer
is "balloons."

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.474
I'll get your check.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.397
Uh, you're bumming us out,
so I think it's best

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.380
if we go to
Ground Zero by ourselves.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.415
Jenny, Biff.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.127
Come on.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.220
Sorry your wife
is such a monster.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.521
I'm leaving her.
