Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. T. E. N. P. R

Speaker 2:          00:11          please enter your address for Colorado calculating route.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Okay, now I'm getting closer to him. Woo. We begin our journey this hour. How old are you? I'm 42. Oh Man, I'm 63. This isn't gonna work with this woman. Her name is Sharon Roseman. Okay. Enough of that. We're going to talk about a little predicament she got herself into. Um, I was about five years old. I lived in a small suburb of Chicago called Maywood, Illinois. And I was outside playing on the street or in a bunch of kids. They were playing this game, blind man's bluff. And she was the person who is, it wears a blindfold and all the other kids try and scatter around and they have to freeze and then they can turn to you and you can only hear them. And the objective is basically to feel around fall the voices until you tag someone. Then they become it. And that's what she does.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Everybody laughs because the person that I tagged as kind of the loser, you know, cause they found them first. So I'm playing the game and they took the blindfold off and suddenly I didn't know where I was. I didn't recognize anything, this horrible panic set in because nothing looked familiar to me. Absolutely nothing. I just, uh, I ran blindly just running, just to run, cause I was so scared and I ran into the backyard of this house in front of me and I saw my mother sitting in a lawn chair and I said, why are you here? And she said, what? What do you mean? Why am I here? I said, why are you in this backyard? Where are we? She said, what are you talking about? We're at home. I'm in the back yard. And he said, but this is in our house. And she said, yes, this is what are you talking about? And I couldn't explain it and I just kept crying and just kept saying, I don't know where I'm at. And your mother must've been very worried at that moment. Well, unfortunately my mother said something to me that actually changed my life forever. She pointed her finger in my face and she said, don't ever tell anybody, because they'll say you're a witch and they'll burn you. What? Shit?

Speaker 2:          02:51          I don't know. I don't know. And from that moment on, it was my secret. She realizes now that what happened to her in that moment when she was five and playing the game was that her whole world had rotated a quarter turn, a quarter turn picture where you're sitting right now. Yeah. You would still be sitting in that same room, but the wall that you're looking at right in front of you is now one wall over to the right. Let me make it easier. If I were on the toilet, say sitting there looking straight ahead. [inaudible] is now the bath tub in a different place than it was before the sink in a different place by about 90 degrees. Everything. Everything in the entire universe, but just horizontally. It doesn't tilt or no, it doesn't tilt. East West becomes north south, like in Colorado here, the the mountains, the rocky mountains are on the west end of town. Right. When this happens to me, they moved to the north end of town, but everything else moves with it. So the first time that happened did you, you say you didn't know where you were yet, you recognize things but they just weren't where they were supposed to be or I didn't even recognize them that very first time. I was so panicked. I just didn't know what to do. Did it ever happen again? Over and over and over.

Speaker 3:          04:14          Okay. I mean I get lost all the time as you, you, but that's loose is different. Yeah. Before we go any further, let's just orient real quick. I'm Chad at boom rod. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. This hour we're calling it the lost and found, so I'm going to be experiencing the feelings like Sharon pat of being totally lost and then that relief that you feel as Sharon will feel eventually of being totally found.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Oh, not totally. Let's go back to her story. Did it ever happen again? Over and over and over. She says this 90 degree rotation problem would come on in all kinds of situations. Sometimes even when she had her eyes closed. But what saved me was that shortly after that first episode, I went to a little birthday party and we were playing, um, pin the tail on the donkey and they put a blindfold on me and spun me in circles. You must've been like, oh man, you want to do that? It was, it was awful because after that first turn, everything did shift. But then on the second turn, when they spun her around again, it fixed it. Really? Yeah. Dizzy. That's so weird. If I played a third time crazy again, so it's binary. It's like on, off, on, off. Sadly. Exactly. But I couldn't tell anybody that, but now she had a fix or a temporary fix.

Speaker 2:          05:36          So from that moment on, anytime her world would shift, I would go into the bathroom and I'd close the door so nobody could see me and I would spin in circles until it fixed it. You spin and it reasserts itself correctly. Yeah. And I still do that to this day. And with her secret spinning, Sharon has managed to lead a relatively life. She got married, had three kids. When, when my children were babies, if one of them would cry out, just cry out in their sleep. Invariably she'd wake up being into a while, completely turned around and then I would have to follow their cries, the sound of their cries until I could find the their bedroom. There was no explanation for that. I had to just say I was clumsy. So you never told them? No. And my husband didn't know and I'm not married to him anymore. But um, and you can leave that in there.

Speaker 4:          06:30          The point is she kept it a secret. But one day when Sharon was 29, she was on her way to her brother's house

Speaker 2:          06:38          and uh, she got turned around. So I called him from a pay phone and I said, I, I can't find your house. She read him the names of the street signs and he said, Sharon, you're like two blocks from my house. And I just started crying and I told him the story. He was just shocked.

Speaker 5:          07:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:04          so he dragged you to the hospital and they saw some specialists and they kept me in, um, in the hospital for like a week doing every kind of test you can imagine. And it showed nothing.

Speaker 4:          07:16          They basically told me it was psychological. Like it's all in your head. Yes. Wow. And that you were the only one in the whole universe who had this problem? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          07:27          I thought, okay, I must be a witch.

Speaker 5:          07:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          07:38          Huh? I mean that, that's, that's just, that's a crazy story. Okay. Just to pull out for a bit, after we talked with Sharon, we ended up speaking with them. Well, if you've heard Radiolab before, you probably know that voice. Um, Jonah Lehrer literally asked him like a question. Jonah Lehrer. There you go. Jonah is a science writer and an author. Uh, my last book was how we decide and it was a lot about the brain. And so we played him tape from the Sharon interview just to see what you think. And he had an interesting take. I mean, it just, it just one of these great windows into this talent we completely take for granted. Um, and in you realize this is such sophisticated software, there are so many different algorithms that are running that allow us to not get lost in the way out of the bathroom.

Speaker 4:          08:21          One way to think about this story he says is not why does Sharon get lost all the time? But why don't the rest of us, and a lot of this is brand new science or we're talking the last three, four or five years. But in the time he says, scientists have just begun to figure out how brains make maps of our surroundings from moment to moment. They've identified at least four different types of cells that make these maps possible. Everything from place cells to grid cells to border cells. Like can we go through ways? So yeah, no, we'll, we'll slow down. But, but, but all these cells come together to give us incredibly rich masters. All began to make more sense to us when Jonah said, okay, let me do it this way. I just took a trip into this office, but I'm sitting in a radio station and let me do the same thing as I did it in my brain.

Speaker 4:          09:05          I got out of my car, I walked to the front of the building. So I open up the door and somehow some way my brain begins to make sense of this space. First thing that happens, he says his little cells in his head called red cells. Come on mind grid cells are pretty weird. I gotta be honest. Before he's even taken a step into the building, these grid cells kind of like mappers are surveyors. They lay on a grid. It's great. This matrix over the hallway right in front of him. Unbeknownst to me, that grid is composed of equal lateral triangles. [inaudible] triangles. Yeah, it's, it's pretty spooky. As I'm walking down the hallway, I pass from one triangle to the next. My brain is keeping track of exactly which triangle I'm in. I pass it by a wall, so some border cells go off. Avoid the concrete road, just respond to borders, edges, physical limits. I look to my right and my head direction cells change, but then they change the act. Woo. The erection l so there's a head direction neuron firing all the time when I'm facing dead ahead. When I turned my head to the left, that neuron stops firing. We have a new head direction neuron firing.

Speaker 6:          10:23          Now I'm back to the deadhead. I turned to the right new head direction on firing that ahead.

Speaker 4:          10:30          These cells keep you oriented so you know where you are in the grid and now it's time to fill in the details. And this is where things get really cool. Proceed down the Cardo as I take a couple more steps. Now my place cells are probably beginning to get active. It's the, I'm here. So it's like for every landmark in the space, each body passes by the brain will drop a little pin. It's like an I'm here people. Yeah, at the coffee table and then I'm here at the potted plant in, then I'm here at the door or in the studio. So now as I imagined myself walking from this little closet like space back to my car, as I pass by the coffee table with the magazines, that place I'll fire now and by the front door, that place all fires. Now I'm on the sidewalk. That place, so fires now I'm by my car. That place, so fires and when you put it all together, the place sells the grid cells, the boarders hell's what you get. He says it's a symphony of electricity, which somehow is translated for me into an idea of a space and this whole neural symphony, it mostly takes place in that particular part of the brain, hippocampus. So if Jonah were to just hazard a guess about Sharon, she should get her hippocampus checked at is you should do

Speaker 2:          11:54          meet me. You know? That's just a guess. Now getting back to that story, even though I was 29 I was an adult. I had children. The point at which we left off, Sharon had gone to the hospital, got in a bunch of tests and the doctors had told her that I needed to go see a psychiatrist. I felt like a freak.

Speaker 7:          12:11          Hello.

Speaker 2:          12:14          But then one day years after that, I was watching some TV show, Belgian scanning a crowd. It was a newsy 2020 type thing about face blindness, blindness, people who can recognize faces. And at the end of the show, the reporter mentions this website, the website, Sharon goes, she was curious. And when she gets there, this little window pops up that asks her if she wants to take a survey. I thought, well, I'll do it. And it was mostly questions about face recognition. But as I got deeper and deeper into the questionnaire, the questions start turning more to have you ever experienced being in a place that should look familiar to you but suddenly does not. And I was like, oh my gosh, that's me. And asked for explanations. So I was just typing away and typing away. And eventually she meets the doctor who had finally d, which her.

Speaker 3:          13:05          Uh, my name is Giuseppe urea. I am a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Calgary. And do you have a strong sense of direction? And I'm curious. I don't actually, I am, I'm not a gifted direction. Like you know Guy [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:18          but just said that had this idea that maybe just like face blindness there could be such a thing as location blindness. So he asked Sharon to go online and play this game, sort of video games like virtual reality, like where do you have to shoot people and find people and Blah Blah Blah. The screen would be showing you these landmarks like a flower shop at Bar Bang Bakery and then eventually I need it to be able to to say where things are with respect to one an order. Well No, nothing now, not even a guess for me and it actually made me physically ill and then juice up. He told her something before you, I'd met this woman,

Speaker 3:          13:58          this lady who has complained about orientation and she also failed this test. So I brought her in to the lab and had her play the game in this counter in the MRI scanner in the brain scanner and we were able to find activity all over the brain except in one little place. We were not able to detect any increased activity within the hippocampus, which just so happens to be though

Speaker 2:          14:17          home of Jonas little guys play cell border, cell grid cells, that particular part of the brain, the hippocampus just never developed and at that point that's when Giuseppe for the first time told her this thing has a name d t d for developmental topographical disorientation

Speaker 7:          14:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:37          and that's not trivial because when something like this has a name, suddenly it's not your fault. I felt like I was reborn. I keep telling him, you are my hero, you'll always be my hero but have you ever met Sharon? I mean face to face and we are, we

Speaker 3:          14:52          are supposed to meet now in this fall. What if you like meet her and fall in love with her and then she gets lost and you rescue her and the science is ruined. But you get married. I am already [inaudible] never, nevermind. But anyway. Do you set, he's there. He's got a couple of patients and he's wondering how many other folks like this are out there. So he puts up a website. We said, okay, we are looking for people who have this specific symptoms. One year later we were basically dealing with 700 people. We did say, oh see the same issue. Yeah. So he sets up an Internet forum where they can all talk to each other. I'm the moderator and now Sharon corresponds with DTD sufferers from all over the place. There are others out there who experienced the 90 degree rotation. Yeah. Oh, what about spinners though? Do you have, you've ever met at spinner?

Speaker 8:          15:42          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          15:42          No, no, no.

Speaker 8:          15:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:49          Actually I should get some lighter cause if I look here, oh here. Well there's one there that, that one, that's fine. But then another one she wants later, I haven't drank. She did another woman named Sharon. My name is Sharon Mitchell. The last name is m a. C. H. E. L rhymes with Rachel. Okay. When this Sharon heard about the first Sharon, she says she bolted straight up. There is a woman in Colorado who has what I have and I, it was such an emotional moment for me that she decided to fly to Colorado to meet Sharon Roseman and they spent a day together. All right, so let's just start with the easy stuff. And they spoke with reporter Dave Fender described yesterday. I mean, what was it like to, uh, to get together yesterday and yesterday was awesome. I got out of the car and we just gave each other a hug.

Speaker 2:          16:33          And it was, it was, it was a band that I've never experienced with anybody else in my life ever. We sat down right away in the hotel lobby and started to laugh. We couldn't stop laughing. Everything we were telling our experiences right away and comparing notes, not even finishing our sentences. No, we still don't know what's wrong with Sharon and Sharon and the others. We certainly don't know how to fix it, but whereas before, Sharon and Sharon were lost and alone, now they're lost and together this bond that we share, so in a wave, it's like they're not really lost. Like we sat there probably for 15 minutes describing how we were going to navigate from this hotel to the shopping mall that we could see right out the window of the hotel and we had to come up with some contingency plans. Yeah. Yeah. So we had, we had the gps if we needed it. Sharon had a map in her hands if we needed it. We had street names. We were just hoping that at least one of us was there instead instead of being messed up. And so, um, we got there.

Speaker 2:          17:41          There it is. There it is. There it is weird. Most stocks are jumping up. It was really ridiculous if anybody and

Speaker 9:          17:50          they have no clue why we were so excited that we found Nordstrom.

Speaker 8:          18:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          18:01          big thanks to Molly Webster for producing that piece with us. More information on anything you just heard or will hear. Go to radio lab.org and you can subscribe to our podcast there.

Speaker 10:         18:18          Hi, this is Sharon Roseman radio lab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation. Okay. I'm seeing public understanding of science and technology in the modern war. [inaudible] from Calgary. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org sorry, I'm so late. I've been on the road. I'm calling from my shelf on video that is produced by WWE NYC and distributed by NPR.

Speaker 9:          18:47          Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab today. Our program is lost and found approaching zone without gps or it, well, you know, I think we're getting real close on the linear driving into our next adventure is our producer Tim Howard. Yes, yes. This is it. So I sorted and I took a trip. Your picture id to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. For what? Fort Monmouth. Is that a military base? Yup. We were going to this museum they have on the base

Speaker 11:         19:23          to meet you at the store to meet this woman Mindy, Mindy rose, what's on the museum curator at a US army communications to show us around to see what patients, Chad, do you wanna hear some stories? Absolutely. Okay. Here on display we have the war heroes. So she pointed to this one glass case, sort of like a memorial. Well, he was born in 1918, died here at Fort Monmouth in 1937 so he lived about 20 years, served with the army expeditionary forces. He was wounded and blinded in one eye, carrying a very important message. What's all this on his, on his face there? Looks like putty. Like what's all this stuff on his nose? It's called crop and it's a natural growth. Um, I think it's a calcium growth and some pigeons just get that. Did she just say pigeons? You got it. A lot of get it. There's another one marker. I don't know. Yeah, but he has one eye. His eye was shot out in a second. Tim, what's the story? Why Pigeons? Pigeons. Yeah. Well

Speaker 9:          20:28          a pigeons are awesome. And B, there's a big question here, which is, well, let me, let me just start you off. Training wheels with a simple little story on, this is GI Joe. He's our hero pigeon, but there's one pigeon named GI Joe GI Joe is pretty cool. Well, he looks like a totally ordinary pigeon. I wouldn't know that. I'm standing a foot away from a a war hero. I think he's cute. He's got yellow legs. Remember I told you about the legs? The feet. All right, so what's the story? Okay, so it's 1943 there was a town, the British have just taken this little Italian town call of the Chia full with Chia from the Germans, the bad guys. The problem is it took it really fast and their American allies are about to bomb the town in 20 minutes. Oh, the radios are down. They can't get anybody back to the base in time to tell them to call it off. How nearby is the space? 20 miles away. And so they only really have one option. Let me guess. No, wait, just so you really get this. Yeah, bring it home. This bird is in a place that he's never been before. [inaudible] hallway there for hours. He's been in a dark box. He should be completely confused. Should be. And yet when they take him out and throw them in the air [inaudible] like a cosmic zip court. He's pulled over mountains, lakes, forest. None of which he's ever seen before. Right back.

Speaker 12:         21:43          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          21:44          Did the army base where he lives just in the nick of time, just as a bombers, they're about to take off. He's credited with saving over thousands British live,

Speaker 12:         21:51          American hatched and GI Joe Kennedy, the message through and artillery bombardment in Italy and the same units of the 56th London division.

Speaker 1:          21:58          How the hell did he do that? How did he know exactly where to go? Some of them returned with, um, the message capsule hanging from their leg and their breastbone shot open and all that kind of stuff. But they would always, um, fly back home. How that's your question? Yep. Hello? Hello there. So I called this guy. This is Charlie Wolcott. He's a heavy hitter in the vision world. The former director of the Cornell lab of ornithology. My question is if GI Joe had never been to that town, how did he know

Speaker 13:         22:30          how to get back home? Well, the first thing that GI Joe needs to know is where, wait, wait, Tim, I'm sorry. I feel bad for saying this because it's your first piece for the show, but I mean, don't we know the answer to this? What's the answer, Jen? Oh, birds have a compass in their head. That's how they migrate. Jed. You dummy.

Speaker 9:          22:51          You're just not getting the degree of difficulty

Speaker 13:         22:54          about it. This way, if I take you in a little boat and put you out in the middle of a large body of water, all you can see is water and every direction. Which way do you paddle to find New York City? Are you asking me? Yeah. Can I have a compass and this scenario? Sure. But that's not going to help you. Sure will. No, no.

Speaker 9:          23:14          What do you mean? No? Just think about it. Which way are you going to paddle first?

Speaker 8:          23:19          Hmm. I

Speaker 9:          23:22          don't know enough to say yes

Speaker 13:         23:25          exactly. It depends a little bit on whether I've dumped you in the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean or whatever. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          23:32          you can't swim home if you don't know which direction home is. And you're saying this is what a pigeon does. You can throw it anywhere and it knows. That's my whole point. I W if you were a pigeon, I wouldn't need to tell you anything.

Speaker 13:         23:43          Huh? How did GI Joe figure out where he is with relation to home?

Speaker 9:          23:48          That's the great question. That it, okay, I'm with you now and I'm sorry for interrupting you earlier. That's all right. So how do they do it? Well, and if you have a one sentence answer for it, then that's a short answer.

Speaker 13:         23:59          It is a very, very easy answer. We don't know.

Speaker 9:          24:03          Wow. But they have been doing a lot of crazy experiments on pigeons over the years, like 60 years now to try and figure all this out.

Speaker 13:         24:10          Um, let us count the ways [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          24:13          We have tried flying pigeons with frosted contact lenses. They've put coils on their head with the pigeons head like a hat. They've glued little brass weights to their backs. They put radio transmitters on them. Yes, indeed. Dave followed pigeons in airplanes. The point is that it is a complex issue and they have definitely not arrived to any consensus

Speaker 13:         24:33          for how pigeons do this. They have theories, plenty of theories. Oh yeah. For example, you get talions Floriano poppy and his colleagues believed that when you take the pigeons out to the release point, they sample the odors on the way to the release point, all the smells of the places that they pass, right? Essentially a series of olfactory landmarks. You know, you go past the chocolate factory and the olive groves of the garlic plantation or whatever sounds like a beautiful place. And so when a pigeon is released, uh, what it does is it sniffs the breeze and says, Aha,

Speaker 9:          25:09          continue past garlic, take a left at chocolate.

Speaker 13:         25:13          This is the odor that came to me on the Northwind and therefore I need to fly south in order to get home.

Speaker 5:          25:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          25:21          but Charlie's actually put this idea, that

Speaker 13:         25:23          test or we anesthetized the pigeons, put them in a box, artificial air so they can't smell anything and are rotating turntable and transported them about a hundred miles away. And when they got over being kind of car sick, they flew home just fine.

Speaker 9:          25:38          So something else is going on here. Yeah. And here's where we get to my personal favorite theory. All right, forget about smell. There are some researchers who think that the key to pigeon navigation is, are you ready for this? Yeah. What is it? Metal, which is to say if you go all the way down into the center of the earth, there's all this iron down there churning and as it's churning it's throwing off this magnetism.

Speaker 13:         26:07          Yes. Lines of magnetic force

Speaker 9:          26:10          through the earth out into space. So imagine up there in the atmosphere above the planet, there are all these lines that are wiggly and as GI Joe is flying through the air is moving through these lines.

Speaker 5:          26:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          26:26          do you think he sees the lines? Well I can tell you that he might feel them because there are these little particles in his beat. Magnetite magnetic iron particles. They're twitching. Some spots they twitch more in in some spots less. And if you can

Speaker 13:         26:44          measure various aspects of the magnetic field, like its strength and its angle, you can tell whereabouts you are. Do you think that's what's actually happening? I think it may be partly what's happening. I mean Charlie, Charlie says there's probably a lot of things going down. Anytime you think you've figured it out, the pigeon goes and messes you up. For example, he told me about this one place, a place in New York. Oh, about 90 miles west of here called Jersey Hill fire tower. If we take Cornell pigeons to Jersey Hill and let them go, they go random and so they are essentially lost. It is a Bermuda Triangle for Cornell pigeons. Why would that be that? Sorry, I hadn't, if we knew, I would tell you. Is it a magnetic thing? No, no. There's nothing magnetically disturbed about it. Is it a sewage treatment capitol? No. Hyper active radio frequencies?

Speaker 13:         27:41          No, it's a, it's a hill surrounded by pine trees. It's just a hill. Does it make you wonder if there's a whole other system going on in a pigeon that we haven't even started to think about? Yes, of course. And then use you say, well, what could it possibly be? Yeah. And after a long day of, of being out there with the pigeons and releasing them and waiting for them to make up their mind and fly home and get the vanishing bearings. You come back and you open the loft and there they are, you know, all sitting on their little purchasers going, cool, cool. And here's long to grab one by the scruff of the neck and say, how do you do it? But so far obviously they haven't told us. Okay,

Speaker 9:          28:21          one more thing I didn't tell you about how they were monogamous. The pigeon mind might be unknowable, but the pigeon heart is an open book. Yeah. Well Mindy said that with a lot of other birds and chickens, you get them all together. They all go wild and party. One thing leads to another. They all, well maybe they go the Jacuzzi, maybe they, I don't know what they do in the Jacuzzi. I'm not judging, but pigeons, they would mate and they would stay mated until death do they part. So one thing you can do to make the pigeon fly home faster is you take the male out of his cage, you put another male in there with his girl, and of course he's going to get pissed off. This feathers are fluffing in who is the straight male in my cage and all this kind of stuff. Drive him away. He flies back so fast to clean house. So this is called the widow hood method and yes, it is a powerful motivator. Yeah, they miss the misses, so wow. So who knows how he did it, but what may have propelled GI Joe through those darken war-torn skies was jealous. Rage. A Ban could've Ben, you go judge or you go get that young buck [inaudible] you go ga Joe. And if you have to save a thousand lives in the meantime, okay, just do it. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          29:45          pretty good. Pretty good. Those pigeons. But I think we can go one more round for the human being and our natural ability to navigate. I met a woman named Lira Borucki. She's in the psychology department at Stanford University. She studies languages and she's found that some languages have a curiously, I don't know how to put this a curiously pigeon like power. No, seriously.

Speaker 11:         30:10          There are languages that don't rely heavily on words like left and right and some languages actually don't have those words at all. Um, in the, uh, culture I got to spend some time in, they rely on north, south, east, west. Oh, you mean like sort of taking in left at the biscuit factory. I'm going to hang it east more so than that. Uh, you would say things like there's an ant on your southwest leg or move your cup to the north northwest a little bit. Where are we talking about, by the way?

Speaker 4:          30:39          I should back up. This story is too good. You should start at the, where are we in the world right now?

Speaker 11:         30:43          This is a community called pumper out on Cape York. In Australia. Per Rao. When was this? Uh, this was a few years ago, I guess 2006 there. The way you say hello in pumper out is you say, which way are you going? Ah, so in English you say, how are you? Fine. In Palm you say, which way are you going? And the answer must be something like north, northeast in the middle distance. How about you? What? Say, imagine as you're walking around your studio, each person that says hi to you, you have to report your heading direction to them so you literally can't get past hello in this language without knowing which way you're facing. And you said North northwest and the Middle Direction. Is it really that that precise? It's actually more precise than that. There are 80 some different choices. Oh yeah. It was socially very awkward. People thought I was quite dim because I wasn't oriented and I didn't know exactly which way it was, which all the time you can ask a five year old there, can you point northeast?

Speaker 11:         31:44          And they'll point without hesitation. If you ask a Stanford professor or Harvard professor to do the same thing, they have no idea. It isn't. And that you know what if you were indoors, like what if you were in a, in a shelter, could they still do it? Yep. They keep track of directions even when they're indoors, how without windows you pay attention, you just have to pay attention. And I think what's really striking about, um, the discovery of languages like this and folks like this as they have an ability that we call dead reckoning and it's an ability to, you know, after any kind of circuitous path to turn around and head straight back home. That ability we thought was beyond human capacity. We had observed it an aunt and we had observed it and birds, but there was always some other explanation. Like birds have magnets in their beaks and answer counting steps in, you know, there's some kind of extra thing that they were doing.

Speaker 11:         32:41          Now there's 7,000 languages in the world, about a third of the world's languages have this property. Hello, not a third of the world's speakers, but a third of the world's languages. Wow. And these are not folks that have magnets or special ant super powers. They're using this, the same cognitive system that we're using. They're just using it differently. They're paying attention to something that we normally don't pay attention to. But interestingly earlier it says there was a moment, a very particular moment when she sort of slipped into attention. I had this interesting experience and I was there. So after about a week of being there, I was, people were constantly pointing, uh, to locations and I was constantly trying to stay oriented. And after about a week, I was walking along, I was kinda trudging through the sand. It was hot and I was thinking about whether I was wasting my time there or not.

Speaker 11:         33:36          I wasn't sure if this study was gonna work out. And all of a sudden I noticed that in my head there is this extra little, it seemed almost like a window, like an extra window. Like in a video game there was like a little console. And in that console was a bird's eye view of the landscape that I was walking on and I was a little red dot. That was traversing. Now that is kidding. No kidding. And you just become a pillow pole, aloe or whatever they're called them. And I thought, wow, that's really cool. That makes it so much easier if you have that little extra module in all of a sudden is the correct word is that you happened all of a sudden it, oh, I just saw it. It was, it was just there. And then I kind of shyly shared this with someone.

Speaker 11:         34:20          I said, you know, this weird thing happened. I was walking along and I got this, I had this view in my mind and they'd looked at me kind of strangely and said, well of course. How else would you do it? That's exactly the, of course, you, you have a bird's eye view and you keep track of your location from a birds eye view. Of course. You do. I have that all the time. No you don't. I don't either. Proceed to break. And by the way, that voice right there that's been joining us from time to time, uh, we should explain that is Karen, Jake.

Speaker 10:         34:51          And I'm also known as the GPS girl.

Speaker 11:         34:54          She was nice enough to, uh, agree to read some things that we could use in our stories. So that's what you've been hearing.

Speaker 10:         34:59          Okay. Well let's, shall we start with the scripts that I have in front of me? Okay. Please enter your address.

Speaker 11:         35:05          Well that's amazing. It sounds like you've actually gone into the machine somehow.

Speaker 10:         35:10          I don't work out how to bottle that. Oh, I did.

Speaker 11:         35:16          Okay.

Speaker 14:         35:17          This is Jim Donahue from Fort Worth. Texas.

Speaker 15:         35:41          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember the Krill, which this is radio lab. Today on this program we are calling it lost and found, right? You have stories of getting lost and of course getting found now. I think we're gonna, we're gonna make a little adjustment here. Recalculating. Shift gears, approaching emotional lift and thank God. I don't know. Give it to me. This next story is a very different kind of lost and found sort of a love story. If you can tell us your name. Oh, here's the guy. My name is Alan [inaudible]. Do you want to say anything more than that? I Dunno. Is this, is this for like a credit intro? Let people introduce themselves? Oh, I don't know. I don't have a title. Okay. All right. So that salad girl, Emily will meet her a bit later for reasons that will become clear. The story begins on a fall day in Brooklyn.

Speaker 15:         36:35          And so the day in question, um, I guess was the morning of October 8th. They're both living in this one room loft in Brooklyn and we woke up and you know, both 21 went about our daily routine and prepared to go. He was in art school, she was taking some time off from art school to work for a local artist. So she would take the bike and I would take the train. What was it morning like? It was a beautiful day. It was, you know, sun was low in the skies there, you know, long shadows. I strapped on her helmet and adjusted it, took her bike out for her. We kissed each other goodbye and said, I love you. And I watched your ride down the street

Speaker 8:          37:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         37:13          this early morning. And then you know on, I went down into the subway, six hours later he's working in the studio doing some sculpture and he gets a call from a cop and he just said, Emily Goseo, she had an accident. She said, Bellevue, this is the address. And I said, oh, I mean do you have any more information? He just told me that it was bad.

Speaker 8:          37:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         37:38          I was like carrying a bunch of stuff and I just dropped everything and started running

Speaker 8:          37:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         37:47          now Alan and Emily had only been together nine months, but when it started says Allen, it was just so immediate. The night they got together, they both just kind of knew. It was sort of like a weird prophetic kind of thing where they think it was the first day that the school has had a snow day. It was snowed out. It was kind of like this past blizzard, you know, sort of like city shuts down, magical kind of thing. He'd gone out with some friends just as the snow was coming down and we were trapped at this party and that's where he bumped into Emily pint sized. Cause he's big like you're a desiccant eyes and very kind of have trouble describing your voice. It's almost as if, I know you guys are audio people, but it's like stereo. Almost. Truth is they've known each other for a while, but that night says Allen fireworks all of a sudden. And it felt right. So you had, you had a feeling this wasn't just a thing, this was a thing. Right, right. Or the thing, the thing, right. The thing that you think the soul thing. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 2:          38:51          Well Emily, uh, they've always been boys frowned to Emily. I mean that's Susan Gosu, Emily's mom. She says at first when Emily told her about Alan, she thought, okay, so that's another boy. Emily seemed to have that effect on boys perhaps because she didn't really seem to need them. Here is someone who's been obsessed with art and it's given up every body in her life for art. At the age of six, she was creating her own comic books in junior high school. She took drawing classes every night and then in high school she left us friends, boyfriends to go to a high school of the arts in Florida. No one stands in the way of her art. It's all she sees, it's all she focuses on. But then she visited Emily in May a few months before the accident and she met Allen. I met Alan and he was delightful. Um, but there was a different look that I'd never seen in Emily's eyes before when she looked at him and I didn't like it. Tell us about the accident from your perspective. From my, for when I, yeah, I was at work. I, you're in New Orleans mattering, which is a suburb of New Orleans and I get a telephone call and I looked and I saw it was Allen Allen has never called me before, answered the phone. I said Hello Allen. And he said, ah, you have to come. Emily was hit by a truck,

Speaker 15:         40:12          uh, 18 wheelers, semi truck,

Speaker 2:          40:14          and I took a breath and I said, Alan, is Emily dead? And he said, no, but you need to get here as soon as possible. Six hours later, her and her husband, Emily's dad, we're at Bellevue hospital here in Manhattan. They brought us into the, her Roman surgical ICU.

Speaker 15:         40:30          We all went in, she was just lying in bed and they were tubes, tubes down, her throat coming in and out and her face was so swollen. Emily covered in blood,

Speaker 2:          40:40          wait at probably at the time of the accident, about a hundred pounds and she then weighed 128 she had swollen 28 pounds.

Speaker 15:         40:50          She had multiple fractures in her leg and her pelvis in the left side of her face

Speaker 2:          40:54          open her abdomen and they had taken her intestines out and put them on top of her body so that she could breathe

Speaker 15:         41:01          and she was just lying completely still. You know that first 48 hours, nothing moved. Not Nothing. We took up shifts, you know, her mother would be there in the day and her father in the evening and then I would be there with her.

Speaker 2:          41:17          Her eyes weren't even flickering and as she sat there watching Emily not move, she says, she kept thinking why I got these four kids and everything bad seems to happen to Emily starting at six months ear infections than sinus infections than asthma, than kindergarten. Emily was

Speaker 15:         41:34          losing her hearing for reasons no one could quite figure out. She had to get hearing aids on both sides. But somehow her mom says, all this just made Emily more fierce if anyone can conquer this, it's Emily. I think on the second day they started to take her off her medication, expecting to see some sort of reaction from her and nothing,

Speaker 8:          41:57          nothing.

Speaker 11:         42:00          There was a nurse and the nurse said that Emily was gone and asked me about organ donations and I said yes. And so, um, I worked up enough courage to go into what they call the track room, which is where the residents usually are. And there was one woman residents sitting at a computer and I went and I said, when are you going to let Emily go? And she's so we will have a family meeting tomorrow morning and we'll talk then. And so I said, okay. And I, I left and I went back and, and I'm sitting with Emily side of her bed and I'm telling her, Emily and I read the book, the bridge of San Louis right when she was a sophomore. And I remember the ending of the book, there's a land of the living, there's a land of debt and the bridge is love. And that love is the only thing that survives. And it's kind of the way it goes. And so I was sitting there with Emily and I was telling this to, I was saying this and talking in her ear and saying this and talking to her and telling her that I would love her eternally through all time. That I love with never end. And Emily raised her left hand

Speaker 8:          43:15          did chick,

Speaker 11:         43:18          I got it. I can wait. What was it was, it was k Hos I was yelling for the nurse. I saw it. I saw her move.

Speaker 15:         43:27          That was really one of the really abrupt moments. Now

Speaker 11:         43:32          they knew Emily was not dead. Emily was alive. But how alive

Speaker 15:         43:38          over the next few days says Allen, she slowly started moving more, not really in response to anything. She'd arrive in bed, scratch your leg where there was a wound,

Speaker 11:         43:48          hold her hand down and she'd slap shit, slap our hands away.

Speaker 15:         43:53          But when they tell this to the doctors, the doctors would say that's not indicative of any kind of mental functioning. Could just be a reflex really. So the medical team began trying to determine just how damaged was she? The ophthalmologists teams were coming in and they were trying to get Emily's eyes to eye peoples to respond and they weren't responsive. And so I knew what that meant. What did that mean? It meant she could be blind. So Emily couldn't see, couldn't hear because remember she wore hearing aids and why didn't you just put those in? We tried. We tried many times to put it in, but she just wouldn't allow it. But what you do exactly when you did it, flail her head shake around kick and she would hit, had a lot of bruises on my body where she'd kicked me and pitched. So we, we stopped.

Speaker 15:         44:39          We every once in a while we would go back to it, but there was the question, you know, um, maybe she couldn't hear anymore. So what do you, what do you do to a person who's gay? You don't know what's going on inside her and you can't get to her. Um, you send it to a nursing home and you know, that's where she would have remained. And after several weeks in the ICU, Emily, she was stable and that meant they had to make a decision. Once you become stable, then you have to move off surgical ICU and out of the hospital to either a rehabilitation or to a nursing home. So that became the new question. Where would she go? Could she be repaired, so to speak? In which case you'd go to Rehab or is it for her? In which case she'd go to a nursing home.

Speaker 15:         45:23          Now making that call medically is sometimes tricky. That's Dr McCalla Eisenberg. She's a physician at NYU and it's her job to make that call. And she says one of the key criteria for getting someone into rehab to do Rehab on somebody, you need to have them reacting to you. A person needs to be able to participate in a meaningful way for three hours of therapy a day. They have to be able to follow commands because that's how you rehabilitate someone. If the person can't hear, if the person can't see, then there's no way to communicate with her. And so they made the assessment that she could not go to rehab and that Emily should go to a nursing home.

Speaker 16:         46:08          Mm MM.

Speaker 17:         46:08          So I sent my husband back to New Orleans to look for a nursing home. Did they can bring her back to,

Speaker 15:         46:17          they just kept it all secret from me that they were going to take her away from me. I mean, how do you

Speaker 17:         46:21          tell someone who loves your daughter that much? That we're taking her away. But there was not just one life that we had in our hands. It was two lives. We felt that that would be the best thing for him. And Alan could hate us.

Speaker 18:         46:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 17:         46:37          maybe as a way for him to bridge and let go for that grief.

Speaker 16:         46:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 15:         46:45          but then as the doctors are prepping Emily to move her to a nursing home, they had to remove her tracheotomy, which was helping her breathe. And she all of a sudden started talking. Really? She, she spoke? Yes. What was she saying? He would curse. Don't touch me. You blank to blank. You know, she would say, stop. This was in response to someone touching her, touching her. And if she wasn't cursing, says Ellen, she would call everybody Miss Dash. Would certain people that were touching her where mustache would, oh, let's, um, from sentence sensibility coding gene aust yellow. Yeah. We had watched the movie like a couple months previous to this, so somehow she was locked in the movie and it was just the assumption of the doctors that she was just sort of mentally, but if she's calling people miss dash, doesn't that at least mean something? No, it wasn't enough to say that Emily could follow a command, like set up, raise your right hand.

Speaker 15:         47:39          So the plan was still the nursing home, right? I mean though, every possibility had not been exhausted. I can see him. He was sitting across the room and his jaws were just clenched. It just was not going to give up. And he was saying, you have to give her a chance. She, you have to give her the chance. You have a plan. No, I had no plan whatsoever. It was lost. This experience was just completely traumatic to me emotionally. But at the same time I was going to help her in whatever way I could. Uh, the only trajectory I had was to help her in one night, just a few days before Emily was going to be discharged to a nursing home away from him. I was there alone with her and it's 3:00 AM or something, and she was calm. Like she wasn't trying to fight me away or anything.

Speaker 15:         48:24          I had helped her fix a thing that was wrong with her, uh, mouth wiring. It was like a wire that was poking her and I fixed it for it. And he says at that moment, something occurred to him. I really just was like, in the recesses of my mind, he thought of the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan. He'd read about it a few days earlier online and he thought, what if I tried what Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller on Emily? I took her left hand with my left hand and I leaned over and using her wrist as the baseline for the words. And his finger is the pen I just wrote. I waited a second. Oh, wait a second. Oh, waited a second. The e waited a second. You then according to Allen, she said to him, she said, Oh, you love me. Thank you. She literally replied the reply immediately because she knew who, you know, she has no idea who I am.

Speaker 7:          49:25          Uh,

Speaker 15:         49:28          now we had a way to get to her so he could figure out how much of her was actually there and maybe even prove it to the doctors. You know, I had to have something that was conclusive to present to them. The following evening I took out my cell phone and it has a record function on it and I started recording

Speaker 19:         49:49          question after question to determine her Tonya disability.

Speaker 7:          49:53          What is your name?

Speaker 19:         49:57          What? W. H. A. T. Hi. Yes, I am.

Speaker 7:          50:05          Hey,

Speaker 19:         50:07          you finger spelled every letter. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          50:13          [inaudible] Hi [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] she's writing her name on the poem of mine.

Speaker 19:         50:58          Alan called me at four o'clock in the morning, said, you have to come now. I have proof.

Speaker 7:          51:02          No one's going to ask her what year it is. [inaudible] hi, I'm going to ride year. [inaudible] [inaudible] question mark. Very good. And Emily. Very good. Very, very good. You know where you a question mark? Okay. Right now I'm going to ride hospital

Speaker 19:         51:52          that they're about four 45 in the morning. Alan is over there by the bed continuing to finger spell and talk to her and she, she calls him Allen. She knows that this person who is finger spelling on her hand is named Allen, but Allen can't get her to understand who he really is. That it's her alley.

Speaker 7:          52:11          I'm just going to read my name again. Alan.

Speaker 19:         52:13          She just couldn't make that mental jump to connect her past life with her present.

Stop scratching your wounds. And I dreamed they blend in with reality.

Speaker 15:         54:16          She says she knew somehow that there are people around her, but she couldn't get to them and that she also knew she was in a dream.
