[Narrator] Thus far, we've only looked at the form of an utterance or sentence,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
what words it has, whether they fit the subject, object, verb kind of ordering,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but we haven't really looked at what they mean.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It turns out that these 2 are not the same thing,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and one of the most famous counter examples comes, again, from our man Noam Chomsky

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with the sentence, "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And this is a sentence that's syntactically well formed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Idea is the noun; sleep is the verb.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is an adverb.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
These are all modifiers that make it a noun phrase, but it's not clear what the meaning is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Actually, let me try to sketch it out.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We've got some ideas, and I hear that one always represents ideas with old tiny lightbulbs,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
except that our ideas are colorless so let's ignore this yellow somehow,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and simultaneously green.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This--it's not obvious how to draw this, and then there's sleeping,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I think the universal symbol for that in English is a bunch of Zs.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The sound that snoring makes in colloquial English,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but they're sleeping furiously so Zzzzz, lots of Zs,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and as my total difficulty to sketch this,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I should point out, well, A: I'm bad at sketching,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but B: it's really not clear what this means.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
What does it mean for an idea to sleep?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I thought ideas were conceptions that people had; can ideas go to sleep?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And people can try to put poetic interpretations on this.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You can imagine a sort of a prose or poetic way of reading this,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but in general I can sort of alter the sentence and make it still syntactically correct

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but symantically more and more contradictory.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's really not clear what this sentences means.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Turns out that we have similar notions in computer programming languages.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In python, you can write 1 + 1 or hello + world and get reasonable answers out,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but what happens if I try to write 1 + hello?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This does not really make sense.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's not clear what it means to add an integer to a string,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and in general if you feed such a program fragment or expression to a python interpreter,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
it will give you some sort of run-time era which is the equivalent of throwing up its hands and saying, "I don't know."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Just to review what it means for a program to lead to a run-time era or to describe something that doesn't make much symantic sense,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
here I've written 4 program fragments, and what I'd like you to do is check each one that would lead to some sort of run-time era,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you have to assume that each one is a complete program.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What you see is what you get; there are no other hidden variables or imports declared earlier.

00:02:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Multiple multiple choice, try it out.
