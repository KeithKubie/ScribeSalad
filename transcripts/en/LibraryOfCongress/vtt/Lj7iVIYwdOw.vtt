00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.150
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
&gt;&gt; Next up is Canadian
Visual Artist Sarah Hatton.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
Sarah's deep interest in human
nature and insatiable curiosity

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.150
about the natural works are
found throughout her paintings

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.830
and mixed media work.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.950
Through her paintings and projects,
she observes and explores notions

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.370
of longing, transition, morality,
and human connections with nature.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.220
She's here today to share
about her process of creating.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.510
Please welcome Sarah Hatton.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.710
[ Applause ]

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.520
&gt;&gt; Sarah Hatton: Thank you.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm Sarah.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
I'm a visual artist
from Ottawa, Canada.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.980
I'm a lifelong naturalist.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.980
I like challenging myself
in horticultural ways.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.960
I grew the only giant
sequoia from seed

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.340
but it survived the Canadian
winter six times in a row.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.000
Of course, like any millennial,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.600
the little tree has its
own Twitter account.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.410
I'm also a beekeeper.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.880
Now if there's one thing I can
say about my artwork, in general,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.270
it's that science and nature always
seem to make an experience in it.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.010
It's something I just
can't switch off.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.980
I was invited here today to talk
about my latest series of work,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.010
which is called Attachment.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.570 position:56%
But I thought I would give you a bit
of background into a previous series

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.180
of work that I did just
so that you can start

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.770
to see the connections
that I'm talking about.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.150 position:56%
So, 2013 was not a good year for
bees -- not a good year for my bees,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.060
as well as some of the
other beekeepers' colonies

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.540
in the region that I live in.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.720
I lost all of my colonies and
because we're a tight network,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.270
beekeepers, I was learning
more and more

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.510
about colony [inaudible]
disorder, the global bee crisis

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.940
and systemic pesticides that have
been thought to be causing a lot

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780
of the problems with the bees.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.530 position:56%
So, when I lost my hives, I wanted
to do something meaningful with them

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.240
so that I could start some
activism and start to talk

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.890
about was happening to them.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.190
But I didn't know what to do.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.680
I had all of these --
thousands of dead bodies

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.300
and I didn't have the idea yet,
so what does one do in that case?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
I bagged them up in Zip-locks
and I put them in my freezer

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.340
until I had my eureka moment.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.810
My family is either really
understanding about this

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.400
or they're just resigned
to the stuff that I do now.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.800
And the eureka moment
came when I thought

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.300
about the mathematical patterns
that are inherent in nature,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.850
particularly the Fibonacci
sequence of math that is found

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.050
in seed producing plants,
like the sunflower.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.310
And it was these patterns
that gave me my inspiration

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.350
for what to finally do.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.850 position:56%
These are the sorts of crops that
are treated with the same pesticides

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.870
that are thought to be
destroying the bees.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.250
So, I glued -- one by one -- all of
the honeybees into these patterns

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.900
and then I coated them with resin.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.670
And the resulting work --

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.350
this is the prototype
and I get to do a cool,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.120
badass art disclaimer here that
some of these patterns tend

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.810
to use the sense of vertigo in
some viewers so if you start

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.470
to feel uncomfortable,
just close your eyes.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.970
These are 4 feet across.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.190
So, these are -- because systemic
pesticides affect the bee's central

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.710 position:56%
nervous system and they wipe out
the ability to navigate and get back

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.620
to their hives, I chose patterns
from crop circles as well

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.870
that gave a similar affect --

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.840
an optical illusion effect
to the viewer and gave

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.340
that same sense of disorientation.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.940
That's another piece that's
4 feet by 4 feet circle.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.390
It's about 10,000 bees
in that piece.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.050
So, you can read study after study
of the data behind the bee decline

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.850
but when you look at art, art
gives you that visceral gut-punch

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.800
of emotion that tells you what the
story is behind what you're seeing.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.930
This series got quite a
bit of international press,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.060
partly because I think
of the timing of it,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.160
the bee decline was just starting
to be recognized but also,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.480
not a lot of artists out these
using thousands of dead bees

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.850
as their medium, I don't --
I hope that's still the case.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.640
So, what I want you
to think about here is

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.660
that I've used a single
item repeated on math

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.040
to send a specific message through
a symbolic pattern, which brings me

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.360
to my next series of work.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.970
So, meanwhile in Canada, Library
in Archives Canada, our colleagues

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.010
to the north, have started
their mass digitization project.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.780
It's a multiyear, enormous
project with many,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.280
many resources devoted to it.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.280
and that's the digitization of the
complete collection of the CEF,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.280
Canadian Expeditionary
Force World War I files.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.490
And this is an enormous undertaking
and the data that will be produced

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.980
by the digitization project, a
treasure in itself, but there --

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.780
as anyone who has done a mass
digitization project knows,

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.850
there's byproducts
that come from it,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.070
you have to hire additional
staff to process the files.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.460
These are paper records
that have been held together

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.240
for a hundred years by pins,
stapes, and paperclips.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.950
And when I turned the preservation
center, the thing that struck me,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.410
as an aside from the immensity of
the project, was that they had bin,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.070
after bin, after bin of these brass
pins that held the records together

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.340
that had been taken apart and it
struck me as so moving to see --

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.560
physically represented
in front of me --

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.090
the number of people that this was.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.530
And I asked them, what are you
going to do with all of these pins?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.900 position:56%
And they said, well, we want to do
something to commemorate the project

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.720
but we're not quite sure what.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.990 position:56%
We're thinking of maybe melting them
all down and making metals or coins.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.330
And I thought -- that didn't
sit well with me because I had

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.460
that reaction to seeing the number
of them and these were items

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.590 position:56%
that held together Canada's
military memory for a hundred years,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.200
you can't just take
that kind of destroy it

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.040
by melting it all together,
there's something there.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.560
Again, waiting for my eureka
moment, I said, give me one of them

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.380
to take home and I'll think about
this and see what I come up with.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.610 position:56%
So, I took one of them back and I
was just sitting there looking at it

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.220
and I thought each one of these
fasteners has been embossed,

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.740
it was the style of the
time, with a star, eureka.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.040
So, this is what I did.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.950
&gt;&gt; This is a single
brass fastener pin.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.060
It's 100-years-old.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.560
These are the pins that held
together the military service

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.210
records of each Canadian soldier
who served in the First World War.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.860
When Library and Archives Canada
began their mass digitization

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.840
of soldier's files, each of these
pins had to be detached by hand.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.960
In total, there were
640,000 of them.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.480
Nobody knew what to do
with all of this brass

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.070
and so they asked an artist.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.280
&gt;&gt; Sarah Hatton: I wanted to do
something with these fasteners

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.290
that would preserve their
meaning as historical artifacts

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:48.020
but it would also find a respectful
way to convey the magnitude

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.970
of human loss during [inaudible].

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:00.530 position:56%
Each fastener is stamped with a star

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.600
and there's unmistakable military
symbolism attached to the gold star

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:13.180
when you think about the sacrifice
that these families have made

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:21.580
and it was that that gave
me my inspiration for this.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:33.850 position:56%
I started by focusing on the five
major battles of the First World War

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.630
that involved the Canadian's
Expeditionary Force.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.040
&gt;&gt; After determining the
geographical coordinates of each

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.340
of these battles, Hatton
generated star maps

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.800
of what the skies would have looked
like on the nights following each

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.100
of these major conflicts.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.900
Then she got to work.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:10:27.040
[ Music ]

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.780
The result is a series of star
charts titled, Detachment.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:41.620
These pieces show us exactly how
the stars appeared 100 years ago,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.130
the first night after the fighting
was over, the skies that, no doubt,

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.770
the surviving soldiers would
have been looking up at.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.620
&gt;&gt; Sarah Hatton: This series
is a tribute piece, sacrifice,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.490
timelessness, and remembrance.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:12.660
Regardless of your political view,
stars are a cross cultural constant

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.410
that we look to for direction,

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.880
whether that's spiritual
or navigational.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.280
They're a universal
way that we recognize

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.080
and memorialize the fallen.

sincere gratitude to Library

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:50.010

me in this direction and to --

And I also want to thank
the Library of Congress

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.690
for inviting me here today to share
this with you, it's been an honor.
