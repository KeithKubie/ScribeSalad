00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.770
The problem is that the vertex shader changed the positions but did not modify

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.470
the corresponding shading normals. All the shading normals continue to point

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
straight up. In theory, the fragment shader could also be modified, but it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.090
doesn't have to be. It's not wrong. It could use the position to compute the

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.060
normal. It's much more straightforward, however, to modify the shading normal

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.150
in the vertex shader. This, in fact, is the next exercise.
