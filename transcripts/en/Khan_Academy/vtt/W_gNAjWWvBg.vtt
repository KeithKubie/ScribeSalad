00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:02.122
- [Instructor] What we
have right over here

00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:06.236
is the graph of Y is equal to E to the X

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:08.548
and what we're going to know
by the end of this video

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:12.966
is one of the most
fascinating ideas in calculus

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.912
and once again it reinforces the idea

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:19.382
that E is really this
somewhat magical number.

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.996
So we're gonna do a little
bit of an exploration.

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:24.495
Let's just pick some points on this curve

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.426
of Y is equal to E to the X

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.098
and think about what the
slope of the tangent line is

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:31.272
or what the derivative looks like

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.534
and so let's say when Y is equal to one

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.074
or when E to the X is equal to one,

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.442
this is the case when X is equal to zero.

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:40.352
Well, the slope of the tangent line

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:44.651
looks like it is one,
which is curious because

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.841
that's exactly the value of
the function at that point.

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:52.008
What about when E to the X is
equal to two right over here?

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.835
Well here, let me do it in another color,

00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:00.002
the slope of the tangent
line sure looks pretty close,

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:04.215
sure looks pretty close to two.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:08.382
What about when E to
the X is equal to 1/2?

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:13.134
So that's happening right about here.

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:15.925
Well, it sure looks like the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:18.193
is about 1/2.

00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:19.948
We could try what happens when E to the X

00:01:19.948 --> 00:01:21.933
is equal to five?

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.042
Well, the slope of the tangent line here

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:27.375
sure does look pretty close,

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:31.470
sure does look pretty close to five

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.303
and so just eyeballing it,

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:38.387
is it the case that the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:42.304
of E to the X is the same
thing, is E to the X?

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.686
And I will tell you and
this is an amazing thing

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:47.839
that that is indeed true,

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:51.588
that if I have some function, F of X,

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:53.838
that is equal to E to the X

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:56.810
and if I were to take
the derivative of this,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.192
this is going to be equal
to E to the X as well

00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:01.947
or another way of saying it,

00:02:01.947 --> 00:02:05.780
the derivative with
respect to X of E to the X

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.902
is equal to E to the X

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.647
and that is an amazing thing.

00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:15.389
In previous lessons or courses,

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.191
you've learned about ways to define E

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.453
and this could be a new one.

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:21.755
E is the number that where
if you take that number

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.553
to the power of X, if
you define a function

00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:25.523
or expression as E to the X,

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.466
it's that number where if you
take the derivative of that

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:30.299
it's still going to be E to the X.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.232
And what you're looking here, this curve,

00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:37.107
it's a curve where the
value that's Y value

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:41.274
at any point is the same as
the slope of the tangent line.

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:45.030
If that doesn't strike you as mysterious

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.079
and magical and amazing just yet, it will.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.344
Maybe tonight you'll wake up
in the middle of the night

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.802
and you'll realize just what's going on.

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.494
Now, some of you might be
saying okay, this is cool,

00:02:55.494 --> 00:02:58.693
you're telling me this, but
how do I know it's true?

00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:01.646
In another video, we will do the proof.
