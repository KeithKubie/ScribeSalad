00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.087
- [Voiceover] Now I'm gonna
clear off the screen here

00:00:02.087 --> 00:00:06.125
and we're gonna talk about the
shape of the sine function.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:07.292
Let's do that.

00:00:10.086 --> 00:00:11.911
This is a plot of the sine function

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.857
where the angle, theta, this
is the theta axis in this plot,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:19.255
where theta has been plotted
out on a straight line

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:21.660
instead of wrapped around this circle.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.918
So if we draw a line on here,

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:26.918
let's make this circle a radius one.

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:29.663
So if I draw this line up here,

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.317
it's on a unit circle,
the definition of sine

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.150
of theta, this will be theta here,

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.224
is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:43.179
So this is the opposite side

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.262
and that distance is the opposite leg

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:50.395
of that triangle, is
this value right here.

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:53.403
So sine of theta is actually equal to y

00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:56.372
over the hypotenuse and
the hypotenuse is one

00:00:56.372 --> 00:00:58.778
in all cases around this.

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:01.956
So, if I plot this on a curve,

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:05.706
this is an angle and I
basically go over here

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:08.905
and plot it like that.

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.820
And then as theta swings
around the circle,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.079
I'm gonna plot the different values of y.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.279
If it comes over this
way, down here like this,

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:24.029
right, you can see that, that plots

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.106
over there like that.

00:01:26.106 --> 00:01:28.899
Now when the angle gets
back all the way to zero,

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.738
of course, the sine function
comes all the way back to zero

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:36.310
and then it repeats again
as our vector swings

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.687
around the other way.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:41.799
So the sine of two pi is zero,
just like the sine of zero.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.726
So every two pi, if I go off the screen,

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:48.393
every two pi comes back
and repeats to zero.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:52.045
So now I wanna do the same
thing with the cosine function

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:56.171
that we did with sine, where
we project the projection

00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:00.338
of this value onto this time
the cosine curve down here.

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:05.900
This has the cosine curve with
time going down on the page.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.233
And our definition of cosine

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.648
was adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:16.455
Hypotenuse is one in our drawing.

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:17.955
So cosine of theta

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:24.145
equals adjacent which is x, the x value,

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:27.107
divided by hypotenuse which is one.

00:02:27.107 --> 00:02:29.825
So in this diagram, the cosine of theta

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:34.238
is actually the x value
which is this x right here.

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.405
So let me clean this off for a second.

00:02:38.752 --> 00:02:39.880
And we'll start at the beginning.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.134
Let's start with the radius
pointing straight sideways.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:48.301
And we know that cosine of
theta equals zero is one.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.992
So if I drop that down,
if I project that down

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:53.659
onto the angle zero,

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:58.480
that's this point right here on the curve.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.530
Now as we roll forward,
we go to a higher angle,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.447
this projection now moves
to here on the curve.

00:03:09.261 --> 00:03:11.761
When the arrow is straight up,

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:16.129
we are at this point right here,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.133
we go back to the axis.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:21.966
If we go continue on,
this projects down here.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.243
We're moving this radius vector

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.909
around in a circle like this.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.127
And actually this one
will be at the same point

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:41.060
as before, as the one above, but it'll be

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.621
on this part of the curve here.

00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:46.538
And when we get back to zero again,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.473
the projection is to this point here.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:54.793
So that's a way to
visualize the cosine curve

00:03:54.793 --> 00:03:58.960
getting generated by a vector
rotating around this circle.

00:03:59.858 --> 00:04:01.581
The cosine comes out the bottom

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:03.826
because it's the projection on the x-axis,

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.895
and when we did the sine,
it was the projection

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:09.867
on the y-axis, produced the
sine wave when we went this way.

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:13.528
So I like to visualize this
because this rotating vector

00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.308
is a really simple and powerful idea,

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:18.249
and we can see how it actually generates,

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.323
it's a way to generate
sine and cosine waves.

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:23.283
And you can see how sort of naturally

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:24.930
they come out at different phases, right.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.534
The sine starts at zero and
the cosine starts at one.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.271
With this way of drawing it,
you could see why that happens.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.291
So this relationship between circles

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.943
and rotating vectors and sines and cosines

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.321
is a very powerful idea.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:39.007
We're really gonna take advantage of this.
