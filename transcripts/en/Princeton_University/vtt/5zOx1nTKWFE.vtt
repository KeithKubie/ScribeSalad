        [MUSIC]
              

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.580
        MIKE SHOWAK: Welcome to Koidu.
              

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.490
        We're here on our 2012
        pre-assessment trip as part of      

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.940
        the Princeton Chapter of
        Engineers Without Borders, the      

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.570
        Sierra Leone Project, looking
        to find a project to do here      

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.320
        in Koidu town, in the Kono
        district, eastern province of      

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.570
        Sierra Leone.
              

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.920
        STEPH TEEPLE: Koidu is
        a fairly large city.      

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.890
        It's the biggest in the
        eastern province.      

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.170
        I've been told that about ninety
        thousand to a hundred      

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.470
        thousand people live there.
              

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.550
        But, unfortunately, all one
        hundred thousand of those      

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.940
        people suffer lack of access to
        paved roads, running water,      

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.030
        electricity.
              

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.180
        There are no power lines.
              

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.800
        Any source of electricity that
        people contain comes from      

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.010
        generators or individual
        solar installations.      

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.700
        MIKE SHOWAK: When we go to these
        communities, we often      

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.030
        spend a number of hours just
        sitting and observing.      

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.980
        You have to watch where people
        are getting their water from,      

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.220
        where they're going to the
        bathroom, and how they're      

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.010
        actually distributing
        medical supplies.      

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.320
        As you're doing that people will
        start to come up to you      

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.470
        and mention things that are
        going on in their community.      

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.400
        And, by really trying to
        interact with these people is      

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.100
        how you understand where their
        needs are, where their      

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.860
        problems are, and what
        is actually going      

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.110
        well in their community.
              

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.030
        
              

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.130
        KATIE BREEN: We went to Wardu
        this week, and we went there      

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.440
        with the same mission that
        we went with the other      

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.300
        communities, going there to talk
        to the people that live      

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.640
        there and interview with the
        chief, and really get a sense      

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.720
        of what these people are
        experiencing in their      

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.740
        day-to-day life, while
        living in this place.      

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.030
        CHRISTINE FENG: Ultimately, we
        chose Dorma as the community      

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.500
        to form a partnership with.
              

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.880
        We determined that the most
        pressing problems that      

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.790
        currently face the village are:
        one, lack of a source of      

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.440
        clean water; two,lack of a
        sanitation and latrine      

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.530
        facility; and, three, lack
        of safe bridges on the      

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.310
        main road to town.
              

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.220
        MIKE SHOWAK: Dorma only has one
        functioning well, which is      

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.300
        dry for at least half the year,
        sending residents to the      

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.580
        swamps nearby to gain water.
              

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.200
        CHRISTINE FENG: One of the
        main issues in Dorma that      

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.490
        we've identified are these
        unsanitary latrines, which are      

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.630
        essentially shallow pits dug
        within the ground, maybe about      

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.970
        ten meters from houses, with
        palm fronds and various      

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.590
        lengths of cloth outside.
              

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.550
        These pits contribute to a lot
        of unsanitary practices and      

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.170
        increase the amount of illnesses
        within the community      

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.490
        tremendously.
              

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.790
        MIKE SHOWAK: One of the
        potential problems in the      

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.080
        Dorma community are two
        pipe bridges they      

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.390
        have over small creeks.
              

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.400
        As you can see, these bridges
        aren't really designed for      

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.210
        large scale transportation.
              

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.900
        Cars have a tough time getting
        across them, which impacts the      

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.430
        health clinic set on the other
        side of the bridges, and      

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.440
        motorbikes, the primary form
        of transportation, have a      

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.740
        really tough time as they
        skid out on the pipes.      

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.840
        Locals try and put the mud back
        frequently during the      

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.630
        rainy season, but it washes
        away pretty quickly.      

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.540
        CHRISTINE FENG: Over the past
        few days, we've been in talks      

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.390
        with the Dorma chief, and the
        community of Dorma is very      

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980
        excited partner with us to
        form an EWB-USA project.
