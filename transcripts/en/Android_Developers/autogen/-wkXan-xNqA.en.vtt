this is just a start for us we're really

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
this is just a start for us we're really
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.760
this is just a start for us we're really
excited about you know the growth of

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.050
excited about you know the growth of
Android and the growth of the market

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060
Android and the growth of the market
 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.480
Android and the growth of the market
itself and we're looking forward to

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490
itself and we're looking forward to
 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.460
itself and we're looking forward to
putting more games out exclusively on

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
putting more games out exclusively on
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.900
putting more games out exclusively on
Android so wanted to jump into a couple

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
Android so wanted to jump into a couple
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.980
Android so wanted to jump into a couple
of things that are they're really

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990
of things that are they're really
 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.660
of things that are they're really
important about game development and the

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
important about game development and the
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.520
important about game development and the
first one as a developer which I'm sure

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
first one as a developer which I'm sure
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.870
first one as a developer which I'm sure
you've realized is that making games

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
you've realized is that making games
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.030
you've realized is that making games
isn't as easy as you might think it is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040
isn't as easy as you might think it is
 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.980
isn't as easy as you might think it is
that at the start so not only do you

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990
that at the start so not only do you
 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.920
that at the start so not only do you
have to have a killer game concept

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930
have to have a killer game concept
 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.660
have to have a killer game concept
intuitive UI and engaging art you also

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
intuitive UI and engaging art you also
 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.280
intuitive UI and engaging art you also
have to decide between do you want to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290
have to decide between do you want to
 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.050
have to decide between do you want to
have a paid app or would you like to use

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
have a paid app or would you like to use
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.060
have a paid app or would you like to use
in-app purchase and then you know

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070
in-app purchase and then you know
 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.500
in-app purchase and then you know
thinking about the future you want to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
thinking about the future you want to
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.090
thinking about the future you want to
think about how well the backend

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100
think about how well the backend
 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.980
think about how well the backend
services are to scale to the millions of

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990
services are to scale to the millions of
 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.060
services are to scale to the millions of
users that you're going to have when

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070
users that you're going to have when
 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.330
users that you're going to have when
your game is you know a hit but not only

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
your game is you know a hit but not only
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.250
your game is you know a hit but not only
do you have to consider those things but

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260
do you have to consider those things but
 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.660
do you have to consider those things but
there's also things that you might have

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
there's also things that you might have
 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.420
there's also things that you might have
forgotten about and so essentially what

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
forgotten about and so essentially what
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.740
forgotten about and so essentially what
you the things that you might forget

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
you the things that you might forget
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.349
you the things that you might forget
about our memory performance and the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359
about our memory performance and the
 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.300
about our memory performance and the
different devices and what you should

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310
different devices and what you should
 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.490
different devices and what you should
prioritize as being the you know your

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500
prioritize as being the you know your
 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.860
prioritize as being the you know your
focal points as well as regions on the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
focal points as well as regions on the
 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.080
focal points as well as regions on the
locale and so all of these combined you

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090
locale and so all of these combined you
 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.460
locale and so all of these combined you
know should be taken into a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470
know should be taken into a
 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.900
know should be taken into a
when you're thinking about your Android

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910
when you're thinking about your Android
 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.640
when you're thinking about your Android
game development and in order to create

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650
game development and in order to create
 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.280
game development and in order to create
a successful experience and so I'm going

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290
a successful experience and so I'm going
 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.790
a successful experience and so I'm going
to give a couple of tips on basically

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800
to give a couple of tips on basically
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.100
to give a couple of tips on basically
some things that we've learned and and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
some things that we've learned and and
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.830
some things that we've learned and and
jump right into that the first thing is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
jump right into that the first thing is
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.650
jump right into that the first thing is
it's important to pick the right set of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
it's important to pick the right set of
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.420
it's important to pick the right set of
devices that you want to really tailor

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
devices that you want to really tailor
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.560
devices that you want to really tailor
your game to and and I guess tell you

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570
your game to and and I guess tell you
 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.240
your game to and and I guess tell you
step back at what Android really

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
step back at what Android really
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.310
step back at what Android really
provides as an opportunity to with a

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320
provides as an opportunity to with a
 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.650
provides as an opportunity to with a
single development process reach a huge

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660
single development process reach a huge
 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.220
single development process reach a huge
variety of devices the Android platform

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230
variety of devices the Android platform
 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.630
variety of devices the Android platform
is so diverse and so and so great but

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640
is so diverse and so and so great but
 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.010
is so diverse and so and so great but
you can't just hit publish and get a

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020
you can't just hit publish and get a
 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.630
you can't just hit publish and get a
game to work on every single device it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640
game to work on every single device it
 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.070
game to work on every single device it
does take a little work and you got to

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080
does take a little work and you got to
 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.250
does take a little work and you got to
step through it and so what we suggest

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260
step through it and so what we suggest
 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.370
step through it and so what we suggest
is pick a few devices that you really

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380
is pick a few devices that you really
 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.230
is pick a few devices that you really
want to focus your QA on and do most of

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240
want to focus your QA on and do most of
 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.980
want to focus your QA on and do most of
your of your testing on and and picking

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990
your of your testing on and and picking
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.430
your of your testing on and and picking
those devices definitely comes down to

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440
those devices definitely comes down to
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.200
those devices definitely comes down to
who who are the users that you're most

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210
who who are the users that you're most
 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.170
who who are the users that you're most
interested in demographics of people who

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180
interested in demographics of people who
 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.760
interested in demographics of people who
have those devices and there's a ton of

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770
have those devices and there's a ton of
 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.050
have those devices and there's a ton of
information available online about the

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060
information available online about the
 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.850
information available online about the
breadth and the adoption of particular

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
breadth and the adoption of particular
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.230
breadth and the adoption of particular
devices that can help you make that

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240
devices that can help you make that
 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.010
devices that can help you make that
those decisions and but it's important

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020
those decisions and but it's important
 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.270
those decisions and but it's important
to keep in mind that there are times

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280
to keep in mind that there are times
 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.590
to keep in mind that there are times
when you just won't be able to support

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600
when you just won't be able to support
 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.020
when you just won't be able to support
every device and often it's better to

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030
every device and often it's better to
 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.670
every device and often it's better to
just leave a device off your approved

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
just leave a device off your approved
 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.790
just leave a device off your approved
list rather than give people a subpar

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800
list rather than give people a subpar
 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.960
list rather than give people a subpar
experience next thing is just the screen

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970
experience next thing is just the screen
 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.159
experience next thing is just the screen
resolution it can really it's it's a

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169
resolution it can really it's it's a
 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.670
resolution it can really it's it's a
tricky issue but you know there there

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680
tricky issue but you know there there
 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.950
tricky issue but you know there there
are really high res phones and tablets

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960
are really high res phones and tablets
 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.310
are really high res phones and tablets
and low res phones as well and you know

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320
and low res phones as well and you know
 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.200
and low res phones as well and you know
you definitely want to want to do

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210
you definitely want to want to do
 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.790
you definitely want to want to do
everything you can to support all those

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
everything you can to support all those
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.940
everything you can to support all those
but sometimes it's important to just

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950
but sometimes it's important to just
 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.740
but sometimes it's important to just
restrict your apps so that it only goes

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750
restrict your apps so that it only goes
 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.930
restrict your apps so that it only goes
out to the devices that you have had

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940
out to the devices that you have had
 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.320
out to the devices that you have had
time to develop for so far but keeping

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330
time to develop for so far but keeping
 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.370
time to develop for so far but keeping
in mind that you always want to go back

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380
in mind that you always want to go back
 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.320
in mind that you always want to go back
and make sure as many users as possible

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330
and make sure as many users as possible
 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.330
and make sure as many users as possible
have accessed here to your application

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340
have accessed here to your application
 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.540
have accessed here to your application
one one thing that we found particularly

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550
one one thing that we found particularly
 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.460
one one thing that we found particularly
interesting is that you can't just focus

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470
interesting is that you can't just focus
 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.070
interesting is that you can't just focus
on the pixel resolution of a device

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080
on the pixel resolution of a device
 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.040
on the pixel resolution of a device
because there are 10 inch tablets and 4

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050
because there are 10 inch tablets and 4
 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.360
because there are 10 inch tablets and 4
inch phones that have exactly the same

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370
inch phones that have exactly the same
 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.870
inch phones that have exactly the same
screen resolution and and that can cause

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880
screen resolution and and that can cause
 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.060
screen resolution and and that can cause
a pretty jarring difference for users if

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070
a pretty jarring difference for users if
 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.730
a pretty jarring difference for users if
you're writing your code to just pay

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740
you're writing your code to just pay
 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.520
you're writing your code to just pay
attention to those pixels so definitely

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530
attention to those pixels so definitely

our QA teams have the ability to jump
 

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.030
our QA teams have the ability to jump
through the game so they can make sure

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040
through the game so they can make sure
 

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.000
through the game so they can make sure
that when we have a bug or a problem

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.010
that when we have a bug or a problem
 

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.440
that when we have a bug or a problem
later in the game they can jump right to

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.450
later in the game they can jump right to
 

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.760
later in the game they can jump right to
it and they don't have to play through

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:51.770
it and they don't have to play through
 

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.850
it and they don't have to play through
the whole game every time

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.860
the whole game every time
 

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.610
the whole game every time
it's also a good way to sort of

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:56.620
it's also a good way to sort of
 

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:03.120
it's also a good way to sort of
experiment with new features so one of

no this is you great so you know one of
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.990
no this is you great so you know one of
the problems that's actually classic

Android that we'd like to illustrate

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170
Android that we'd like to illustrate
 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.350
Android that we'd like to illustrate
here it's you know once you essentially

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360
here it's you know once you essentially
 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.180
here it's you know once you essentially
finished creating your game and you're

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.190
finished creating your game and you're
 

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.150
finished creating your game and you're
ready to put it through a real rigorous

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160
ready to put it through a real rigorous
 

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.829
ready to put it through a real rigorous
testing schedule and make sure that it's

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839
testing schedule and make sure that it's
 

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:25.340
testing schedule and make sure that it's
ready to go out right you'll you'll

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.350
ready to go out right you'll you'll
 

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.210
ready to go out right you'll you'll
classically fall into this problem where

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.220
classically fall into this problem where

classically fall into this problem where
you say okay I have a thousand devices

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480
you say okay I have a thousand devices
 

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.360
you say okay I have a thousand devices
which are the devices that I should

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:30.370
which are the devices that I should
 

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.009
which are the devices that I should
prioritize and what are actually the

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:32.019
prioritize and what are actually the
 

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:33.300
prioritize and what are actually the
operating systems that I want to make

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
operating systems that I want to make
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.009
operating systems that I want to make
sure that I have you know a really

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:35.019
sure that I have you know a really
 

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.259
sure that I have you know a really
polished experience on and so the way

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:37.269
polished experience on and so the way
 

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:38.850
polished experience on and so the way
that we think about this at pocket jams

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:38.860
that we think about this at pocket jams
 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.680
that we think about this at pocket jams
is essentially in this matrix view and

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.690
is essentially in this matrix view and
 

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.759
is essentially in this matrix view and
so in a sense you'll see for example

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:43.769
so in a sense you'll see for example
 

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:46.259
so in a sense you'll see for example
we've got some devices on the left-hand

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:46.269
we've got some devices on the left-hand
 

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:48.120
we've got some devices on the left-hand
side the galaxy ace the Droid X the

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.130
side the galaxy ace the Droid X the
 

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.889
side the galaxy ace the Droid X the
Galaxy Nexus and these might be things

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:49.899
Galaxy Nexus and these might be things
 

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:51.870
Galaxy Nexus and these might be things
that again we've identified as target

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880
that again we've identified as target
 

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.780
that again we've identified as target
devices or are apt to go out on and it

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:54.790
devices or are apt to go out on and it
 

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.940
devices or are apt to go out on and it
could be based on you know GPU it could

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:56.950
could be based on you know GPU it could
 

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.530
could be based on you know GPU it could
be based on memory it could be based on

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:58.540
be based on memory it could be based on
 

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.930
be based on memory it could be based on
you know CPU cycles but essentially we

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:00.940
you know CPU cycles but essentially we
 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.120
you know CPU cycles but essentially we
picked and prioritized the device list

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.130
picked and prioritized the device list
 

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.130
picked and prioritized the device list
that we want and then at that point you

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:05.140
that we want and then at that point you
 

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.569
that we want and then at that point you
know we know that each of these devices

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:06.579
know we know that each of these devices
 

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:08.670
know we know that each of these devices
runs on a number of different operating

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680
runs on a number of different operating
 

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.069
runs on a number of different operating
systems so if we want it to be a hundred

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079
systems so if we want it to be a hundred
 

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:12.960
systems so if we want it to be a hundred
percent certain that we were you know

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:12.970

every single device and every
 

00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:18.240
every single device and every
configuration what we would do is start

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.250
configuration what we would do is start
 

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.040
configuration what we would do is start
to check off each one of these boxes and

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.050
to check off each one of these boxes and
 

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.350
to check off each one of these boxes and
spend time performing a full test pass

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360
spend time performing a full test pass
 

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.310
spend time performing a full test pass

but as you can realize when you you know
this is only 5 or 6 devices when you

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:34.930
this is only 5 or 6 devices when you
 

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.840
this is only 5 or 6 devices when you
start to expand this out to between 10

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:36.850
start to expand this out to between 10
 

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.720
start to expand this out to between 10
and 20 devices it becomes a solution

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.730
and 20 devices it becomes a solution

that you know you don't have enough time
essentially to QA your device and all

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:42.790
essentially to QA your device and all

essentially to QA your device and all
these so really the what I'd like to

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:45.430
these so really the what I'd like to
 

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.610
these so really the what I'd like to
propose and how we think about this is

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:47.620
propose and how we think about this is
 

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.960
propose and how we think about this is
instead of feeling that like you have to

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:50.970
instead of feeling that like you have to
 

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.180
instead of feeling that like you have to
perform a full QA pass on everything

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:53.190
perform a full QA pass on everything
 

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.100
perform a full QA pass on everything
make sure that you have coverage across

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.110
make sure that you have coverage across
 

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.560
make sure that you have coverage across
every operating system and across every

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:58.570
every operating system and across every
 

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.420
every operating system and across every
device that you care about and you can

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.430
device that you care about and you can
 

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.519
device that you care about and you can
priorities prioritize these a little

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:02.529
priorities prioritize these a little
 

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.380
priorities prioritize these a little
different based on how you view the

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.390
different based on how you view the
 

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.150
different based on how you view the
importance of each device but in this

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160
importance of each device but in this
 

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.620
importance of each device but in this
case if you'll see

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:07.630
case if you'll see
 

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.540
case if you'll see
like to test the galaxy ace on two point

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:09.550
like to test the galaxy ace on two point
 

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.190
like to test the galaxy ace on two point
one we'd like to test the Galaxy Nexus

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200
one we'd like to test the Galaxy Nexus
 

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.800
one we'd like to test the Galaxy Nexus
on the latest for three and now in this

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:13.810
on the latest for three and now in this
 

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.750
on the latest for three and now in this
sense we have a testing process every

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760
sense we have a testing process every
 

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.890
sense we have a testing process every
one of our devices that we care about

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:16.900
one of our devices that we care about
 

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.170
one of our devices that we care about
and across you know every operating

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:19.180
and across you know every operating
 

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.960
and across you know every operating
system that it could that we also care

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:21.970
system that it could that we also care
 

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.670
system that it could that we also care
about and so what you'll see here is

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680
about and so what you'll see here is
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.980
about and so what you'll see here is
again you haven't you're not forming the

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:25.990
again you haven't you're not forming the
 

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.840
again you haven't you're not forming the
or you're not performing the full

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:27.850
or you're not performing the full
 

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.510
or you're not performing the full
complete QA pass over all these but this

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:30.520
complete QA pass over all these but this
 

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.400
complete QA pass over all these but this
is you know from a risk perspective a

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.410
is you know from a risk perspective a
 

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.920
is you know from a risk perspective a
great way to think about optimizing your

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:34.930
great way to think about optimizing your
 

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.480
great way to think about optimizing your
time and especially if you don't have

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.490
time and especially if you don't have
 

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.390
time and especially if you don't have
you know if you have limited resources

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:38.400
you know if you have limited resources
 

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.310
you know if you have limited resources
so another way to think about this is

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320
so another way to think about this is
 

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.590
so another way to think about this is
that after you've shipped your app you

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600
that after you've shipped your app you
 

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.480
that after you've shipped your app you
should really be using the data and the

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:45.490
should really be using the data and the
 

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.160
should really be using the data and the
analytics that you're receiving from

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.170
analytics that you're receiving from
 

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.800
analytics that you're receiving from
Google or your own collection to refine

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:49.810
Google or your own collection to refine
 

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.260
Google or your own collection to refine
your process so in this case if I find

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.270
your process so in this case if I find
 

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.420
your process so in this case if I find
that once I release I'm making 90

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:54.430
that once I release I'm making 90
 

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.090
that once I release I'm making 90
percent of my revenue from 4'o devices

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.100
percent of my revenue from 4'o devices
 

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.360
percent of my revenue from 4'o devices
and maybe the galaxy tab on 3.1 then

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:00.370
and maybe the galaxy tab on 3.1 then
 

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.220
and maybe the galaxy tab on 3.1 then
it's completely fine to go back and

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.230
it's completely fine to go back and
 

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.560
it's completely fine to go back and
alter your QA process and say instead of

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:04.570
alter your QA process and say instead of
 

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.450
alter your QA process and say instead of
you know testing on tu1 and tu2 anymore

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:06.460
you know testing on tu1 and tu2 anymore
 

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.460
you know testing on tu1 and tu2 anymore
I'm really going to focus all my efforts

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.470
I'm really going to focus all my efforts
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.620
I'm really going to focus all my efforts
on 400 devices for all these to make

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:10.630
on 400 devices for all these to make
 

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.060
on 400 devices for all these to make
sure that I have a hundred percent

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:12.070
sure that I have a hundred percent
 

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.190
sure that I have a hundred percent
success rate in terms of the experience

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:14.200
success rate in terms of the experience
 

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.160
success rate in terms of the experience
going out so again it's it's going to be

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.170
going out so again it's it's going to be
 

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.720
going out so again it's it's going to be
on a case-by-case basis but it's

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:18.730
on a case-by-case basis but it's
 

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.160
on a case-by-case basis but it's
completely okay to go and refine these

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.170
completely okay to go and refine these
 

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.420
completely okay to go and refine these
afterwards too for your specific needs

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:23.430
afterwards too for your specific needs
 

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.670
afterwards too for your specific needs
so now again when you're thinking about

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680
so now again when you're thinking about
 

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.160
so now again when you're thinking about
keyway a lot of people are asking well

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.170
keyway a lot of people are asking well
 

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.470
keyway a lot of people are asking well
do I run a full test pass and everything

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480
do I run a full test pass and everything
 

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.390
do I run a full test pass and everything
like what does that actually mean do I

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:33.400
like what does that actually mean do I
 

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.030
like what does that actually mean do I
run a broad test which is what we would

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040
run a broad test which is what we would
 

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.400
run a broad test which is what we would
call compatibility test and so for us

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.410
call compatibility test and so for us
 

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.560
call compatibility test and so for us
from the matrix if you remember we would

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:40.570
from the matrix if you remember we would
 

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.200
from the matrix if you remember we would
perform a full test pass on a select

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.210
perform a full test pass on a select
 

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.760
perform a full test pass on a select
number of devices and so that might be

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:44.770
number of devices and so that might be
 

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.430
number of devices and so that might be
the Galaxy Nexus on 403 and the galaxy

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440
the Galaxy Nexus on 403 and the galaxy
 

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.400
the Galaxy Nexus on 403 and the galaxy
tab on 3.0 but we would also perform a

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:50.410
tab on 3.0 but we would also perform a
 

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.650
tab on 3.0 but we would also perform a
compatibility test which essentially

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
compatibility test which essentially
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.070
compatibility test which essentially
touches every feature but doesn't go

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:55.080
touches every feature but doesn't go
 

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.480
touches every feature but doesn't go
nearly into the depth that a full test

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:57.490
nearly into the depth that a full test
 

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.700
nearly into the depth that a full test
pass would so you know compatibility

00:12:59.700 --> 00:12:59.710
pass would so you know compatibility
 

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.920
pass would so you know compatibility
test for us would take maybe minutes for

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:01.930
test for us would take maybe minutes for
 

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.540
test for us would take maybe minutes for
each device instead of the hours that it

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.550
each device instead of the hours that it
 

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.950
each device instead of the hours that it
takes you to perform a full test pass

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:04.960
takes you to perform a full test pass
 

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.200
takes you to perform a full test pass
and make sure every single scenario and

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.210
and make sure every single scenario and
 

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.240
and make sure every single scenario and
every quest and every feature is 100%

you know polished and again I would
think about prioritizing what to run

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:14.530
think about prioritizing what to run
 

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.950
think about prioritizing what to run

important to remember
 

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.820
important to remember
that it's okay to test to the deltas so

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:01.930
have a great experience but with you
 

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.329
have a great experience but with you
know the limited time and resources that

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:03.339
know the limited time and resources that
 

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:05.430
know the limited time and resources that
you know as a developer you're going to

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440
you know as a developer you're going to
 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.200
you know as a developer you're going to
have it's really important to prioritize

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:09.210
have it's really important to prioritize
 

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.490
have it's really important to prioritize
effectively and reduce the risk as much

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:11.500
effectively and reduce the risk as much
 

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.350
effectively and reduce the risk as much
as possible yeah I mean personally one

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360
as possible yeah I mean personally one
 

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.360
as possible yeah I mean personally one
of the things that is most fun about

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.370
of the things that is most fun about
 

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.880
of the things that is most fun about
being a developer at pocket gems is just

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:20.890
being a developer at pocket gems is just
 

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.570
being a developer at pocket gems is just
the ability to work in this really tight

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.580
the ability to work in this really tight
 

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.699
the ability to work in this really tight
feedback loop between QA and the

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:26.709
feedback loop between QA and the
 

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:29.460
feedback loop between QA and the
developers you know we're all in the

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:29.470
developers you know we're all in the
 

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.769
developers you know we're all in the
same area and we all get to talk you

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:31.779
same area and we all get to talk you
 

00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:35.490
same area and we all get to talk you
know all the time and it's just a really

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:35.500
know all the time and it's just a really
 

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.530
know all the time and it's just a really
important part of how we make the games

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:37.540
important part of how we make the games
 

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.870
important part of how we make the games
better is just every time we make a

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880
better is just every time we make a
 

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.370
better is just every time we make a
feature change we're having a discussion

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:41.380
feature change we're having a discussion
 

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.079
feature change we're having a discussion
about how that improves the gameplay and

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:43.089
about how that improves the gameplay and
 

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:46.740
about how that improves the gameplay and
the flow and and QA is always there to

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:46.750
the flow and and QA is always there to
 

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.730
the flow and and QA is always there to
keep us honest but but that's just a

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:50.740
keep us honest but but that's just a
 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.860
keep us honest but but that's just a
build process and when we release and

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:52.870
build process and when we release and
 

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.410
build process and when we release and
transition into live ops is when we

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:55.420
transition into live ops is when we
 

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.510
transition into live ops is when we
start sort of opening up the doors for

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:57.520
start sort of opening up the doors for
 

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.690
start sort of opening up the doors for
the whole second part of the the process

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:00.700
the whole second part of the the process
 

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.600
the whole second part of the the process
which is where we take the crash reports

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:03.610
which is where we take the crash reports
 

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.640
which is where we take the crash reports
and the the analytics and the data that

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:05.650
and the the analytics and the data that
 

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.230
and the the analytics and the data that
we're collecting from our users playing

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240
we're collecting from our users playing
 

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.300
we're collecting from our users playing
the games and what they're enjoying and

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:09.310
the games and what they're enjoying and
 

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.040
the games and what they're enjoying and
we start to take that and feed that back

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.050
we start to take that and feed that back
 

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.290
we start to take that and feed that back
into both our development process and

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:13.300
into both our development process and
 

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.829
into both our development process and
our QA process to improve both so that

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839
our QA process to improve both so that
 

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:19.640
our QA process to improve both so that
overall our build process just gets

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:19.650
overall our build process just gets
 

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.840
overall our build process just gets
significantly better and that's it's a

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:21.850
significantly better and that's it's a
 

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.460
significantly better and that's it's a
really important point in the

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.470
really important point in the
 

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.519
really important point in the
development phase of a project is where

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:26.529
development phase of a project is where
 

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.440
development phase of a project is where
you transition to all of a sudden having

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:28.450
you transition to all of a sudden having
 

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.579
you transition to all of a sudden having
these this broad and and really rich set

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:32.589
these this broad and and really rich set
 

00:15:32.589 --> 00:15:33.500
these this broad and and really rich set
of data that you

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:33.510
of data that you
 

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.390
of data that you
what your users are doing the way that

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.400
what your users are doing the way that
 

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.140
what your users are doing the way that
we do that most is by by taking

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.150
we do that most is by by taking
 

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.180
we do that most is by by taking
advantage of any time there is a crash

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:44.190
advantage of any time there is a crash
 

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.250
advantage of any time there is a crash
or an error on a device we make sure we

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260
or an error on a device we make sure we
 

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.710
or an error on a device we make sure we
report as much data as we can back to

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720
report as much data as we can back to
 

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.500
report as much data as we can back to
our servers so that we can really you

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:51.510
our servers so that we can really you
 

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.160
our servers so that we can really you
know grind through that data we you know

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.170
know grind through that data we you know
 

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.260
know grind through that data we you know
of course whenever there's a crash we

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:57.270
of course whenever there's a crash we
 

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.360
of course whenever there's a crash we
want a stack trace of where in the code

00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.370
want a stack trace of where in the code
 

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.910
want a stack trace of where in the code
path the application was but we also

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920
path the application was but we also
 

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.460
path the application was but we also
have info stacks which give us more

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:06.470
have info stacks which give us more
 

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.110
have info stacks which give us more
content data about what was actually

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120
content data about what was actually
 

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.080
content data about what was actually
being processed when the error occurred

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.090
being processed when the error occurred
 

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.240
being processed when the error occurred
and that's you know a really really

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.250
and that's you know a really really
 

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.310
and that's you know a really really
valuable thing especially when you run

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320
valuable thing especially when you run
 

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.600
valuable thing especially when you run
it through the same code and tons of

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:17.610
it through the same code and tons of
 

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.320
it through the same code and tons of
different ways but the you know and on

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:21.330
different ways but the you know and on
 

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.490
different ways but the you know and on
our servers we have automatic

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500
our servers we have automatic
 

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.050
our servers we have automatic
deification which is just really

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060
deification which is just really
 

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.030
deification which is just really
powerful for us time-saving lies we have

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040
powerful for us time-saving lies we have
 

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.610
powerful for us time-saving lies we have
the ability to report in our crash

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620
the ability to report in our crash
 

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.220
the ability to report in our crash
reports the last 50 lines of log data

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.230
reports the last 50 lines of log data
 

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.550
reports the last 50 lines of log data
that we push to to our log and that's

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560
that we push to to our log and that's
 

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.930
that we push to to our log and that's
just a really great way to get the

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:38.940
just a really great way to get the
 

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.360
just a really great way to get the
context of what generally was the

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:41.370
context of what generally was the
 

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.190
context of what generally was the
application up to even if it what are

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.200
application up to even if it what are
 

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.630
application up to even if it what are
the crashes that are happening most

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:44.640
the crashes that are happening most
 

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.060
the crashes that are happening most
often and that's a really important

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.070
often and that's a really important
 

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.680
often and that's a really important
thing for us as a development team and

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:48.690
thing for us as a development team and
 

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.230
thing for us as a development team and
management you know from management

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240
management you know from management
 

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.150
management you know from management
perspective just figuring out what is

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160
perspective just figuring out what is
 

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:59.120
perspective just figuring out what is
the top priority and and then but

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.130
the top priority and and then but
 

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.310
the top priority and and then but
sometimes you know you you end up with a

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320
sometimes you know you you end up with a
 

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.960
sometimes you know you you end up with a
crash that you don't have all the

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:02.970
crash that you don't have all the
 

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.329
crash that you don't have all the
information for and you have to make a

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339
information for and you have to make a
 

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.800
information for and you have to make a
choice at that point are you going to

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:06.810
choice at that point are you going to
 

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.420
choice at that point are you going to
move on as a team and just live with

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:08.430
move on as a team and just live with
 

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.210
move on as a team and just live with
that crash for for a while until maybe

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220
that crash for for a while until maybe
 

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.860
that crash for for a while until maybe
you just kind of stumble upon a solution

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:12.870
you just kind of stumble upon a solution
 

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.620
you just kind of stumble upon a solution
or what we end up having to do more

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:15.630
or what we end up having to do more
 

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.350
or what we end up having to do more
often is add to the instrumentation that

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360
often is add to the instrumentation that
 

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.600
often is add to the instrumentation that
your application provides add new

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:20.610
your application provides add new
 

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.180
your application provides add new
features into your crash reports I mean

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.190
features into your crash reports I mean
 

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.620
features into your crash reports I mean
a lot of these features that you've seen

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:24.630
a lot of these features that you've seen
 

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.720
a lot of these features that you've seen
here because of that kind of a narration

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:26.730
here because of that kind of a narration
 

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.320
here because of that kind of a narration
we needed better tools and so you know a

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.330
we needed better tools and so you know a
 

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:31.580
we needed better tools and so you know a
lot of the time you just have to put

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:31.590
lot of the time you just have to put
 

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.360
lot of the time you just have to put
that investment in but I would say one

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:35.370
that investment in but I would say one
 

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.300
that investment in but I would say one
of the greatest things is utilizing

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.310
of the greatest things is utilizing
 

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.930
of the greatest things is utilizing
customers

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940
customers
 

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.450
customers
the the customers who go out of their

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460
the the customers who go out of their
 

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.320
the the customers who go out of their
way to post on a forum or to give a

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.330
way to post on a forum or to give a
 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.680
way to post on a forum or to give a
review are

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.690
review are
 

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.150
review are
they've already shown that interest in

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160
they've already shown that interest in
 

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.270
they've already shown that interest in
your game and there they're there and

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280
your game and there they're there and
 

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.120
your game and there they're there and
they are often so responsive and so

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.130
they are often so responsive and so
 

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.540
they are often so responsive and so
helpful and the dialogue and the depth

helpful and the dialogue and the depth
of detail you can get is just really

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:01.700
of detail you can get is just really
 

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.240
of detail you can get is just really
incredible both for the developers and

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.250
incredible both for the developers and
 

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.640
incredible both for the developers and
and especially for the QA team in

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.650
and especially for the QA team in
 

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:12.610
and especially for the QA team in
finding reproducible bugs so yeah

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:12.620
finding reproducible bugs so yeah
 

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.370
finding reproducible bugs so yeah
another trick that we we've gotten our

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:15.380
another trick that we we've gotten our
 

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.520
another trick that we we've gotten our
games is we have sort of a tiered

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:18.530
games is we have sort of a tiered
 

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.630
games is we have sort of a tiered
experience where if you are a developer

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640
experience where if you are a developer
 

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.940
experience where if you are a developer
building on in your IDE or if you're

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:24.950
building on in your IDE or if you're
 

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.150
building on in your IDE or if you're
running tests on your on your on the

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160
running tests on your on your on the
 

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.350
running tests on your on your on the
code directly the game anytime it runs

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360
code directly the game anytime it runs
 

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.230
code directly the game anytime it runs
across an unusual situation something

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240
across an unusual situation something
 

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.770
across an unusual situation something
that we flagged is important it'll crash

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:37.780
that we flagged is important it'll crash
 

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.260
that we flagged is important it'll crash
and that's really important that the

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.270
and that's really important that the
 

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.000
and that's really important that the
developers don't get to sort of live

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.010
developers don't get to sort of live
 

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.550
developers don't get to sort of live
with a mild bug like that you know they

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:45.560
with a mild bug like that you know they
 

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.490
with a mild bug like that you know they
sort of are halted in their steps and

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:48.500
sort of are halted in their steps and
 

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.840
sort of are halted in their steps and
they go and they fix it as soon as

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:49.850
they go and they fix it as soon as
 

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.800
they go and they fix it as soon as
possible but you know then the second

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:53.810
possible but you know then the second
 

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.020
possible but you know then the second
tier is when we have our QA team testing

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:56.030
tier is when we have our QA team testing
 

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.480
tier is when we have our QA team testing
you it would be great if we could just

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:58.490
you it would be great if we could just
 

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.890
you it would be great if we could just
crash but you know they need to actually

00:18:59.890 --> 00:18:59.900
crash but you know they need to actually
 

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.830
crash but you know they need to actually
get there their testing done so instead

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840
get there their testing done so instead
 

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.930
get there their testing done so instead
we pop up a dialog in the game and we

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:04.940
we pop up a dialog in the game and we
 

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.640
we pop up a dialog in the game and we
say hey here's the problem that happened

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:06.650
say hey here's the problem that happened
 

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.720
say hey here's the problem that happened
file a bug let the let the dev team know

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:09.730
file a bug let the let the dev team know
 

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.640
file a bug let the let the dev team know
and that's just really really helpful

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:12.650
and that's just really really helpful
 

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.140
and that's just really really helpful
for us as a dev team to be able to call

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.150
for us as a dev team to be able to call
 

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.450

those things out but for users
 

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.370
those things out but for users
they don't pay that a bug happened you

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:18.380
they don't pay that a bug happened you
 

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.540
they don't pay that a bug happened you
know they just want to keep playing the

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:19.550
know they just want to keep playing the
 

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.040

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.050
game so we don't interrupt them at all
 

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.350
game so we don't interrupt them at all
what we do send ourselves a crash report

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360
what we do send ourselves a crash report
 

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.800
what we do send ourselves a crash report
to to allow us to debug that in the

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:26.810
to to allow us to debug that in the
 

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.930
to to allow us to debug that in the
future and especially marked as

something that the user is able to
continue from and so that's our our

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:33.800
continue from and so that's our our
 

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.140

you're going to you how do you figure

00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:27.019
you're going to you how do you figure
 

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.749
you're going to you how do you figure
that out yeah that's that's a great

00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:28.759
that out yeah that's that's a great
 

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:30.789
that out yeah that's that's a great
question and essentially we started with

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799
question and essentially we started with
 

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.529
question and essentially we started with
just market data and this was when we

00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:32.539
just market data and this was when we
 

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:35.259
just market data and this was when we
were just new to the to the market and

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:35.269
were just new to the to the market and
 

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:37.119
were just new to the to the market and
Android development as well we looked up

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:37.129
Android development as well we looked up
 

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.549
Android development as well we looked up
the stats and and saw hey you know some

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559
the stats and and saw hey you know some
 

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:41.619
the stats and and saw hey you know some
of the the Galaxy phones and something

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:41.629
of the the Galaxy phones and something
 

00:21:41.629 --> 00:21:43.149
of the the Galaxy phones and something
like that Motorola droids have a

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159
like that Motorola droids have a
 

00:21:43.159 --> 00:21:45.220
like that Motorola droids have a
significant market share and so we knew

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.230
significant market share and so we knew
 

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.710
significant market share and so we knew
that for our games our philosophy is to

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720
that for our games our philosophy is to
 

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.259
that for our games our philosophy is to
push out our experiences to you know

00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:50.269
push out our experiences to you know
 

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:52.210
push out our experiences to you know
everyone and in a sense we want to have

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:52.220
everyone and in a sense we want to have
 

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.860
everyone and in a sense we want to have
the the largest target audience possible

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:53.870
the the largest target audience possible
 

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.659
the the largest target audience possible
so we started there with that kind of

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:55.669
so we started there with that kind of
 

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:57.759
so we started there with that kind of
device that and then we refined it over

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:57.769
device that and then we refined it over
 

00:21:57.769 --> 00:21:59.560
device that and then we refined it over
time as we push out apps and we'd see

00:21:59.560 --> 00:21:59.570
time as we push out apps and we'd see
 

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.299
time as we push out apps and we'd see
where our games were working well and

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:01.309
where our games were working well and
 

00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:02.470
where our games were working well and
devices where they weren't going well

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480
devices where they weren't going well
 

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.869
devices where they weren't going well
and so we've had like a year's worth of

00:22:04.869 --> 00:22:04.879
and so we've had like a year's worth of
 

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:06.730
and so we've had like a year's worth of
experience refining that and coming down

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:06.740
experience refining that and coming down
 

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.960
experience refining that and coming down
to a set that we feel really comfortable

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:07.970
to a set that we feel really comfortable
 

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.539
to a set that we feel really comfortable
with and how did you feel that you need

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:10.549
with and how did you feel that you need
 

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:12.820
with and how did you feel that you need
to go back to sort of revise that list

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:12.830
to go back to sort of revise that list
 

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.310
to go back to sort of revise that list
yeah it's a it's an interesting time

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320
yeah it's a it's an interesting time
 

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.530
yeah it's a it's an interesting time
because you know you'll see if she see

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:17.540
because you know you'll see if she see
 

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.120
because you know you'll see if she see
and Samsung and all these you know

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.130
and Samsung and all these you know
 

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.040
and Samsung and all these you know
handset makers are releasing so many

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.050
handset makers are releasing so many
 

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.070
handset makers are releasing so many
things at you know every quarter and so

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080
things at you know every quarter and so
 

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.470
things at you know every quarter and so
it's it's definitely advantageous to you

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480
it's it's definitely advantageous to you
 

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.060
it's it's definitely advantageous to you
to keep up on a lot of that news and

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.070
to keep up on a lot of that news and
 

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.650
to keep up on a lot of that news and
you'll start to see there's a lot of

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:29.660
you'll start to see there's a lot of
 

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.650
you'll start to see there's a lot of
sites out there that track Android phone

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:32.660
sites out there that track Android phone
 

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.690
sites out there that track Android phone
usage and trends and so say something

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:34.700
usage and trends and so say something
 

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.240
usage and trends and so say something
for right now I looked at Galaxy s2 is

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.250
for right now I looked at Galaxy s2 is
 

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.490
for right now I looked at Galaxy s2 is
something that's very popular is risen

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:39.500
something that's very popular is risen
 

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.260
something that's very popular is risen
quickly over the last couple months so

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:41.270
quickly over the last couple months so
 

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.910
quickly over the last couple months so
just keeping track of you know the

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:42.920
just keeping track of you know the
 

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.220
just keeping track of you know the
market using the stats that Google

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.230
market using the stats that Google
 

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.990
market using the stats that Google
provides you as well because you'll see

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000
provides you as well because you'll see
 

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.580
provides you as well because you'll see
like what's the most popular device type

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:48.590
like what's the most popular device type
 

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.290
like what's the most popular device type
and this the most popular operating

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:50.300
and this the most popular operating
 

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.030
and this the most popular operating
system that's a great way to keep track

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:52.040
system that's a great way to keep track
 

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.310
system that's a great way to keep track
of it nice so you mentioned that you've

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320
of it nice so you mentioned that you've
 

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.110
of it nice so you mentioned that you've
got your own crash reporting system

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120
got your own crash reporting system
 

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.950
got your own crash reporting system
which is impressive haha so I'd like to

00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960
which is impressive haha so I'd like to
 

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.180
which is impressive haha so I'd like to
dig a little bit deeper into that if

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:01.190
dig a little bit deeper into that if
 

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.860
dig a little bit deeper into that if
possible you know how can you talk a

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:02.870
possible you know how can you talk a
 

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.510
possible you know how can you talk a
little bit about the implementation side

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520
little bit about the implementation side
 

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.700
little bit about the implementation side
of that how do you provide that sort of

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:06.710
of that how do you provide that sort of
 

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.290
of that how do you provide that sort of
multi tier level of being able to have

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.300
multi tier level of being able to have
 

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.510
multi tier level of being able to have
users continue to do their thing and

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520
users continue to do their thing and
 

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.360
users continue to do their thing and
still do crash reports yeah so a lot of

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:13.370
still do crash reports yeah so a lot of
 

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.030
still do crash reports yeah so a lot of
that is we've built a lot of utilities

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:16.040
that is we've built a lot of utilities
 

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.870
that is we've built a lot of utilities
inside the client inside the application

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880
inside the client inside the application
 

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.780
inside the client inside the application
to you know what we always want to do is

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:22.790
to you know what we always want to do is
 

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.300
to you know what we always want to do is
make sure that in indicate in an

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:25.310
make sure that in indicate in an
 

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.430
make sure that in indicate in an
unexpected case if we do run across one

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440
unexpected case if we do run across one
 

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.620
unexpected case if we do run across one
of those code paths we want to figure

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:29.630
of those code paths we want to figure
 

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.500
of those code paths we want to figure
out a way to recover safely so you know

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:32.510
out a way to recover safely so you know
 

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.200
out a way to recover safely so you know
that's returning null or returning an

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.210
that's returning null or returning an
 

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.180
that's returning null or returning an
empty object instead of one that that

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.190
empty object instead of one that that
 

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:38.610
empty object instead of one that that
actually has the functionality you need

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:38.620
actually has the functionality you need
 

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.800
actually has the functionality you need
that's you know the kind of the kind of

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:41.810
that's you know the kind of the kind of
 

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.630
that's you know the kind of the kind of
decision you make when you're when

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640
decision you make when you're when
 

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.810
decision you make when you're when
you're developing that but we we have

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:46.820
you're developing that but we we have
 

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.260
you're developing that but we we have
built in just the utilities to say throw

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:50.270
built in just the utilities to say throw
 

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.530
built in just the utilities to say throw
an exception if you're testing and it's

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.540
an exception if you're testing and it's
 

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.740
an exception if you're testing and it's
all nicely wrapped up so that so that

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:56.750
all nicely wrapped up so that so that
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.170
all nicely wrapped up so that so that
really you just have to make that that

00:23:59.170 --> 00:23:59.180
really you just have to make that that
 

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.570
really you just have to make that that
first step as a developer yes this is

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:01.580
first step as a developer yes this is
 

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.070
first step as a developer yes this is
one of those points where I do want to

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080
one of those points where I do want to
 

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.070
one of those points where I do want to
throw an exception if you're you know

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080
throw an exception if you're you know
 

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.790
throw an exception if you're you know
send a crash report if I'm a user so

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:09.800
send a crash report if I'm a user so
 

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.820
send a crash report if I'm a user so
that's our yeah that's how that happens

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:14.830
that's our yeah that's how that happens
 

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.310
that's our yeah that's how that happens
are you the on the server side it's sort

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320
are you the on the server side it's sort
 

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.080
are you the on the server side it's sort
of a lot simpler or in terms of the

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.090
of a lot simpler or in terms of the
 

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.760
of a lot simpler or in terms of the
there's a lot less decision-making every

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:24.770
there's a lot less decision-making every
 

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.700
there's a lot less decision-making every
time we get a crash report

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:26.710
time we get a crash report
 

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.989
time we get a crash report
run through it see if it fits and

00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:28.999
run through it see if it fits and
 

00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:30.580
run through it see if it fits and
matches with any of the other ones we

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:30.590
matches with any of the other ones we
 

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.859
matches with any of the other ones we
have if it does we put put that into a

00:24:32.859 --> 00:24:32.869
have if it does we put put that into a
 

00:24:32.869 --> 00:24:34.930
have if it does we put put that into a
group otherwise we leave it as an

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:34.940
group otherwise we leave it as an
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.269
group otherwise we leave it as an
individual report so you really it's

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279
individual report so you really it's
 

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.259
individual report so you really it's
really brought from the design

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:38.269
really brought from the design
 

00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:39.909
really brought from the design
perspective right at the beginning you

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919
perspective right at the beginning you
 

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:41.619
perspective right at the beginning you
have to build that right into your app

00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:41.629
have to build that right into your app
 

00:24:41.629 --> 00:24:43.119
have to build that right into your app
like you need to throw an exception it's

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:43.129
like you need to throw an exception it's
 

00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:44.830
like you need to throw an exception it's
not good enough to just print it out in

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840
not good enough to just print it out in
 

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.930
not good enough to just print it out in
the logs and move on and die you really

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:46.940
the logs and move on and die you really
 

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.450
the logs and move on and die you really
need to figure out how can it continue

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.460
need to figure out how can it continue
 

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.669
need to figure out how can it continue
even after this unexpected cases as it

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679
even after this unexpected cases as it
 

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.940
even after this unexpected cases as it
could yeah absolutely yeah we try and

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:53.950
could yeah absolutely yeah we try and
 

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.859
could yeah absolutely yeah we try and
start with that philosophy every time we

00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:56.869
start with that philosophy every time we
 

00:24:56.869 --> 00:24:58.239
start with that philosophy every time we
add a new feature yeah it's really

00:24:58.239 --> 00:24:58.249
add a new feature yeah it's really
 

00:24:58.249 --> 00:24:59.680
add a new feature yeah it's really
important because then on the other hand

00:24:59.680 --> 00:24:59.690
important because then on the other hand
 

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.299
important because then on the other hand
you will still get crash reports where

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:01.309
you will still get crash reports where
 

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:03.639
you will still get crash reports where
you don't have enough information and so

00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:03.649
you don't have enough information and so
 

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:05.409
you don't have enough information and so
at that point you make a decision you

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:05.419
at that point you make a decision you
 

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:06.909
at that point you make a decision you
say how much time do I want to spend

00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919
say how much time do I want to spend
 

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:08.739
say how much time do I want to spend
investigating this or can I get you know

00:25:08.739 --> 00:25:08.749
investigating this or can I get you know
 

00:25:08.749 --> 00:25:11.849
investigating this or can I get you know
actionable repro steps in a sense on it

00:25:11.849 --> 00:25:11.859
actionable repro steps in a sense on it
 

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:13.659
actionable repro steps in a sense on it
but the other way that you can think

00:25:13.659 --> 00:25:13.669
but the other way that you can think
 

00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:15.489
but the other way that you can think
about it is okay well now that I have a

00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:15.499
about it is okay well now that I have a
 

00:25:15.499 --> 00:25:17.019
about it is okay well now that I have a
crash that I think I know the area that

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:17.029
crash that I think I know the area that
 

00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:18.639
crash that I think I know the area that
it's in you can go back and add some

00:25:18.639 --> 00:25:18.649
it's in you can go back and add some
 

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:20.680
it's in you can go back and add some
more logs or instrumentation to those to

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:20.690
more logs or instrumentation to those to
 

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.289
more logs or instrumentation to those to
get better data for the next actual bill

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:23.299
get better data for the next actual bill
 

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.940
get better data for the next actual bill
that you ship out so it's an evolving

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:24.950
that you ship out so it's an evolving
 

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.310
that you ship out so it's an evolving
process and even we find areas of the

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320
process and even we find areas of the
 

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.479
process and even we find areas of the
system where we want to get more

00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:28.489
system where we want to get more
 

00:25:28.489 --> 00:25:29.619
system where we want to get more
information about it so it's a

00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:29.629
information about it so it's a
 

00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:32.169
information about it so it's a
continuously evolving process for us

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:32.179
continuously evolving process for us
 

00:25:32.179 --> 00:25:35.889
continuously evolving process for us
very cool very interesting so given that

00:25:35.889 --> 00:25:35.899
very cool very interesting so given that
 

00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:37.869
very cool very interesting so given that
you have your own crash reporting system

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:37.879
you have your own crash reporting system
 

00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:39.549
you have your own crash reporting system
do you still take advantage of the

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559
do you still take advantage of the
 

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.349
do you still take advantage of the
things which you get provided by the

00:25:41.349 --> 00:25:41.359
things which you get provided by the
 

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:43.419
things which you get provided by the
system like the Android crash reports on

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:43.429
system like the Android crash reports on
 

00:25:43.429 --> 00:25:45.549
system like the Android crash reports on
developer console yeah we do and and

00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559
developer console yeah we do and and
 

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:48.430
developer console yeah we do and and
that's why it's great because with the

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440
that's why it's great because with the
 

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.560
that's why it's great because with the
prioritization of the the Android data

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.570
prioritization of the the Android data
 

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.419
prioritization of the the Android data
itself it helps us also it's another

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:52.429
itself it helps us also it's another
 

00:25:52.429 --> 00:25:54.430
itself it helps us also it's another
data point in terms of we see our own

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440
data point in terms of we see our own
 

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.960
data point in terms of we see our own
crash groups and we see you know what's

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:55.970
crash groups and we see you know what's
 

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.430
crash groups and we see you know what's
infecting our users but it's just like a

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440
infecting our users but it's just like a
 

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.739
infecting our users but it's just like a
second point of validation on yes this

00:25:59.739 --> 00:25:59.749
second point of validation on yes this
 

00:25:59.749 --> 00:26:01.060
second point of validation on yes this
is the crash that we should really go

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:01.070
is the crash that we should really go
 

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.590
is the crash that we should really go
spend our time on because you know you

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600
spend our time on because you know you
 

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.119
spend our time on because you know you
might be getting hundreds of crashes a

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:04.129
might be getting hundreds of crashes a
 

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:06.489
might be getting hundreds of crashes a
day from you know obscure devices that

00:26:06.489 --> 00:26:06.499
day from you know obscure devices that
 

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:08.080
day from you know obscure devices that
you didn't even know your your app was

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.090
you didn't even know your your app was
 

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.700
you didn't even know your your app was
going to and at that point it becomes

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:09.710
going to and at that point it becomes
 

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.249
going to and at that point it becomes
you could spend months going back and

00:26:12.249 --> 00:26:12.259
you could spend months going back and
 

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:13.359
you could spend months going back and
trying to track down all these crashes

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:13.369
trying to track down all these crashes
 

00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:16.060
trying to track down all these crashes
so you really have to have a very

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:16.070
so you really have to have a very
 

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.070
so you really have to have a very
explicit prioritization system so we use

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080
explicit prioritization system so we use
 

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.599
explicit prioritization system so we use
the Google data from the dashboard

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:19.609
the Google data from the dashboard
 

00:26:19.609 --> 00:26:21.849
the Google data from the dashboard
heavily in conjunction with our own data

00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:21.859
heavily in conjunction with our own data
 

00:26:21.859 --> 00:26:24.519
heavily in conjunction with our own data
very cool and you mentioned using the

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:24.529
very cool and you mentioned using the
 

00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:27.159
very cool and you mentioned using the
dotter in the developer console as well

00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:27.169
dotter in the developer console as well
 

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:29.169
dotter in the developer console as well
to be able to do that post launch

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:29.179
to be able to do that post launch
 

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:31.299
to be able to do that post launch

we had the console engineers on a couple

00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:35.599
we had the console engineers on a couple
 

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:37.640
we had the console engineers on a couple
of times over the last few months

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:37.650
of times over the last few months

and well talking about trying to get
 

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.420
and well talking about trying to get
information from you guys as to what the

curious real-world developers how have

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:51.570
curious real-world developers how have
 

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.299
curious real-world developers how have
you found that transition you know do

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:53.309
you found that transition you know do

console and you know
 

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.690
console and you know
well we'd say the mr. the most useful

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:58.700
well we'd say the mr. the most useful
 

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.460
well we'd say the mr. the most useful
yeah I think we've definitely have been

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:01.470
yeah I think we've definitely have been
 

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.350
yeah I think we've definitely have been
very happy with how that's been evolving

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360
very happy with how that's been evolving
 

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.090
very happy with how that's been evolving
over time and you know for awhile we

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100
over time and you know for awhile we
 

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.830
over time and you know for awhile we
didn't have a ton information there you

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840
didn't have a ton information there you
 

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.030
didn't have a ton information there you
would see some of these the crash

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.040
would see some of these the crash
 

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.010
would see some of these the crash
reports and stack traces but now that

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020
reports and stack traces but now that
 

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.200
reports and stack traces but now that
you have info on you know largest

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.210
you have info on you know largest
 

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.990
you have info on you know largest

it's great data that before we didn't
 

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.540
it's great data that before we didn't
really have access to and we would kind

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:23.550
really have access to and we would kind

that data and start to use it in your
future creation it helps out a lot very

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:33.390
future creation it helps out a lot very
 

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.900
future creation it helps out a lot very
cool so we've been focusing a lot on how

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:35.910
cool so we've been focusing a lot on how
 

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.820
cool so we've been focusing a lot on how
you report things when things go wrong

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:37.830
you report things when things go wrong

of the way there but then you need that

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:57.990
of the way there but then you need that
 

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.340
of the way there but then you need that
extra data validation to make sure that

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:01.350
extra data validation to make sure that
 

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.870
extra data validation to make sure that
you're doing the right things so we

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880
you're doing the right things so we
 

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.850
you're doing the right things so we
certainly you know we're heavily

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860
certainly you know we're heavily
 

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.220
certainly you know we're heavily
instrument all of our events and so you

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:07.230
instrument all of our events and so you
 

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.890
instrument all of our events and so you
know what things people are buying where

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900
know what things people are buying where
 

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.930
know what things people are buying where
they're getting stock you know things

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940
they're getting stock you know things
 

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.370
they're getting stock you know things
like retention the monetization and

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380
like retention the monetization and
 

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.380
like retention the monetization and
engagement stats and we use those very

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.390
engagement stats and we use those very
 

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.169
engagement stats and we use those very
heavily to understand how to how to teen

00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179
heavily to understand how to how to teen
 

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:19.340
heavily to understand how to how to teen
our games and how to make them better

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:19.350
our games and how to make them better
 

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.220
our games and how to make them better
for all of our users out there be cool

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.230
for all of our users out there be cool
 

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.200
for all of our users out there be cool
yeah I mean people's very much the same

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.210
yeah I mean people's very much the same
 

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.790
yeah I mean people's very much the same
it's very sort of analytical driven

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:25.800
it's very sort of analytical driven
 

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.380
it's very sort of analytical driven
company where you try and get as much

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.390
company where you try and get as much
 

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.450
company where you try and get as much
data to base your decisions on possible

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460
data to base your decisions on possible
 

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:34.640
data to base your decisions on possible
so yeah so in terms of it we'll talk a

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:34.650
so yeah so in terms of it we'll talk a
 

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.340
so yeah so in terms of it we'll talk a
little bit about how you choose what

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:36.350
little bit about how you choose what
 

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.590
little bit about how you choose what
devices you want to focus on obviously a

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600
devices you want to focus on obviously a
 

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.570
devices you want to focus on obviously a
big thing for us these days to tablets

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580
big thing for us these days to tablets
 

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.419
big thing for us these days to tablets
try to get you know developers to seize

00:28:44.419 --> 00:28:44.429
try to get you know developers to seize
 

00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:46.040
try to get you know developers to seize
the opportunity there and really

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.050
the opportunity there and really
 

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.810
the opportunity there and really
optimize the experience for tablets is

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820
optimize the experience for tablets is
 

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.730
optimize the experience for tablets is
there something that's on the radar you

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740
there something that's on the radar you
 

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.660
there something that's on the radar you
guys

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:50.670
guys
 

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.670
guys
yeah absolutely I mean I would say that

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:52.680
yeah absolutely I mean I would say that
 

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.960
yeah absolutely I mean I would say that
one of the things that we've been

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:53.970
one of the things that we've been
 

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.680
one of the things that we've been
focusing on most recently is making sure

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:57.690
focusing on most recently is making sure
 

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.110
focusing on most recently is making sure
that our games run and look really crisp

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120
that our games run and look really crisp
 

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.000
that our games run and look really crisp
on the high-res screens and just

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.010
on the high-res screens and just
 

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.460
on the high-res screens and just
building up you know it's it's one thing

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:07.470
building up you know it's it's one thing
 

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.900
building up you know it's it's one thing
to handle a couple of different aspect

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:08.910
to handle a couple of different aspect
 

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.930
to handle a couple of different aspect

about four or five inches but when you

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:15.210
about four or five inches but when you
 

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:18.440
about four or five inches but when you
are you know three five inches but when

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:18.450
are you know three five inches but when
 

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.750
are you know three five inches but when
you start you know scaling up to the to

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760
you start you know scaling up to the to
 

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.450
you start you know scaling up to the to
the huge tablet displays it really does

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460
the huge tablet displays it really does
 

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.230
the huge tablet displays it really does
require a lot more thought of how how is

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240
require a lot more thought of how how is
 

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.150
require a lot more thought of how how is
the game going to play when all of a

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:29.160
the game going to play when all of a
 

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.890
the game going to play when all of a
sudden the buttons are three times as

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:30.900
sudden the buttons are three times as
 

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.290
sudden the buttons are three times as
big as your finger you know and the

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:35.300
big as your finger you know and the
 

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.640
big as your finger you know and the
taking care and and figuring out

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:37.650
taking care and and figuring out
 

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.430
taking care and and figuring out
strategies of of actually taking into

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440
strategies of of actually taking into
 

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.320
strategies of of actually taking into
account the physical width of how big

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.330
account the physical width of how big
 

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.990
account the physical width of how big
something is going to be on the screen

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000
something is going to be on the screen
 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.820
something is going to be on the screen
rather than just the number of pixels

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:46.830
rather than just the number of pixels
 

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.130
rather than just the number of pixels
has been something that I think has

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140
has been something that I think has
 

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.710
has been something that I think has
started to show in our inner games and

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720
started to show in our inner games and
 

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.100
started to show in our inner games and
started to really improve the gameplay

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.110
started to really improve the gameplay
 

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.140
started to really improve the gameplay
for for all users and in fact one of the

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:57.150
for for all users and in fact one of the
 

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.550
for for all users and in fact one of the
really great side effects of that is

00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:58.560
really great side effects of that is
 

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.070
really great side effects of that is
that the more we focus on those really

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080
that the more we focus on those really
 

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.110
that the more we focus on those really
high res high yeah large screens we

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120
high res high yeah large screens we
 

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.950
high res high yeah large screens we
actually have been incidentally and and

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960
actually have been incidentally and and
 

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.540
actually have been incidentally and and
once we realize this we really seize the

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:11.550
once we realize this we really seize the
 

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.340
once we realize this we really seize the
opportunity improving the experience for

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.350
opportunity improving the experience for
 

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.020
opportunity improving the experience for
the really low res phones the really

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.030
the really low res phones the really
 

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.500
the really low res phones the really
small devices and that's actually been I

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:18.510
small devices and that's actually been I
 

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.020
small devices and that's actually been I
think one of a one of the highlights of

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.030
think one of a one of the highlights of
 

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.790
think one of a one of the highlights of
our of our past few releases is really

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:22.800
our of our past few releases is really
 

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.050
our of our past few releases is really
making that experience better for

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.060
making that experience better for
 

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.560
making that experience better for
everyone

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.570
everyone
 

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.900
everyone
outstanding and so I'm from sort of the

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:26.910
outstanding and so I'm from sort of the
 

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.750
outstanding and so I'm from sort of the
conceptual leap to go oh actually this

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760
conceptual leap to go oh actually this
 

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.240
conceptual leap to go oh actually this
is something we need to look at and

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:31.250
is something we need to look at and
 

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.070
is something we need to look at and
optimize for how difficult has it been

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080
optimize for how difficult has it been
 

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.660
optimize for how difficult has it been
to sort of implement those changes

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:35.670
to sort of implement those changes
 

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.580
to sort of implement those changes
provide something custom for the

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.590
provide something custom for the
 

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.150
provide something custom for the
different sorts of devices I think that

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.160
different sorts of devices I think that
 

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.700
different sorts of devices I think that
actually the you know with the native

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:43.710
actually the you know with the native
 

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.970
actually the you know with the native
Android UI toolkit for our menus and

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980
Android UI toolkit for our menus and
 

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.670
Android UI toolkit for our menus and
things like that it's just been really

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:48.680
things like that it's just been really
 

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.220
things like that it's just been really
quite easy to to start taking advantage

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:52.230
quite easy to to start taking advantage
 

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.680
quite easy to to start taking advantage
of alternate layouts things like that to

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:54.690
of alternate layouts things like that to
 

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.920
of alternate layouts things like that to
make the game work better in those

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:57.930
make the game work better in those
 

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.940
make the game work better in those
different environments but also the you

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:01.950
different environments but also the you
 

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.419
different environments but also the you
know for us just thinking about new ways

00:31:04.419 --> 00:31:04.429
know for us just thinking about new ways
 

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:07.509
know for us just thinking about new ways
to to do scaling and an in-game you know

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519
to to do scaling and an in-game you know
 

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.090
to to do scaling and an in-game you know
when we have the high art displays that

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.100
when we have the high art displays that
 

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.560
when we have the high art displays that
it's it's sort of a different problem

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.570
it's it's sort of a different problem
 

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.799
it's it's sort of a different problem
and figuring out how to build scaling

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:14.809
and figuring out how to build scaling
 

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:17.049
and figuring out how to build scaling
into those those screens from the start

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:17.059
into those those screens from the start
 

00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:18.549
into those those screens from the start
rather than doing it as an afterthought

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559
rather than doing it as an afterthought
 

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:23.049
rather than doing it as an afterthought
has it's it's been a it's actually gone

00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:23.059
has it's it's been a it's actually gone
 

00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:26.019
has it's it's been a it's actually gone
very smoothly I think once we once we

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:26.029
very smoothly I think once we once we
 

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:29.440
very smoothly I think once we once we
made that decision to start paying close

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:29.450
made that decision to start paying close
 

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.470
made that decision to start paying close
attention to scaling we we were able to

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480
attention to scaling we we were able to
 

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.419
attention to scaling we we were able to
tackle the problem pretty easily that's

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:34.429
tackle the problem pretty easily that's
 

00:31:34.429 --> 00:31:36.489
tackle the problem pretty easily that's
great it seems a lot less speak to

00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:36.499
great it seems a lot less speak to
 

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.379
great it seems a lot less speak to
developers the issue isn't so much being

00:31:38.379 --> 00:31:38.389
developers the issue isn't so much being
 

00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:40.389
developers the issue isn't so much being
able to do it but just sort of realizing

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399
able to do it but just sort of realizing
 

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.279
able to do it but just sort of realizing
that you have to you've got an office

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:42.289
that you have to you've got an office
 

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:44.019
that you have to you've got an office
full of people just using standard

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:44.029
full of people just using standard
 

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:45.909
full of people just using standard
phones and then someone comes in with

00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919
phones and then someone comes in with
 

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:48.279
phones and then someone comes in with
something really high res or a fancy new

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:48.289
something really high res or a fancy new
 

00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:52.779
something really high res or a fancy new
10-inch tablet yeah and a lot of times

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:52.789
10-inch tablet yeah and a lot of times
 

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:54.190
10-inch tablet yeah and a lot of times
what we do is we can we force ourselves

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200
what we do is we can we force ourselves
 

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.799
what we do is we can we force ourselves
to use different devices so you know I

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:56.809
to use different devices so you know I
 

00:31:56.809 --> 00:31:58.810
to use different devices so you know I
love my Galaxy Nexus but you know I have

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:58.820
love my Galaxy Nexus but you know I have
 

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.940
love my Galaxy Nexus but you know I have
I apportion myself to user laura's

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:00.950
I apportion myself to user laura's
 

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.169
I apportion myself to user laura's
device just to understand what the

00:32:02.169 --> 00:32:02.179
device just to understand what the
 

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:04.029
device just to understand what the
experience is you know across the board

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039
experience is you know across the board
 

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:06.519
experience is you know across the board
and you'll find funny things like well

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:06.529
and you'll find funny things like well
 

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:07.749
and you'll find funny things like well
when you want to optimize for the

00:32:07.749 --> 00:32:07.759
when you want to optimize for the
 

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.070
when you want to optimize for the
high-res devices then all of a sudden

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080
high-res devices then all of a sudden
 

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.289
high-res devices then all of a sudden
you know the quality of your art needs

00:32:11.289 --> 00:32:11.299
you know the quality of your art needs
 

00:32:11.299 --> 00:32:12.940
you know the quality of your art needs
to get a little bigger which makes the

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:12.950
to get a little bigger which makes the
 

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:14.710
to get a little bigger which makes the
image size larger which then you know

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720
image size larger which then you know
 

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.320
image size larger which then you know
translates to apki apki is getting

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:17.330
translates to apki apki is getting
 

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.629
translates to apki apki is getting
larger and so it's this you know it's

00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639
larger and so it's this you know it's
 

00:32:19.639 --> 00:32:20.980
larger and so it's this you know it's
this balance that you really have to go

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:20.990
this balance that you really have to go
 

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.109
this balance that you really have to go
through but really at the end of the day

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:23.119
through but really at the end of the day
 

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:24.639
through but really at the end of the day
creates a better user experience so it's

00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:24.649
creates a better user experience so it's
 

00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:26.139
creates a better user experience so it's
something that we're we're really happy

00:32:26.139 --> 00:32:26.149
something that we're we're really happy
 

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:29.919
something that we're we're really happy
to continue doing yeah it's funny we do

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:29.929
to continue doing yeah it's funny we do
 

00:32:29.929 --> 00:32:32.200
to continue doing yeah it's funny we do
the same thing we'll be testing games

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.210
the same thing we'll be testing games
 

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.139
the same thing we'll be testing games
and apps for partners to give people

00:32:35.139 --> 00:32:35.149
and apps for partners to give people
 

00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:37.239
and apps for partners to give people
feedback and we're so used to using the

00:32:37.239 --> 00:32:37.249
feedback and we're so used to using the
 

00:32:37.249 --> 00:32:39.669
feedback and we're so used to using the
same devices now my Galaxy Nexus and my

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679
same devices now my Galaxy Nexus and my
 

00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:42.039
same devices now my Galaxy Nexus and my
transformer prime and that's a little

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:42.049
transformer prime and that's a little
 

00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:43.690
transformer prime and that's a little
I'll do it on and then so we've have to

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:43.700
I'll do it on and then so we've have to
 

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.190
I'll do it on and then so we've have to
stop and realize actually a lot of

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200
stop and realize actually a lot of
 

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.289
stop and realize actually a lot of
people aren't using access I should

00:32:47.289 --> 00:32:47.299
people aren't using access I should
 

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.480
people aren't using access I should
probably a gingerbread device just for

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:49.490
probably a gingerbread device just for
 

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.440
probably a gingerbread device just for
fun

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:50.450
fun
 

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.749
fun
you mentioned the challenge with you

00:32:52.749 --> 00:32:52.759
you mentioned the challenge with you
 

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.340
you mentioned the challenge with you
know supporting more and more devices

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:54.350
know supporting more and more devices
 

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.039
know supporting more and more devices
that your apk gets bigger and bigger are

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:57.049
that your apk gets bigger and bigger are

that your apk gets bigger and bigger are
you guys still delivering things as a

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:58.490
you guys still delivering things as a
 

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.399
you guys still delivering things as a
single apk or if you started to make use

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:00.409
single apk or if you started to make use
 

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:04.119
single apk or if you started to make use
of multi apk delivery yeah so for right

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:04.129
of multi apk delivery yeah so for right
 

00:33:04.129 --> 00:33:06.190
of multi apk delivery yeah so for right
now we're still using mainly just the

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200
now we're still using mainly just the
 

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.820
now we're still using mainly just the
one apk

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:06.830
one apk
 

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.109
one apk
but as you know Ice Cream Sandwich

00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:08.119
but as you know Ice Cream Sandwich
 

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.029
but as you know Ice Cream Sandwich
functionality becomes more prevalent in

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039
functionality becomes more prevalent in
 

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.590
functionality becomes more prevalent in
the market we're certainly looking at

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600
the market we're certainly looking at
 

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.379
the market we're certainly looking at
the idea of moving to multiplied decays

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:14.389
the idea of moving to multiplied decays
 

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:16.330
the idea of moving to multiplied decays
and you can imagine that will even have

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:16.340
and you can imagine that will even have
 

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.040
and you can imagine that will even have
to adjust our QA

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.050
to adjust our QA
 

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.240
to adjust our QA
philosophies and our prioritization

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:19.250
philosophies and our prioritization
 

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.000
philosophies and our prioritization
because now you're testing to apks that

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.010
because now you're testing to apks that
 

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.700
because now you're testing to apks that
might be 90 percent similar but then

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:24.710
might be 90 percent similar but then
 

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.680
might be 90 percent similar but then
again you have these customs this custom

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:26.690
again you have these customs this custom
 

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.540
again you have these customs this custom
functionality so it's going to be you

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:28.550
functionality so it's going to be you
 

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.040
functionality so it's going to be you
know interesting for us as we continue

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:30.050
know interesting for us as we continue
 

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.620
know interesting for us as we continue
to move on with you know having multiple

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:32.630
to move on with you know having multiple
 

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.060
to move on with you know having multiple
apks because that's the right solution

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.070
apks because that's the right solution
 

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.630
apks because that's the right solution
ultimately and we'll get to see how we

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:37.640
ultimately and we'll get to see how we
 

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.510
ultimately and we'll get to see how we
have to modify our processes accordingly

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:39.520
have to modify our processes accordingly
 

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.820
have to modify our processes accordingly
excellent um so I'd be interested to

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:42.830
excellent um so I'd be interested to
 

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.070
excellent um so I'd be interested to
touch a little bit on your testing and

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080
touch a little bit on your testing and
 

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.980
touch a little bit on your testing and
QA process if possible so how often do

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:47.990
QA process if possible so how often do
 

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.080
QA process if possible so how often do
you do releases and what's the process

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:50.090
you do releases and what's the process
 

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.910
you do releases and what's the process
there in QA and making sure that what

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:51.920
there in QA and making sure that what
 

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.720
there in QA and making sure that what
you put out is really high quality I

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:54.730
you put out is really high quality I
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.550
you put out is really high quality I
mean we aim for very frequent releases

00:33:59.550 --> 00:33:59.560
mean we aim for very frequent releases
 

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.900
mean we aim for very frequent releases
for a few weeks or more often impossible

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:03.910
for a few weeks or more often impossible
 

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:09.520
for a few weeks or more often impossible
we I mean we do constant constant QA

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:09.530
we I mean we do constant constant QA
 

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:14.020
we I mean we do constant constant QA
testing test passes of of our games we

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.030
testing test passes of of our games we
 

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.690
testing test passes of of our games we
always focus on of course the one for

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:16.700
always focus on of course the one for
 

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.700
always focus on of course the one for
the QA side what whichever one we're

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:18.710
the QA side what whichever one we're
 

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.520
the QA side what whichever one we're
doing the most development on and and we

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:21.530
doing the most development on and and we
 

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.100
doing the most development on and and we
do try and sort of cycle through our

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.110
do try and sort of cycle through our
 

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.810
do try and sort of cycle through our
games not not spend too much time

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.820
games not not spend too much time
 

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.110
games not not spend too much time
looking at looking at just one but

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:29.120
looking at looking at just one but
 

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.760
looking at looking at just one but
really make sure we're not leaving them

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:30.770
really make sure we're not leaving them
 

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:38.200
really make sure we're not leaving them
behind but I guess we we always we work

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:38.210
behind but I guess we we always we work
 

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.820
behind but I guess we we always we work
really closely with the QA team to make

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:39.830
really closely with the QA team to make
 

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.290
really closely with the QA team to make
sure that they know exactly what we're

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:41.300
sure that they know exactly what we're
 

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.040
sure that they know exactly what we're
changing and try and keep you know keeps

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.050
changing and try and keep you know keeps
 

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.840
changing and try and keep you know keeps
their their jobs much simpler if they

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:46.850
their their jobs much simpler if they
 

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.550
their their jobs much simpler if they
know exactly what to look for what might

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560
know exactly what to look for what might
 

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.930
know exactly what to look for what might
go wrong what are the possible side

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:49.940
go wrong what are the possible side
 

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.680
go wrong what are the possible side
effects and that's definitely been our

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:53.690
effects and that's definitely been our
 

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.020
effects and that's definitely been our
recipe for success is just as a good

communication there between the dev and

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:57.830
communication there between the dev and
 

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.930
communication there between the dev and
QA teams as possible yeah I think as a

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:01.940
QA teams as possible yeah I think as a
 

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.090
QA teams as possible yeah I think as a
company our philosophy is really the day

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:04.100
company our philosophy is really the day
 

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.920
company our philosophy is really the day
that we you know ship a game on day one

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:05.930
that we you know ship a game on day one
 

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.750
that we you know ship a game on day one
that's not the end for us you know we

you're done with the game then let's

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200
you're done with the game then let's
 

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.170
you're done with the game then let's
move on to the next one but we have you

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180
move on to the next one but we have you
 

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.690

know a very philosophy that once we push

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700
know a very philosophy that once we push
 

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.280
know a very philosophy that once we push
it out we should also you know listen to

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:40.290
it out we should also you know listen to
 

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.839
it out we should also you know listen to
our users and figure out what they want

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:41.849
our users and figure out what they want
 

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:44.960
our users and figure out what they want
and where we can take the next leap not

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:44.970
and where we can take the next leap not
 

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.359
and where we can take the next leap not
standing you know I always love to speak

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:47.369
standing you know I always love to speak
 

00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:48.440
standing you know I always love to speak
to developers we should take that

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:48.450
to developers we should take that
 

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.270
to developers we should take that
approach of not just pushing over the

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280
approach of not just pushing over the
 

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.040
approach of not just pushing over the
wall and moving on to the next project

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.050
wall and moving on to the next project
 

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.349
wall and moving on to the next project
but really treating it is not as a

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359
but really treating it is not as a
 

00:35:54.359 --> 00:35:56.240
but really treating it is not as a
service as such but as a product which

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:56.250
service as such but as a product which
 

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.030
service as such but as a product which
continues to live people it's been a lot

00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040
continues to live people it's been a lot
 

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.680
continues to live people it's been a lot
of time and effort on that on adding

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:00.690
of time and effort on that on adding
 

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.280
of time and effort on that on adding
games so it's it's useful for them

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290
games so it's it's useful for them
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.510
games so it's it's useful for them
interesting and it's interesting useful

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520
interesting and it's interesting useful
 

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.400
interesting and it's interesting useful
for them to know that what they're doing

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:07.410
for them to know that what they're doing
 

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.270
for them to know that what they're doing
is so the camera isn't switching so

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280
is so the camera isn't switching so
 

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:34.670
is so the camera isn't switching so
we're going to take it alright so yeah

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680
we're going to take it alright so yeah
 

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.440
we're going to take it alright so yeah
like I said it's a great to hear that

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:36.450
like I said it's a great to hear that
 

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.510

you guys take that that approach of you

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520
you guys take that that approach of you
 

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.890
you guys take that that approach of you
know once it's out there it's something

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900
know once it's out there it's something
 

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.210
know once it's out there it's something
you need to continue to support and

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220
you need to continue to support and
 

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.559
you need to continue to support and
probably something I need to pay more

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:42.569
probably something I need to pay more
 

00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.390
probably something I need to pay more
attention to on the apps that I put on

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400
attention to on the apps that I put on
 

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:44.990
attention to on the apps that I put on
the market

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000

she don't always get quite as much love
so let's see so are you releasing your

00:36:51.319 --> 00:36:51.329
so let's see so are you releasing your
 

00:36:51.329 --> 00:36:53.150
so let's see so are you releasing your
titles you're not an Android only shop

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160
titles you're not an Android only shop
 

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.069
titles you're not an Android only shop
right you are you release titles another

right you are you release titles another
 

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:57.559
right you are you release titles another
smartphone platforms can you tell us a

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:57.569
smartphone platforms can you tell us a
 

00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:59.270
smartphone platforms can you tell us a
little bit about you know what's your

00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280
little bit about you know what's your
 

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.150
little bit about you know what's your
release strategy for there you prefer

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160
release strategy for there you prefer
 

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.099
release strategy for there you prefer
one platform or another trying at least

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:04.109
one platform or another trying at least
 

00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:05.930
one platform or another trying at least
the same time what's the thing yeah

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940
the same time what's the thing yeah
 

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.490
the same time what's the thing yeah
that's a great question and so you know

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500
that's a great question and so you know
 

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.470
that's a great question and so you know
when we when the company was founded you

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480
when we when the company was founded you
 

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.480
when we when the company was founded you
know iOS platform was the most mature at

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:11.490
know iOS platform was the most mature at
 

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.579
know iOS platform was the most mature at
the time and so we having limited

00:37:13.579 --> 00:37:13.589
the time and so we having limited
 

00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:15.799
the time and so we having limited
resources focused our efforts primarily

00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:15.809
resources focused our efforts primarily
 

00:37:15.809 --> 00:37:17.870
resources focused our efforts primarily
on iOS so that's how we you know grew

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880
on iOS so that's how we you know grew
 

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.450
on iOS so that's how we you know grew
our our operations and that's where you

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460
our our operations and that's where you
 

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.339
our our operations and that's where you
know the majority of our time was spent

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:22.349
know the majority of our time was spent
 

00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:25.400
know the majority of our time was spent
but you know as Android has ramped up

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:25.410
but you know as Android has ramped up
 

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.890
but you know as Android has ramped up
and has become an amazing market with a

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900
and has become an amazing market with a
 

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.450
and has become an amazing market with a
lot of opportunity we've also shifted

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460
lot of opportunity we've also shifted
 

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.460
lot of opportunity we've also shifted
our resources and our efforts to

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.470
our resources and our efforts to
 

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.589
our resources and our efforts to
creating not only you know things like

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599
creating not only you know things like
 

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.809
creating not only you know things like
simultaneous releases but also looking

00:37:35.809 --> 00:37:35.819
simultaneous releases but also looking
 

00:37:35.819 --> 00:37:38.120
simultaneous releases but also looking
at the potential of Android first and

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:38.130
at the potential of Android first and
 

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.549
at the potential of Android first and
Android exclusive type launches so as

00:37:40.549 --> 00:37:40.559
Android exclusive type launches so as
 

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:41.630
Android exclusive type launches so as
you know the market continued

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640
you know the market continued
 

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.370
you know the market continued
two ball we recognize that both

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380
two ball we recognize that both
 

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.049
two ball we recognize that both
margaret's are actually different you

00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:45.059
margaret's are actually different you
 

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:46.220
margaret's are actually different you
can't treat them the same

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:46.230
can't treat them the same
 

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.720
can't treat them the same
you can't necessarily push the exact

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:47.730
you can't necessarily push the exact
 

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.339
you can't necessarily push the exact
same app out on both platforms and

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:49.349
same app out on both platforms and
 

00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:51.410
same app out on both platforms and
expect it to do well on both so we're

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420
expect it to do well on both so we're
 

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.390
expect it to do well on both so we're
taking the approach of tailoring our

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400
taking the approach of tailoring our
 

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.640
taking the approach of tailoring our
experiences to you know the custom

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:55.650
experiences to you know the custom
 

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.349
experiences to you know the custom
platforms it's interesting have you

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359
platforms it's interesting have you
 

00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:59.240
platforms it's interesting have you
found that that's being effective you

00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.250
found that that's being effective you
 

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.440
found that that's being effective you
know producing slightly different

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:00.450
know producing slightly different
 

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.809
know producing slightly different
versions does that resulted in you know

00:38:02.809 --> 00:38:02.819
versions does that resulted in you know
 

00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:04.039
versions does that resulted in you know
without going into too much detail but

00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:04.049
without going into too much detail but
 

00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:05.809
without going into too much detail but
is that resulted in more relative

00:38:05.809 --> 00:38:05.819
is that resulted in more relative
 

00:38:05.819 --> 00:38:08.809
is that resulted in more relative
revenue to know than just the same yeah

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:08.819
revenue to know than just the same yeah
 

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.009
revenue to know than just the same yeah
you know it's interesting and again like

00:38:10.009 --> 00:38:10.019
you know it's interesting and again like
 

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:11.690
you know it's interesting and again like
we take a very analytical approach to

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700
we take a very analytical approach to
 

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.299
we take a very analytical approach to
this we will try different features and

00:38:14.299 --> 00:38:14.309
this we will try different features and
 

00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:17.180
this we will try different features and
different aspects on each platform and

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:17.190
different aspects on each platform and
 

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.400
different aspects on each platform and
we'll be able to see what the ROI is of

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.410
we'll be able to see what the ROI is of
 

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.640
we'll be able to see what the ROI is of
that so it's um you know you can start

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:22.650
that so it's um you know you can start
 

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.200
that so it's um you know you can start
it you know as a developer if you have

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:24.210
it you know as a developer if you have
 

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.089
it you know as a developer if you have
an iOS game you know it might be great

00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099
an iOS game you know it might be great
 

00:38:26.099 --> 00:38:27.829
an iOS game you know it might be great
to if you wanted to move over to Android

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839
to if you wanted to move over to Android
 

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.839
to if you wanted to move over to Android
start with feature parity but then as

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:29.849
start with feature parity but then as
 

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:31.370
start with feature parity but then as
you start to look at the data and see

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380
you start to look at the data and see
 

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.230
you start to look at the data and see
everything that's coming in you'll

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240
everything that's coming in you'll
 

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.240
everything that's coming in you'll
realize that you will need to tune it

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:35.250
realize that you will need to tune it
 

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.849
realize that you will need to tune it
and add custom features for your Android

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859
and add custom features for your Android
 

00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:39.650
and add custom features for your Android
audience in order to potentially get the

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.660
audience in order to potentially get the
 

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.240
audience in order to potentially get the
same or better you know return from it

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.250
same or better you know return from it
 

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.829
same or better you know return from it
yeah it's interesting it's something

00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839
yeah it's interesting it's something
 

00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:45.079
yeah it's interesting it's something
which we've been telling developers for

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:45.089
which we've been telling developers for
 

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:46.460
which we've been telling developers for
a while like you know your Android

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:46.470
a while like you know your Android
 

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:47.450
a while like you know your Android
audience have different expectations

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460
audience have different expectations
 

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.890
audience have different expectations
yeah I think particularly for

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900
yeah I think particularly for
 

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.990
yeah I think particularly for
development shops which have come from

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000
development shops which have come from
 

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.180
development shops which have come from
an iOS background or even a different

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:53.190
an iOS background or even a different
 

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.130
an iOS background or even a different
smartphone background and have those

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140
smartphone background and have those
 

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.249
smartphone background and have those
devices you know they are users of that

00:38:58.249 --> 00:38:58.259
devices you know they are users of that
 

00:38:58.259 --> 00:38:59.630
devices you know they are users of that
platform and so they have the same

00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640
platform and so they have the same
 

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.470
platform and so they have the same
expectations

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480
expectations
 

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.749
expectations
whereas the vast majority of their

00:39:02.749 --> 00:39:02.759
whereas the vast majority of their
 

00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:04.609
whereas the vast majority of their
audience hasn't had a different device

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619
audience hasn't had a different device
 

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:06.799
audience hasn't had a different device
or has chosen an Android device for a

00:39:06.799 --> 00:39:06.809
or has chosen an Android device for a
 

00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:09.049
or has chosen an Android device for a
reason right so there's definitely an

00:39:09.049 --> 00:39:09.059
reason right so there's definitely an
 

00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:11.359
reason right so there's definitely an
advantage I think to really customizing

00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:11.369
advantage I think to really customizing
 

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:12.740
advantage I think to really customizing
your solution to something that your

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:12.750
your solution to something that your
 

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.430
your solution to something that your
actual users will be happy with yeah

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440
actual users will be happy with yeah
 

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.490
actual users will be happy with yeah
it's interesting let's see we've got

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500
it's interesting let's see we've got
 

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.230
it's interesting let's see we've got
time for a couple more questions I'm

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240
time for a couple more questions I'm
 

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.880
time for a couple more questions I'm
just having a look on the moderator I

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:22.890
just having a look on the moderator I
 

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.410
just having a look on the moderator I
think we've got anything there which is

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420
think we've got anything there which is
 

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.049
think we've got anything there which is
particularly is there anything there

00:39:27.049 --> 00:39:27.059
particularly is there anything there
 

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:28.220
particularly is there anything there
that you're inclined to answer this

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.230
that you're inclined to answer this
 

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.460
that you're inclined to answer this
questions about competitors and and

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:30.470
questions about competitors and and
 

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.569
questions about competitors and and
revenue which I don't think you guys

00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579
revenue which I don't think you guys
 

00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:34.849
revenue which I don't think you guys
will answer he talked about how many

00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859
will answer he talked about how many
 

00:39:34.859 --> 00:39:36.799
will answer he talked about how many
developers that you've got sure so you

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:36.809
developers that you've got sure so you
 

00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:38.299
developers that you've got sure so you
know it's one of those things where our

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:38.309
know it's one of those things where our
 

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.190
know it's one of those things where our
team evolves over time and you know as

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200
team evolves over time and you know as
 

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.559
team evolves over time and you know as
we create more Android exclusives and

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:42.569
we create more Android exclusives and
 

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:45.349
we create more Android exclusives and
more titles for our Symington

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359
more titles for our Symington
 

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.259
more titles for our Symington
simultaneous launches so it's not

00:39:48.259 --> 00:39:48.269
simultaneous launches so it's not
 

00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:50.089
simultaneous launches so it's not
something that you know is ever static

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099
something that you know is ever static
 

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:51.620
something that you know is ever static
and so we change that over time just

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:51.630
and so we change that over time just
 

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.620
and so we change that over time just
based on

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:52.630
based on
 

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.520
based on
where we want to put resources the the

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:56.530
where we want to put resources the the
 

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.980
where we want to put resources the the
in-app purchase one so the question is

00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:58.990
in-app purchase one so the question is
 

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.870
in-app purchase one so the question is
how well is in-app purchase gone for tap

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880
how well is in-app purchase gone for tap
 

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.750
how well is in-app purchase gone for tap
two you know as the again a company

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760
two you know as the again a company
 

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.330
two you know as the again a company
philosophy of ours is to have a we

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:06.340
philosophy of ours is to have a we
 

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.860
philosophy of ours is to have a we
follow the freemium model and not the

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:07.870
follow the freemium model and not the
 

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.560
follow the freemium model and not the
the paid model because we really wanted

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:10.570
the paid model because we really wanted
 

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:12.450
the paid model because we really wanted
to reduce that barrier to entry for

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:12.460
to reduce that barrier to entry for
 

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.610
to reduce that barrier to entry for
everyone to come and try out our

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:14.620
everyone to come and try out our
 

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.650
everyone to come and try out our
experience and so for us it has gone

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:16.660
experience and so for us it has gone
 

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.820
experience and so for us it has gone
really well and you know we don't have

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:19.830
really well and you know we don't have
 

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.260
really well and you know we don't have
comparable data or to say like what

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.270
comparable data or to say like what
 

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.700
comparable data or to say like what
would happen if taps we was a paid app

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:23.710
would happen if taps we was a paid app
 

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.020
would happen if taps we was a paid app
or things like that but it's just our

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.030
or things like that but it's just our
 

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.550
or things like that but it's just our
company philosophy has been let's get it

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560
company philosophy has been let's get it
 

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.200
company philosophy has been let's get it
out to the most amount of users as

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.210
out to the most amount of users as
 

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.480
out to the most amount of users as
possible so they can all enjoy it sure

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:30.490
possible so they can all enjoy it sure
 

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.930
possible so they can all enjoy it sure
that makes sense now

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940
that makes sense now
 

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.930
that makes sense now
so um let's have a look so I think we've

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:36.940
so um let's have a look so I think we've
 

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.130
so um let's have a look so I think we've
got any other questions coming

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.140
got any other questions coming
 

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.870
got any other questions coming
you just have a quick look on the G+

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880
you just have a quick look on the G+
 

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.330
you just have a quick look on the G+
stream to see whether anyone has asked

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:42.340
stream to see whether anyone has asked
 

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.440
stream to see whether anyone has asked
them there what do you ask by using for

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:46.450
them there what do you ask by using for
 

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.240
them there what do you ask by using for
crash reporting we've gone through that

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:48.250
crash reporting we've gone through that
 

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:51.030
crash reporting we've gone through that
okay so you can probably just about wrap

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040
okay so you can probably just about wrap
 

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.490
okay so you can probably just about wrap
up what I am interested in I don't know

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:53.500
up what I am interested in I don't know

how much you can talk about it but do
 

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.720
how much you can talk about it but do
