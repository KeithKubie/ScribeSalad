00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 align:start position:0%
the big problem would be it would be the
 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.730 align:start position:0%
the big problem would be it would be the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.700 align:start position:0%
hoopla of continuity error and oh no no
but<00:04:36.919><c> but</c><00:04:37.190><c> Finn</c><00:04:37.460><c> and</c><00:04:37.610><c> Jake</c><00:04:38.020><c> he's</c><00:04:39.020><c> a</c><00:04:39.050><c> spirit</c>

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 align:start position:0%
but but Finn and Jake he's a spirit
 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.350 align:start position:0%
but but Finn and Jake he's a spirit
animal<00:04:39.919><c> and</c><00:04:40.310><c> of</c><00:04:40.490><c> course</c><00:04:40.729><c> it's</c><00:04:40.910><c> like</c><00:04:41.030><c> he's</c><00:04:41.180><c> not</c>

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
animal and of course it's like he's not
 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.260 align:start position:0%
animal and of course it's like he's not
an<00:04:41.539><c> animal</c><00:04:41.690><c> so</c><00:04:42.110><c> I</c><00:04:42.169><c> think</c><00:04:42.610><c> I</c><00:04:43.610><c> understand</c><00:04:44.150><c> what</c>

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 align:start position:0%
an animal so I think I understand what
 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.370 align:start position:0%
an animal so I think I understand what
you're<00:04:44.539><c> saying</c><00:04:44.750><c> where</c><00:04:44.960><c> you're</c><00:04:45.080><c> coming</c><00:04:45.349><c> from</c>

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 align:start position:0%
but I think most people would just be
 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
but I think most people would just be
like<00:04:46.940><c> that's</c><00:04:47.389><c> a</c><00:04:47.539><c> con</c><00:04:47.720><c> una</c><00:04:48.050><c> Tierra</c><00:04:48.289><c> I</c><00:04:49.660><c> bago</c><00:04:50.660><c> work</c>
