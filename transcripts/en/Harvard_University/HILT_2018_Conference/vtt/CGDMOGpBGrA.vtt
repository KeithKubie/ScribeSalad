00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.270
Greetings, everyone.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.394
We're going to get started.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.950
So we've now arrived.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.820
You've had the chance to
unpack the plenary in a cohort

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.229
or in the context
of your choice.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:21.520
Now we're going to get to work.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.830
So roll up those sleeves
and get ready to engage

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
in an implementation
workshop, we're calling them.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.510
So throughout the planning
of this conference,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.390
we've been thinking
a lot about what

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.450
do we really mean by the phrase
"the science of learning."

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
And you heard Erin speak to
that at a fairly general level.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
We'd like to have you pull out
of your registration folders

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.490
the chart that she
briefly referenced.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.050
This is going to be key
for our session today.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.515
With this horizontally
oriented sheet.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.660
The game plan for
our session today

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.890
is to let you think about
a problem of practice,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.130
a challenge that you're
facing in the teaching you're

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.460
doing directly, or in
the teaching being done

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.010
and the learning being done
by the courses and faculty

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.530
that you support.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.500
After you think
about that challenge,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.180
momentarily we're going to ask
you to identify one of these--

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.100
one of a subset
of five principles

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.790
that we've chosen to then think
more about, and to make some

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.080
plans.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.660
So indeed, in the spirit
of it being a workshop,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.190
there will be a
lot of time for you

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
to be fleshing out
trajectories that will

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.500
be useful in your own context.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.600
And then at the end, we'll share
back out to the larger group.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.640
To get us started,
though, let's take

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.570
a minute to look
at the sheet itself

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.060
since we didn't have a lot of
time for that in the opening.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.520
And think about
these nine principles

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.510
that are roughly
bucketed into cognitive

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.400
behavioral and affective,
with two as bookends,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.440
thinking about aiming by
which we engage what Steve

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.320
Kosslyn was talking about, and
being really clear about what

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.740
is it that we want our students
to know and do as a result

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.280
of the learning experience.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.770
Detect and scaffold,
be building on what

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.740
it is the students already know
in ways that sequence for them.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.550
To model activating guide,
and you can see throughout,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.870
to the right in the columns,
some more concrete ways

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.110
to enact these
kinds of principles.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.510
On the affective
dimensions, to connect

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.720
and to have high expectations,
and then to make sense of it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
all in assessing.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.140
What we've done is
put together examples,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.220
concrete manifestations
or practices,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.830
that build on and expand beyond
what's in the rightmost column.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.946
So you'll see here
a couple of examples

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:10.570
to help you visualize well, what
do we really mean by activate?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.090
What could that look
like in my classroom?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.570
You'll be given the chance
to look at more such examples

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.800
and think of additional
ones for your own.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.760
And as I said, make a
plan for your context.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.500
Because we knew that we
wouldn't be able to do justice

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.950
to all nine
principles, we decided

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.890
that we would focus us
all today on these five.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.230
So again, in a moment
you'll be given a chance

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.090
to think about a
problem of practice

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.270
and to then connect
with one of these.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.470
I want to say, now that
you have the big picture,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.860
I want to say a
special thank you,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.290
an introduction to my
wonderful colleagues.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.890
Adrienne Phelps-Coco, who is
at the Division of Continuing

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.750
Education, and
Josh Bookin, who's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.300
at the Graduate
School of Education.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.820
When I decided that
I wanted to have

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.980
this be one of our
implementation workshops,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.820
I picked up the bat phone and
called my fantastic colleagues

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.120
who I knew would be
incredibly expert and skilled

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.450
and lovely to work with.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.950
And that's been
absolutely the case.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.210
So thanks to you
both for what we're

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.410
about to experience today.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.845
Any questions about
what we're up to here?

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:35.590
OK.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.700
I'm going to hand
it over to Adrienne.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.200
Hello.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.530
Welcome, everybody.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.140
So what we want to
do is make sure,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.210
as we think about the
science of learning,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.410
that it fits in with your
course, and with the practices

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.740
that you're doing, and with the
challenges that you're facing.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.530
We're hoping that this
session can help you come up

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.640
with some solutions to actual
challenges that you have,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.460
or if you are someone who
works with faculty in designing

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.920
their courses, to
actual challenges

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.710
that you often hear
people encounter.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.270
So what we want to
do today, is we're

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.910
going to walk you
through a series of steps

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.310
to think about some
of those challenges,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.480
and then to brainstorm some
solutions with your colleagues.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.350
So to get started, there is a--

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.980
in the center of
your table, there

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.200
is a worksheet that
has a paper clip.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.940
Not the thing that's
in the envelope.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.820
The thing that's sitting open on
the table with the paper clip.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.680
The envelope will
come in a minute.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.000
So if you can distribute
those amongst yourselves,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.370
that'll be our step one here.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.430
Is this the worksheet?

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.930
Yes.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.590
All right.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.510
Everybody got it?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.690
So what we want to do is start
with the very first step, where

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.870
we want to think about
a problem of practice.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.820
And what we mean
by that is either

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.710
a challenge that you
know you're facing,

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.320
or something that crops
up in your evaluations,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.547
you're not quite sure
what to make of it.

00:06:07.547 --> 00:06:09.130
Again, if you're
working with faculty,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.060
something that you hear
from people that you would

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.560
like to have some solutions for.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.980
So we want you to take
about five minutes,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.639
and just write about this
challenge for yourself.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.930
Finish early, you can talk
with the person next to you.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.740
But let's define the problem.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.701
Then we'll start
getting into solutions.

00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:29.200
So you can probably
guess what we're

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.040
about to do next, which
is, our goal here is really

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.030
to think about how we can use
the science of learning to make

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.790
improvements to your course
or the courses you're working

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.140
with, with these challenges.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.990
So what we want you
to do is sort of

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.510
read over those categories
just a little bit again,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.330
and see if you get
a sense of which

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.750
of these might be most helpful
for solving your challenge.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.750
And then what we're
going to do is

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.600
we're all going to stand up
and move to tables so you

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.160
can discuss your challenges.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.160
But take just a second,
look over these principles.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.660
All right.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.951
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.680
I'm going to ask
for a show of hands

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.615
for who is interested
in which principle,

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.990
and that way we're going to
divide up the tables in a way

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.740
that, you know, if half of
you want to talk about detect,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.940
we'll make a lot of detect
tables, and if only a few

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.740
of you want to talk about
activate, we'll just make one.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.670
Sound good?

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.020
All right.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.800
[LAUGHS] You guys, make it two.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.300
Make it two.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.800
All right.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.700
That's good.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.480
Good to know.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.610
So while they're figuring
out the tables here,

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.151
I want to tell you a little bit
about what we're going to do.

00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:38.640
Is once we have the tables,
we'll put all the numbers up.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.590
You can go to the table for the
principle you're interested in.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.100
And then there is a packet
at the middle of the table.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.700
And inside that
packet, you're going

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.970
to find a whole lot more
information about each

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.100
of these principles,
including examples

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.490
that are being used here
at Harvard and elsewhere,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.580
and also just a little bit
more examples of how you

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.660
might put this into practice.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.300
And what we're going
to ask you to do

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.690
is spend some time reading
over the part of your packet

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.130
that applies to your table.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.990
So we gave you all
the whole packet

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.860
so you can come away
with the whole thing.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.950
But if you're in activate,
you can skip straight

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.290
to the activate.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.260
And think about
those ideas, and then

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.740
to think about how
you might adapt them

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.040
for your own classroom
practice, and then we're

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.410
going to do some group share
out and some collective

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.110
note-taking, so that we can
come away with as many ideas

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.520
as we possibly can.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.989
That sound good to everybody?

00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:35.530
All right.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.154
Anybody have any questions about
any of these up to this point?

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:41.909
All right, everyone.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:46.170
So as you get settled, do what
many of you are already doing.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.820
Please introduce yourself to
the other people at the table.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.720
If you have a lot of
people at your table,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.400
you may want to
split into two groups

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.720
so you have smaller groups
talking to each other.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.750
But just do a
quick introduction,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.600
tell people why you're here,
what your problem of practice

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.101
is.

00:09:00.101 --> 00:09:02.308
We're only going to spend
about five minutes on this,

00:09:02.308 --> 00:09:04.430
so let's make it more
of a lightning round.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:09.265
But take a minute to
introduce yourselves.

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:10.235
All right, everyone.

00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:13.182
Looks like intros are winding
down at some of the tables,

00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:15.716
so I want to tell you
what's going next.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:19.290
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.490
Now is the time to open up
that packet if you have not

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.955
and find your principle.

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:27.920
And we want you to
spend the next eight

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.460
minutes or so thinking about--

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.770
reading through the
ideas for your principle.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:40.497
And then looking at parts
C and D on your worksheet.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.080
And just really
thinking about, as you

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.169
read the examples of the
handout, do any of them

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:46.210
seem like they're going
to work for your context,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.830
or might they work
if you adapted them?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.990
And then also, are there
any other practices

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.330
that you're already doing?

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.955
Or that learning
about these principles

00:09:53.955 --> 00:09:58.021
make you think that, that
could then be useful?

00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:00.520
So you want to spend about eight
minutes doing some writing,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.745
thinking on your own.

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:06.588
If you need to finish interests
first, that's totally fine.

00:10:06.588 --> 00:10:07.610
All right, everybody.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.260
Seems like the conversation
has picked back up again,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.060
which is a good thing.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.270
So even if you're not completely
done with your writing,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.450
you can always go
back to that later on.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.190
But what we want to do here
is you'll see in this packet,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.200
we have given you some
examples that we have gathered

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.190
of either examples from Harvard,
or from elsewhere, that we

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.030
really think are
thought-provoking and can

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.270
help everyone improve
their teaching.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.820
But what we'd really like
to do is expand on that.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.390
So for the next 15 minutes,
what we want you to do

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.940
is share with each
other any ideas

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.040
that you came up with,
or collectively work

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.340
on some ideas.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.070
And we have a series
of Google Docs

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.610
for each of these principles.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.330
So these are the URLs for
each of the Google Docs.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.090
And we're going to ask
one person from each group

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.100
to be the note taker.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.280
And we will share all
of this out later on.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.800
But our goal here
is to really expand

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.720
on what you've
got in this packet

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.330
and create a greater
bank of ideas

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.810
that everyone can draw from.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.740
Sound good?

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.030
Or even to just
talk about how you

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.560
might use one of
the things that's

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.570
in the packet in
your own context.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.070
Absolutely.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.390
Doesn't have to be a huge leap.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:26.895
15 minutes.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.970
OK.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.730
Thank you for engaging
deeply with the material

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.570
and with each other.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.640
I sat in on a variety
of conversations

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.580
and found rich
problems of practice

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.550
that people were workshopping
in really interesting ways.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.040
What we'd like to
do now is to get

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.450
a little bit of
a snippet of what

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.250
happened at the
various tables and

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.020
with the various principles.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.180
This is not going
to be the only time

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.290
that you're going to be able
to interact with other people's

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.700
topics.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.530
So there's the Google Docs that
people are taking notes in,

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.650
and some groups are
taking notes by hand.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.470
Feel free to continue to do
that throughout the remainder

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.447
of the session.

00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:09.530
We'll collect those and
we'll send those links out

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.724
to everyone.

00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:12.140
The rest of the
packet, obviously,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.405
with the other four
principles that you probably

00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:15.780
haven't had a
chance to read yet,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.220
but hopefully are
good resources,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.060
will also be available.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.690
But what we're doing now is
we have three minutes, pretty

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.630
quick share outs per principle.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.920
And so I will try
to keep us to that.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.080
But we'd love to hear
interesting ideas,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.520
unresolved issues, or insights
that your group came up with.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.360
So we'll start with aim.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.000
So these first two tables.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.970
So if anyone wants to volunteer.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:45.470
All right.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.080
Hi, everybody.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.830
My name is Jeremy.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.460
I had the pleasure of working
with Jascha, Ramona, and Laura

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.080
on aim.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.480
We did not resolve all
of the issues with regard

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.080
to linking our teaching goals to
learners' learning objectives.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.200
We did sort of
unanimously decide,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.320
or come to a consensus,
that being very explicit,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.590
being very upfront about
what our specific teaching

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.430
goals were early in the teaching
encounter, or in a curriculum,

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.480
and then doing some sort
of detection or assessment

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.330
to determine how those goals
align with learners' objectives

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.529
is important.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.570
Particularly in this
contemporary era in which we

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.910
are judged by
student evaluations

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.850
and their perceptions of
the utility of the courses

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.447
and content that we develop.

00:13:31.447 --> 00:13:33.530
Along those lines, we
struggled with the challenge

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.530
of the sort of one room
schoolhouse model, where

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.780
we may have learners with
different levels of knowledge,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.580
with different perspectives,
with different agendas

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.160
coming into a teaching encounter
or into a course of curriculum.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.730
And we did not, kind
of, fully address

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.190
how to tackle that challenge.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.710
Similarly, we
struggled with the idea

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.770
of developing goals or
end-learning objectives that

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.710
are more content
or factual based,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.640
and maybe less about analysis
and application and higher

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.784
level skills, and how to
build those in a way that

00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:07.200
can be meaningful
for the learners

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.840
and that can be assessed in a
meaningful way down the road.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.280
Did I miss anything?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.220
I don't think so.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.250
That was excellent.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:14.910
Nicely done.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:15.899
And a great model.

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:17.940
Anything that this group
would like to add about,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.500
sort of, aim.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.660
Ideas can be specific.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.640
Things people wanted to
try, or general principles.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.140
Sure.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.660
So I'm Holly from
the second aim table,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.510
and I'll just read a
couple from our group.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.970
We have a number of
people who support faculty

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.980
in the creating of
learning objectives,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.280
and assessment of learning.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.404
And so we had some really
interesting conversations

00:14:38.404 --> 00:14:41.255
about how to do that
because faculty will often

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.380
think that everything
they're teaching is critical.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.390
So how do you help them
to identify the enduring

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.015
understandings?

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:47.960
And sometimes having
an outside perspective

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.200
either from an
educational specialist,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.719
or convening a group of
alums from a course that

00:14:52.719 --> 00:14:54.510
are five years out,
that you might actually

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.850
run into an airport,
are two practical ways

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.675
that we talked about to try
to crystallize those enduring

00:14:59.675 --> 00:15:00.300
understandings.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.440
We were all really taken by
that part of the aim idea.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.320
We talked about posting
learning objectives

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.870
in the physical
classroom environment,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.720
and/or in some electronic
way checking in with students

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.090
every one to two weeks to
say, like, how far along

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:16.987
are we progressing?

00:15:16.987 --> 00:15:18.820
I know that's getting
a little bit into some

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.700
of the more assessing
things, but just making sure

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.710
that you're continuously
revisiting the learning

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.630
objectives as opposed to
writing them and putting them

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.379
aside, or putting them
on your first slide

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:28.690
and putting them aside.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.470
Wonderful.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.890
One thing I'm struck by about
aim is how ambitious, sort of,

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.550
the airport goal is, and
that less can often be more

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.530
of this idea of everything
seems important,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.694
but then nothing gets sort of
the treatment that it deserves.

00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:46.360
And I think these schematics are
very interesting to think, sort

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.640
of how much are we trying
to do, and how much they

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.850
relate to each other.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.705
So even if we don't
give them to students,

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:53.830
how do we ourselves understand
how these things all

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.471
fit together?

00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:54.970
Great.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.469
Thank you.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.420
What's next?

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.630
Yeah.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.640
Next table for detect.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.990
Hi, I'm Margaret,
and our group talked

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.960
about the detect principle,
finding appropriate ways

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.240
to gauge what your students
know and don't know.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.209
And our group had
people who play

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:14.750
a number of different roles in
a number of different schools.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.240
So that was really
great, and I'm

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.670
hoping that my
peers will speak in

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.150
if I forget anything because
I was busily taking notes.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.310
One theme that came
up with our group

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.550
is the importance of building
trust in your community,

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.650
and making sure that
the students know

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.080
that it's OK to ask questions.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.550
And also we discuss how
it's great to empower

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.800
the students to decide
themselves how are

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.480
we going to build a community.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.810
And that will help with detect.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.250
Another topic that
we talked about was

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.930
the power of small group
discussions and presentations

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.700
and how that peer effect can
be motivating to help students

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.190
prepare and do the
reading, or whatever work

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.050
is needed before class.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.980
And if they don't do the
work or reading, that one,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.920
they need to be able to own it
and acknowledge it when they're

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.599
doing small group
work, and secondly,

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:12.670
that they may be motivated to
do that work because they know

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.010
that their peers are depending
on them to contribute

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.339
to that small group work.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.420
We also talked
about cases in which

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.849
students need to
self-evaluate their own work.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:27.819
And it was related
that students are often

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.090
very highly critical of
themselves, and maybe

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.390
one of that, this was
in the case of speaking,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.120
that the students
may be self-critical

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.790
because they don't realize
the huge amount of effort that

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.910
goes into preparing
presentations or speeches.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.400
And it would be great to
be transparent about that

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.340
so that they know how much
time it takes and then we'd

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.730
have a better gauge about
how to self-evaluate where

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.890
they are currently
in their skills

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.600
and how they can improve.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.780
We also talked
about the new course

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.630
schedules and what do you do if
you have a three hour stretch

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.640
of time to cover things.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.890
I'm not sure we
solved that problem,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.630
but if anyone has any ideas,
please go to the Google Doc.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:17.380
And finally, we also touched
on the in-class polling.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.970
What do you do with the faculty
with whom you work, you know,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.730
are not really on
board on using that?

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.940
What are some possible
other ways to address that?

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.530
And we didn't really solve
that challenge quite either,

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.650
but again, please,
go to the Google Doc

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.220
and write your ideas.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:31.720
Great.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.770
Thank you.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.490
And the other group from detect?

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.140
Things to add?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.570
Or was that the one--
that was one group.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.070
OK.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.070
So I think one thing
I'll say about detect

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.990
that-- a middle point you made
about, sort of, meta-cognition,

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.190
or self-assessment, I think that
is very powerful as a modality,

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.100
and the learning sciences
says that as well.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.117
And I like how you
also talk about,

00:18:52.117 --> 00:18:54.700
in some ways modeling for them
that meta-cognition, and giving

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.330
them a sense of how hard it
is to do a public speech,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.740
and sort of, what are the
component parts before they

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.780
then overly critically assess
themselves against, sort of,

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.190
unfair metrics.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.040
So activate, from this table.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.830
Anyone want to share some
thoughts, or willing to?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.400
So ours is going
to be really broad.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.960
Basically, we each had
struggles that other schools

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.860
had conquered.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.160
So I think just the
takeaway for this

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.230
is to look and see what
other schools are doing.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:36.280
So for example, my challenge
was looking at large lectures

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.130
at 8:00 AM for working
adults, and they're taped.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.150
So students don't come.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.260
What do you do?

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.110
And this is what spurred the
medical school's curriculum

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:46.390
reform.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.690
Business schools looking
at how to bring more voices

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.455
into their case discussions,
and that's something

00:19:53.455 --> 00:19:55.580
that the Kennedy School is
looking at with Teachly.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.630
So we just found that
if we're looking around

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.810
at other schools, people
are doing things and having

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.150
the same challenges that
we're having and solving them.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.680
Great.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.630
Thank you.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.620
Table six.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.454
Thoughts to add in
terms of activate?

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.770
Well, we talked about one
particular problem, probably

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.470
mostly was dealing
with the consultancy.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.650
A problem where
we had a classroom

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.100
of doctors and nurses
learning to teach

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.740
and some of the problems
that come up with in terms

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.150
of hierarchies, getting
people to work together

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.910
and not clump together.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.480
And talked mostly
about consultancies

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.580
and how those might be in--

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.210
kind of what we're
doing here, and how

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.140
that might help them solve
some of those problems.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.840
I don't know if you
wanted to add anything.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.570
I also discovered the problem
that I had written down

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.760
would probably better
addressed stepping back

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.410
a little bit, which is also a
good thing to realize, right?

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.180
That's great.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.593
Yeah.

00:21:07.593 --> 00:21:09.426
Were you going to say
what your problem was?

00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:10.620
What your challenge was?

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.810
It's mostly dealing with a
faculty member who is ambitious

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.470
and not being able
to rein in some

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:24.010
of the excitedness of his plans.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.360
And just having that person then
go on and do other things, kind

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.670
of, just not feeling very
useful in that moment,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.640
and trying to come up
with a solution when maybe

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.190
it really should've started in a
negotiation back at that level.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.150
Great.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.280
Thank you.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:45.780
Yeah.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.931
And then the last
table on activate.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.680
We had a lot of
different ideas as we

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.610
were talking about
different challenges,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.770
but one of the themes
that we talked about

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.230
was creating self-driven
activities or expectations

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.910
or norms on the
part of the people

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.100
learning in our different
situations, where

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.620
they're actually
setting their own goals,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.730
or working towards that.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.550
And then we just help them
negotiate that with each other.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.820
We were also talking about
finding opportunities

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.250
for more collaborative
activities where they can learn

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.230
from each other,
rather than having

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.880
us stand in as an instructor.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.470
Really finding
opportunities for them

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.520
to practice their
learning through showing.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.930
And we also talked about
finding opportunities

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.850
for those students
to frame content,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.087
or like create the content
that they want to learn.

00:22:39.087 --> 00:22:41.420
And if that doesn't work,
finding opportunities for them

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.350
to reflect or personalize
their approach

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.970
to the content in a way that's
useful and applicable to them

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.100
so that they know what
they're taking away

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.170
while they're actually in
the learning situation.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.670
Great.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.840
Thank you.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.156
One of the things I hear
coming through that theme

00:22:59.156 --> 00:23:00.530
that your table
was talking about

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.960
is motivation and self-efficacy.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.980
And another thing that, in
terms of peer instruction

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.537
and learning from
each other, I was

00:23:08.537 --> 00:23:10.370
struck that one of the
most dramatic finding

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.790
of the research literature is
that when students are teaching

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.550
each other, the person
doing the teaching

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.680
tends to learn more than the
student getting instructed.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.460
So I had always assumed it
would be the other way around.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.633
So it can be very powerful
in all directions.

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:25.440
Great.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.330
So the connect table.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.510
So we talked about the
challenge of connecting,

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.343
and we had some really
interesting examples,

00:23:32.343 --> 00:23:34.880
particularly in online
or very large courses,

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.140
or folks who are doing part-time
learning where you can never

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.865
gauge who's in the room
or why they're there.

00:23:41.865 --> 00:23:44.240
So we had a lot of discussions
about different techniques

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.930
to try.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.210
And something
interesting is to make

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.000
them feel a connection to
you as the instructor, which

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.144
is a kind of strange thing
maybe in an online setting

00:23:53.144 --> 00:23:54.560
to feel like you
can take the time

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.300
to try to get the
students to know you

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.030
and to understand that you're
not there just to make this

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.760
difficult for them, but that
you are motivated to help them.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.550
So we talked about that.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.500
We talked about some
challenges in connecting

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:10.970
in courses that are actually
really hard because sometimes

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.762
they'll think that you're just
in it to embarrass them or give

00:24:14.762 --> 00:24:16.220
them a terrible
grade or something.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.690
And we talked about
the importance

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.460
of sort of setting
that vision upfront,

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.560
even taking the time,
especially in the beginning,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.380
to make that connection
to their bigger picture.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.270
Why are they there?

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.430
What-- this is going
to be a long journey,

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.570
but go on it with me.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.060
And then trying to reiterate
that message a few times

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.630
throughout the semester.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.300
And then a great
tip at the very end

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.310
of the semester, once
hopefully they've

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.610
done that journey with you,
to ask if they could offer

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.720
words of advice or wisdom.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.020
What did they wish they knew
at the beginning of the course?

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.750
And then having that available
in your pocket for when

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.430
you teach it the next
time because it's

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.014
coming from other students,
not from scary you.

00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:55.430
And then we just
talked in general

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.430
about the concept of fostering
participation and engagement,

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.370
which we felt is really
important to connection.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.430
And again, that's
establishing what

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.974
I know in the business school
we call a learning contract

00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:09.140
upfront, just letting them
know that what you expect

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.575
preparation being
very essential,

00:25:11.575 --> 00:25:13.950
as is participation, and that
the more that they do that,

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.460
the more they'll get out of it.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.510
And trying as best you can
to create a safe environment,

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.969
just to make sure that people
feel comfortable speaking up.

00:25:21.969 --> 00:25:23.135
That's what we talked about.

00:25:23.135 --> 00:25:23.640
Great.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.765
I love that one of the many
ideas you said in there

00:25:25.765 --> 00:25:28.400
is the idea of connecting
even between classes

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.414
of different years.

00:25:29.414 --> 00:25:30.830
So there's connections
that can go

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.538
in so many different
directions, but even

00:25:32.538 --> 00:25:35.240
that longitudinal,
institutional knowledge.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.930
That's a great idea.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.376
So the last principle, assess.

00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:41.000
And this is assessing
our own teaching,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.300
not assessing the
student's learning.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.350
But so anyone who'd be
comfortable sharing out?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.290
I don't know that we did such a
good job tackling the assessing

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.980
because we ended up touching
on all these other issues, too,

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.740
but all because
of the challenges

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.240
of figuring out how to assess.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.160
And so we didn't come
up with solutions.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.370
We had a couple of
ideas which were having

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.600
in-class polling that
can be showing live,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.620
so you get a sense of,
basically, is this working?

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.980
And identifying problems
before moving on past them.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.630
We talked about not being
too adherent to student

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.060
evaluations, but having--

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.820
going back to the
aims, which is like,

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.060
this all kind of
comes full circle.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.740
But going back to the
aims and thinking,

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.170
you know, how can we
figure out five years out

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.030
whether they know it or not?

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.680
And is there a way
we can implement

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.070
that to reach out to people
and find out what they know?

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.780
And then finally, we talked
about the value of small groups

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.530
within the class with guided
questions as a way of you

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.190
can figure out what
they knew coming in,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:52.020
and they can teach each other
within that small group,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.250
and that also empowers them
to speak up within the class.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.790
So I think those are the
main things that we covered.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.640
Yeah.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.850
But what we all agreed on is
that there is not a good way

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.060
to assess as far as
we can tell right now.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.580
And if you guys
have other thoughts,

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.305
that would be really
helpful to everyone.

00:27:12.305 --> 00:27:14.160
That's great.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.660
Let's see.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.520
In terms of other
thoughts on assess.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.070
I mean, I am struck
by the last point

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.320
you made of, sort
of, if we're trying

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.090
to assess the efficacy
of our teaching,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.200
assessing our
students' learning.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.670
If you actually get
them in groups and see,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.040
can they do the tasks that
we're asking them to do?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.450
That is really good
real time feedback.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.300
In addition to a
polling of, you know,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.700
does this make sense to you?

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.206
Or actually can you
do this question?

00:27:36.206 --> 00:27:39.260
But I mean, one thing I've seen,
and I'll circle back to this

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.330
and see if my colleagues
have other thoughts,

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.960
but I'm hearing in a
really good productive way

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.540
the difficulty of
isolating these principles

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.974
from each other.

00:27:48.974 --> 00:27:50.390
In the same way,
one of the things

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.190
that I have found
most powerful for me

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.040
as I think about how to
tackle teaching problems,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.830
is the idea of having a
pedagogical repertoire,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.232
and then matching it
to the right situation.

00:28:00.232 --> 00:28:01.940
And in this case,
we're almost meta here.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.920
It's sort of we have a
teaching problem, a practice,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.795
and we're trying to
figure out what principle

00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:07.640
can be sort of the
entry point, or, sort

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.710
of, the main lever for change.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:12.530
But they're all interconnected,
and so when we hear

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.420
about people starting with--

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.920
being in activate
and realizing they

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.870
want to go back
towards aim, or people

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.810
who are doing things about
detect and seeing that trust

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.520
and connecting is a
really important way

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.020
to be able to detect because
people aren't going to give you

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.440
the data that you need if
they don't feel comfortable.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.900
And so I feel like my last
thought on the assess question

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.870
that you opened up
was it is a thing

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:40.370
to start from the beginning as
a culture in the classroom, of I

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.330
myself am very open to learning
from you and making changes,

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.180
so it's the in-class polling,
it's the one-minute papers

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.160
at the end of the
first class session,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.310
it's the mid-semester feedback,
it's reporting it back to them

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.980
and then showing that
you're doing those changes.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.440
Such that-- because I
often read course evals

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.900
and help faculty
members digest them,

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.780
and it's not surprising,
but notable to me

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.070
how many times students
say, this was an issue.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:10.100
The faculty got data from
us and really addressed it,

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.200
and I deeply
appreciate that, and we

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.560
saw how it changed over the
trajectory of the experience.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.560
So that sort of building
assessment in on a daily basis

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.374
has, to me, been
really powerful.

00:29:20.374 --> 00:29:22.040
I don't know if you
have anything to add

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.731
on that before we transition.

00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:25.230
I think if I can
just add one thing.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.970
So I've been using anonymous
feedback surveys built

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.000
into Canvas, which are
basically a variation

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.210
on the minute paper.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.020
And I've been doing it for
four years now, I think.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.030
And I will never
teach without it

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.850
again because you learn so much.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.530
You think you can
assess how people

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.420
are doing by looking
them in the eye,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.540
but when you actually ask
them, you learn things like,

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.400
oh, this activity didn't go
well because it was too hard,

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.220
or because all of my
kids have the flu,

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.080
and it was just a hard week.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.780
You get all of this
information from people

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.170
that you wouldn't otherwise
get just by asking,

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.910
and it's wonderful.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.070
So I highly, highly
recommend it.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.600
Yeah?

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.570
So I just-- we tried that
last year, and what we found

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:19.796
was that all we did was invite
the angry people to anonymously

00:30:19.796 --> 00:30:22.280
tear us apart.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.860
And then people
started skipping it.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.820
And I actually ended up having
students come up after and say,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.780
I'm not one of them.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.160
I'm on your side.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.100
And so we decided not
to do it this year.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.941
So, you know, I think
they can go both ways.

00:30:37.941 --> 00:30:38.440
It can.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.420
I make them worth
one point every week.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.480
I mean, that's silly, but
it does get people to do it.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.070
And I also-- I report back
on it every single week.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.220
So I say, this many people--

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.960
half the group thought this
activity was fantastic,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.690
the other half did not.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.840
And that reporting lets them
see that there are lots of sides

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.287
to every issue, so that if--

00:30:58.287 --> 00:30:59.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.470
You obviously don't make
people as angry as we do.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.214
We have a response here.

00:31:05.214 --> 00:31:07.130
The other thing that we
do to get around this,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.260
like, just hearing
the complaints issue,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.040
is that we have them as
Plus Deltas, which I think

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.530
is in one of these as well.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.380
And so they have
to say one thing

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.660
that they want to see more
of because it's going well

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.600
for them, and one thing
they want to change.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.510
Which can come still
across as a complaint,

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.360
but also it can come
as a more productive,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.620
constructive thought.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:30.940
Great.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.820
Wow.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.670
So we are--

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.224
Am I on?

00:31:35.224 --> 00:31:35.723
Yes, I'm on.

00:31:35.723 --> 00:31:36.222
OK.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.350
We're close to the end
of our time together.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.110
I'd like you to think about
the problem of practice

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:50.070
that you wrote about
when we started.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.110
Think about what
it is that you've

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.690
learned in discussion
with others today,

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.660
in reading the handouts, in
hearing from other groups.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.180
And the last prompt on the
worksheet is just to think,

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:09.240
what is one thing you are going
to try out or do differently

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.570
or even think more about as a
result of this conversation?

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.370
So take a moment
and jot that down,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.630
and we'll hear from a few of
you about your own trajectory

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:22.950
during this session.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:31.040
All right.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.470
Sorry.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:39.950
So a couple of takeaways
that we hope you leave with.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:46.520
The first is the generosity and
richness of the contributions

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.690
that you've made with each
other to the Google Docs,

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.000
and in the report- out.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.450
There's only so
much that can happen

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.210
in a 75-minute chunk of
time, but a lot has happened.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.950
We want to continue to use the
Google Docs as a repository

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.910
for great ideas.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:08.510
So if you took notes and
didn't use a Google Doc,

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.150
please leave your sheet
and we'll upload it.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.230
I also was struck in the plenary
by Steve Kosslyn's comment

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.970
about the distinction
between knowing

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.510
the skill or the content and
knowing when and how to use it.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:27.680
And I think we've seen both
the potential for transfer

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.570
across context of some
of these practices,

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.220
and also some of the
challenges for that.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.740
At the bottom of the
handout, you've seen--

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.110
we've listed
additional resources.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.590
Some of these are just places
where we ourselves generated

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.030
or found these exercises.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.080
So we encourage you to
check these out as well.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.350
What are a couple
of takeaways, or I

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.530
plan to do this
differently or better

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.422
as a result of the session
that you wrote about?

00:33:58.422 --> 00:33:59.380
What's something that--

00:34:07.121 --> 00:34:07.620
Yes.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.880
Casey.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.730
I'm going to try at
the end of unit one

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.860
doing a Plus Delta
just on an index card.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.940
So asking students, you know,
so we're a third of the way

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.330
through the semester now, what
do you want to see more of?

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.159
And what suggestions do you have
for things you want to change?

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:25.979
That's great.

00:34:25.979 --> 00:34:28.270
And that's in an online context.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:31.989
So I think I'm actually going
to do it in-class on index cards

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:35.190
and ask them to drop them into
a box as they walk out the door.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.969
Great.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:36.550
OK.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.050
Others?

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.320
I think we might find ways
to reincorporate the surveys

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.960
because I like the idea
of reporting back to them

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.260
so they-- because I think
that our problem was that they

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.000
didn't take it seriously.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.159
And so I think that
really showing them

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.050
that we're listening
to them, I think

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.730
that that's incredibly helpful.

00:34:59.794 --> 00:35:00.335
Other things.

00:35:03.182 --> 00:35:05.140
Virginia, what are you
going to do differently?

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.280
Mine was the same, actually.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.840
Well, I was getting some
anonymous feedback each week

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.560
on Canvas.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.630
Because I think it's also a
way to report back and help

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.850
shape their expectations
and keep them realistic.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.066
And mine as well.

00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:32.000
I think just using the map
of the general understanding,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.490
the airport concept, what
do we want them to learn,

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.290
and then what do we
want them to remember,

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.112
both in terms of when
I work with faculty

00:35:38.112 --> 00:35:39.695
and thinking about
the course overall,

00:35:39.695 --> 00:35:43.100
or the session, but also
in terms of my own work.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:48.140
I spend a lot of time
developing cases and using

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.170
that construct to help me
think about the case material

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.980
and how I'm going
to put it together.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.630
Great.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.550
Thank you so much.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.270
Well, in trying to
walk our own talk,

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.310
you'll be receiving,
for the conference

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.530
overall, a quick survey.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.450
And there will be
a space for you

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.630
to share feedback
about this session

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.110
because this was a
new experience for us.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.940
And we plan to read--

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.350
and repurpose in different ways.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.860
We'd love to hear what worked
and what didn't for you.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.960
And we look forward
to continuing

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.110
to be in touch
virtually and in person.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.440
So thank you very much.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.790
