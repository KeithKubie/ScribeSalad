00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.440
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.040
Coming up in December of 2015, the UN will
host the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.460
The focus of this year’s COP21 will be climate
change.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.420
Most of the leading nations in the world have
been asked to pledge to keep the rise in global

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509
temperature under 2 degrees celsius.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.900
It’s clear that a sharp curb in co2 and
greenhouse gas emissions is needed.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.630
Unfortunately, not all countries agree on
how best to go about that.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.399
There’s two main plans: one says everyone
gets a per capita cut.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.310
Everyone, all nations, have an equal responsibility
to curb emissions.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.399
The other says that countries who polluted
more in the past have more responsibility

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.870
to curb their emissions, so that those that
polluted less can have some wiggle room to

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.870
still grow.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.499
But one study from the Center for International
Climate and Environmental Research – Oslo

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.929
(CICERO) found that the US, EU, and Chinese
emission pledges leave very little room for

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.159
other countries to emit in a 2°C world.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.970
Those countries say their pledges are “fair
and ambitious” but might not be enough to

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.600
keep things cool enough.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.950
The 2 degrees target was decided back in 2009
at another UN conference in Copenhagen, where

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.170
in the Copenhagen Accord countries recognized
“the scientific view that the increase in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.830
global temperature should be below 2 degrees
Celsius".

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.210
But why did they choose that number?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.920
Well that number can be traced back to two
papers published in the mid-70s by Professor

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.860
of Economics William Nordhaus at Yale University.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.189
In these papers he said that “If there were
global temperatures more than 2 or 3° above

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.880
the current average temperature, this would
take the climate outside of the range of observations

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810
which have been made over the last several
hundred thousand years”.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.189
Ice core sampling in the mid 80s confirmed
that two degrees above pre-industrial levels

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.170
hadn’t been seen on the planet in at least
the last 100,000 years.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.259
Another report in the early 90s reconfirmed
that the consensus that two degrees is “an

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.350
upper limit beyond which the risks of grave
damage to ecosystems... are expected to increase

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.350
rapidly”.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.970
Since then, that number has had huge visibility
as a “speed limit” of sorts.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.990
As we might pass that number, the worse effects
on the climate and the faster those effects

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.400
will happen.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.090
Effects like global sea level rise.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.880
A study published in the journal Nature Climate
Change found that levels could rise 1.5 and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.020
4 meters by the year 2300 if the Earth warms
at least 2 degrees.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.830
The effects of which we’ve talked about
in previous episodes.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.190
Links for those down below.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.771
Not only could oceans rise, but rivers could
run dry, according to a study published in

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:40.580
the journal Philosophical Transactions of
the Royal Society A. In analyzing water scarcity,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.660
researchers found that water supplies would
dwindle thanks to more pressure from a growing

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.660
population.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.760
If the temperatures climb even higher, to
four degrees, some river beds will be drier

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.990
but some might be wetter, which could put
more pressure on stressed out governments.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.170
As the temperatures get worse, the effects
will be more extreme.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.070
In another study also published in the same
journal, researchers found other effects include

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.290
no sea ice in the arctic in the summer, coral
reef die outs, melting of permafrost which

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.060
will release more greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere, and “die-back of the Amazon

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.060
forest”.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.050
The study also predicts that semi-arid and
arid places, like sub-Saharan Africa will

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.270
be even drier, they predict the collapse of
the agricultural system in that region.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.000
So it’s safe to say that if the world warms
up, as it looks like it very well might, Earth

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.700
is going to look a lot different.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.450
We’re witnessing one of the effects of a
climate change right now!

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.280
Arctic ice levels have been the lowest scientists
have ever seen.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:51.420
So what happens if all the ice melts?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:02.180
What changes have you noticed, perhaps longer
summers?
