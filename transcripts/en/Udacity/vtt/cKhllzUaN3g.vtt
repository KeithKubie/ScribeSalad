So it's the end of the year and
you want to get your final grades.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.370
Let's go back to the Main Menu.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.360
Click Student Services &amp; Financial Aid,
and then click Student Records.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.300
And then click Final Grades,
select the Term.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.200
At the bottom of the screen,
you'll find your grades.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Your grades will be
on a scale of A to F,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.570
or maybe an I if you coordinate
with your professor in advance.
