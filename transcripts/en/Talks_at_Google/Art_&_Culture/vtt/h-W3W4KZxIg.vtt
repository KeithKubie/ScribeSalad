[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.290
CHRIS JACKSON: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.410
How you doing?

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.030
What's up?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.797
So thank you for allowing
me to come and play

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:21.630
with you guys today.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.110
This is the most fascinating
building in the entire world.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.012
I'm only going to
say, OK, Google, once.

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:28.470
We'll just get that
out of the way.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.210
I'm really, really,
really, really

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
excited to be up here,
firstly because I don't really

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.910
have a show to do
tonight which makes

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.150
my life a whole lot easier,
which is a lot more than I can

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.340
say for these three
amazing performers

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.210
that we're going to
get to meet today.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.100
And I'm just going to call them
up right now because we just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.430
need to hear from them.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.930
Ashley Park, from "Mean
Girls," Ari Stachel

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:07.189
from "The Band's Visit," and
Ariana DeBose from "The Donna

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:07.855
Summer Musical."

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:13.095
Hi, guys.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:14.270
ASHLEY PARK: What's up

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.479
ARIANA DEBOSE: Hello.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.520
CHRIS JACKSON: What's up?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.085
This is your life right now.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:20.175
ARI'EL STACHEL: Google.

00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:23.330
CHRIS JACKSON: So
full disclaimer,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.530
I just got to meet Ashley
just a little while ago.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.282
I've done a little
show with Ari--

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.490
you guys might have heard of.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.531
ARI'EL STACHEL: Two Aris.

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:36.314
CHRIS JACKSON: Right, and
Mr. Stachel here, well, we

00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:38.480
go way back, but I'll let
him tell that story to you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.854
as you are.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:40.798
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, no.

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:42.210
What a mystery.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210
CHRIS JACKSON: All three
of these amazing actors

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.994
are nominated for Tonys in the
best featured actor and actress

00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:51.930
category.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.540
And so I guess,
firstly, I just want

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.142
to know, how's your life
changed in the last few weeks?

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:00.160
ASHLEY PARK: Where am I?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.575
I don't know.

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:04.200
Well, we're still
doing 8 shows a week.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.699
I think it's just, it's super,
super busy, it's super crazy,

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:07.850
it's super exciting.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.350
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah, I was going
to say, I'm a heck of a lot

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.960
busier than I was, but
it's really exciting,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.000
for all the good reasons.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.520
I did have that revelation
the other day of like,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.030
no matter what I do from now
on, when they introduce us,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.540
they're like Tony
nominee so-and-so.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.840
That's really cool.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.162
CHRIS JACKSON: First
line of your obituary.

00:02:30.162 --> 00:02:31.620
ARI'EL STACHEL: I
was going to say,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.119
like I haven't really made sense
of how my life has changed,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.090
but I've been in
like the same room

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.770
eating steak with
Denzel Washington

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.482
like five times in
the last three weeks.

00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:41.440
ARIANA DEBOSE: Not bad.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.300
Not bad at all.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.960
ARI'EL STACHEL: It
changed in that way.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.130
ASHLEY PARK: It
really is a whirlwind.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.963
And it's so crazy that
everyone's like, it's

00:02:45.963 --> 00:02:47.495
been building up to this week.

00:02:47.495 --> 00:02:48.370
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.995
Five days.

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:49.829
ASHLEY PARK: I know.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.286
CHRIS JACKSON: I'm going to
ask the other obvious question.

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:53.910
Where were you
when you found out?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.010
What were you doing?

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.760
Who were you with?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.370
ARIANA DEBOSE: I was sitting
on my couch with my cat.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.520
ASHLEY PARK: You have cats?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.210
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah,
I have two cats.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.455
ASHLEY PARK: You too?

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:00.670
You are such a cat person.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.040
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah,
I'm a cat lady.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.475
I'm 70.

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:03.725
ASHLEY PARK: That makes sense.

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.270
ARIANA DEBOSE: We're OK with it.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.470
I was watching the
live stream, just

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.020
like cheering for everyone.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.210
And then I got a text
from Laura Haywood, who

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.260
runs AOL Build, one
of the interviewers,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.436
and she was like, I knew it.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.310
And so I burst into
tears because I was like,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.029
this is a sick joke.

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.820
And then, because
there's a delay, and then

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.360
I saw my face on my laptop
and I burst into tears again

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.610
because I couldn't believe it.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.535
Yeah, so I cried.

00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:30.410
ASHLEY PARK: Now you.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.500
ARI'EL STACHEL: Now me?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.780
We were performing
on the Today Show,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.640
and they wanted to
coincide, I think,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.945
our performance with
the announcements.

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:39.194
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, my god, you
were doing the Today Show

00:03:39.194 --> 00:03:39.770
that morning?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.310
ARI'EL STACHEL: It was awesome.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.662
I was up at like
4:00 AM to show up.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:48.120
And we had to promise to keep
our phones in the green room,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.620
which was the
worst part about it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.911
because we couldn't look at it.

00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:53.580
So my poor publicist,
who is here in the back,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.670
I was like looking at him
as I was performing on this,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.040
on live television,
because I wanted to know.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.460
And so we're freaking out,
and they were actually,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.110
our categories, I
think, come later.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.200
I think the leading
categories are early.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.900
ASHLEY PARK: The last one.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.280
CHRIS JACKSON: The last one.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.120
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah,
we were the last ones,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.780
and so I think at 8:50
is when we performed.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.280
But by that point,
they'd already

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.550
announced that our show had
received seven nominations.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.709
And I was looking back
at him, and he was still

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.637
not giving me anything.

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:23.470
CHRIS JACKSON: Because
he's good at his job.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.011
ARI'EL STACHEL: He's
good at his job.

00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:27.582
But then we finished, and
I think at that point,

00:04:27.582 --> 00:04:29.040
it was like 9:00,
and at that point

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.800
all the nominations came out and
our lead producer came to me,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.850
and he was like, congrats, man.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.391
I was like, yeah,
this is so awesome.

00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:36.570
And he was like, no, you
got an individual one.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.850
And I started crying, man.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.800
I was just weeping.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.550
ASHLEY PARK: You were
still at the Today Show?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.590
ARI'EL STACHEL: I was
still at the Today Show.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.461
ASHLEY PARK: I
want that footage.

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:44.242
Who has that footage?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.658
CHRIS JACKSON:
Millions of people.

00:04:45.658 --> 00:04:47.365
I was blubbering like--

00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:48.990
ARI'EL STACHEL: No,
I was weeping, man,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.340
and then my cast made a mentor,
like Tony Zilu, who also

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.440
got nominated, just
hugged me, and it

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.280
was like the first of many.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.360
And then I cried more.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.380
And then I went in--

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.546
ASHLEY PARK: Let's see if
we can make him cry today.

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:05.410
CHRIS JACKSON: I'm
on it, I'm on it.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.010
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.600
It's so crazy because the Tonys
are the last of the awards.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.030
And there's like a couple of
weeks of just so many things

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.601
being announced up until then.

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.350
And I think by that
point, I was like, you

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.102
know what, for this one, I call
up to my best girlfriends who--

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:20.310
they've known me for a while.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.940
We've all traveled
together-- and I was like,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.020
do you guys want to go
on a walk in Central Park

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.255
at this time, this morning?

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:28.380
And they were like, oh, we
know what this is about.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.460
So we got coffee and juices
and we put our phones away,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.940
and I was like, let me just see
if we can just forget about it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.540
for a second.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.530
And I will genuinely-- no,
listen, because I knew that

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.780
and also we were
going to rehearse

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.894
for the Today Show
that day, our show,

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:46.560
and I knew I was going
to see everybody.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.450
And so I was like,
you know what?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.960
I'll put my phone
away and like, I

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.960
don't want to jinx it either
way, so like if I pull it out

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.210
and there's a bunch of stuff,
then I'll know something

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.709
happened.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.570
So I will honestly
say that I think we

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.950
were talking about face masks.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.870
I hadn't my girlfriends
in like so long

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.550
because we're so busy, right?

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.800
And I genuinely was
pulling out my phone

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.050
to be like, oh, my gosh,
I just found this thing.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.950
And then I open it, and
there's a bazillion things.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.100
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.090
And they're like, what?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.710
Can we look at our phones now?

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.526
But we were in Central
Park, and there's

00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:18.150
no cell service in Central Park,
so then we couldn't figure out

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.720
what was going on.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.960
CHRIS JACKSON: Go
to the great lawn.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.375
There's like the biggest space.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:22.083
That's all right.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.550
We'll will talk about it later.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.210
That's fine.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.876
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah,
and then I just spent

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.690
the rest of the
morning like wandering,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.309
and then that day, like after
the Today Show rehearsal,

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:33.600
we went to go look at our
big billboard in Times Square

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.730
for the first time as a cast.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.224
It was really, really cool.

00:06:37.224 --> 00:06:39.390
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah, those
billboards move quickly,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.336
don't they?

00:06:41.336 --> 00:06:42.710
ASHLEY PARK: Ours
is the biggest.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.780
ARIANA DEBOSE: I'll actually
agree with that statement.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.834
ARI'EL STACHEL: I
perform on low for you

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.000
guys on Saturday Night Live.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.320
I understand.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.607
ASHLEY PARK: I know.

00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:52.942
He's going to cry now.

00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:55.710
CHRIS JACKSON: Now, Ms. DeBose.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.200
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yes, darling.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.910
CHRIS JACKSON: You
have held roles

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.840
in "Hamilton" and
"A Bronx Tale,"

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.970
bringing on the musical
"Motown" and "Pippin."

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.430
You have been a dance machine
for a very, very long time,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.560
and considered one of
the best dancers that

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.419
has stood on a Broadway stage
in the last 10 years, at least.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:17.460
ARIANA DEBOSE: Thank you.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.420
CHRIS JACKSON: How do
you find this transition

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.270
from your work,
that type of work,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.940
to now helping lead a very
large, successful musical?

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.920
ARIANA DEBOSE: I wish I
could say it was seamless.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.830
It's not exactly easy.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.700
I think what is a comfort to
this transition is that I have

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.400
still been able to keep
my love for dance so pure,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.150
and I can infuse it
into what I'm doing now.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.190
No one told me I
didn't have to dance.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.450
So we had this talk
once, and he looked at me

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.650
backstage at "Hamilton" and was
like, no matter what you do,

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.780
you always need to dance.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.790
That's your gift.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.270
So when I decided to
seek larger challenges,

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.470
that was part of the challenge.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:11.980
How do I keep dance a part of
this job, in this line of work?

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.060
And I think it just
makes it harder,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.020
in a beautiful way because you
have to double your stamina.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.035
You take care of your
body differently.

00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:21.500
It's not just your voice.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.425
It's like there are three
different components

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:27.950
to what it is that I do,
in conjunction with leading

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.740
a company.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.550
And I am very fortunate
to be able to have

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.667
a great partner in
LaChanze, and she really

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:35.750
can take the lead on that.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.260
And therefore, my work
is part of how I lead

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.240
and I lead by example.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.320
I might defer to her.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.840
She's much more
eloquent than I am,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.210
and she just has this
beautiful motherly energy.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.520
So I don't have
to try to do that.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.910
I can let her do that.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.050
And we're a great
team in that way.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.510
And then I'm just like
the favorite little sister

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.790
over here who happens
to say a bunch of words,

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.300
dance the little dance steps,
and move the plot along.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:10.230
So it's been wonderful
getting my sea legs

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:15.530
and being someone now who is
a little more recognizable,

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.400
who does have to sit up here
and talk and make sense.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.575
But it's fun.

00:09:23.575 --> 00:09:25.200
ASHLEY PARK: As
someone who's seen you,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.366
I mean, I'm realizing right
now that I saw you bring it on.

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:29.365
I saw you in "Hamilton."

00:09:29.365 --> 00:09:30.720
I saw you in "Bronx Tale."

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.010
We've been friends
for a while, and I

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.027
think that's so beautiful.

00:09:35.027 --> 00:09:37.110
It's so funny to hear you
talk about it so humbly,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.779
in terms of like,
you've been trying

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.320
to make dance a part
of what you keep

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.940
doing because I don't think
there's a lot of people

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.360
who can do what you're doing.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.250
And I think you do
it so beautifully,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.870
and I love that you started
in ensemble because I think

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.590
you're really good with that.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.430
ARIANA DEBOSE: You
know what that is?

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:50.587
ASHLEY PARK: I know.

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:51.780
I think that's why you
are able to be there

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.190
for your cast in that way too.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.730
ARIANA DEBOSE: Thank you.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.960
ASHLEY PARK: Sorry to
cut in, but I just, I'm

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.660
realizing right now
I really love you.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.040
CHRIS JACKSON: That's the
discussion aspect of it.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.560
We're good.

00:10:01.105 --> 00:10:02.730
ARIANA DEBOSE: And
I think that's cool.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.310
Like it does give me a
different perspective

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.620
because I did start
out in the ensemble,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.480
and you relate to your company
differently in that way.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.850
And it's been really nice.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.058
There have been a few moments
where a few of my girls

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:16.965
needed a little
support, like just maybe

00:10:16.965 --> 00:10:19.770
to get their shoes taken care
of, and I was able to be like,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.150
hey guys, let's put my
dress on hold for a second.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.740
And let's go out and
shop new shoes for them.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.750
And that was real nice.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.350
CHRIS JACKSON: So
they don't die.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.183
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah.

00:10:29.183 --> 00:10:31.140
I was like, they're
dancing their face off,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.091
playing women and men.

00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:33.090
I'm like, you know what?

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.230
We should probably get them
some comfortable heels,

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.510
or let's refit this flat shoe.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.200
I'll be fine.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.564
So that's been cool.

00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:42.605
CHRIS JACKSON: Fantastic.

00:10:42.605 --> 00:10:47.070
All right, it says you
auditioned for your role

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:47.850
several times?

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.195
ARI'EL STACHEL: Seven.

00:10:48.195 --> 00:10:49.070
CHRIS JACKSON: Seven.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.033
ARI'EL STACHEL: Seven
times, over nine months.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.836
ARIANA DEBOSE: Oh, that's
a long time to wait.

00:10:53.836 --> 00:10:54.710
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.668
It wasn't just waiting.

00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:58.160
It was like crying in bed, but--

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.306
ASHLEY PARK: Again
with the crying.

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:01.930
CHRIS JACKSON: No,
but all jokes aside.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.013
What was the process like?

00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:05.730
ARI'EL STACHEL: The process,
listen, man, and I'm

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.160
going to go ahead and tell.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.925
This is very significant
for me right now.

00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:11.550
This is probably the
most exciting part

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.200
of this entire month
is learning that I

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.520
was going to talk to you.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.010
I met Chris when I was
17, and I was trying

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.390
to choose college programs.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.570
And one of the programs
that I got into was NYU,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.159
and on that day, I
took a train ride.

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.950
I didn't even know how
to get on the train.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.908
And I got there, and I
got to "In the Heights,"

00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:29.745
the show that I had
admired so much.

00:11:29.745 --> 00:11:31.080
CHRIS JACKSON: We both
had a lot more hair then.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.705
ARI'EL STACHEL: We
had a lot more hair,

00:11:32.705 --> 00:11:34.889
and I remember, I was
at the stage door,

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.930
and I went up to Chris,
and I was like, yo, like,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.200
oh, you mean so much
to me, da da da da.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.930
And he was gracious
enough to actually,

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.670
after signing his autograph,
he said, yo, come here man.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.806
I was like, urh?

00:11:47.806 --> 00:11:48.561
And he--

00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:50.310
CHRIS JACKSON: It
doesn't dark, I promise.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.880
ARI'EL STACHEL: No, and
he brought me backstage,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.050
and this was the first time
I've ever been in New York

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:58.950
on a Broadway stage.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.300
And he looked up, and
he was like, yo, man.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.230
It's just a mezzanine.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.500
Just learn how to
tell the story.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.230
But I'm saying that in some
way to relate to the question

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.910
that you asked, which is
that at that time in my life,

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.640
I was concealing the fact that
I was a Middle Eastern person.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.740
And so I think part of
learning how to tell the story

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.290
was to learn how
to accept myself.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:28.500
And I literally
pretended that I was not

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.220
Middle Eastern for like
a third of my adult life

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.310
because I thought it would be
prohibitive for me as an actor.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.620
And so when this show came
about and I saw this audition,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.850
I was scared of it.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.636
I was scared of what it would
mean to publicly be that

00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:49.260
and what that would mean for me,
how that would limit my career

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.400
prospects.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.740
And so I think that
nine-month span was really

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.830
a personal journey about
removing the distance that I

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.440
had between myself
and what it means

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.490
to be a Middle Eastern man.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.200
And by the final audition, I
let the humanity come first,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.990
and I realized it was
OK to be all of me

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.250
and be Middle Eastern
at the same time.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:15.012
And so it was a really
sort of spiritual process,

00:13:15.012 --> 00:13:16.720
and I'm grateful for
that because it also

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.594
taught me a lot about
resilience and forging--

00:13:19.594 --> 00:13:21.010
ASHLEY PARK: I
got-- joke's on me.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:21.510
I'm crying.

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:26.344
ARI'EL STACHEL:
Forging ahead, man.

00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:28.000
Sorry.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.880
But it's been transformative.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.260
I mean, it was agony.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.860
I mean, you want to do it and
you don't feel like you can,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:45.010
but now, it's this wonderful
sort of hybrid for me of this--

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.010
I'm sitting here with amazing
Tony-nominated actors.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.360
But the show is also
having a social impact,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.575
and so I answered five
questions that you didn't ask.

00:13:56.575 --> 00:14:01.060
CHRIS JACKSON: But also, I
think that the best art evokes--

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.430
it brings out something.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.685
It requires something of you.

00:14:04.685 --> 00:14:06.310
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah,
yeah, I think so.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.726
I think you need
skin in the game.

00:14:07.726 --> 00:14:11.230
Like I don't think I
have-- these girls,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.549
like I can't dance like that.

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:14.590
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.240
Like she's so funny.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.120
Like if she is so
naturally-- like I

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.630
don't feel like I have that, and
so I think to sort of penetrate

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.220
this business, there
needs to be a lot

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.610
of your own skin in the game.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.660
Like it needs to undeniably be
yours because there's literally

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.600
a hundred people who are really,
really good who want your job.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.364
So something needs to
spark in that room.

00:14:33.364 --> 00:14:35.530
ASHLEY PARK: I mean, I've
seen you in your show too.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.850
I mean, I sound
like a super fan.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.308
I've seen everybody
and everything.

00:14:38.308 --> 00:14:41.440
No, but I feel like you
were 100% that character.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.737
That character's 100% you.

00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:43.570
There's no one else.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.620
You own it.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.639
ARI'EL STACHEL: Because
of the skin in the game.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:47.680
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.055
ASHLEY PARK: God,
I love what you

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.897
said about feeling like
you have to hide being--

00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:53.230
Google, thank you for having us.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:54.146
This is like the best.

00:14:54.146 --> 00:14:55.660
It's like really cathartic.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.780
CHRIS JACKSON: Actor
therapy on a Tuesday.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.230
This is what happens when
you get nominated for a Tony,

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.800
and you're doing
eight shows a week.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.840
You are so raw.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.120
Like everything is
just, I love you too!

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.600
You see people from other shows
whose performances you haven't

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.950
seen, but you're all suffering,
and you're all so happy,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.020
and you're all so tired.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.470
And you got nodes
on your chords.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.870
And you haven't talked
to your mama in 15 days.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.510
It just, it's all
of those things.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.450
ASHLEY PARK: But
we're like in jeans,

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.783
and we were just saying, like
we were like, oh, my gosh.

00:15:27.783 --> 00:15:31.187
This is like three ethnic
up and comers in a--

00:15:31.187 --> 00:15:32.020
ARIANA DEBOSE: Rare.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.370
ASHLEY PARK: Rare.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.203
ARIANA DEBOSE: Rare.

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:34.786
Rare to see this
type of diversity.

00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:35.660
You know what I mean?

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.632
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah,
yeah, that's wonderful.

00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:39.111
ASHLEY PARK: It's so cool.

00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:42.320
CHRIS JACKSON: And I'm just
long enough in the tooth

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.250
to have been around when--

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.250
when I graduated
college, the only show

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.400
that I could have been
cast in was "Showboat"

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.530
because there were no
black people on Broadway.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.930
There were no stories that
were inclusive in that regard.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.500
And in the last 20 years,
thankfully, that has just--

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.220
ARIANA DEBOSE: That has changed.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.570
ASHLEY PARK: And you've been
such a huge part of that.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.028
CHRIS JACKSON: It's
still evolving.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.460
It's still finding its way.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.730
But it's really
beautiful to be reminded

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.470
that when you go
through these processes,

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.970
there is a certain amount of
transformation that happens

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.650
and discovery that
happens, and there's

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.630
something about suffering for
nine months with uncertainty,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:29.860
and with the dire
aspect of everything.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.486
Every time you go in, it's
the most important moment

00:16:32.486 --> 00:16:33.985
that you've ever
found in your life,

00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:36.115
found yourself in, except
you found yourself in it.

00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:37.490
ASHLEY PARK: It's
like pregnancy.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.535
Isn't pregnancy like--

00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:39.410
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.650
Pregnancy.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.690
Say, I love my baby, but the
last thing I want to say,

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.779
not to interject, but the
cool thing is actually,

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:48.070
I got the job in this building.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.736
The audition was on
the fourth, I think,

00:16:49.736 --> 00:16:51.110
fourth floor of this building.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.625
ASHLEY PARK: Of this building?

00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:52.150
ARI'EL STACHEL:
Yeah, fifth floor.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.910
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, the
Atlantic Theater Company.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.430
ARI'EL STACHEL: Fifth
floor, that's where it was.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.910
Yeah.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.142
ASHLEY PARK: That's where
you birthed your baby.

00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:57.046
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:16:57.046 --> 00:16:58.862
ASHLEY PARK: The end
of the pregnancy.

00:16:58.862 --> 00:16:59.860
ARI'EL STACHEL:
She's in the back.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.443
It'll be good.

00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:01.370
I'm just kidding.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.390
CHRIS JACKSON: No, Ashley,
just to switch gears

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.819
just a little bit.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.459
You were in the tour
of "Cinderella."

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:10.240
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.739
Yes.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.673
ARIANA DEBOSE: Did I do that?

00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:14.589
CHRIS JACKSON: And now
you're in "Mean Girls."

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.297
ASHLEY PARK: Yes.

00:17:15.297 --> 00:17:16.774
CHRIS JACKSON:
Playing a mean girl?

00:17:16.774 --> 00:17:17.440
ASHLEY PARK: No.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.190
CHRIS JACKSON: No?

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.119
Are you a nice girl?

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:19.540
ASHLEY PARK: Yes.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.039
Yes.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.020
This is my fourth
show on Broadway,

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.554
and it's the first one I've
done originating a role.

00:17:25.554 --> 00:17:26.720
CHRIS JACKSON: How about it?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.727
What was that
experience like for you?

00:17:28.727 --> 00:17:30.310
ASHLEY PARK: It was
great, but it also

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.309
did feel like my other--

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:35.029
I mean, my last two
shows were big revivals,

00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:37.070
and this kind of felt like
a revival in some ways

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.980
just because "Mean
Girls" is so iconic,

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.010
and everybody loves
these characters so much.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.481
And it was Tina Fey
again, so like it

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.230
was the best process
though because I just

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.080
think a show is such
a collaboration,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.850
and when you have
an amazing team,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.694
and a team that is
going to encourage--

00:17:53.694 --> 00:17:55.360
I mean, I feel like
the Gretchen Wieners

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.910
that I have now is the
baby product of truly

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.780
my entire team.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.250
And they are very,
very supportive

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.400
of trying to find what was
honest about the character

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.460
in me, and the comedy of that
character and how I speak

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.460
and how I interpret what that
character is going through.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.100
And so, I mean, she's the best.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.660
I love Gretchen.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.692
I do.

00:18:17.692 --> 00:18:19.400
People at the stage
door are always like,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.233
oh, I love Gretchen.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:24.040
And I was like, I do
too, which is fun.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.630
CHRIS JACKSON: Do you do you
find that because of the cult

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.030
status, if you
will, of the film,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.180
do you feel pressured to hit
certain marks because of it,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.700
or do you just feel
absolutely free

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.967
that you've created, in
essence, a new version of what

00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:42.800
you're working with?

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.390
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.140
I think there are
definitely some markers.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.600
There are some epic
lines that come in.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.740
But we have our little
spin on it for everything.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.960
I mean, the basic things
are, first of all,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.720
you have an aging role on
the marquis of like the three

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.290
plastics.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.220
That's different.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.386
We're singing and we're
dancing, which is completely

00:18:58.386 --> 00:19:01.261
different from the movie.

00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:02.760
And it's a totally
different medium.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.570
And also our show
takes place in 2018,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.980
and is a totally different
book, but it's still

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.880
Tina Fey's voice.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.240
And it feels very relevant.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.150
So yeah.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.191
CHRIS JACKSON: All right.

00:19:12.191 --> 00:19:14.790
I'm going to ask this
question for you guys.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.880
Coolest person you've met
backstage after a show.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.930
Go.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.710
ARIANA DEBOSE:
Like in the show--

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.210
in this one.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.043
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah.

00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:23.240
The other one doesn't count.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.900
The other one was
a little like--

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.340
that other one was just stupid.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.115
ARIANA DEBOSE: Dumb, so dumb.

00:19:30.115 --> 00:19:33.240
ASHLEY PARK: What are
you guys talking about?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.690
CHRIS JACKSON: I should say,
so like the best post-show

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.610
encounter or
conversation, and that

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.810
can be not just with a
celebrity, but with a fan,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.150
whatever.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.000
What would you--

00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:50.590
ARIANA DEBOSE: Two short ones.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.820
Whoopi Goldberg because
she was friends with Donna,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.180
and it was just a moment where
she looked at all three of us

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.810
and was like, Donna was
here in each one of you.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.967
And that meant a lot, number
one, because Whoopi is Whoopi.

00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:10.550
CHRIS JACKSON: As
mama would be, yeah.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.250
Whoopi.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:12.750
And

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.750
ARIANA DEBOSE: Then number
two, just because she

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.110
had a first-hand knowledge
of Donna's sensibility.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.960
And that's what we've always
been after, is the sensibility,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.500
not to impersonate , but
we wanted her essence.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.210
So that felt really
good to know.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.462
And then there was this woman.

00:20:31.462 --> 00:20:32.670
I don't know how old she was.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.560
I would say she was
probably in her 70s,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.910
but she was in a wheelchair.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:40.830
And she waited at the end
of the stage door line.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.260
And it took a minute for
all of us to get down there.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.160
But when I finally
got down there,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.284
I was able to speak to her.

00:20:45.284 --> 00:20:49.620
She literally just took my hand
and cried, and said, thank you.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.420
And that was it.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.370
Like she could speak, like she
was just confined to her chair,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.510
but that moment, just a
pure human connection,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.190
it was just so beautiful
to be reminded that that

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.410
is the reason why we do this.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.710
The theater is good
communion, right?

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.040
It's like, it is
good communion when

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.590
it's in its finest truest form.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.950
And for her that day,
that's what we provided.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.140
And that felt really cool
to know that the disco

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.164
queen was able to do that.

00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:24.877
So yeah.

00:21:24.877 --> 00:21:27.460
CHRIS JACKSON: Now, we already
know you had steak with Denzel.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.510
I'm just saying.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.426
ASHLEY PARK: Does he
know who you are, though?

00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:33.300
CHRIS JACKSON: Just
humble brag, just humble.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.241
ARI'EL STACHEL:
He does, kind of.

00:21:36.241 --> 00:21:37.120
He will.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.930
For me, it's a
similar experience.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.040
I remember we were, I think,
two weeks into previews,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.500
and the stage doors when
fans are waiting outside.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.020
And there's like a very
little opening for Tony

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.000
to get into his car.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.170
I mean, it's pretty
high security.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.200
But this young Palestinian
girl found her way through it,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.920
ran through it into my arms,
with tears in her eyes,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.127
and hugged me, crying.

00:22:06.127 --> 00:22:08.710
And she assumed I spoke Arabic
because I speak it in the show.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:14.530
I don't fluently, but
she just could not

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.290
believe that representation
of her people was on stage.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.710
And that experience
has actually recurred.

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.900
Not everyone is
running past the gates,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.720
but those conversations
are happening over and over

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.790
with kids who are
seeing this new pathway.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:38.220
And sometimes, with
Chris Jackson in mind,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.012
depending on the person, if I
see that they have something

00:22:41.012 --> 00:22:42.970
and I believe that they
really want to do this,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.803
I'll do the exact same
thing because of you,

00:22:44.803 --> 00:22:48.730
and I'll bring them backstage
and say the same thing.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.992
It's just a mezzanine.

00:22:49.992 --> 00:22:51.762
ARIANA DEBOSE:
That's a good line.

00:22:51.762 --> 00:22:52.720
ASHLEY PARK: Copyright.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.450
ARI'EL STACHEL: But
no, I really do that.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.230
And so it's those experiences
when you realize that there's

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.810
a social impact because as a
Broadway actor, Tony nominated,

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.690
I mean, I'm living my
life 24 hours a day.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.260
You know what I mean?

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.250
I'm doing my laundry.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.140
I'm getting fruit
at Whole Foods.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.190
like I'm just living my life.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.250
So when you realize that
there is that impact

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.440
and you actually see it,
those are the moments

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.110
that mean the most to me.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.980
CHRIS JACKSON: And having
a steak with Denzel

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.800
is not a bad lunch.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.190
ARI'EL STACHEL: Not
a bad thing either.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:19.810
CHRIS JACKSON:
It's not a bad lu--

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.994
I wouldn't mind having
a steak dinner--

00:23:22.994 --> 00:23:24.660
ASHLEY PARK: We get
a lot of fun people.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.620
I mean, although, the coolest
part about like the SNL people

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.810
coming is--

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.240
a lot of the
celebrities who come

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.574
are really so proud of Tina too.

00:23:34.574 --> 00:23:36.698
They're so proud of her
and her Broadway and stuff.

00:23:36.698 --> 00:23:39.120
So there's actually like,
yeah, there's a celebrity here,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.130
but they're also like,
thank you for being

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.340
part of our friends thing.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.750
Like they're just so
excited to be there too,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.670
which is like awesome.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.269
And then for me personally,
having like Andre Bishop

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:53.060
and Bart Sher come and
be like, oh, my god,

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.726
we had the best time
with our daughters,

00:23:54.726 --> 00:23:57.150
and we're so proud
of you for that.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.720
And it feels like a different
part of the Broadway family

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.320
that is there, and
that it just reminds

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.470
me of like, it always
every time there's

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.630
like a little Asian
girl at the stage door,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.110
and there's one in particular
who is very little,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.620
and like couldn't even
look over the thing.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.290
I almost like passed
her by, and she

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.750
was like, I never saw myself.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.960
I know what I want to do.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.339
And I was like, aw.

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:26.630
And I was like being little,
and being like, oh my god,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.900
like watching Barney.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.402
I just want to be one
of the Barney kids.

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:33.950
Yeah, is that why we're
singing and dancing?

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:39.949
CHRIS JACKSON: I just want
to be one of the Barney kids.

00:24:39.949 --> 00:24:41.740
ASHLEY PARK: But what
was so crazy and cool

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.030
was like right next
to her was this

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.980
like older, I'm
going to say he was

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.550
a gay white boy, like teenager,
and he was like, girl,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.990
I saw myself in Gretchen.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.260
Like, thank you so much.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.684
And I was like, yeah!

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.725
Let's all take a selfie.

00:24:58.725 --> 00:24:59.970
CHRIS JACKSON: Just
lifting up the people.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.803
ASHLEY PARK: No, those
genuine interactions.

00:25:01.803 --> 00:25:05.160
It's like, oh, my gosh, it's not
about having fans or anything.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.006
It's like, I genuinely
connected with these two

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:09.630
and like, thanks
Gretchen, thanks Tina.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.080
Like that.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.961
CHRIS JACKSON: That's awesome.

00:25:12.961 --> 00:25:14.460
Open up the floor
to some questions.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.090
Anybody have any questions for
these wonderful actors that

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.847
have come here,
and they're awake?

00:25:19.847 --> 00:25:21.180
ARI'EL STACHEL: Oh, there we go.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.430
CHRIS JACKSON: Feeling things.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.820
I have a question
about your inspirations

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.340
for pursuing a life
in the theater.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.610
Is there a particular Broadway
show or a Broadway performer

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.000
that you looked up to, that
helped reinforce your decision

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.350
to pursue this career?

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.560
ARIANA DEBOSE: Oh, wow.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.760
Who's got a good one?

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.170
I feel like I go
first all the time.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.790
But I'm just going to do it
because I know what I'll say.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.250
I want to be Madonna's backup
dancer when I was a kid.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.150
That was my plan.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.040
I was going to go to LA.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.950
And funny, make plans.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.750
That'll teach you otherwise.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.530
So I had done "So You
Think You Can Dance,"

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.840
didn't exactly work
out how I'd planned,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.730
and came to New York on a whim
to audition for some stuff,

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.870
and got a job.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.400
And I met up with Charlotte
Dubois, Tony nominee and dance

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.540
legend.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.720
Decided she would
have lunch with me.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.070
I felt very special.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.750
And she said, just
come to New York.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.090
Come to New York and stay here.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.600
So I did.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:37.940
And as I got to know her, she
truly, within six months time,

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.680
changed my perspective
on everything.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.130
Like I was like, why is anyone
going to take me seriously?

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.710
I'm a little brown girl from
North Carolina who kicks

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.020
real good and that could be it.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.980
You know what I mean?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.340
She was like, no, you
are here for a reason.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.620
And she coached me within
an inch of my life,

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.570
helped me figure out
how to say a sentence

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.750
and get to the end of the line.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.100
She was literally holding
my hand through this.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.980
But if she had not
done that, I don't

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.430
think I would have stayed.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.130
So I owe a lot to
her in that way.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.610
And she's a constant
reminder to just stay open

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:15.720
and to keep saying yes because
I think that's probably

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.730
how I ended up where I am.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.160
Stay open and say yes.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.050
Thanks, Char.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.780
Love you.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.045
How about you, guy?

00:27:26.045 --> 00:27:28.880
ARI'EL STACHEL: You go first.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.860
ASHLEY PARK: I think that, well,
I mean, I grew up in Michigan,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.550
and I had never been to--

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.170
Yeah!

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.820
And I'm realizing
now, like I really

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.190
think that cast albums
were a big thing for me.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.644
Like I remember "Wicked" and
"Thoroughly Modern Millie,"

00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:43.810
and like "Spring Awakening."

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:47.140
And I would just listen to
them and I would imagine.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.940
I think that was my
real access to this.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.080
I mean, my favorite
movie growing up

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.340
was "Sound of Music,"
like Julie Andrews,

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.070
Kelley O'Hara, Sutton Foster.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.140
Like all of those ladies, I
remember listening to them.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.860
I loved Adina and Kristen
on that album too,

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.360
and I watched "Wicked"
like in Chicago,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.840
in Detroit, and all this
stuff, and long story short, I

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.940
had cancer in high school.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.120
And the Make A Wish
Foundation, they grant a wish

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.196
and my wish was to go
watch a Broadway show

00:28:22.196 --> 00:28:23.320
because I hadn't done that.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.730
And I was like, I really
think that theater

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.605
is what I want to do.

00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:27.688
They were really nice, the
Make a Wish Foundation.

00:28:27.688 --> 00:28:29.320
They flew my entire
family out here.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.240
I'd never been to New
York, and they gave me

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.890
a very bad preconceived
notion for how

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.050
New York was because we were
in this fancy hotel with a limo

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.560
everywhere.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.650
And I was like, this
is New York, baby.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:44.500
And we watched not one,
but four, Broadway shows.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.420
The first show I ever
saw was "Lion King,"

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.250
and "Spring Awakening,"
which my dad had gone back

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.260
to work at that point.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.780
Thank god I didn't
watch that with him.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.981
And "Chorus Line,"
which my sister

00:28:57.981 --> 00:28:59.980
fell asleep in, but like
Pulitzer Prize winning.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.740
We love it.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.120
Yeah, so that was like,
and then after that trip,

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.367
and like since I went to
high school in Ann Arbor,

00:29:08.367 --> 00:29:10.450
Michigan-- that's where
the University of Michigan

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:14.299
is that I eventually went to--
and a lot of those students

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:15.840
would come, musical
theater students,

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.740
would come and direct
our high school shows.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.240
And a lot of them,
one of them being

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.760
Etai, who's in
the show with you,

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.530
and like so I had
a lot of mentors

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.310
who were in that program and
who are still in the industry.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.290
And I have them to thank too.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.058
ARI'EL STACHEL: I need
to answer that one?

00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:35.980
It's hard for me.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.410
I mean, we keep talking about
it, but I think in the heights,

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.380
and watching these guys
was really impactful for me

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.050
because that was at a
time where I was just

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.550
sort of figuring
out if this is what

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.800
I wanted to pursue in college.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.490
I think I was 16,
17 at the time.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.920
So seeing them at
least speak sort

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.110
of the cultural language
of our generation

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.260
was really important to me.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.280
It made me feel
like I had a way in.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.594
And I remember just feeling
like when I got to college,

00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:03.760
like I identified with this.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.570
And I could do it in a way
that lots of the other kids

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.350
couldn't because I
was a person of color.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.190
So it was sort of a
mixture of that show,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.180
but the truth is that
it was really just,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.180
I originally wanted to
play basketball as a kid,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.970
and I just, like when
I was 15, I realized

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.710
I just wasn't good enough.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:23.410
There was a classmate I had
who was 6'8" and dunking,

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.040
and I was like,
this is not for me.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.370
ASHLEY PARK: So I'm
going to do theater.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.317
ARI'EL STACHEL: So, I'm
going to do theater.

00:30:30.317 --> 00:30:31.150
Well, you know what?

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.800
I always wanted to like
succeed in like a big way.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.240
And I always knew that as a kid.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.550
And like the one thing that
I had was like, OK, not

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.899
basketball.

00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:43.190
Then I wanted to dance, and
I also wasn't good at that.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.692
But I switched to an arts
high school as a dance major,

00:30:46.692 --> 00:30:48.150
and to answer, the
real person that

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.050
made me want to do it was,
there was this dance teacher who

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.500
was like the basketball
coach I never had and wanted.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.430
He just loved art.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.960
And I wanted to do it so bad.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.460
I went to an arts
high school and we

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.470
would dance for like
five hours at the school,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.970
and I was so obsessed
with it that I

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.630
would go eat pasta at my house,
and then for three hours,

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.130
go to his night classes.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.430
And I remember the way he
talked about just the journey

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.250
of an artist, and he would be
like, man, the amount of people

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.350
who want to be good
dancers is like this, man.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.100
It sounds like hoooooo.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.760
And he was talking about just
not wanting to be mediocre,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.170
just this never ending pursuit
of excellence and of the work.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.060
And that's just excited me,
and so I'm still very much sort

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.050
of in pursuit of that thing.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:33.766
But yeah.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.640
ARIANA DEBOSE: That's
a good pursuit to have.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.250
ASHLEY PARK: You
know what I mean?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.390
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.590
ASHLEY PARK: Being open.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.060
ARIANA DEBOSE:
Everybody say yes.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.340
Let's not be mediocre.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.850
Ain't nobody got time for that.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.850
ARI'EL STACHEL: But you
see also how much people

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.420
love it, and devote their lives
to it and feel alive by it.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.860
ASHLEY PARK: What kind of dance?

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.859
CHRIS JACKSON: Athletic.

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:52.817
Athletic.

00:31:52.817 --> 00:31:54.400
ARI'EL STACHEL: For
a year and a half,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.574
I was taking ballet
and modern then.

00:31:57.574 --> 00:31:58.740
ARIANA DEBOSE: It's freeing.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.345
It's freeing.

00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:00.220
You know what I mean?

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:00.550
ARI'EL STACHEL:
Yeah, it's freeing.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.342
Y'all don't want to
see me do it now, but--

00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:04.091
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah,
that's not necessary.

00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:05.350
We've got another question.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hey,
thanks for coming.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.690
Hey.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.529
How you doing?

00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:11.320
CHRIS JACKSON: Hey.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.706
AUDIENCE: A technology company.

00:32:12.706 --> 00:32:14.580
I was wondering if you
guys could talk about,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.620
in your experience over the
years, how you have seen

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.446
technology change the business,
how it's affected things,

00:32:21.446 --> 00:32:23.320
and also-- it's kind of
a two-part question--

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.290
technology and social
media, and if that change,

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.150
in your opinion, is good or not?

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.440
ARIANA DEBOSE: Oh, wow.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.846
I have so many thoughts.

00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:34.300
ASHLEY PARK: Well, I mean,
technology in terms of like set

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.700
piece, just like very
basic, is like I mean,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.460
like our show is completely
like all screens,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.590
and it's a very warm
feeling, and we're grounded

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.839
and everything, but like
that technology did not

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:44.630
exist 10 years ago.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.242
The capability of
changing sets that fast--

00:32:47.242 --> 00:32:48.700
ARIANA DEBOSE:
Definitely involved.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.420
ASHLEY PARK: --did not exist.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.820
Everything is much faster paced.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.736
ARIANA DEBOSE: Mm-hmm.

00:32:52.736 --> 00:32:53.570
Definitely.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:55.360
I mean, and I was
going to say, I mean,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.690
with social media
and cell phones--

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.009
ASHLEY PARK: Half of our
campaign is all social media.

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:03.550
ARIANA DEBOSE: It's
all social media.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.460
It's moved the industry,
I think, forward

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.620
in a lot of great ways.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.710
We're much more accessible to
lots of different demographics

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.840
than we ever were before,
which is very exciting.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.030
I also think, though, everybody
wants to put their Broadway

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.100
show on InstaStory.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.970
Everybody sitting in
front of the headlights

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.200
likes to tell people
where they are,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.760
and that they are
enjoying the show,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.040
and da da da da, which is
super awesome and very, very

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.140
exciting.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.290
It's also distracting.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.250
So I think with the
excitement that technology

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.030
has allowed us to garner
for what it is that we do,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.762
the caveat to that
is remembering that--

00:33:46.762 --> 00:33:48.595
ASHLEY PARK: Live theater
is a sacred space.

00:33:48.595 --> 00:33:50.011
ARIANA DEBOSE: It
is sacred space.

00:33:50.011 --> 00:33:51.340
And this is also our job.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.010
So if you wouldn't want Sally
Sue coming up in here, putting

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.020
a phone up in your
grill, while you're

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.270
doing whatever it is
that you take pride in,

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:03.180
that you love doing
day to day, perhaps

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.960
you might not do
that at the theater.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.548
CHRIS JACKSON: Patti Lu
Pone, ladies and gentlemen.

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:12.775
ARIANA DEBOSE: She's a balto!

00:34:12.775 --> 00:34:14.400
CHRIS JACKSON: Any
time someone asks me

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.020
that question, I
always say, imagine

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.949
what would have happened if cell
phones and texting and Twitter

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.440
were around when "Rent" hit.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.850
Right?

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.280
And then look at
how "Hamilton" hit.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.170
You see the two--
you know what I mean?

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.810
You go to the Nederlander
Theater in '96,

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:33.760
and there are 500
people waiting in line,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.199
sleeping outside all
night just for 20 seats.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.686
That was before you could
do online lotteries.

00:34:41.686 --> 00:34:43.060
ARI'EL STACHEL:
Or hand for hand.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.530
CHRIS JACKSON: Or hand,
all of those things.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:45.821
ARI'EL STACHEL: All that stuff.

00:34:45.821 --> 00:34:49.806
CHRIS JACKSON: Those things
weren't available 20 years ago.

00:34:49.806 --> 00:34:51.639
10 years ago, they
weren't really available.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.310
I remember sitting
backstage with Lin

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.630
when Facebook was the thing
we were making videos for,

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.640
in the Heights, and it was
still like the craziest thing

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.390
you could imagine.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.010
Like let's do a
video on your phone.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.970
We got 30 seconds.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.650
Let's go.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.870
And he would make it,
and now we look back

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.120
on all of those videos,
but before that, he

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.330
had an Easy Share camera that
he had to like record, and then

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.000
upload onto his laptop,
and then he would post it.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.620
And now, it's just like, that
was really labor intensive.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.490
Why would anybody do that?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:27.370
Except it was another way of
communicating with the world.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:31.104
And so outside of videoing, or--

00:35:31.104 --> 00:35:32.020
ASHLEY PARK: The show.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:37.159
CHRIS JACKSON: --the show, have
you found, in a personal way--

00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:38.700
what have you found
your interactions

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.230
like with the public on
Twitter, or on Facebook,

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.150
or have you pursued it?

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.560
Have you avoided it?

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.615
What's been your
experience with that?

00:35:46.615 --> 00:35:48.490
ASHLEY PARK: I mean, I
don't have a Facebook,

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.110
and I'm not very
active on Twitter,

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.660
but I love Instagram because
my mom was a scrapbooker.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.310
So I grew up with her
like scrapbooking,

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.460
and so like I consider it
like my modern day scrapbook.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.250
Like I love it.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.400
CHRIS JACKSON: Without the
little quirky scissors?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.170
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.887
I mean, you have like all the
little gifts and stuff now.

00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:09.220
So like I love that, and I
love interacting in that way.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.402
I love sharing.

00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:12.610
And also because like,
especially in like a whirlwind

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:13.900
like this past month.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.506
I'm going to wake
up in like a month

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:16.630
and not remember any of it.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.000
ARIANA DEBOSE: That's
your scrapbook.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.850
ASHLEY PARK: And so
I'm going to be like,

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.730
oh, look at that was a fun day.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.850
like that's really
fun, to remember that.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.640
ARI'EL STACHEL: That's
actually stressful.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.215
I find it stressful to have to--

00:36:26.215 --> 00:36:28.690
I find myself like in an event,
and then like five minutes

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:31.630
is devoted to figuring
out which angle to take

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.714
the picture of the cookie.

00:36:32.714 --> 00:36:34.504
ASHLEY PARK: You got
to be natural with it.

00:36:34.504 --> 00:36:35.870
Like it'll come to you, man.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.494
CHRIS JACKSON: Just
take a shot and go.

00:36:37.494 --> 00:36:39.020
ARI'EL STACHEL:
Just take a shot.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.569
ARIANA DEBOSE:
I'm half and half.

00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:41.110
I'm like you.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.450
I love Instagram.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.760
And I think a picture
says a thousand words.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.840
So I do focus on that capture,
less of the video content.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.600
But I love--

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.184
Chris Jackson!

00:36:54.184 --> 00:36:55.266
CHRIS JACKSON: I love you.

00:36:55.266 --> 00:36:56.870
ARIANA DEBOSE: Always
laughing at me.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:02.620
But I love being able to connect
with fans through Instagram.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.170
I like being able to
receive direct messages.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.110
It's a great way for them
to share their stories,

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.560
whereas like I use my social
media platform, share mine.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.210
What I will say is, I do find
myself a little on edge when

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.010
it comes to Twitter,
just because I

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.530
think it allows people to be
really free with their words.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.670
Like people will just
about write anything.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.560
And they will say
anything about you,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.850
to you, which I
think is very brave,

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.580
but then it also gives me pause.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.950
It was like, I don't feel
the need to defend myself.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.270
I'm not in a line of work
that is really defensive,

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:42.070
I don't believe.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:46.570
But I do give myself
pause because some

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.430
of the things that
I do receive may not

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.150
be positive all the time.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.070
CHRIS JACKSON: So you
have to filter it.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:50.986
ARIANA DEBOSE: You do.

00:37:50.986 --> 00:37:52.160
CHRIS JACKSON: Will I open?

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.754
Yeah.

00:37:52.754 --> 00:37:54.670
ASHLEY PARK: I will say,
it's distracting too,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:59.170
with the art sometimes
in terms of ever placing

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:03.060
any value on that kind
of thing where like, oh,

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.580
like I have this many
followers, or this many likes.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.560
Like anytime it gets
into that territory

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.230
of ever putting self worth
or self value in something

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.480
like that, that's something
our show is kind of about.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.950
That's dangerous territory.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.270
But in terms of technology too,
I will say that logistics wise,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.120
it makes things easier,
such as, I forget that

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.380
10 years ago, or 20 years ago,
simple things like the stage

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.859
manager sending out a schedule
for the day, or being like,

00:38:28.859 --> 00:38:30.150
OK, this person is out tonight.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.108
We have to have an
emergency put in at 7:00 PM.

00:38:32.108 --> 00:38:34.230
Like they would have to
either individually call

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:38.051
people or whatever, like
have a paper up rather

00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:39.300
than just e-mailing everybody.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.510
So like in those ways, it
makes the logistics of Broadway

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.280
a lot easier and
more accessible.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.040
ARIANA DEBOSE: And
more efficient.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:45.570
ASHLEY PARK: And more efficient.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.568
ARIANA DEBOSE: It's
way more efficient.

00:38:47.568 --> 00:38:49.026
CHRIS JACKSON: You
have a question?

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:50.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.660
I just want to make a comment.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.970
I'm really excited to go
see "Mean Girls" tomorrow

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:55.280
with the Alumni Association.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.030
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, my
god, is that tomorrow?

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.530
OK.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.330
I mean, yeah, no.

00:39:03.265 --> 00:39:07.920
AUDIENCE: But besides that's,
the industry that you're in

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.340
is incredibly competitive.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.770
And now you are
all Tony nominees.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:22.270
And so what has it been
throughout your career,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:26.020
like after school and after
training and everything, what

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.840
kept you going and what
kept you persevering

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.860
to get to this point?

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.360
ASHLEY PARK: Well,
I think something

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.050
that I learned in school,
like my favorite motto is

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.790
that you can't move forward if
you're looking side to side.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.690
And I think that
the notion of, like

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.530
you have to realize very quickly
that everyone's path is so

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.930
vastly different and so unique.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.640
And so as soon as
you're just focused

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.610
on finding what feels
honest and true to yourself,

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.419
like no matter what you
do, then you never--

00:39:55.419 --> 00:39:55.960
I don't know.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.630
Like of course, our industry,
it's all rejection too,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.625
but there's a lot of joy and as
soon as we lift each other up

00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:04.000
and we support
each other, and we

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.083
support each other's
successes, and it never feels

00:40:06.083 --> 00:40:07.969
like a failure to anybody.

00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:09.010
CHRIS JACKSON: Community.

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:10.450
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah, totally.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.300
That is a great part about
being a part of the Broadway

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.340
industry, this
particular facet of it,

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.260
is we do function very
much like a community.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.680
And so when one
of us is down, we

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.190
do really rally
around each other.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.000
So I do a lot of yoga.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.876
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yoga.

00:40:28.876 --> 00:40:30.166
ARIANA DEBOSE: Center yourself.

00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:32.170
Keep your feet on the
ground as much as you can,

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.753
very much what you
were talking about.

00:40:33.753 --> 00:40:38.574
Like find your smaller community
within a larger community.

00:40:38.574 --> 00:40:40.740
CHRIS JACKSON: I've always
felt too, if you do more,

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.750
you do one show
that runs, you meet

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.292
everybody's friend,
everyone's significant other,

00:40:46.292 --> 00:40:47.960
and their parents.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.590
And then from the
time that you do

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.466
that one show to the
next show that comes up,

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:54.256
there's usually like
four or five readings.

00:40:54.256 --> 00:40:55.490
So you end up just sort of--

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.110
ASHLEY PARK: It's
truly a network.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.150
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah, it really
becomes that very quickly.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.750
ARI'EL STACHEL: But I think the
thing that sort of sustains me

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.124
through the rejection, which
I've had, I'm sure all of us

00:41:04.124 --> 00:41:06.340
have had plenty of,
is that I really think

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.270
it's really an important thing.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.820
Like I come from a family that
fights for social justice.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.860
My mom does work in
Africa in clinics,

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.900
making sure that
women can give birth

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.550
in a more healthy way
and more safe way.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.110
And so as long as I'm
remembering from a larger

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.110
global perspective that
I'm after that larger

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:34.210
social mission, it dilutes
the rejection a little bit.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:40.000
And speaking of, like we're
doing something important,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.710
but like the other
day, I think it

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.543
was like five days after
my Tony nomination,

00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:45.130
and I was biking
through Chinatown.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.770
And there was a guy with
like a stick on his back

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.950
with like 500 bottles in
one bag and 500 bottles

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:51.700
in the other bag.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.350
He doesn't care about
the Tony awards.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.030
You know what I mean?

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:58.480
So I think that that
keeps it in perspective.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.667
But when you do it,
hopefully it helps people.

00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:03.250
And I think both of these women
were saying, and Chris saying,

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.010
like when you help people, when
you're creating more equity,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.790
and when you're inspiring
people, that's what it's for.

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.680
And again, so I
think that dilutes

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.510
the sting of a
rejection because you

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.470
have to have a larger
perspective about what

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.970
we're doing.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:17.710
ASHLEY PARK: And also, we
have to really love it.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.600
Like you have to
really, really love it.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.100
Whenever someone
asks that question,

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.450
I'm like, as long as you like--

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.540
I think in our blood and
sweat, like in our bones,

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.850
we really love doing theater.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:31.180
And you have to love it to
do it eight times a week.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.820
It's really, really hard on
our bodies, on our minds,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.550
on our souls.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.970
But as long as we're
surrounded by good people,

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.220
and we're really enjoying
it-- like as soon as I don't

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.847
enjoy it anymore, like, bye.

00:42:41.847 --> 00:42:42.680
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.810
No, and I think one of the
greatest pieces of advice I

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.120
ever got was from Judith Light.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.530
And this was early on.

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:54.370
I think I was still doing
"Bring It On," and she said,

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.400
you have to live
a life of service.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.980
Like theater arts is a
service business, in a way.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.390
So if you are
bringing your talents

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:09.300
to the table in a way that can
be of service to someone else,

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.200
and you lead in that
direction, then you

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.690
will always be on your path.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.270
It's like, heart
forward in that way.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:20.460
And that's really helped
me because I pride myself

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.720
on being a creator.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.710
I love to create.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.570
Sometimes there's
not a space for that.

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:27.450
So then you have to be willing
to go create your own space,

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:28.887
but that's where we are.

00:43:28.887 --> 00:43:30.470
CHRIS JACKSON: That's
what artists do.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.053
ARIANA DEBOSE: That's
what artists do.

00:43:32.053 --> 00:43:32.766
So it's cool.

00:43:32.766 --> 00:43:34.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you all
for being here today.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.830
You guys are all so inspiring,
and I definitely found myself

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:38.160
tearing up a few times today.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.890
So but I have a
lighter question.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.960
What is your favorite
Schmackary's cookie flavor?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.330
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, my gosh.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.380
Why?

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.280
Are you going to send them?

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:48.780
What?

00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:52.841
No sin salad.

00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:55.340
ARI'EL STACHEL: Are these the
ones with the frosting on top?

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:55.590
ASHLEY PARK: Funfetti.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.365
ARIANA DEBOSE: Funfetti.

00:43:56.365 --> 00:43:57.300
ARI'EL STACHEL: Is
that what it is?

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.200
ASHLEY PARK: With
the rainbow frosting.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.991
ARI'EL STACHEL: Anything
with frosting is--

00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:01.010
They all have frosting.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.760
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.234
I mean, the Funfetti
is like crack.

00:44:03.234 --> 00:44:04.400
Are we allowed to say crack?

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.183
I mean, yeah.

00:44:06.183 --> 00:44:06.682
It is.

00:44:06.682 --> 00:44:09.040
ARIANA DEBOSE: Their gluten-free
cookie's bangin' too.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.420
ASHLEY PARK: Yeah, the corn one?

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.045
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah,
it's really great.

00:44:12.045 --> 00:44:14.120
ASHLEY PARK: The corn one,
and the macho one too.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.860
ARI'EL STACHEL: Yeah, they
transcribe it as crack.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.010
I was wondering if they
were going to censor it.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.222
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, they're
writing what we said.

00:44:23.222 --> 00:44:24.472
CHRIS JACKSON: That's forever.

00:44:24.472 --> 00:44:26.170
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, it is forever.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.144
The macho one too,
she's describing it.

00:44:28.144 --> 00:44:28.810
Well, OK, it is.

00:44:34.556 --> 00:44:37.322
Oh, no, I'm distracted.

00:44:37.322 --> 00:44:39.780
CHRIS JACKSON: You can only
eat Schmackary's-- if you're an

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.030
actor, you can only eat
Schmackary's when you're doing

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.090
eight shows a week.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:43.740
ARIANA DEBOSE: That's so true.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.400
CHRIS JACKSON: Because
otherwise, it makes you--

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.910
ASHLEY PARK: In "Mean Girls," we
get like the packages of them,

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:48.780
and so we love one.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.380
Like our doorman will be
like, so-and-so, there's

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.880
a Schmackary's delivery,
and we all run downstairs.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.700
CHRIS JACKSON: You
get to the green room

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.370
and there's only a card left.

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.350
All the cookies are gone.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:03.160
AUDIENCE: I actually brought
some Schmackary's for you all.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.010
ARIANA DEBOSE: Oh,
wait, what kind?

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.528
CHRIS JACKSON: Favorite
guest of the day.

00:45:08.528 --> 00:45:09.694
ASHLEY PARK: Yay, thank you.

00:45:09.694 --> 00:45:11.590
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah, I want
to eat the Funfetti kind.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:12.220
ASHLEY PARK: Oh, my god.

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:12.652
Open 'em

00:45:12.652 --> 00:45:13.084
CHRIS JACKSON: Eat 'em up, guys.

00:45:13.084 --> 00:45:13.829
Eat 'em up.

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:14.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:15.510
ARIANA DEBOSE: That
was so sweet of you.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.343
CHRIS JACKSON: Do you
have Schmackary's too?

00:45:17.343 --> 00:45:18.720
OK, enjoy your seat.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.100
I'm sorry.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.600
They're going to
look through those.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.340
Ask the question.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.860
I'll make sure they get it.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.860
AUDIENCE: I wanted to say to
you first, I'm really excited,

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.960
ARI'EL STACHEL: Thank
you, love, thank you.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.745
ARI'EL STACHEL: God bless you.

00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:29.245
Thank you.

00:45:29.245 --> 00:45:31.500
AUDIENCE: But
also, I was looking

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.600
through all your
Instagram stories earlier

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.250
and you guys are very busy.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.320
Like you did a
two-mile run before you

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.810
came, which is phenomenal.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:39.880
CHRIS JACKSON: Which one?

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.715
AUDIENCE: You do?

00:45:40.715 --> 00:45:45.105
CHRIS JACKSON: It's
six mile, yeah.

00:45:45.105 --> 00:45:48.034
ASHLEY PARK: Shut up
and eat your cookie.

00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:50.550
ARIANA DEBOSE: Eat your cookie.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.120
AUDIENCE: My question is,
how do you guys manage time

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.510
doing like eight shows
a week, and then trying

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.529
to have like a social life?

00:45:57.529 --> 00:45:59.320
ASHLEY PARK: Well, I
did an eight-mile run,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.660
and I decided I didn't need
to put it on social media.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.430
So you should all know that.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.180
ARI'EL STACHEL: I think
it ebbs and flows.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.020
I think there are times
when it really accelerates,

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.482
and social life
takes a dip and you

00:46:13.482 --> 00:46:15.190
got to do something
early in the morning.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.015
And then other
times, it doesn't.

00:46:17.015 --> 00:46:17.890
You know what I mean.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.090
Like when we're
leading up to opening,

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.131
there's just so much stuff,
you can't see anyone.

00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:22.810
So I think that's
built into what we do,

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:25.665
that there's times
where it ebbs and flows.

00:46:25.665 --> 00:46:27.790
ASHLEY PARK: I like to
trick my body into thinking,

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.040
and this is a problem
of mine, like not

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.240
being able to say no
to stuff, but like,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.900
I like to trick my mind
into thinking like,

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.680
OK, if I'm planning
all this stuff,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.930
I'm saying yes to Brian Behrs.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.430
I'm saying yes to I'm going to
throw myself a birthday party

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.957
tomorrow, even though it's
Tony's week, because whatever.

00:46:45.957 --> 00:46:47.540
If I see everybody
that I want to see,

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.754
then my body's
like, OK, you're not

00:46:49.754 --> 00:46:50.920
going to shut down just yet.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.860
Like you can't be sick because
you're doing all this stuff.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.450
That's not a healthy way
sometimes to go about it.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.390
But it makes it more fun.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.835
I don't know.

00:46:59.835 --> 00:47:00.960
ARIANA DEBOSE: No, totally.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.850
I mean, I sort of live like
a hermit, a little bit.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:07.540
Like the stamina that I
have to maintain is a lot,

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.352
but I don't necessarily have
the energy to do the six miles.

00:47:10.352 --> 00:47:12.310
ARI'EL STACHEL: Because
you dance in your show.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.400
ARIANA DEBOSE: I do,
so my show kind of

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.230
keeps me going in a way.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.050
I will say, that's been a
really nice through line

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.530
about all the extra that comes
with this amazing opportunity.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.060
I can rely on my show.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.920
ASHLEY PARK: Show,
it's a safe place.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.045
ARIANA DEBOSE: I always
have my show to go back to.

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.620
And that's really nice.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.350
But I don't see anyone.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:34.401
I'm at home with my two cats
pretty much all the time.

00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:34.900
It's great.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.120
ASHLEY PARK: That's great.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.640
I'm a lot more
social on this show

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.490
than I have been with like, like
I permitted for other shows.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.850
So because "Mean Girls" is
also like a party on stage

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:43.950
every night.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.366
CHRIS JACKSON:
Have you also found

00:47:45.366 --> 00:47:47.770
that the more physically
demanding the show

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:51.410
is, that is what ends up
regulating your outside life?

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.620
ASHLEY PARK: Absolutely, yes.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.410
CHRIS JACKSON: Like if you've
got to go home and sleep.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.260
I never went out when
we did "Hamilton."

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.480
I always went home
because I had to do the--

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.063
ASHLEY PARK: Is that
the show you did?

00:47:59.063 --> 00:48:00.080
CHRIS JACKSON: Yeah.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.480
But because I had to get up with
my kids every morning at 7:30

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.470
when everybody else was
sleeping until noon.

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.588
So you know what I mean?

00:48:07.588 --> 00:48:09.550
You end up making choices
and it dictates how

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.000
you navigate through the world.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.970
ASHLEY PARK: I don't know
how you parents do it too.

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:13.990
CHRIS JACKSON: I
don't know either.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.890
ARIANA DEBOSE: That's a thing.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:15.940
CHRIS JACKSON: Don't have kids.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.340
ASHLEY PARK: I think that's
what we're going for right now

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.890
because we know that when
have families one day,

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:20.350
maybe it'd be harder.

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.349
ARIANA DEBOSE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:23.440
One day, there will come
a moment where I'm like,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.898
I'm going to take
a break because I

00:48:24.898 --> 00:48:28.240
need to go have what I consider
to be a real life for a minute.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.380
ASHLEY PARK: Is no one
else eating a cookie?

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.249
ARI'EL STACHEL: I'm having some.

00:48:32.249 --> 00:48:33.790
ARIANA DEBOSE: So
you only live once,

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.830
and you're only a
first-time nominee once.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:38.350
So we take advantage
of everything.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.114
I can't believe--

00:48:39.114 --> 00:48:40.030
CHRIS JACKSON: Listen.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.420
10 second answers, OK,
because I got to read a blurb.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.650
What's Monday morning going
to be like for you guys?

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.890
ASHLEY PARK: What's Monday?

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:48.640
ARIANA DEBOSE: I'm sleeping in.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.910
CHRIS JACKSON: OK,
you're going to sleep in?

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:51.120
ARIANA DEBOSE: Yeah.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.819
ARI'EL STACHEL: I will
still be partying.

00:48:53.819 --> 00:48:54.860
Don't I have until seven?

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.570
Isn't that the thing?

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:56.930
CHRIS JACKSON: Are you dark on--

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:57.880
ARI'EL STACHEL: We're
dark on Mondays.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.379
CHRIS JACKSON: Oh,
then you're good.

00:48:59.379 --> 00:49:00.430
ASHLEY PARK: Me too.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:01.124
I don't know.

00:49:01.124 --> 00:49:02.290
ARI'EL STACHEL: You will be.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:04.289
ASHLEY PARK: I mean, I
will look at my calendar.

00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:05.300
I don't know.

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.450
ARIANA DEBOSE: I
do know I'm hosting

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:12.004
a gala for Live Out Loud, which
is an LGBT youth organization.

00:49:12.004 --> 00:49:13.170
I'm very excited about that.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:15.660
It is the night
after the Tonys, so--

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.410
ARI'EL STACHEL: Sleep
in and then you'll--

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.030
ARIANA DEBOSE: Sleep
in and pray for me.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.196
Send me your best thoughts,
and maybe more Schmacks.

00:49:21.196 --> 00:49:21.696
Thanks.

00:49:21.696 --> 00:49:23.612
CHRIS JACKSON: Well,
first of all, can we just

00:49:23.612 --> 00:49:24.677
thank this amazing panel?

00:49:30.062 --> 00:49:32.270
And here's what you need to
know about Sunday, if you

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.061
don't already know.

00:49:33.061 --> 00:49:34.540
The 72nd annual Tony awards.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.140
The previous Tony
award nominees,

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.280
Sarah Bareilles and Josh Groban
will host the awards show,

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.680
live from the historic
Radio City Music

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.040
Hall in New York City,
Sunday, June 10, 2018,

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.450
from 8:00 to 11:00 eastern
time delayed and Pacific time

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:50.500
on CBS.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.631
The Tony awards were first held
in 1947 at the Waldorf Astoria

00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:55.255
grand ballroom.

00:49:55.255 --> 00:49:57.430
There you go, right?

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.070
And the ceremony is presented
by Tony Award Productions which

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.810
is a joint venture of
the Broadway League

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:05.350
and the American theater
wing which founded the Tonys.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.680
And on behalf of these
amazing performers and myself,

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.339
thank you so much for coming
and spending time with us today.

00:50:12.339 --> 00:50:16.110
And good luck on Sunday.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:16.869
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:16.869 --> 00:50:17.910
ARIANA DEBOSE: Thank you.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:19.110
ARI'EL STACHEL: Thank you.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.060
[APPLAUSE]
