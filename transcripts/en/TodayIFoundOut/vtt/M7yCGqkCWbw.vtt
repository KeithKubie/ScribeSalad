00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.090
Beginning in 1987, under several different
names including The Justified Ancients of

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.770
Mu Mu and The Timelords, Drummond and Cauty
produced a number of hit club music singles,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710
including “Doctorin’ the Tardis.”

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.830
By 1991, as The KLF (Kopyright Liberation
Front), the two were one of Britain’s best-selling

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.019
music acts.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.841
Before retiring in 1992, the duo released
a blueprint for producing a hit single, The

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:40.860
Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy
Way) in 1988, and their guidance also provides

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.549
insight into the mindset of the artists:

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:51.750
Firstly, you must be skint [broke] and on
the dole [state benefits].

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.030
Anybody with a proper job or tied up with
full time education will not have the time

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.370
to devote to see it through . . . If you are
already a musician stop playing your instrument.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.189
Even better, sell the junk . . . .”

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:07.690
Apparently the advice was good, since subsequent
bands, including Edelweiss, The Pipettes and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.619
the Klaxons, all enjoyed success after reading
the book.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.619
Nailed to the Wall

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.150
Although they were no longer recording, the
two continued to work together on projects.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.560
By August 1994, they had renamed themselves
the K Foundation and created “Nailed to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.960
the Wall,” which was essentially to be £1
million physically nailed to a pine frame.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.210
Dissatisfied with the reception (or lack thereof)
“Nailed to the Wall” received, Drummond

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.329
and Cauty devised a new plan.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.100
After being rejected by the Tate Gallery in
Liverpool, Cauty asked, “Why don’t we

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
just burn it?”

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.630
A question to which Drummond, apparently,
had no better reply than “sure.”

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.630
Burning a Million Quid

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.070
Preferring a small group, Cauty and Drummond
made their way to the relatively isolated

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.120
island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides with
reporter Jim Reid and filmmaker Gimpo (aka

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.620
Alan Goodrick), on August 22, 1994.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.060
Before leaving London, the group had to get
the £1 million.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.780
Since you can’t just withdraw it from an
ATM and no bank keeps that much handy in small

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.509
bills, Drummond and Cauty had hired a security
company, named Ratedale, to arrange the money.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
Driving to an industrial area near Gatwick
airport, Cauty and Drummond entered a warehouse

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.470
and come out a few minutes later with two
security guards carrying suitcases.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.220
The troop then drove south to the Redhill
Aerodrome where they caught a plane to the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.220
islands.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.069
Staying in a hotel in Jura, the party went
to check on the burn site earlier in the evening,

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.409
an old boathouse Drummond and Cauty had previously
used to burn a wicker man on midsummer’s

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.739
day 1991.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.299
After returning to the hotel and intending
to going to bed, shortly after midnight on

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.739
August 23, 1994, Cauty and Drummond changed
their minds and the group returned to the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.840
boathouse:

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.219
Gimpo drags a piece of scaffolding [into the
boathouse with] two triangular bits of cloth

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.219
attached near the top of the pole . . . . To
these Gimpo adds two survival flares . . . . Below

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.459
the two triangular cloths Cauty is tying a
large piece of aluminum . . . survival blanket.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.129
. . . The pole is hoisted up to the [wooden]
drum which is laid on its side and the lights

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.219
and flags flutter and blink over the stormy
night.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.269
Inside the boathouse Drummond is tying the
two bags on to the ropes.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.059
. . . The bags are untied and opened . . . . Cauty
hands [a bundle of money] to Drummond and

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.599
. . . lights them both . . . . Drummond is
standing to the left of the fireplace throwing

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.900
fresh bundles in, Cauty is to the right . . . . After
five minutes their actions become mechanical,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.900
almost like it is . . . coal that they are
fueling the fire with.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.930
According to Reid, all the money was destroyed
after about two hours.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.930
The Aftermath

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.849
Although Cauty had attempted to destroy all
photographic and video evidence of the burning,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.400
Gimpo retained a copy and produced the film
Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.230
which was taken on a screening tour the next
year.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.529
Friends later reported that Drummond and Cauty
were “haunted” by the burning.

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:39.400
Although in 2000 Drummond claimed he did not
rue burning the money, by 2004 he noted: “Of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.090
course I regret it – who wouldn’t!

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.559
My children especially regret it, but I don’t
regret it all the time.”

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:47.609
Why?

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.819
Early on, Drummond told Reid that they had
nothing better to do with the cash and “needed

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.860
to express something about money and we wanted
to push it through art.”

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.189
In 2000, Drummond said that the act “wasn’t
about burning all the money . . . [or] cleansing

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.189
anyone’s soul.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.859
. . . I’m trying to make sense of something
. . . . I don’t know what it is.

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.319
. . . What I will say is that I’ve never
seen it as a destructive thing.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.780
It wasn’t to destroy the money.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.359
It was to watch it burn.”

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.819
In 2004, Drummond elaborated: “After a while,
we realized that whatever answer we came up

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.420
with would not be good enough . . . . It’s
for other people to explore.”
