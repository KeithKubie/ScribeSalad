00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.702
My opponent tonight
is outgoing president

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.637
of Planned Parenthood,
Cecile Richards.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.006
-Her new memoir...
-(cheers and applause)

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.808
Her brand-new memoir is called

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.010
 Making Trouble:
 Standing Up, Speaking Out,

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:13.279
 and Finding the Courage
 to Lead.

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.181
Guess what?
You don't need courage to lead.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.083
Just ask Paul Ryan.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.718
Cecile Richards, everybody.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.087
-Hey. Good to see you, Jordan.
-Cecile, welcome.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.955
-Good to see you. Yeah.
-Good to see you.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.424
So, Cecile,

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.060
today is officially
your last day as president

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.295
of Planned Parenthood
after 12 years.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:30.763
12 years, that's right.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.533
Did you find Jesus?

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.235
If so, welcome to the flock.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.238
Uh, I've been so honored to do
this job for 12 years.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.873 line:0%
Planned Parenthood
is actually one

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.708 line:0%
of the most popular
organizations in the country,

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.343 line:0%
even according to Fox News.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.412
Uh, uh, in fact, um...

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.414
(cheers and applause)

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:50.783
And, uh, one in five women
in this country

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.318
have been to us for health care.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.786
And I'm so proud
of the work we've done,

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.788
and I'm ready to make room

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.690
for somebody else to lead
the organization now.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.526
Now, you claim
that Planned Parenthood

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.262
-is not in the federal budget.
-That's exactly correct.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.331
But then why am I so mad

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.968
about the federal budget funding

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.937
Planned Parenthood
and abortions?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.207 line:0%
Yeah, so, I don't know why
you're mad, but, uh...

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.376 line:0%
I need an answer.
I'm-I'm furious.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.245
So Planned Parenthood operates

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.180
like all other health care
providers in the country.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:23.382
We get reimbursed
for preventive services

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:27.587
like birth control, which
is very popular in America.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.423
We do pap smears,
we do breast exams,

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.792
and all of that is reimbursed
just like hospitals.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.061
Federal funding does not pay
for abortion,

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.829
except in very limited
circumstances.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.364
So we operate
like everyone else.

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.334
Now I heard it is paid for
by the federal--

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.237
And my-my uncle sells-- sends
out this, uh, this tweet,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.038
and he also has an e-mail

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.608
-with a bunch of information
and pictures on it. -Right.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.344
-And that's been going around
for years. -Right.

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.247
Well, in fact, he's wrong.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.250 line:0%
And so is a lot of congress,
and that's why, actually,

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.452 line:0%
there's been such an outpouring
of support around the country,

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.421 line:0%
especially among women,
when this president

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:05.658 line:0%
and this congress tried to,
you know, defund, as they said,

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.594 line:0%
or prevent women from coming
to Planned Parenthood.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.796
We were able to beat back
the efforts

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.899
to both defund
Planned Parenthood

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.734
and repeal Obamacare.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.569
And Planned Parenthood's doors
are still open

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.304
all across the United States
of America.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.073
Now, you had a meeting
with, uh, "Javanka,"

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:22.975
Jared and Ivanka, in 2017.

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.144
-That's correct. -In this book,
you talk a little bit about it,

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.280
that they made you
a very good offer--

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.016
you and Planned Parenthood--
What happened?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.919 line:0%
Well, so Ivanka Trump
had said she wanted to meet

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.754 line:0%
to talk about
Planned Parenthood,

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.790 line:0%
because her father had said he
was going to defund us again.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.126
And I thought, well,
if there's any chance

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.162
to make my case, uh, I,
you know, wanted to do that.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.630
I did make my husband
come with me,

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.666
so that I have a witness.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.036
But actually, really they,

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.405
they didn't want to talk too
much about Planned Parenthood.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.407
Pretty much Jared Kushner said

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.342
if we would quit
providing access

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.045
to safe and legal abortion,
which we will not,

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:02.181
then he would actually
get more federal funding

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.150
for Planned Parenthood.
And I just said,

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.952
"Look, we're not gonna trade off
women's rights

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.820
in this country for money."

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.755
That's just not who we are.

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:11.724
(cheers and applause)

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.295
That sounds like a deal.

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:17.930
You got to give a little
to take a little.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:19.599
Well, we're not making deals

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.334
about women's health
and women's rights.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.638
And actually,
Ivanka did say, she said,

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:28.307 line:0%
"Well, you have to understand
my father's pro-life."

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.109 line:0%
I said, "Well, he can have
his own opinion,

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.811 line:0%
but he can't take away
the rights of millions

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.412 line:0%
of American women that make
their own decisions

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.114 line:0%
about their pregnancy.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:37.550
-And, uh, and also...
-(cheers and applause)

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.253
I mean, I s-- you know, I...
(stammers)

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.054
How can he say he's pro-life

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:44.423
when he's trying
to deport dreamers,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.525
take away health care
from millions of people

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.661
in this country
,and maternity benefits,

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.763
all of the things that this
administration is trying to do?

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.865
So I-I just feel
like he really needs

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.667
to rethink what his values are.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.869
Well, he's very pro-his life.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.472
Yeah. (laughs)
That may be it.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:02.341
You've said that if members of
congress could get pregnant,

00:04:02.374 --> 00:04:04.644
a lot of issues would be solved.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.178
-Don't you think?
-Well, but I...

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:07.546
I have an issue with that.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.216
How are old white men
over the age of 50

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.019
-going to get pregnant?
-Exactly. Exactly.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:14.854
It doesn't make any sense,
like...

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.089
Yes, no, I think
that's exactly right.

00:04:17.122 --> 00:04:19.358
In fact, I remember
when one of the senators said

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.827
that he thought
we shouldn't even be covering

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.530
maternity benefits for women

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.732
because he was never
going to need them.

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.234
So, I guess, apparently,

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.569
he was past
his childbearing years.

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:32.972
And, uh... But thank--

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.707
this is why we need more women
in office.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.542
Debbie Stabenow,
the senator from Michigan,

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:37.877
said, "Well,
I bet your mother did,"

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.712
and actually, we were able
to get maternity benefits

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:40.980
for millions of women.

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:43.049
But this administration
is trying to take them away.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.351
Are you just
inciting violence here?

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.986
 Make Trouble. 
What are you getting at?

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.588
-I think it's important. I-I...
-Just look at this pi...

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:52.358
-This feels like just an antifa
handbook. -It's getting your...

00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.859
-All of this. -It's getting
you agitated right there.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:56.529
-It's just... It's so angry.
-(laughs)

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.297
It's, uh... You know,
right after the election,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.433
every day it seemed like
someone stopped me on the street

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.336
and said, "What can I do?
I need to do something more."

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.770
And I decided instead of talking

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.472
to every single person
on the subway--

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.908
-as some people try to do...
-Don't do that.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:10.142
-Trust me, yeah.
-Yeah, I'm not gonna do that--

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:11.610
that I would put it
in a book instead.

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.979
And I hope
it's kind of a call to action

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:15.414
and a little bit of a memoir.

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:17.850
And what I have seen
around the country

00:05:17.883 --> 00:05:20.086
is that women
are doing everything.

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.554
They're, you know,
they're marching,

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:23.756
they're going
to town hall meetings,

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.057
they're calling
their members of Congress.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.392
But what we've got
to really make sure

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.027
is that this November
they're going to vote,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.262
'cause that's how we're gonna
change the direction of America.

00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:32.231
(cheering and applause)

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.235
All those women out there,

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:39.038
I hear voting in December
is much cooler.

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.706
Tell me something
I already know.

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:43.075
Well, I think it's maybe just
something you need to know

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:44.677
is that Planned Parenthood

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.846
actually now has
twice the membership

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.914
of the National Rifle
Association.

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.650
-(cheering and applause)
-And so, um, I just...

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:54.353
Birth control and Planned
Parenthood are really popular,

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.288
so maybe you should switch
your allegiances.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.257
-That's my idea.
-Those numbers can't be right.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.692
-It's absolutely right.
-They can't be right.

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.627
-It's absolutely true. -I hope
those numbers aren't right.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.995
They're right. They're correct.

00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:04.964
Her new memoir is called
 Making Trouble.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.733
Cecile Richards.
The fight continues.
