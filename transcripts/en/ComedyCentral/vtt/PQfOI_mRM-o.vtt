00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:05.339
Now, as we all know,
gravity goes down, yes?

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.007
But if we all focus,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.711
sometimes gravity can make
things go up.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:15.549
Now, does anyone have
a gum wrapper I could borrow?

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.751
Oh, I do.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:18.952
Wonderful.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.988
Thank you.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.356
He is so hot.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.892
Yeah, I'm not mad
at that eyeliner either.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.195
As we all can see, this gum
wrapper is a rectangle, yes?

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.831
Now, if I fold it
one more time,

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.100
you see
it turns into a square.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.502
Now, here's the weird part.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.204
If I were
to unwrap this,

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:42.342
the wrapper is right back
to how it was.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.511
Oh, my God.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.079
Are these even tricks?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.781
I'd like to use
a lovely assistant.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.016
Does anybody...?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.918
Shut up!

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:52.753
I have the "lovely"
part taken care of.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.087
Oh, no.

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:55.589
Too hard?
Yeah.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.524
No, I'd love
to be your assistant.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.159
Okay, here's what
I want you to do.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:04.198
I want you to tell me
when to stop.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.066
Stop.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:07.201
Stop.

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:08.235
Stop.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.704
Okay.

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:14.074
Now tap this
one time.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:18.946
Okay, this is
a story about a queen.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.080
Aw.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.617
Who dated a bunch
of a-holes.

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:24.985
It really is
your story.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.488
Who didn't do Jack
for her, okay?

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.390
Until one day,

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.092
she found a guy
who was too--

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.761
eight of clubs,
give me that back--

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:39.933
who was 2 good
to be true.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.105
She finally
found her King.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.107
Does anybody have
a pretzel?

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.510
Oh, wait, here's one.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.612
In your nose.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.181
Oh, wow.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.849
Does anyone
have a balloon?

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.351
I can't believe this.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.152
I never thought
this would happen, but--

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:00.387
What?

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:04.291
I'm gonna (bleep)
a magician.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.394
â™ª

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.069
What?
How'd you do that?

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.940
I'm afraid
that's Victoria's secret.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.141
Ew.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.378
Put this on.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:28.182
Some people say
no glove, no love.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.884
However, quantum mechanics
dictates--

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.086
Okay, can you just
put it on, please?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.589
Amy, you make me
feel like an animal.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.291
Okay.
That's-- all right.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.193
Enough, please.
Just, can you--

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:42.362
Do you have an unlit match
and a Canadian coin?

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.198
No, can you just stop
with the magic?

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.799
Like we're naked,
we're in my bed.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.367
Like you did it.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.237
I actually can't
do it tonight.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.405
Why?

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.907
'Cause there's something
blocking my way.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.008
What?

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.177
(grunts)

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.346
Oh, my God!

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.915
Oh, my--
ew, ew, ew.

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.251
All right, enough.
No more magic.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.820
Your wish
is my command.

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.355
Let's still like
a magic saying.

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:09.923
Oh.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.191
Man, you're pregnant!

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.060
What?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.628
No, I'm not.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.497
Oh, my God.

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:18.765
I can feel it kicking!

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:19.867
Ew!

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.802
Josh, this is cra--

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.240
Josh?

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.075
(wind blowing)

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:28.942
Magic.
