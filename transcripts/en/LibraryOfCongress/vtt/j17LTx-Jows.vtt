Today's lecture is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.770
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.930
The Kluge Center is a vibrant

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.140
Today's program is titled
Making Patriotic Prostitutes:

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.720
The South Korean Government's
Policies

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.010 position:56%
on Prostitution for the US Military.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.370
It features scholar Jeong-Mi
Park, currently a Kluge fellow

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.330
at the John W. Kluge Center.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.180
Dr. Park's research at the library
examines how the South Korean

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.010
government controlled
military prostitutes catering

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.090
to American servicemen in the
context of US military occupation,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.490
the hot and cold wars, economic
development and globalization.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.280
She also reveals the ways in
which the Korean government strove

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.620
to make these "dangerous"
women into "patriotic subjects"

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.990
who could contribute
to national security.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.140
Jeong-Mi Park earned her BA, MA and
PhD at the Department of Sociology,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.320
Seoul National University.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.560
She worked as a research assistant
professor at Hanyang University

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.520
as a historical sociologist.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480
She has analyzed the historical
transformations of state policies,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.920
citizenship and social
movements in South Korea

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.910
from a perspective of
gender and sexuality.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.740
The title of her PhD dissertation
is A Study on Prostitution Policies

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.920
in Korea: The Transformation of
the Toleration Regulation Regime

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.130
and the Historical Constitution
of the Prostitute, 1945-2005.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.230 position:56%
She has published several papers in
Women's Studies International Forum,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.730
Korean Journal of Sociology
and Society and History.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.270
And most recently she has
been a Kluge fellow here

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.630
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.510
So please join me in
welcoming Jeong-Mi Park.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:45.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.370
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: Thank you
everyone for coming to my talk.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.570
It was my honor to conduct
research at the Library

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.870
of Congress as a Kluge Fellow.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.520
And I am glad to express my
appreciation to the people

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.330
who made my stay amazing.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.530
Dr. Recker of the Kluge Center,
Janice Hyde, the former director

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.850
of scholars, and the wonderful
staff such as Marylou,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.130
Joanne, Travis, Jason and Ben.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.800
My colleagues, Kluge fellows,
the promising young scholars,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.850
outstanding senior scholars
and many people and librarians.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.570
And I also appreciate my
husband Ti-Won and my friend Ken

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.280
for their valuable discussions.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.050
My project is a history of
sociology of prostitution policies

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.730
in post-colonial South Korea.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.110
After World War II, Korea's sex
industry was divided according

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.570
to the race or nationality of the
client, such as Korean nationals,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.030
American troops and foreign
forces, most of who were Japanese.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.180
In order to control those
racially regulated sex industries,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.180
the Korean government implemented
separate but similar policies.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.960
In my book I'm exploring how
such policies were intertwined

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.260
with Korea's ongoing
nation-building process.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.020
Today I will focus on
one of those policies,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.430
the evolution of the Korean
government control of prostitution

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.770
for the US military
since World War II.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.410
And the way in which it
was developed and enforced

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.250
in the name of national security.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.070
I would like to begin my
talk with a comment made

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.450
by an American medical officer

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.480
who visited South Korea
right after World War II.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.660
He was brigadier general and an
advisor for health and welfare

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.770
to the US army forces
in South Korea.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.030 position:56%
In his autobiography entitled Medic,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.080
he recalled his first
impression of the Korean people.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.600
And I quote, "Korean
women as a matter

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.130
of national pride apparently
had refrained from social

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.700
and sexual contacts with their
occupiers during the 30 years

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.800
of Japanese occupation.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.190
When the American soldiers moved
into Korea in the fall of 1945,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.830
the Korean girls would have
nothing to do with them.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.320
In fact the first girls who
were seen in the company

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.890
of American soldiers were
shunned by the Korean people

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.940
who had protected their
women from sexual contact

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.090
with Japanese for so many years."

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.530
On one hand, his observation
was accurate

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.680
since Korean women's sexuality
had been considered a matter

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.630
of national pride and strictly
suppressed for a long time.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.900
On the other hand, he was wrong in
that the Korean people had failed

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.940
to protect their women,
although they despised those

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.690
who catered to their occupiers.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.590
In fact, in the late 19th century,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.440
Japanese settlers transplanted
a system

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.950
of legalized prostitution
to the Korean peninsula.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.060
Before this prostitution in
Korea had been prohibited

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.290 position:56%
by the Joseon Dynasty, though it was
not always successfully enforced.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.950
With prostitution legalized,
some disenfranchises Korean girls

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.410
and women were legally or
illegally trafficked to brothels

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.900
to serve both Japanese
and Korean men.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.330 position:56%
This picture shows the first brothel
district in Seoul in the 1910's.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.780
The next one shows the inside of
a brothel in Gunsan in the 1930's.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:08.380
This was until 1931 when Japan
invaded North China, numerous girls

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.640
and women from throughout east
Asia were mobilized by force

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.190
or misrepresentation into
serving as comfort women

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.980
for the Japanese military.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.130
How many women were
recruited is not clear.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:32.730
Scholars speculate that their
numbers were between 50,000-200,000

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.600
and Korean women constituted
a substantial part of them.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.310
These pictures show
Korean comfort women

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:45.630
who were rescued by
the Allied forces.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.590
At the time of [inaudible],
a new and different chapter

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:55.510
of Korean female sexual contact
with foreigners was about to begin.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.740
Let's go back to Sam's memoir.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.320
He continued, "Time passed.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.440 position:56%
With the usual gifts of candy and
other things, the initial resistance

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.010
of Korean women to association with
foreign soldiers was broken down.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.210
A comparatively small segment

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:19.090
of the Korean population then
became highly infected as far

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.120
as [inaudible] was concerned,
by the American soldiers.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.330
And in turn passed the
infection on to other soldiers.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.440
It does not take long."

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.520
Although Sam did not
mention the word explicitly,

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.600
these women associating with
American servicemen were seen

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.390
to be prostitutes by
both Korean society

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.460
and the US military in Korea.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:52.470
Then how did the newly
arrived troops grapple

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.980
with prostitution and STD's?

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.780
What kind of policies
did they rely on?

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.630
In order to answer this
question, it is necessary to go

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.550
over the two legacies
that had an impact

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.360
on post-colonial Korea's policies.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.440
Colonial regulation and
American prohibition.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.530
As I said before, Japanese
settlers started legalizing

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.760
prostitution Korea.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.080
In 1916, the colonial government
promulgated a series of regulations

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.250
to centralize prostitution
nationwide.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.450
Which were tighter regulation of
brothel owners and prostitutes,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.800
and regulation of geishas,
[inaudible]

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.040
and employers of geishas.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.800
So first the regulation
legalized prostitution

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.390 position:56%
by registering prostitutes and
subjecting them to STD examinations.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.950
These licensed prostitutes
were called public prostitutes.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.610
The second regulation
applied to Geishas

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.100 position:56%
and Korean [inaudible] and barmaids.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.330
In 1937 another category was added.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.060
These women were not
public prostitutes.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:18.740
So in principle, prostitution of
these groups was prohibited by law.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.870
Nevertheless, the colonial
government also enforced

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:27.080
registration and STD testing
of such women on the premise

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.270
that they were likely to
engage in prostitution.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.410
In this way the prostitution
policies

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.330
in colonial Korea were
composed of two pillars.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:45.410
I call the first one the
authorization regulation policy,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.730
and the second one the
toleration regulation policy.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.170
The Japanese military's
occupation system before

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.650
and during World War
II was an extreme form

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.520
of these authorization regulations
in that the Japanese military

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.640
and imperial government
not only established

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.890
and managed confrontations
for servicemen,

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.770
but also urbanized the
mobilization of comfort of women.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.860
In contrast, the United States
adopted the opposite approach

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.390
towards prostitution in
the early 20th century.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.740
That is, prohibition.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.660
As this map shows, by 1942 all
states except for the four shown

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.910
in white had laws against
prostitution.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:41.050 position:56%
In addition, in 1941 the federal
government enacted the so-called May

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.890
Act to suppress prostitution
near military bases.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:52.400
At the same time, the United States
implemented extensive STD control

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.990
policies, in particular
during the two World Wars.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:02.040
Women, including professional
prostitutes and so-called amateurs,

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.260
were considered a source of STD's.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.500
As you can see from these
posters from the US military,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.400
[inaudible] were represented
with demonized female figures.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.260 position:56%
Military police and public
officials had authority to identify,

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.990
locate and apprehend
women who were suspected

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.220
of transmitting STD's
to military personnel.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.510
This was called a contact
tracing program.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:35.940
This picture shows a
contact tracing interview

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.360
between a military medical officer

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.900
and an infected serviceman
during World War II.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.510 position:56%
The arrested women were incarcerated
in detention centers for weeks

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.140
or even months until
they were cured.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.030
This photo shows a detention
center during World War II

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.700
which was called a
rapid treatment center.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.430
By contrast, from 1944 infected
soldiers did not receive any

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.690
disciplinary actions or punishment.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.180
In this respect, despite
substantial differences,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.500 position:56%
not only colonial regulation, but
also American prohibition was a form

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.490
of oppression of women in that both

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.270
of them regarded women not
men as the source of STD's.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.560
And strictly controlled the women.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.660
And post-colonial Korea
became a stage

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:38.120
on which these two policies
encountered each other.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.190
Two days after the US
Army's occupation of Korea

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.550
on September 8th, 1945, the United
States Army Military Government

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.910
in Korea was established.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.920
The new military governor struggled

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.680
to safeguard the servicemen
from STD's.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.710 position:56%
In May 1946 he proclaimed an
ordinance to punish women with STD's

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:06.830
for "engaging in or eliciting
sexual intercourse with any member

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.500
of the occupying forces."

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.280 position:56%
What is interesting here is that
the US Military Government in Korea,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.300
unlike in the United States,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.570
criminalized not prostitution
but the spread of STD's.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:27.330
Edward Grand Mead, an officer
of the US Military Government

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.760
in Korea pointed out
this contradictory nature

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.630
of the prostitution
policy as follows.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.110
"In a sense, the attitude

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.450
of military government towards this
profession had an amusing facet.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.450
No attempt was made to
illegalize the practice,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:51.410
and a Korean prostitute was not
disobeying the law unless she

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.180
engaged in sexual intercourse
with any member

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.150
of the occupying forces
while suffering

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.690
from [inaudible] in
an infectious state."

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:07.100
At the same time the military
government retained the colonial

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.180
requirement of registration and
testing, as this document shows.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:18.820 position:56%
"A policy has been set up that all
entertainment girls will be required

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.710
to have vaginal and seriological
examinations every month.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:29.490 position:56%
Failure to have such examinations
will result in the loss of license."

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.470
On the contrary, Korean
feminists struggled

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.030
to abolish the colonial regulation.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.900 position:56%
To many Koreans, state regulated
prostitution was a symbolic reminder

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.310
of our shameful colonial past.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:53.230
In early 1947, female activists
proposed a bill entitled Act

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.330
on the Abolishment of
Legalized Prostitution.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.690
The legislature passed it
with only one dissenting vote,

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.200
showing its agreement with
feminists that abolition stood

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.710
for a new nation free
of colonial vestiges.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:16.540
Following the American model, the
new law prohibited prostitution,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.910
criminalizing all participants
in the sex industry.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.670
It is ironic that American
prohibition was introduced not

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.630 position:56%
by the US military government but by
the Korean people who were striving

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.840
to eliminate colonial vestiges.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.660
As a result of this new law, public
prostitutes lost their legal status

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.990
and were subject to punishment
if they persisted in their work.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:49.800
Nevertheless, this
new law was not enough

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:57.410
to uproot all colonial vestiges
since it only abolished regulation

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.500
of public prostitutes,
leaving intact regulation

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.590 position:56%
of geishas, barmaids and waitresses.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.510
Moreover, two weeks before the
effective date of the new law,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.220 position:56%
the military government enacted a
regulation called Establish the Rule

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.380 position:56%
on the Business of Entertainers,
retolerating the colonial regulation

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.920
of geishas, barmaids and waitresses

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:28.030
who are simply recategorized
as entertainers.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:33.200 position:56%
This rule continued the registration
and testing requirements.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.770 position:56%
Consequently, even though
prostitution was entirely prohibited

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.850
by the new law, these females,
these workers were still subject

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.030
to regulation on the assumption
that they were likely to engage

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.670
in prostitution as in
the colonial period.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.430
In this way, toleration
regulation survived regulation

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.460
and was renewed while authorization
regulation was abolished

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.350
by the new prohibitionist law.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.840
I call the combination
of colonial regulation

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.980
and American prohibition the
toleration regulation regime.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.370
Interestingly, Korean feminists
did not challenge this toleration

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.310
regulation regime, even though
it retained the colonial legacy.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.270
Rather they actually supported it.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.540
On one hand they adhered
to prohibition

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.500
in order to build a moral nation.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:37.700
On the other hand, they also
demanded more rigorous STD testing

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.300
of women likely to engage
in prostitution in order

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.920
to protect the new
nation from STD's.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.800
In this respect the toleration
regulation regime was more

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.780
than a lingering colonial legacy.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.890
It was a post colonial reinvention
that enabled a compromise

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.170
between Korean feminists and
the US Military Government.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:08.040
They shared the interest of
combating STD's for their nation

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.540
and for their servicemen,
respectively.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.940
After the Korean government
was established in 1948,

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:24.030 position:56%
the US military withdrew from Korea,
leaving only 500 military advisors.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.410
At the time of the
Korean War however,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.800
foreign troops including
Americans returned,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.500
and prostitution for them resumed.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.250
During the Korean War, the
peak strength of UN forces

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.670
from 21 countries was 340,000

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:48.660
of which the vast majority,
300,000 were Americans.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.560
In order to comfort these allies,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:57.580
the Korean government permitted
comfort stations to be established.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.430
According to one document I found
at the Korean National Archive,

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:09.150
in October 1951 the Ministry of
Health instructed its officials

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.140
to license comfort stations.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.960
This document specified that the
purpose of the facilities was

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.100
to protect the Korean
people's safety in order

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:27.780
that the service be offered only
to UN forces, not to civilians.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.580
It also stipulated the registration
of comfort women, geishas

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.870
and waitresses in order to
conduct periodic STD testing.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:43.180
The category of comfort women
was defined as "women who comfort

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.320
and entertain foreign
troops at comfort stations."

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.910
In this way the Korean
government returned

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.130
to authorization regulation
during the war.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.480
Nonetheless, it was keenly aware

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.120
that licensing military brothels
was a violation of its own law.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.210
In this document the Korean
government instructed its officials

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.720
to keep in mind that a comfort
station is "A special business

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.190
for conducting this
war, not a local one."

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:22.060
UN forces cooperated with the
Korean government policies well.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.610
According to the same document,
a comfort station was established

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.070
when UN forces demanded it.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:35.840 position:56%
And the UN military police assisted
the Korean police in arresting women

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:41.100
who evaded registration
and STD testing.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.680
Moreover, in a document of UNCACK,
or UN Civil Assistance Command

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.260
to Korea, similar categories of
women appeared as the targets

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.430
of registration and STD testing.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.710 position:56%
Prostitutes, dancers and waitresses.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:03.110 position:56%
UNCACK was responsible for directing
and assisting the Korean government

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.310
in enforcing public health
policies during the Korean War,

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.630
including the prevention of STD's.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:14.630
Therefore it is possible
that the word prostitutes

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:21.710 position:56%
in this document was an English
translation of Korean comfort women.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.680
The frequency of check-ups was
twice a week for prostitutes,

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.280
once a week for dancers and
once a month for waitresses.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.830
In this document the
UNCACK stipulated that

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.240
"If necessary the American medical
police will help the South Korean

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.910
police in conducting
this operation."

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.390
As we already know, the
terms comfort stations

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.540
and comfort women originated

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.740
from the Japanese military
sanctioned slavery before

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.740
and during World War II.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:01.170 position:56%
Korean government officials used the
same terms to refer to prostitutes

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.760 position:56%
and military brothels for UN forces.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.770
They also shared with the Japanese
the idea that it was necessary

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:15.090
to provide safe sex to the military
in order to boost soldiers' morale,

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:21.950
prevent STD's and protect so-called
ordinary women from sexual assault.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.570
In a sense it is not
surprising given the fact

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:31.110 position:56%
that the Korean War broke out only
five years after World War II ended.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:36.640
And that most Korean government
officials having been trained

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.370
under colonial rule were familiar
with the Japanese policies.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.740
However, historical documents
indicate that comfort stations

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.040
for UN troops were
established and managed

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.510
in a manner somewhat different
from the Japanese ones.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.420
First, the Japanese
military directly established

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.580
and managed comfort stations or
ordered civilians to establish

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.740
and managed them following
its regulations.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.370
According to this document
produced by the Allied forces right

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.230
after World War II, which
was entitled Amenities

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.140
in the Japanese Armed Forces,
such military regulation

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:28.540 position:56%
on comfort stations were meticulous,
specifying almost everything

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:34.620 position:56%
from rates to service hours to terms
of employment of comfort women.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.620
Civilian managers were forced to
submit monthly business reports

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.980
to the military and
were not able to shut

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.780
down their business
without permission.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.080
In this respect, the Japanese
comfort stations were de facto

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.040 position:56%
military facilities directly
controlled by the Japanese military.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.460
In fact, they were also often
called "filled army canteens."

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.330
In contrast, the Korean
government's regulation

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.590
of conversations was
much simpler and looser,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.840
requiring only licensing the
facility and registration

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.220
and STD testing of comfort women.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.040
In short, the Japanese comfort
stations were operated according

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.510
to strict military standards while
the Korean comfort stations were

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.000
in between military facilities
and civilian brothels.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.020
Another important difference is
that while the Japanese government

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.790
and military were involved in
the recruitment and transport

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:46.000
of comfort women, there
is no evidence

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.410
that shows the Korean government
or UN forces did the same.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.310
Finally the scale of comfort women
for UN troops was far smaller

00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:00.010
than those for the
Japanese military.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.850
Most researchers estimate
their number

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.240
between 50,000 to over 200,000.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.720
By contrast, according
to the USCACK document,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.390
right after the Korean War,

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:19.540
the number of registered
prostitutes was 9,233.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.940
It can be assumed that these
differences between the Japanese

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.980
and Korean comfort stations
resulted from the characteristics

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.070
of each war and each government.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.530 position:56%
The history of the Japanese military
comfort stations traces back

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:40.110
to Japan's invasion of
north China in 1931,

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.890
continuing until the
end of World War II.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.760
The number of Japanese
military reached 3 million

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.890
across the Pacific right
before the end of the war.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.270
By contrast, as I previously
noted, the peak strength

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:02.040
of UN forces during the
Korean War was 340,000.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.600
That was about a tenth

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.670
of the Japanese counterpart
during World War II.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.910
The Korean government, which
was newly established in 1948

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:19.270
and thereafter devastated
by the war, was much weaker

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:24.160
and more chaotic than the
Japanese imperial government.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.830
In addition, unlike
in Imperial Japan,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.810
prostitution was outlawed
in post-colonial Korea.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.960
Therefore it might have been
difficult for the Korean government

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.200
to overtly mobilize its own
women into comfort stations.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.880
These pictures show
brothels or so-called houses

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.750
of ill repute established
during the Korean War.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:56.100
Considering that these houses were
set up inside the Pacific area

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.500
and that their signs
were written in English,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.300
they appear to be comfort
stations for UN forces.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.430
Such a brothel was
equipped with a waiting room

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:13.120
and several bedrooms
with numbered doors.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.930
This picture shows a Korean
doctor examining prostitutes

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:23.100
at a field clinic that belonged
to the Third US Infantry Division.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.450
In a letter sent to UNCACK in 1951,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.330 position:56%
the chief of Korean police
explained the purpose of STD testing

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:38.150
of prostitutes and other
female entertainers as follows.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.190 position:56%
"This medical examination and
medical treatment for those who need

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:49.330
such assistance will be enforced
in order to promote the efforts

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:54.610
of the UN forces gallantly
fighting this war of aggression.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.850
No misunderstanding
should therefore arise

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:02.090
from such action taken
by the police."

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.080
This letter implies that the Korean
police considered it necessary

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.130
to protect the health of
the UN forces and possibly

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:16.060
to provides safe pleasure
to them to help win the war.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:21.290
However the UN forces did not
seem to be fully satisfied

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:24.460
with the Korean government's
STD control.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.130
In the view of the UNCACK,
there was a glaring weakness

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.710
in the STD policy during
the war that is,

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.190
"The failure to isolate infected
individuals until noninfectious.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.170
Prostitutes return to work
immediately after examination."

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:49.840
In order to overcome this
shortcoming, facilities to isolate

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.930
and treat infected prostitutes were
established not long after the war.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:02.680
The Korean War ended in 1953, but
the US, motivated by the Cold War,

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.530
desired to contain communism,

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.720
maintained a sizeable
presence in Korea.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.050
But the US military operated
under the name of the UN Command

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.730
when the other UN members
withdrew in the 1950's and '60's.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.830
The number of American
military personnel decreased

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:29.950
from around 300,000 right after
the war to 58,000 in 1961.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.300
And this level continued
throughout the 1960's.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.480
The Korean government absolutely
depended upon the US military

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.640
for its national security
and was ready to do anything

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.110
to meet its allies requirements.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:53.090
With the US military's long-term
presence, so-called compounds

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.560
which means business
and amusement area

00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:00.250
around the US military
bases, started to form.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.040
These pictures show what
the compounds looked

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.020
like in their early days.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.470
The images of bustling streets,

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:15.930
clubs which the provost marshal
permitted his soldiers to enter.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:22.510
The inside of such clubs and the
women who frequented these places.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.340
During the Korean War
the government was able

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.820
to justify establishing
comfort stations in the name

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.170
of the state of emergency.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:37.200 position:56%
However, since the comfort stations
obviously violating the existing law

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.530
prohibiting prostitution,
the government had to shut

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.170
down those facilities
right after the war.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.540
Replacing the comfort stations,

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.490
clubs became the main
venue of prostitution.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.740
The Korean government also
licensed and regulated these clubs,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.540
calling them "special
restaurants for UN troops."

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.160
With this euphemistic term,
the Korean government attempted

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.760
to avoid the allegation of
permitting prostitution.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.150
In this way, after the Korean
War, the government returned

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:19.610 position:56%
to the toleration regulation regime,
officially prohibiting prostitution

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:25.690
but simultaneously
tolerating and regulating it.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.210
And during the Cold War,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:32.970
the toleration regulation
regime became more systematized.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.970 position:56%
It was composed of several elements.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.110
The fist element was zoning.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.200
Regions were segregated areas

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.390
for the exclusive use
of American servicemen.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:50.170
As this picture shows, Koreans
other than those catering

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:54.660
to the US military were not
allowed to enter these clubs.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.010
The second was registration.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.250
The Korean government
registered individual prostitutes

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.810
and issued certificates to them.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:09.320
This certificate functioned
as a kind of ID card

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.610
for so-called entertainers to
prove that they were registered

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.750
and got regular STD checkups.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.340
As during the Korean War,
entertainers were classified

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.160
into three groups: comfort
women, dancers and waitresses.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.190
In this way the legal category

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:32.230
of comfort women survived while
comfort stations disappeared.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:38.190
In the 1970's, the term
comfort women was replaced

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.570
by "special business girls".

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:46.170
All entertainers were forced to put
their photos on the certificates

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.060
to get a certificate stamp
when they got examinations

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.010
and to carry it while working.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.300
Korean government statistics
indicate that as many

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.540
as 10,000 women may have
engaged in prostitution

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.530
for the US military
annually between the end

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.080
of the Korean War and
the late 1980's.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.350
The third was regular STD testing.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:16.390
The frequency of examination was
the same as during the Korean War.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:20.110
Twice a week for comfort
women, once a week for dancers

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.820
and once a month for waitresses.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:26.570
These three elements
of zoning, registration

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.950
and STD testing were carried
over from colonial regulation.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.660
Added to these were the
following three elements taken

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.200
from American prohibition.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.330
The first was the contact
tracing program.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:47.970
From the post-World War II
occupation until the Korean War,

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:52.160
the US military tried to
implement this program

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.950
that it had utilized
in its own country.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:01.180
However, this concentration program
was initially unsuccessful due

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.460
to the lack of effective
enforcement.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.610
After the Korean War the contact
tracing program was stepped up.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:16.990
This is an excerpt from a 1955
document of the Eighth US Army,

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:21.050
which describes how the
program was carried out.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.690
"If the contact lives
in a nearby area,

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.830
appropriate military police
authorities will be notified

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:34.710
and then accompanied by
national police will endeavor

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:39.760
to locate the contact and have
her examined and treated."

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.770
In this way, the contact tracing
program was implemented jointly

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.470
by the US military police and
the Korean National Police.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.120
The women who were suspected
of spreading infection

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:58.740
to American servicemen or who did
not carry their health certificates

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.480
were arrested.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.130 position:56%
The next element was first treatment

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:10.470
so that the UNCACK recognized
the lack of facilities

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:14.530
for mandatory treatment
as a glaring weakness

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.670
in STD control during
the Korean War.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.900
This problem was solved
with the establishment

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:26.550
of STD treatment centers in
camp towns during the 1960's.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.820
It is noteworthy that
in the United States

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.630 position:56%
such facilities were entirely closed

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.450
in the early 1950's
while they were newly set

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.020
up in Korea during the 1960's.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:46.190
This is one of them which
was established in the 1960's

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:50.260
and shut down in the late 1990's.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.650
The US military helped the
Korean government build

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.940
and manage these facilities

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.440
by offering financial
and medical resources.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.530
The final element was prohibition.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.740
As I previously noted, the Korean
government restored prohibition

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.430
right after the Korean War.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:15.620
This prohibition was based
on the act of the abolishment

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:22.670 position:56%
of legalized prostitution enacted in
1947, and the act on the prevention

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.420
of morally degrading behaviors,

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.970
which replaced the
former act in 1961.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.220
Since prostitution was
illegally prohibited,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.380
the Korean police had authority
to round up prostitutes.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.440
But in general the
police focused not

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:47.600
on suppressing prostitution,
but on combatting STD's.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.430
In this way, the toleration
regulation regime

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.640
that was systematized during
the cold war was a patchwork

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.470
of colonial regulation
and American prohibition.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:03.840
As a result, prostitutes were
subject not only to zoning,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.340
registration and STD testing, but
also to contact tracing programs,

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.360 position:56%
first treatment in detention centers

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.720
and sporadic crackdowns
by the police.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.010
Therefore the toleration regulation
regime can be considered one

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:24.340
of the most severe and intensive
policies [inaudible] prosecution

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.400
by combining every oppressive
element of both colonial regulation

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.930
and American prohibition.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:37.350
The testimony of former military
prostitutes shows how harsh the

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:39.830
toleration regulation regime was.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.760
This is the autobiography
of [inaudible]

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.400 position:56%
who sexually served the US
military during the 1960's and '70's

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.500
and later became a
human rights activist.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.860
This is what she said
as translated by me.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:00.570
"At that time I did not know that
Korea prohibited prostitution.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:05.760
After a few years, I was
so surprised to learn that.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.610
Isn't it quite contradictory

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.500
that the government
prohibits prostitution

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.360
but at the same time
forcibly examines prostitutes

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.900
and prevents those with
STD's from working?

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.310
I have also been arrested and
detained at a police station

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.590
and subjected to some retrial.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:30.660 position:56%
Women who contracted gonorrhea or
other diseases were immediately sent

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.980
to a detention center, usually a
village surrounded by mountains.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.490
It was cold monkey house.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.870
Every woman hated living
at the monkey house.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.910
Being treated like criminals,
we felt ashamed to be forced

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.090
to spread our legs every day

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:54.040
to determine whether we
were diseased or not."

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.700
This testimony shows that the
police rounded up prostitutes not

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:03.730 position:56%
for the suppression of prostitution,
but for the control of STD's,

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:09.390
even though the prohibitionist
rule justified the roundups.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:13.680
It also demonstrates that the
human rights of the women detained

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:20.730
at the STD detention treatment
centers were severely violated.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:25.650 position:56%
Other former military prostitutes
also testified that forced treatment

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:28.460
in detention centers was painful,

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.140
even causing death due
to penicillin shock.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.290
The contact tracing program
and forced treatment were

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:40.850
so mercilessly carried out that
its subjects were terrorized.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:45.520 position:56%
For instance, if an American soldier
pointed out a woman as a carrier

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.500
of STD's, she was immediately
apprehended and incarcerated

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.940
at detention center,
regardless of whether

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.980
or not she actually infected him.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:04.660 position:56%
The Korean officials and camp town
women, often called the [inaudible],

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.800
which means clearing the
enemies in Korean, took them.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.000
Then how was the Korean
government able

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.960
to implement those two
seemingly contradictory policies

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.870
of prohibition and regulation
simultaneously in the form

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.140 position:56%
of the toleration regulation regime?

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.770
In fact, prohibition was
based on laws that were passed

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:33.960
by the legislature while regulation
was implemented through rules,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.210 position:56%
orders and local ordinances that
the other administrators could enact

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:42.750
without the legislature's
rectification.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.690
In this system, regulation
of prohibition

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.700
and in turn both the regulation

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.030
and prohibition suspended
basic rights guaranteed

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.360
by the constitution,
such as arrest warrants,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.030
the right of legal counsel
and the right to trial.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.530
The Korean Constitution
specifies that the restriction

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:11.740
of personal freedom
should be based on law.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.440
Therefore in principle
the STD control

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.780
in the camp towns violated
the constitution.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.160 position:56%
Borrowing from the Italian political
philosopher Giorgi Agamben,

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.910
I think this legal structure
can be conceptualized as a state

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:33.950
of exemption in that it
represents the undercutting of laws

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:37.580
by executive actions,
causing disturbance

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.910
in the hierarchy of
laws and regulations.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.870
Under this regime the
Korean government attempted

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.550
to make military prostitutes
into submissive bodies

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:55.330
who offered safe sex to
its most powerful ally.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:44:00.030
In addition, the government
tried to indoctrinate these women

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:05.180
with patriotism through a series
of lectures by its officials

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.620
which was called patriotism
education.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.250
The regime describes such
a lecture as follows.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:20.130
"The lecturers were community
leaders and department officials.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.710 position:56%
Speaking to the microphone all of
them regurgitated the same verbiage.

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.990
"Ahem, you are patriots.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:30.130
Please have courage and pride

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:34.620
and do not forget you are
contributing to obtaining dollars.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.220
American soldiers came
here to help our country,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.620
so please be decently
dressed for them

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.390
and do not use such vulgar slang."

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:50.770
Today, we invited a famous
English teacher, Tony Hart."

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:58.420
In 1971 the chief of police of the
district of Seoul and the commander

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.690
of the US military in
Yongsan jointly issues a flyer

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:08.610
to the prostitutes to deal with
racial tension in camp towns,

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.100
repeating the same patriotic theme.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.180
This flyer stated as follows.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:23.200
"We believe that you have been
offering the US military the best

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.590
service so far.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.190
But in some cases you might
have hurt some soldiers'

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.300
feelings unintentionally.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.490
Let's reflect on such
behavior and correct it.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.750
You have to know that the
enemy is taking advantage

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.700
of even trivial incidents.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.760 position:56%
In the same vein, you could help the
enemy unknowingly, and as a result

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.840
of that, the national
security could be undermined.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.980 position:56%
Please keep in mind that US military
came to Korea to help defend us

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.580
from North Korea's
aggression and destruction.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.840
Not only for your business,
but also for national security,

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.310
please cooperate with us in
solving current problems.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.780
We encourage you to serve all
American servicemen equally."

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.600
The toleration regulation
regime continued

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.520
without challenge for
almost 40 years.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.740
The first challenge
came from the increase

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.960
in immigration in the late 1990's.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:30.090
As Korea's economic development led
to the depreciation of the dollar,

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:34.770
serving American military personnel
became a less lucrative option

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.380
for Korean women.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:40.340
As a result, to fill
vacancies, club owners started

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.890
to import foreign entertainers
from impoverished countries

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:50.000
such as the Philippines
and former Soviet Union.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.500
Being foreigners, these immigrant
entertainers were more vulnerable

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.310
to exploitation and
violation of their rights

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.860
than their Korean counterparts.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.660 position:56%
Thus camp towns became notorious
for international human trafficking.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:11.510
In 2001, the US Department of
State published the Trafficking

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:16.880
in Persons Report, which ranked
Korea among the most heavily

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.270
trafficked countries.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:23.650
As a result of the report, the
Korean government was faced

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:29.730
with significant international
pressure to reduce trafficking.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:34.910
The Korean government
immediately rebutted this report,

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.470
but at the same time it
acknowledged the need

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.600
to combat human trafficking.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.660
Second, the growth
of women's movement,

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.930
which accompanied Korea's
democratization also contributed

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:52.730 position:56%
to changes in prostitution policies.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.840
In 2004 Korean feminists succeeded

00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.400
in enacting more stringent
laws prohibiting prostitution,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.370
making toleration lose ground.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:08.370 position:56%
Registration, STD testing and
mandatory treatment which were based

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:12.550
on tolerating prostitution
entirely ceased.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:18.860
Finally the toleration regime was
replaced by complete prohibition

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.900 position:56%
which remains current Korean policy.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.240
Today I've explored the history

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.720
of Korean prostitution
policies for the US military.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.080 position:56%
Even though I showed you how
oppressive the toleration regulation

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:41.410
regime was, I do not want to depict
camp town women solely as victims.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:44.620
In fact, they were also
brave women who fought

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.060
against the injustices
inflicted on them.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:52.090
Such as government control,
club owners' exploitation

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.280
and American servicemen's
misconduct.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:00.470 position:56%
I discovered many newspaper articles
reporting these women's protest.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:04.850
In 2014 camp town women,

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:10.780 position:56%
many of whom have now become
grandmothers started a new struggle.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:14.850
With the aid of feminist
activists, researchers and lawyers,

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.990
they filed a law suit
to demand reparations

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:22.650
from the Korean government for the
violation of their human rights.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:26.470
I hope that this suit
will be an important step

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.470
to vindicate their rights.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.790
And I hope that my
research will shed new light

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:34.990
on their forgotten
history and contribute

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.140
to coming to terms with the past.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.440
Thank you for listening.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:54.190
[ Applause ]

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.420
If you have any questions, I would
be happy to try to answer them.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.610
&gt;&gt; In one of the later
documents that you showed,

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:15.860
the government was [inaudible]
that they should serve all

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:21.140 position:56%
of them equally, is this a reference

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:27.420
to racial problems
with American troops?

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:33.010
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: It's actually
after Civil Rights Movement

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.600
in United States occurred,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.760
and it influenced Korean
government policy as well.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:48.160
And you know, clubs and camp towns
were divided according to the race.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:58.270
Some clubs served white soldiers
and some clubs for black soldiers.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:06.330
And usually the clubs for
black soldiers were not so good

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:10.190
as those for white soldiers.

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:16.490
So there were some
riots by black soldiers.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:23.320
Yes, so to deal with such racial
tension the Korean government

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:30.500
encouraged camp town women to
serve all servicemen equally.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.560
&gt;&gt; Do you know what
happened in the North,

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:40.910
especially during the
war with Chinese troops?

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:42.850
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: Actually
I am not aware of that.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:46.160
Because that is beyond
the scope of my research.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.460
I'm sorry.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:06.650
&gt;&gt; Do you know about whether forced
sterilization was part of any

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:14.820
of the programs reinforcing
the toleration regime movement?

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.120
Force sterilization?

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:21.900
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: Actually I don't
think there was force sterilization

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.200
that occurred in the camp towns.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.400
But abortion was usually dominant,
especially by club owners.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.360
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you something.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.160
Specifically for --

00:52:43.160 --> 00:54:05.810
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:11.120
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: Well the
questions are very difficult.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.140
So I can't remember the
first question, so I'm sorry,

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.510
but could you repeat
the first question?

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:35.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:49.560 position:56%
Yeah. There is not enough material,
but I know one woman's autobiography

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:57.450
that she was former comfort
woman for the Japanese military.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:05.670
But after the liberation she
worked in camp towns as well.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:11.630
But it was just one
case I found, yeah.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:16.430
But I think there might be
some women who persisted

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:24.010
in so-called comforting
soldiers after World War II.

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.330
I mean some former comfort women

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:34.940
for the Japanese military
continued their work,

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:38.530
so-called their work
after the liberation.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:46.940
Because you know, they didn't have
enough means to make a living,

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:53.080
but unfortunately there is
no evidence so far except

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:56.750
for that one I mentioned.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:07.030
And yeah, although
prostitution is totally outlawed,

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:16.230
especially after 2004, probably
there is still ongoing prostitution

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:23.740
in camp towns among the
foreign immigrant entertainers.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:30.410
But yeah, but there are
regulations such as registration

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:36.510 position:56%
and mandatory treatment or mandatory
examination entirely ceased.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:43.660
So I don't think it can be called
toleration regulation anymore.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:52.000
And yeah, today I focused on
the Korean government's policy,

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.430
but you know, the US
military also intervened

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:04.500
or assisted the Korean government
to carry out such policies.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:11.380
So I think there might be some
lawsuits against the US military

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:19.510
or against the United
States but I'm not sure.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:45.120
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:57.280
Yeah. You know, Korea was
communist military dictatorship

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.580
for so long time.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:06.590
So patriotism was a kind of
universal discourse not only

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:12.860
for camp town women, but
for ordinary citizens.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:20.990
But you know, the Korean government
passionately emphasized these women

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:23.930
to emphasize patriotism

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:29.880
to make these women
so-called patriotic subjects

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:35.480
to more effectively serve
its most important allies.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.060
And one more question.

00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:43.550
Yeah?

&gt;&gt; Thank you for your presentation.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.510

[ Inaudible ]

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:06.860
What was the status of the
children who went to full term?

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:14.150
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: You mean
during the Second World War?

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:20.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because of
the situation in Korea.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.760
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: Or
after the colonization?

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:29.740
&gt;&gt; During the war, yeah.

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:36.150
World War II, the war.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:42.850
&gt;&gt; Jeong-Mi Park: During the Second
World War Japanese military comfort

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:47.940
stations, babies were
usually aborted, yeah.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:57.160
And some fortunate women
were able to give birth.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:06.930
And after the liberation, many
military prostitutes got married

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:12.280
to members of the US
military as well.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.500
So they had babies, but you
know, they were considered kind

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:25.970
of social outcasts in Korea because
-- so they were called mixed blood.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:33.720
So many of them were
actually adopted

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.100
to the United States
or other countries.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:41.790
It was an official policy
for the Korean government

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:46.020
to so-called export
those mixed babies.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:50.240

think we'll stop it there.
