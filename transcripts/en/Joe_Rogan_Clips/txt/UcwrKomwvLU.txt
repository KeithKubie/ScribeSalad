Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, you know, like, Ooh, it gives me like serious anxiety when I find out that someone got a Vegas residency. I go, how many nights a week? Six, six nights a week at the stratosphere. It sounds, I mean, somebody told me David spade was thinking about doing one. Oh. And he went to go see Louis Anderson who was doing one this before, baskets. And he was like, it was just the saddest thing I've ever seen. That was like Carlin's last stand was a Vegas residency. Did he have a Vegas residency? Yeah. Where was he at? I forget where he was, but he had like a meltdown where he like went off on the crowd, just like talk to calling him all pieces of shit. Really. And Yeah. And then had to go to rehab was like, I'm addicted to painkillers, like, and then on the giver, I don't they ever performed again.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Well, he died before he died. Like he was performing when he died. I mean, I think he was at a hotel, I'm pretty sure he was sleeping in a hotel that he was performing at when he died. I believe that, but I, cause I had done that last special he did was terrible. We, he's like reading half of it. Oh, I didn't see that. It's, it was, it was, it was just like, you know, a swan song for him. But I think that was after the Vegas residency, so must've been doing more. Yeah, his schedule was very, very hectic and unusual. He was doing one hour a year, an hour specialty would film and he would write it all out. Like he would write it all out and then tweak it a little bit, but it was more of a monologue then it was like set up punchline jokes and he seemed to, he was falling into this more like more of a social commentator in some aspects than he was a stand up towards the end.

Speaker 1:          01:48          You know what I mean? Oh yeah. Someone told me that he, a lot of the reason he did an hour every year was because, uh, the tax problems with the IRS was coming out in hard. And uh, so we had to be working that much and it kind of made them miserable. You know the story about his nine 11 story, right. Um, tell me where he recorded a special called. I kinda like it when a lot of people die. That was the name of the special, and he has his whole egg closes with a big long 20 minute thing about like when he hears about people dying, he liked the more the better. And he filmed it on like September 10th and then the next day came in and was like, we've got to, we've got to cancel this, but no one can ever see this or hear this and now you can get the album.

Speaker 1:          02:32          But even in the album, he's reading it. They like it. They destroyed the actual footage from the taping. Really? Yeah. They destroyed it. Oh. He was just like, there's no one can ever see this. Wow. According to, in Vegas at the MGM Grand on September 9th and 10th, September 9th and 10th. That's crazy. Yeah. What was it called? I kinda like it when a lot of people die. Jesus Christ, he woken up the morning of September 11th and go, did I manifest this? Yeah, look at that. I kind of like it when a lot of people die. And so the audio CD, it's just him talking. It's like him working out the, uh, wait a minute. It's a streaming. I like the audio streaming with Amazon prime's audio. There's no video of it. I'll look and see if there is some, some person who works somewhere. It might've preserved it. I mean, I feel like I would've heard about it.

Speaker 1:          03:28          I mean, like I said, I listened to the bit and it's, he's like, I've got to read, this is how I do it. So it's like a very early version of it. But, uh, it's not great, but I mean, I can't, I can't even imagine taping a special on September 10th he had some dark moments in his career. I took some friends to see him in 1988 at the Hampton Beach Casino. I think that's what it was called in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. It's like a place where people would go up for vacation and we went to see a George Carlin there way back in the day and he always had the same opening act and the same opening. I kind of knew even back then cause I was, I guess I was an open miker then I was just starting out. Um, I knew there were certain guys who took people on the road with them that were terrible.

Speaker 1:          04:12          They took people on the road with them that just didn't, they weren't good comics, but they made them look like heroes and [inaudible] they were friends with them or because he just wanted to have like the worst comic ever go up before then? It's a good question. You know, you'd have to, I guess it would vary, but for sure there's certain comics that like it when people go on in front of them suck. They do, they want that, you know, there's certain comics that you see them taking people on the road and you look at it, you're like, what the fuck? You're taking that guy with you. Like what are you doing? Why? Why are you torturing people like that? Yeah. But, uh, the opening acted better than George. Like he had terrible set. He had this whole rant that he was doing cause he like, he had an unquestionably one of the greatest comics of all time, but he had hours that were just not good.

Speaker 1:          04:58          And there was a period of time where it seemed like he just missed it. Like it was like, it was missing, whether it was his personal life was off or whatever it was. But he had this whole rant that was like, fuck this. And he was like, and fuck Israel and fuck comedy clubs. Like he was saying, fuck comedy clubs, like this is like this whole bit. And he was reading it off of a yellow legal pad and the whole audience was like standing there like not understanding like where this was going. Like we're waiting for the jokes. Where's the hilarity? Whereas it, and it wasn't, it just didn't exist. And my friends were mad at me really. I had taken him from where we live. We lived in revere and we all drove all the way up to New Hampshire. Like, yeah, we're going to go see George Collins is going to be awesome.

Speaker 1:          05:42          And it was terrible. It's funny, I remember Louis Ck and like an interview years ago was talking about how he took the pressure came off of him to always have a good show. But you said audience members love saying, Oh, I saw George Collin once. And he was, but they really loved saying, you know, I saw Carlin once and he was horrible. Like they, they still get the experience and the story of it and that that's it's theirs forever. You have to worry about doing a bad shedder though. If they say you were funny. I think it's, I think to see a legend bomb would be, uh, would be great. Well, if you are a Carl and fan, you've got to see those. If you went to see him live a bunch of times, yeah, he had those rough spots, man. You know, it's, um, it's one of those things, if you're going to do an hour of stand up every year, you're going to have some rough ones.

Speaker 1:          06:34          There's just no way around that. Oh, 100%. It seems like that's just, I mean it can be done. I think it can be done. I mean, I think you can put together like I'm six months in from my last special, I think I could do another special in six months, but it wouldn't be as good as my last one, I don't think. Yeah, I just don't think it would, I just think you need time. Yeah. One a year. It's crazy. It's insane. Like the guys like Jimmy Carr who while they're touring, they're writing jokes and just putting them away. So at the end of the tour, when they taped the special, they have all these jokes they can go through and look at and then start the new tour from that. That seems like I like to sit in my set, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          07:17          I just want it to be focused on that and not always be writing the next thing. But some people who are just like, I'm just going to go up and talk. And it's happening a lot now. I think with like the prevalence of Netflix specials, people just want the money and they're famous enough they can just go up and just get through it. And I'm like, this is your legacy. Yes. Why would you want to put out a bad special ever? I don't care what they're paying you make sure it's great. I feel the same way. And I feel like those people that watched that, when you do do that, man, if you don't acknowledge that you fucked him over, they're never going to trust you again. If you don't say, hey look, that one wasn't a good special. I gave it a shot. It just wasn't right.

Speaker 1:          07:53          It didn't come out right. I thought it was pretty good. And then the taping didn't go well and if you don't do that, they're not going to listen to your man. They were like, this is my best work. Like this is, Oh, this is your best work. Yeah, well the fuck you can fool them once. And I mean, like if I want, if I went on tour right now and just did the same material from the special, like people would be like, okay, but they're not coming back the next time. You know, they're gonna get mad at you. Yeah, yeah.
