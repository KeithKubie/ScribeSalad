when I say autonomous vehicle control

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969
when I say autonomous vehicle control
 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.209
when I say autonomous vehicle control
system what is it that I really mean

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219
system what is it that I really mean
 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.239
system what is it that I really mean
what does this require and by asking

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249
what does this require and by asking
 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.009
what does this require and by asking
these questions we can kind of start to

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019
these questions we can kind of start to
 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.469
these questions we can kind of start to
see why we might even want to care about

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479
see why we might even want to care about
 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.779
see why we might even want to care about
an end-to-end solution at all

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789
an end-to-end solution at all
 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.149
an end-to-end solution at all
so for starters we know that autonomous

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159
so for starters we know that autonomous
 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.250
so for starters we know that autonomous
vehicle systems need to be able to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260
vehicle systems need to be able to
 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.799
vehicle systems need to be able to
handle many different types of scenarios

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809
handle many different types of scenarios
 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.840
handle many different types of scenarios
so this includes things like changes in

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850
so this includes things like changes in
 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.660
so this includes things like changes in
luminosity the presence of lane markers

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670
luminosity the presence of lane markers
 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.149
luminosity the presence of lane markers
and even harsh weather conditions this

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159
and even harsh weather conditions this
 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.219
and even harsh weather conditions this
is something a lot of autonomous vehicle

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229
is something a lot of autonomous vehicle
 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.960
is something a lot of autonomous vehicle
systems today are simply not able to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970
systems today are simply not able to
 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.710
systems today are simply not able to
handle model based systems are often

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720
handle model based systems are often
 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480
handle model based systems are often
very brittle in practice they require a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490
very brittle in practice they require a
 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.180
very brittle in practice they require a
huge number of hand programmed rules and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190
huge number of hand programmed rules and
 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.810
huge number of hand programmed rules and
engineered features to be extracted and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
engineered features to be extracted and
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.160
engineered features to be extracted and
instead in this project we aim to

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
instead in this project we aim to
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.070
instead in this project we aim to
utilize large data sets to actually

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080
utilize large data sets to actually
 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080
utilize large data sets to actually
learn an underlying representation of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
learn an underlying representation of
 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.940
learn an underlying representation of
how the human actually drove so that we

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950
how the human actually drove so that we
 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.560
how the human actually drove so that we
can build a computer to replicate that

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570
can build a computer to replicate that
 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.890
can build a computer to replicate that
in practice so let's start by actually

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
in practice so let's start by actually
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.600
in practice so let's start by actually
taking a step back and looking at the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610
taking a step back and looking at the
 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.180
taking a step back and looking at the
standard autonomous vehicle pipeline I

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190
standard autonomous vehicle pipeline I
 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.890
standard autonomous vehicle pipeline I
know this might be very familiar to some

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900
know this might be very familiar to some
 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.030
know this might be very familiar to some
of you but I still want to go through it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040
of you but I still want to go through it
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.740
of you but I still want to go through it
just so we can see the difference with

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750
just so we can see the difference with
 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.170
just so we can see the difference with
an end-to-end pipeline and the key idea

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
an end-to-end pipeline and the key idea
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.880
an end-to-end pipeline and the key idea
here is that the problem is broken up

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
here is that the problem is broken up
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.040
here is that the problem is broken up
into many different sub modules where

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050
into many different sub modules where
 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.800
into many different sub modules where
each sub module is tackled independently

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810
each sub module is tackled independently
 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.300
each sub module is tackled independently
and you can see on the bottom I've put

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310
and you can see on the bottom I've put
 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.910
and you can see on the bottom I've put
some references to actual works and

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
some references to actual works and
 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710
some references to actual works and
publications from both academia and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720
publications from both academia and
 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.890
publications from both academia and
Industry focus on actually tackling an

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900
Industry focus on actually tackling an
 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.260
Industry focus on actually tackling an
individual sub problem of this pipeline

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270
individual sub problem of this pipeline
 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.880
individual sub problem of this pipeline
and it starts with on the left you can

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
and it starts with on the left you can
 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.260
and it starts with on the left you can
see that we're actually just collecting

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270
see that we're actually just collecting
 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.910
see that we're actually just collecting
data about our environment we're trying

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920
data about our environment we're trying
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.280
data about our environment we're trying
to learn what is happening around us so

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290
to learn what is happening around us so
 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.960
to learn what is happening around us so
this can include things like camera data

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970
this can include things like camera data
 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.099
this can include things like camera data
lidar radar inertial data etc and then

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109
lidar radar inertial data etc and then
 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.569
lidar radar inertial data etc and then
we feed this into some sort of detection

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579
we feed this into some sort of detection
 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.009
we feed this into some sort of detection
pipeline because the first thing we want

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019
pipeline because the first thing we want
 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.660
pipeline because the first thing we want
to do is actually understand where the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670
to do is actually understand where the
 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.130
to do is actually understand where the
obstacles around us are

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140
obstacles around us are
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.229
obstacles around us are
we need to identify these obstacles as

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
we need to identify these obstacles as
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.020
we need to identify these obstacles as
both static or dynamic we might want to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030
both static or dynamic we might want to
 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.670
both static or dynamic we might want to
pay even more attention to dynamic

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
pay even more attention to dynamic
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.619
pay even more attention to dynamic
obstacles and perhaps plan their motion

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629
obstacles and perhaps plan their motion
 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.050
obstacles and perhaps plan their motion
in the environment and once we have an

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060
in the environment and once we have an
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.339
in the environment and once we have an
idea of what's happening with the

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349
idea of what's happening with the
 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.750
idea of what's happening with the
objects around us we want to actually

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
objects around us we want to actually
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.179
objects around us we want to actually
localize ourselves relative to those

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189
localize ourselves relative to those
 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.599
localize ourselves relative to those
objects so this is called localization

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609
objects so this is called localization
 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.890
objects so this is called localization
once we have an idea of where we are

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900
once we have an idea of where we are
 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.960
once we have an idea of where we are
where the objects around us are we can

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970
where the objects around us are we can
 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.970
where the objects around us are we can
finally start to talk about planning

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980
finally start to talk about planning
 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.039
finally start to talk about planning
which is really one of the most

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049
which is really one of the most
 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.740
which is really one of the most
fundamental parts of of autonomous

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750
fundamental parts of of autonomous
 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.599
fundamental parts of of autonomous
driving so the goal of autonomous

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609
driving so the goal of autonomous
 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.360
driving so the goal of autonomous
driving is to travel from point A to B

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370
driving is to travel from point A to B
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.430
driving is to travel from point A to B
safely right and that's exactly what

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440
safely right and that's exactly what
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.930
safely right and that's exactly what
planning allows us to accomplish so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940
planning allows us to accomplish so
 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610
planning allows us to accomplish so
planning takes into account where the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
planning takes into account where the
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.089
planning takes into account where the
obstacles are and then allows us to

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099
obstacles are and then allows us to
 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.860
obstacles are and then allows us to
actually plan around to reach our goal

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
actually plan around to reach our goal
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.860
actually plan around to reach our goal
destination once we have this plan we

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870
destination once we have this plan we
 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.869
destination once we have this plan we
can now send actuation signals to the

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879
can now send actuation signals to the
 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.000
can now send actuation signals to the
car motor and actually execute that plan

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010
car motor and actually execute that plan
 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.470
car motor and actually execute that plan
so in this project we actually replace

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480
so in this project we actually replace
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.440
so in this project we actually replace
that entire intermediate pipeline with a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450
that entire intermediate pipeline with a
 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.960
that entire intermediate pipeline with a
learned model and in this project we're

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970
learned model and in this project we're
 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.420
learned model and in this project we're
actually focused on that learn model

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430
actually focused on that learn model
 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.750
actually focused on that learn model
being a deep neural network and instead

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
being a deep neural network and instead
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.009
being a deep neural network and instead
of actually learning the control

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019
of actually learning the control
 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.140
of actually learning the control
directly from raw sensory data we're

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
directly from raw sensory data we're
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.569
directly from raw sensory data we're
going to just focus on pixel values so

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579
going to just focus on pixel values so
 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.580
going to just focus on pixel values so
using a single front-facing camera as

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590
using a single front-facing camera as
 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.119
using a single front-facing camera as
our sensory input and instead of

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129
our sensory input and instead of
 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.159
our sensory input and instead of
predicting all possible control we're

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169
predicting all possible control we're
 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.930
predicting all possible control we're
just going to focus on predicting the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940
just going to focus on predicting the
 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.559
just going to focus on predicting the
steering wheel angle at that instant and

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569
steering wheel angle at that instant and
 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.569
steering wheel angle at that instant and
while this may seem like a very simple

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579
while this may seem like a very simple
 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.129
while this may seem like a very simple
problem at first because we're removing

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139
problem at first because we're removing
 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.199
problem at first because we're removing
all of these intermediate pipe all of

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209
all of these intermediate pipe all of
 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.300
all of these intermediate pipe all of
these intermediate problems this is

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310
these intermediate problems this is
 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.430
these intermediate problems this is
actually an extremely hard problem in

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440
actually an extremely hard problem in
 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.830
actually an extremely hard problem in
practice to actually get working in real

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840
practice to actually get working in real
 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.000
practice to actually get working in real
life and there are a couple reasons why

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010
life and there are a couple reasons why
 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.860
life and there are a couple reasons why
this is so difficult to work in real

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870
this is so difficult to work in real
 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.800
this is so difficult to work in real
life so firstly in the real world we

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810
life so firstly in the real world we
 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.110
life so firstly in the real world we
face huge amounts of uncertainty huge

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120
face huge amounts of uncertainty huge
 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.250
face huge amounts of uncertainty huge
amounts of more important than

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
amounts of more important than
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.750
amounts of more important than
uncertainty we face huge amounts of

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
uncertainty we face huge amounts of
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.719
uncertainty we face huge amounts of
ambiguity so this is a picture of a

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729
ambiguity so this is a picture of a
 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.390
ambiguity so this is a picture of a
roundabout in Paris you can see that we

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
roundabout in Paris you can see that we
 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.390
roundabout in Paris you can see that we
have to deal with huge amounts of

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
have to deal with huge amounts of
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.640
have to deal with huge amounts of
complexity in real-world driving we have

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650
complexity in real-world driving we have
 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.560
complexity in real-world driving we have
to be able to handle uncertainty in the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570
to be able to handle uncertainty in the
 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.019
to be able to handle uncertainty in the
environment we have to be able to handle

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:26.029
environment we have to be able to handle
 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.909
environment we have to be able to handle
uncertainty and the cars around us and

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919
uncertainty and the cars around us and
 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.879
uncertainty and the cars around us and
even uncertainty in their intention

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889
even uncertainty in their intention
 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.040
even uncertainty in their intention
and their actions so we don't know what

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050
and their actions so we don't know what
 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.020
and their actions so we don't know what
the vehicles the pedestrians the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030
the vehicles the pedestrians the
 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.929
the vehicles the pedestrians the
cyclists are doing around us and we have

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:37.939
cyclists are doing around us and we have
 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.219
cyclists are doing around us and we have
to account for that as part of our

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229
to account for that as part of our
 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.070
to account for that as part of our
planning algorithms and since we're

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
planning algorithms and since we're
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.629
planning algorithms and since we're
focusing on vision data there are also

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639
focusing on vision data there are also
 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.279
focusing on vision data there are also
many challenges that come with this as

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289
many challenges that come with this as
 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.830
many challenges that come with this as
well so camera sensors are subject to

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840
well so camera sensors are subject to
 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.619
well so camera sensors are subject to
Sun glare so you can see on the bottom

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629
Sun glare so you can see on the bottom
 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.019
Sun glare so you can see on the bottom
here there's a image of the Sun actually

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:53.029
here there's a image of the Sun actually
 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:54.939
here there's a image of the Sun actually
facing directly into the camera and this

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949
facing directly into the camera and this
 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.559
facing directly into the camera and this
kind of renders the entire driving scene

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569
kind of renders the entire driving scene
 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.769
kind of renders the entire driving scene
underneath that almost black so it makes

00:04:59.769 --> 00:04:59.779
underneath that almost black so it makes
 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.260
underneath that almost black so it makes
the driving or the imagery very

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270
the driving or the imagery very
 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.589
the driving or the imagery very
difficult to actually interpret and

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599
difficult to actually interpret and
 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.640
difficult to actually interpret and
additionally we have to be able to

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650
additionally we have to be able to
 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.490
additionally we have to be able to
account for uncertainty in the the

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500
account for uncertainty in the the
 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.529
account for uncertainty in the the
perception itself so dealing with harsh

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539
perception itself so dealing with harsh
 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.439
perception itself so dealing with harsh
weather conditions brings about the

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449
weather conditions brings about the
 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.659
weather conditions brings about the
inability to accurately image the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669
inability to accurately image the
 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.580
inability to accurately image the
environment and things like rain snow

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590
environment and things like rain snow
 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.619
environment and things like rain snow
and etc and finally one of the perhaps

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629
and etc and finally one of the perhaps
 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.529
and etc and finally one of the perhaps
most key challenge of all autonomous

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539
most key challenge of all autonomous
 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.240
most key challenge of all autonomous
driving not just end-to-end is dealing

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250
driving not just end-to-end is dealing
 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.610
driving not just end-to-end is dealing
with the edge cases so what happens if

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
with the edge cases so what happens if
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.040
with the edge cases so what happens if
we're driving and we see a plane in the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050
we're driving and we see a plane in the
 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.649
we're driving and we see a plane in the
road in front of us like we can see on

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659
road in front of us like we can see on
 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.700
road in front of us like we can see on
this top image here or on the other hand

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710
this top image here or on the other hand
 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.670
this top image here or on the other hand
what if we face assist a scenario like

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680
what if we face assist a scenario like
 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.459
what if we face assist a scenario like
this bottom bottom scenario here where

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469
this bottom bottom scenario here where
 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.800
this bottom bottom scenario here where
there is actually a sign painted on the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810
there is actually a sign painted on the
 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.540
there is actually a sign painted on the
back of a car of a pedestrian and a

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
back of a car of a pedestrian and a
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.429
back of a car of a pedestrian and a
cyclist and our object detector

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439
cyclist and our object detector
 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.350
cyclist and our object detector
detection pipeline has actually

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360
detection pipeline has actually
 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.659
detection pipeline has actually
recognized that sign as containing a

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669
recognized that sign as containing a
 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.959
recognized that sign as containing a
real-life human or pedestrian so these

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969
real-life human or pedestrian so these
 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.779
real-life human or pedestrian so these
are real problems that that face all

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789
are real problems that that face all
 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.189
are real problems that that face all

really I'll walk you through firstly
 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.149
really I'll walk you through firstly
what the definition of parallel autonomy

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159
what the definition of parallel autonomy
 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.149
what the definition of parallel autonomy
is and the autonomy system that we've

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159
is and the autonomy system that we've
 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.629
is and the autonomy system that we've
built at MIT to actually create a

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639
built at MIT to actually create a
 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.309
built at MIT to actually create a
testbed for a parallel autonomy testing

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319
testbed for a parallel autonomy testing
 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.600
testbed for a parallel autonomy testing
next I'll present some of our work in

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610
next I'll present some of our work in
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.650
next I'll present some of our work in
not only learning the

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:44.660
not only learning the
 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.080
not only learning the
steering wheel control of an autonomous

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090
steering wheel control of an autonomous
 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.430
steering wheel control of an autonomous
vehicle but also the corresponding

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440
vehicle but also the corresponding
 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.070
vehicle but also the corresponding
steering bounds for that vehicle in an

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080
steering bounds for that vehicle in an
 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.980
steering bounds for that vehicle in an
end-to-end manner I'll show you how this

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990
end-to-end manner I'll show you how this
 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.530
end-to-end manner I'll show you how this
work actually tackles some of the issues

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540
work actually tackles some of the issues
 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.140
work actually tackles some of the issues
that I presented earlier that end-to-end

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150
that I presented earlier that end-to-end
 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.190
that I presented earlier that end-to-end
systems today currently face and finally

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200
systems today currently face and finally
 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.390
systems today currently face and finally
we'll talk about how we can actually

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400
we'll talk about how we can actually
 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.280
we'll talk about how we can actually
predict when the model is likely to fail

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290
predict when the model is likely to fail
 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.070
predict when the model is likely to fail
when we can determine how uncertain this

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080
when we can determine how uncertain this
 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.750
when we can determine how uncertain this
model is when can we trust our

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760
model is when can we trust our
 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.250
model is when can we trust our
end-to-end system so this is another

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260
end-to-end system so this is another
 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.490
end-to-end system so this is another
huge challenge in intend algorithms we

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500
huge challenge in intend algorithms we
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.350
huge challenge in intend algorithms we
have to be able to account for the the

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360
have to be able to account for the the
 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.940
have to be able to account for the the
situations where the model doesn't know

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950
situations where the model doesn't know
 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.200
situations where the model doesn't know
what it's talking about and we have to

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210
what it's talking about and we have to
 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.940
what it's talking about and we have to
be able to accurately predict these so

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950
be able to accurately predict these so
 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.870
be able to accurately predict these so
let's start with the first part of the

autonomy all this feeling means is that

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570
autonomy all this feeling means is that
 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.240
autonomy all this feeling means is that
we have an autonomy controller that is

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250
we have an autonomy controller that is
 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.100
we have an autonomy controller that is
running two parallel threads in the

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110
running two parallel threads in the
 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.990
running two parallel threads in the
background one is the human and one is

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000
background one is the human and one is
 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.270
background one is the human and one is
the robot or the standard autonomy

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280

controls results in what we call

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.230
controls results in what we call
 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.890
controls results in what we call
parallel autonomy or this this paradigm

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:44.900
parallel autonomy or this this paradigm
 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.380

development platform for debugging and
 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.949
development platform for debugging and
developing our algorithms before we

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959
developing our algorithms before we
 

00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.360
developing our algorithms before we
actually move them on to the full-scale

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.370
actually move them on to the full-scale
 

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.750
actually move them on to the full-scale
car so this is more like a safety safety

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760
car so this is more like a safety safety
 

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.250

step on our end that we take of

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.260
step on our end that we take of
 

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.320
step on our end that we take of
debugging all of our all of our

00:09:59.320 --> 00:09:59.330
debugging all of our all of our
 

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.000

wheelchair which shares the exact same
 

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.800
wheelchair which shares the exact same
sensor suite as the full-scale car so it

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.810
sensor suite as the full-scale car so it
 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.870
sensor suite as the full-scale car so it
has all of the cameras the lidar is the

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880
has all of the cameras the lidar is the
 

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.850
has all of the cameras the lidar is the
radars etc so it's search has a great

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:09.860
radars etc so it's search has a great
 

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.250
radars etc so it's search has a great
test bed before we move to the car but

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.260
test bed before we move to the car but
 

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.480
test bed before we move to the car but
let's take a look at one of our cars

and actually now this is actually a
 

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.330
and actually now this is actually a
little bit outdated so we've installed

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:29.340
little bit outdated so we've installed
 

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.010
little bit outdated so we've installed
two more cameras on the sides of the car

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.020
two more cameras on the sides of the car
 

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.830

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:13.710
ECU board to actually command the car
 

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.490
ECU board to actually command the car
and actually control the car the great

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500
and actually control the car the great
 

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.530
and actually control the car the great
thing about this Drive px 2 is actually

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540
thing about this Drive px 2 is actually
 

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.820
thing about this Drive px 2 is actually
that it has two onboard GPUs which anigh

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:22.830
that it has two onboard GPUs which anigh
 

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.400
that it has two onboard GPUs which anigh
which allows us to do really fast

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.410
which allows us to do really fast
 

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.630
which allows us to do really fast
real-time deep neural network inference

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640
real-time deep neural network inference
 

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.410
real-time deep neural network inference
as well now before going any further I

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420
as well now before going any further I
 

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.700
as well now before going any further I
want to actually draw this distinction

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:31.710
want to actually draw this distinction
 

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.850
want to actually draw this distinction
between shared control and binary

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860
between shared control and binary
 

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.950
between shared control and binary
control so typically when people think

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:36.960
control so typically when people think
 

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.220
control so typically when people think
of a shared control in the autonomous

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.230
of a shared control in the autonomous
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.630
of a shared control in the autonomous
vehicle setting they're thinking of

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640
vehicle setting they're thinking of
 

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.960
vehicle setting they're thinking of
something like binary control and

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:43.970
something like binary control and
 

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.040
something like binary control and
especially in the last talk we got this

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.050
especially in the last talk we got this
 

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.010
especially in the last talk we got this
idea of this handoff problem where the

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:49.020
idea of this handoff problem where the
 

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.390
idea of this handoff problem where the
human driver is in control but we're

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:50.400
human driver is in control but we're
 

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.800
human driver is in control but we're
trying to figure out when to hand off

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:51.810
trying to figure out when to hand off
 

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.930
trying to figure out when to hand off
control to the autonomous system or if

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940
control to the autonomous system or if
 

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.430
control to the autonomous system or if
the autonomous system is in control we

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440
the autonomous system is in control we
 

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.080
the autonomous system is in control we
want to figure out when the autonomous

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.090
want to figure out when the autonomous
 

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.220
want to figure out when the autonomous
system doesn't know what's going on and

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:58.230
system doesn't know what's going on and
 

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.890
system doesn't know what's going on and
I can hand off control back to the human

00:11:59.890 --> 00:11:59.900
I can hand off control back to the human
 

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.630
I can hand off control back to the human
this is actually a much simpler problem

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640
this is actually a much simpler problem
 

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.700
this is actually a much simpler problem
than what we're dealing with in our lab

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:04.710
than what we're dealing with in our lab
 

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.230
than what we're dealing with in our lab
which is shared control which instead of

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240
which is shared control which instead of
 

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.180
which is shared control which instead of
this binary switch we're dealing with

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:08.190
this binary switch we're dealing with
 

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.160
this binary switch we're dealing with
actually a fusion of the two control

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.170
actually a fusion of the two control
 

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.240
actually a fusion of the two control
systems so not only do we have to decide

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.250
systems so not only do we have to decide
 

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.240
systems so not only do we have to decide
when which system to trust more but we

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.250
when which system to trust more but we
 

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.950
when which system to trust more but we
actually have to determine the best way

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:18.960
actually have to determine the best way
 

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.350
actually have to determine the best way
to fuse them together in a very natural

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360
to fuse them together in a very natural
 

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.140
to fuse them together in a very natural
manner such that the human who is always

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:24.150
manner such that the human who is always
 

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.730
manner such that the human who is always
driving the car it doesn't feel like

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740
driving the car it doesn't feel like
 

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.470
driving the car it doesn't feel like
they're losing control of what they're

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480
they're losing control of what they're
 

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.980
they're losing control of what they're
doing this actually results in us not

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:30.990
doing this actually results in us not
 

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.600
doing this actually results in us not
being able to rely on many of the

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:32.610
being able to rely on many of the
 

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.730
being able to rely on many of the
classical techniques for controlling our

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740
classical techniques for controlling our
 

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.999
classical techniques for controlling our
car

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:36.009

which a lot of other industries and

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.610
which a lot of other industries and
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.259
which a lot of other industries and
academic institutions have have gone

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:43.269
academic institutions have have gone
 

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:46.230
academic institutions have have gone
through so I'd actually like to take a

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240
through so I'd actually like to take a
 

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.790
through so I'd actually like to take a
second just through this slide and

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800
second just through this slide and
 

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.840
second just through this slide and
actually talk about how we achieve

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:48.850
actually talk about how we achieve
 

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.650
actually talk about how we achieve
control of our cars so one option is

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:52.660
control of our cars so one option is
 

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.720
control of our cars so one option is
that we can we can do this by actually

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.730
that we can we can do this by actually
 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.400
that we can we can do this by actually
connecting a motor straight to the

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.410
connecting a motor straight to the
 

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.850
connecting a motor straight to the
steering wheel or to the throttle and

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860
steering wheel or to the throttle and
 

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.069
steering wheel or to the throttle and
actually commanding the internal engine

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079
actually commanding the internal engine
 

00:13:02.079 --> 00:13:04.410
actually commanding the internal engine
of this motor to to turn the steering

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:04.420
of this motor to to turn the steering
 

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.179
of this motor to to turn the steering
wheel itself and this suffers a lot from

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:06.189
wheel itself and this suffers a lot from
 

00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:08.189
wheel itself and this suffers a lot from
we actually tried this it's really

00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199
we actually tried this it's really
 

00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:09.569
we actually tried this it's really
difficult to get this kind of system

00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:09.579
difficult to get this kind of system
 

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:11.369
difficult to get this kind of system
working it's very fragile and practice

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:11.379
working it's very fragile and practice
 

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.139
working it's very fragile and practice
very brittle it suffers from

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:13.149
very brittle it suffers from
 

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:15.569
very brittle it suffers from
responsiveness also durability over time

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:15.579
responsiveness also durability over time
 

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.759
responsiveness also durability over time
as you could imagine the second way

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:17.769
as you could imagine the second way
 

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:19.290
as you could imagine the second way
which is really the classical way in

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.300
which is really the classical way in
 

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.269
which is really the classical way in
many industries that many industries are

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279
many industries that many industries are
 

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:24.030

taking is to actually send canned

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040
taking is to actually send canned
 

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.490
taking is to actually send canned
messages to the board to the car can

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:26.500
messages to the board to the car can
 

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.679
messages to the board to the car can
it's like this language that cars can

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:28.689
it's like this language that cars can
 

00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:30.449
it's like this language that cars can
take to actually communicate with

00:13:30.449 --> 00:13:30.459
take to actually communicate with
 

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:32.610
take to actually communicate with
different parts of the car so one way

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:32.620
different parts of the car so one way
 

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.259
different parts of the car so one way
that you can imagine is us just sending

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:34.269
that you can imagine is us just sending
 

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:35.939
that you can imagine is us just sending
the can codes for steering wheel angle

00:13:35.939 --> 00:13:35.949
the can codes for steering wheel angle
 

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.249
the can codes for steering wheel angle
to the car and then controlling it like

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:38.259
to the car and then controlling it like
 

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:40.800
to the car and then controlling it like
that this actually is not possible in a

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:40.810
that this actually is not possible in a
 

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.240
that this actually is not possible in a
shared control paradigm so this is

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.250
shared control paradigm so this is
 

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.590
shared control paradigm so this is
possible if we're talking about binary

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600
possible if we're talking about binary
 

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.660
possible if we're talking about binary
control but in shared control we

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:45.670
control but in shared control we
 

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.780
control but in shared control we
actually want to read the effort of the

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:48.790
actually want to read the effort of the
 

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.790
actually want to read the effort of the
human on the wheel we don't care about

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800
human on the wheel we don't care about
 

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.210
human on the wheel we don't care about
yeah per se we don't care about the

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220
yeah per se we don't care about the
 

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.800
yeah per se we don't care about the
angle that the wheel is turned we really

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:55.810
angle that the wheel is turned we really
 

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.240
angle that the wheel is turned we really
care about how much effort is being

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.250
care about how much effort is being
 

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.480
care about how much effort is being
exerted on the wheel so something more

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.490
exerted on the wheel so something more
 

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.460
exerted on the wheel so something more
like we care about the torque rather

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:02.470
like we care about the torque rather
 

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.499
like we care about the torque rather
than the actual angle of the wheel at

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:04.509
than the actual angle of the wheel at
 

00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:07.290
than the actual angle of the wheel at
that instant so instead we have to turn

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:07.300
that instant so instead we have to turn
 

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.329
that instant so instead we have to turn
to this third approach which is actually

00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:09.339
to this third approach which is actually
 

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:11.970
to this third approach which is actually
what we did which is actually spoofing

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:11.980
what we did which is actually spoofing
 

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.910
what we did which is actually spoofing
the input systems of the car this

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920
the input systems of the car this
 

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.050
the input systems of the car this
essentially means that we've created

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.060
essentially means that we've created
 

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.509
essentially means that we've created
drive-by-wire capability by sending the

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519
drive-by-wire capability by sending the
 

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:21.809
drive-by-wire capability by sending the
car like fake or synthetic data this

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:21.819
car like fake or synthetic data this
 

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.540
car like fake or synthetic data this
makes it believe that the human is still

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:24.550
makes it believe that the human is still
 

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.549
makes it believe that the human is still
controlling it but it is not able to

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:26.559
controlling it but it is not able to
 

00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:28.170
controlling it but it is not able to
accurately observe the observation that

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:28.180
accurately observe the observation that
 

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.249
accurately observe the observation that
the human is doing because we're

00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:29.259
the human is doing because we're
 

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:30.929
the human is doing because we're
spoofing the input signals and combining

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:30.939
spoofing the input signals and combining
 

00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:33.650
spoofing the input signals and combining
them with our autonomy controller and

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660
them with our autonomy controller and
 

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.629
them with our autonomy controller and
this is what we've created in our lab it

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639
this is what we've created in our lab it
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.939
this is what we've created in our lab it
this approach really leads to a very

00:14:38.939 --> 00:14:38.949
this approach really leads to a very
 

00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:42.929
this approach really leads to a very
unique control system and to summarize

00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:42.939
unique control system and to summarize
 

00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:46.259
unique control system and to summarize
this really creates three distinct

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:46.269
this really creates three distinct
 

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:48.449
this really creates three distinct
autonomous modes and the first is just

00:14:48.449 --> 00:14:48.459
autonomous modes and the first is just
 

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:49.290
autonomous modes and the first is just
manual can

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:49.300
manual can
 

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.180
manual can
this just means that the human is in

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.190
this just means that the human is in
 

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.460
this just means that the human is in
complete control of the car this is what

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:53.470
complete control of the car this is what
 

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:54.990
complete control of the car this is what
we use when we're trying to focus on

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000
we use when we're trying to focus on
 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.360
we use when we're trying to focus on
things like data collection and on the

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:57.370
things like data collection and on the
 

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.090
things like data collection and on the
other extreme you can see the when the

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:00.100
other extreme you can see the when the
 

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.560
other extreme you can see the when the
computer controls the car so this is

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:01.570
computer controls the car so this is
 

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.470
computer controls the car so this is
when you have no human input and this is

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480
when you have no human input and this is
 

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.970
when you have no human input and this is
what people usually talk about when they

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:05.980
what people usually talk about when they
 

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.980
what people usually talk about when they
talk about autonomous vehicles so this

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:07.990
talk about autonomous vehicles so this
 

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:10.190
talk about autonomous vehicles so this
is just the computer controlling the car

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.200
is just the computer controlling the car
 

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.600
is just the computer controlling the car
but also what's unique here that I'd

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:12.610
but also what's unique here that I'd
 

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.730
but also what's unique here that I'd
like to really hammer home this point is

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:14.740
like to really hammer home this point is
 

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.230
like to really hammer home this point is
that we've created this third mode which

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240
that we've created this third mode which
 

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.600
that we've created this third mode which
is a combination of both manual and

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:18.610
is a combination of both manual and
 

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.440
is a combination of both manual and
computer which we call parallel autonomy

autonomous driving pipeline and this

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:35.230
autonomous driving pipeline and this
 

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.320

to actually learn the steering control
 

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.820
to actually learn the steering control
of a car but not only learn the control

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:50.830
of a car but not only learn the control
 

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.740
of a car but not only learn the control
but actually learn the bounds the safe

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:52.750
but actually learn the bounds the safe
 

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.930
but actually learn the bounds the safe

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:54.940
and valid bounds for controlling in that
 

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.410

situations so imagine if you are at an

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.380
situations so imagine if you are at an
 

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.140

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:42.530
control actions and we do this by first
 

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.430
control actions and we do this by first
discretizing our entire action space of

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440
discretizing our entire action space of
 

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.560
discretizing our entire action space of

all steering wheel angles to handle
 

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.170
all steering wheel angles to handle
ambiguity and then learn a neural

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:50.180
ambiguity and then learn a neural
 

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.520
ambiguity and then learn a neural

distribution then we transform this

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.010
distribution then we transform this
 

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.070
distribution then we transform this
discrete distribution into a continuous

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080
discrete distribution into a continuous

actions so when we start out we haven't

00:19:56.919 --> 00:19:56.929
actions so when we start out we haven't
 

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.360

seen any training data so we see

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:58.370
seen any training data so we see

but now if the human takes an action it

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:02.630
but now if the human takes an action it
 

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.770

took would look like so it has a value

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:17.900
took would look like so it has a value
 

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.900

doesn't necessarily have to be the exact
 

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.750
doesn't necessarily have to be the exact
same intersection but the human turned

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760
same intersection but the human turned
 

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.000
same intersection but the human turned
left again so now the network will now

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.010
left again so now the network will now
 

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.490

starting to discourage the left action
even though it learned that before so it

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.030
even though it learned that before so it
 

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.460
even though it learned that before so it
actually starts to forget some of that

straight runs eventually the model will
 

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.919
straight runs eventually the model will
even learn that right sorry if we keep

so this is really awesome because it

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:02.990
so this is really awesome because it
 

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.480
so this is really awesome because it

this has two modes this is corresponding

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:16.340
this has two modes this is corresponding
 

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.180
this has two modes this is corresponding
to a situation where the car can either

distribution so the mean simply

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840
distribution so the mean simply
 

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.810

represents the steering wheel angle that
 

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.210
represents the steering wheel angle that
is most likely or most confident so this

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:31.220
is most likely or most confident so this
 

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.230
is most likely or most confident so this
is the angle that the car should

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240
is the angle that the car should
 

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.330

the variance simply reflects some sort

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.370
the variance simply reflects some sort
 

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.240
the variance simply reflects some sort
of uncertainty about that mean so the

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:40.250
of uncertainty about that mean so the
 

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.040
of uncertainty about that mean so the
larger the variance the more uncertain

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:42.050
larger the variance the more uncertain
 

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.710
larger the variance the more uncertain

heard of expectation maximization this

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.170
heard of expectation maximization this
 

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.520
heard of expectation maximization this
is a technique that's very similar so an

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:08.530
is a technique that's very similar so an
 

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.680
is a technique that's very similar so an
e/m or expectation maximization you have

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:11.690
e/m or expectation maximization you have
 

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.690

modes that you expect your distribution
 

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.770
modes that you expect your distribution
to have and this is really the the

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:17.780
to have and this is really the the
 

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.020

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.030
difference with variational Bayes is
 

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.640
difference with variational Bayes is
that you don't have to predefined the

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:21.650
that you don't have to predefined the
 

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.960
that you don't have to predefined the

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:22.970
number of modes you simply have to
 

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.780
number of modes you simply have to
define an upper bound to the maximum

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:25.790
define an upper bound to the maximum
 

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.040
define an upper bound to the maximum
number of modes that you would ever

so for us we use something like 15 modes

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:32.570
so for us we use something like 15 modes
 

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.810
so for us we use something like 15 modes
we never expect to see more than 15

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:34.820
we never expect to see more than 15
 

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.580
we never expect to see more than 15
possible different actions to take on a

possible different actions to take on a
 

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.380
possible different actions to take on a
road so this is really an upper bound

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:38.390
road so this is really an upper bound
 

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.300
road so this is really an upper bound
and then what happens is we feed in our

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:40.310
and then what happens is we feed in our
 

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.560
and then what happens is we feed in our
discrete distribution and then

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:41.570
discrete distribution and then
 

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.310
discrete distribution and then
iteratively we start to kill off modes

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320
iteratively we start to kill off modes
 

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.530
iteratively we start to kill off modes
that lose that that lose power right so

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:50.540
that lose that that lose power right so
 

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.810
that lose that that lose power right so
I won't go into too much detail on how

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:52.820
I won't go into too much detail on how
 

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.430
I won't go into too much detail on how
this actually happens but this is really

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440
this actually happens but this is really
 

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.340
this actually happens but this is really
the amazing thing about variation obey

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:57.350
the amazing thing about variation obey
 

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.130
the amazing thing about variation obey

compared to something like
 

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.110
compared to something like
expectation-maximization and I encourage

discrete distribution can actually be
 

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.390

so here here's an example of a scene

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:45.650
so here here's an example of a scene
 

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.250
so here here's an example of a scene
where the cars turning left you can see

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:48.260
where the cars turning left you can see
 

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.500
where the cars turning left you can see
the extracted discrete distribution is

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:50.510
the extracted discrete distribution is
 

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.140
the extracted discrete distribution is
actually heavily focused on the left

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.150
actually heavily focused on the left
 

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.990
actually heavily focused on the left
part of the control you can also see the

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000
part of the control you can also see the
 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.299

to you about how these bounds are

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640
to you about how these bounds are
 

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.130
to you about how these bounds are
computed yet but I'll get back to that

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.140

very soon a very similar situation here

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:07.460
very soon a very similar situation here
 

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.730
very soon a very similar situation here
is if if I again show you a unimodal

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:09.740
is if if I again show you a unimodal
 

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.560
is if if I again show you a unimodal
action so this is still a with

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:13.570
action so this is still a with
 

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:18.340
action so this is still a with
unambiguous control setting but here the

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:18.350
unambiguous control setting but here the
 

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.770
unambiguous control setting but here the
road has been slightly widened so the

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:20.780
road has been slightly widened so the
 

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.799
road has been slightly widened so the
variance has actually been increased

00:27:22.799 --> 00:27:22.809
variance has actually been increased
 

00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:24.940
variance has actually been increased
right but this is actually not showing

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:24.950
right but this is actually not showing
 

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.560
right but this is actually not showing
off the full capabilities of our

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:26.570
off the full capabilities of our
 

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.409
off the full capabilities of our
approach because the whole reason that I

00:27:28.409 --> 00:27:28.419
approach because the whole reason that I
 

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:30.520
approach because the whole reason that I
motivated this approach was to deal with

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:30.530
motivated this approach was to deal with
 

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.039
motivated this approach was to deal with
ambiguity deal with uncertainty in the

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:33.049
ambiguity deal with uncertainty in the
 

00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:34.360
ambiguity deal with uncertainty in the
environment so let's actually see

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.370
environment so let's actually see
 

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.830
environment so let's actually see
something much more interesting let's go

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840
something much more interesting let's go
 

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.230
something much more interesting let's go
to an intersection so now at an

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240
to an intersection so now at an
 

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.870
to an intersection so now at an
intersection we can finally see

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880
intersection we can finally see
 

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.460
intersection we can finally see
multimodal distributions and multimodal

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:42.470
multimodal distributions and multimodal
 

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.820
multimodal distributions and multimodal
Peaks emerging so at this and at this

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:45.830
Peaks emerging so at this and at this
 

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.100
Peaks emerging so at this and at this
intersection this is a t-intersection

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.110
intersection this is a t-intersection
 

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.779
intersection this is a t-intersection
it's possible to either turn left or

00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:49.789
it's possible to either turn left or
 

00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:52.330
it's possible to either turn left or
right and you can see three modes

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:52.340
right and you can see three modes
 

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.539
right and you can see three modes
emerging from this distribution the

00:27:55.539 --> 00:27:55.549
emerging from this distribution the
 

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:57.279
emerging from this distribution the
three modes are as you'd expect left and

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:57.289
three modes are as you'd expect left and
 

00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:58.810
three modes are as you'd expect left and
right but also we see the straight mode

00:27:58.810 --> 00:27:58.820
right but also we see the straight mode
 

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.970
right but also we see the straight mode
also emerging and if you look at what

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:00.980
also emerging and if you look at what
 

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.649
also emerging and if you look at what
the human actually did in this scenario

00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:02.659
the human actually did in this scenario
 

00:28:02.659 --> 00:28:05.049
the human actually did in this scenario
it was actually to go straight as well

00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:05.059
it was actually to go straight as well
 

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:08.080
it was actually to go straight as well
so at this instant the control command

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:08.090
so at this instant the control command
 

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:10.090
so at this instant the control command
was to go straight but then if you go

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:10.100
was to go straight but then if you go
 

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.139
was to go straight but then if you go
forward two or three

00:28:11.139 --> 00:28:11.149
forward two or three
 

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:12.669
forward two or three
you'll see that that straight actually

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679
you'll see that that straight actually
 

00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:13.959
you'll see that that straight actually
becomes a right so they were trying to

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:13.969
becomes a right so they were trying to
 

00:28:13.969 --> 00:28:15.849
becomes a right so they were trying to
just basically go around something and

00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:15.859
just basically go around something and
 

00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:17.169
just basically go around something and
you can see that this is actually

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:17.179
you can see that this is actually
 

00:28:17.179 --> 00:28:18.430
you can see that this is actually
incredible because the model has

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440
incredible because the model has
 

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.799
incredible because the model has
captured picked up on this and actually

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:20.809
captured picked up on this and actually
 

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:22.930
captured picked up on this and actually
captured that to actually turn right or

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:22.940
captured that to actually turn right or
 

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.239
captured that to actually turn right or
it goes left you actually have to go

00:28:25.239 --> 00:28:25.249
it goes left you actually have to go
 

00:28:25.249 --> 00:28:29.560
it goes left you actually have to go
straight first so now let's take an

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:29.570
straight first so now let's take an
 

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.959
straight first so now let's take an
example of that let's take a look at two

00:28:31.959 --> 00:28:31.969
example of that let's take a look at two
 

00:28:31.969 --> 00:28:38.499
example of that let's take a look at two
examples of the system in real life so

00:28:38.499 --> 00:28:38.509
examples of the system in real life so
 

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:40.450
examples of the system in real life so
first on the left is an example of

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460
first on the left is an example of
 

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.249
first on the left is an example of
navigating intersections reliably

00:28:42.249 --> 00:28:42.259
navigating intersections reliably
 

00:28:42.259 --> 00:28:44.589
navigating intersections reliably
without spurious leery planning so you

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:44.599
without spurious leery planning so you
 

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:47.139
without spurious leery planning so you
can see many four-way intersections and

00:28:47.139 --> 00:28:47.149
can see many four-way intersections and
 

00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:49.209
can see many four-way intersections and
we're able to successfully navigate

00:28:49.209 --> 00:28:49.219
we're able to successfully navigate
 

00:28:49.219 --> 00:28:51.820
we're able to successfully navigate
through those without any jittering or

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:51.830
through those without any jittering or
 

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.529
through those without any jittering or
anything like that and on the right you

00:28:53.529 --> 00:28:53.539
anything like that and on the right you
 

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:55.259
anything like that and on the right you
can see the vehicle successfully

00:28:55.259 --> 00:28:55.269
can see the vehicle successfully
 

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:57.700
can see the vehicle successfully
handling roads with huge cracks and

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:57.710
handling roads with huge cracks and
 

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.940
handling roads with huge cracks and
grass and vegetation growing on them so

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:00.950
grass and vegetation growing on them so
 

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.560
grass and vegetation growing on them so
keep in mind that this network has never

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:02.570
keep in mind that this network has never
 

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.049
keep in mind that this network has never
seen these roads before it has only been

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:05.059
seen these roads before it has only been
 

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:07.539
seen these roads before it has only been
trained on highway and residential

00:29:07.539 --> 00:29:07.549
trained on highway and residential
 

00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:10.089
trained on highway and residential
streets and we only fine-tuned it using

00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:10.099
streets and we only fine-tuned it using
 

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:14.849
streets and we only fine-tuned it using
one minute of data without lane markers

00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:14.859
 
 

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:17.139
 
so this is really exciting because it

00:29:17.139 --> 00:29:17.149
so this is really exciting because it
 

00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:19.419
so this is really exciting because it
shows that we can control the car even

00:29:19.419 --> 00:29:19.429
shows that we can control the car even
 

00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:22.329
shows that we can control the car even
with minimal training data in the actual

00:29:22.329 --> 00:29:22.339
with minimal training data in the actual
 

00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:24.099
with minimal training data in the actual
environment that we're trying to test on

00:29:24.099 --> 00:29:24.109
environment that we're trying to test on
 

00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:25.389
environment that we're trying to test on
we just have to do a little bit of

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399
we just have to do a little bit of
 

00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:28.810
we just have to do a little bit of
fine-tuning and by actually predicting

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:28.820
fine-tuning and by actually predicting
 

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.609
fine-tuning and by actually predicting
the uncertainty with this we're able to

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:30.619
the uncertainty with this we're able to
 

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:32.499
the uncertainty with this we're able to
get some robustness in our control

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:32.509
get some robustness in our control
 

00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:35.649
get some robustness in our control
signal as well but in the first part of

00:29:35.649 --> 00:29:35.659
signal as well but in the first part of
 

00:29:35.659 --> 00:29:37.180
signal as well but in the first part of
this talk I talked to you all about

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.190
this talk I talked to you all about
 

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.279
this talk I talked to you all about
parallel autonomy so what's the

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:39.289
parallel autonomy so what's the
 

00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:40.869
parallel autonomy so what's the
connection here with with this approach

00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:40.879
connection here with with this approach
 

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:44.019
connection here with with this approach
to parallel autonomy so in addition to

00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:44.029
to parallel autonomy so in addition to
 

00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:45.669
to parallel autonomy so in addition to
predicting the control we also want to

00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679
predicting the control we also want to
 

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:49.329
predicting the control we also want to
predict control bounds that we can

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:49.339
predict control bounds that we can
 

00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:50.979
predict control bounds that we can
really use in a parallel autonomous

00:29:50.979 --> 00:29:50.989
really use in a parallel autonomous
 

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:53.919
really use in a parallel autonomous
setting so given the setup and the

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:53.929
setting so given the setup and the
 

00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:55.959
setting so given the setup and the
framework that we've talked about so far

00:29:55.959 --> 00:29:55.969
framework that we've talked about so far
 

00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:58.029
framework that we've talked about so far
this is actually extremely simple to do

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039
this is actually extremely simple to do
 

00:29:58.039 --> 00:29:59.560
this is actually extremely simple to do
so this is the beauty of setting it up

00:29:59.560 --> 00:29:59.570
so this is the beauty of setting it up
 

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.739
so this is the beauty of setting it up
setting the problem up the way we have

00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:01.749
setting the problem up the way we have
 

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:03.700
setting the problem up the way we have
moving into the parallel autonomy

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:03.710
moving into the parallel autonomy
 

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.839
moving into the parallel autonomy
framework is now extremely simple so

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:07.849
framework is now extremely simple so
 

00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:09.700
framework is now extremely simple so
what we can do is for each mixture of

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:09.710
what we can do is for each mixture of
 

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.529
what we can do is for each mixture of
our continuous Gaussian we simply have

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:11.539
our continuous Gaussian we simply have
 

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:14.289
our continuous Gaussian we simply have
to take plus or minus some scaled

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:14.299
to take plus or minus some scaled
 

00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:16.389
to take plus or minus some scaled
variance from the ideal control command

00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399
variance from the ideal control command
 

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:18.579
variance from the ideal control command
or from the mean of that mode we add

00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:18.589
or from the mean of that mode we add
 

00:30:18.589 --> 00:30:20.979
or from the mean of that mode we add
those bounds into some set of valid

00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:20.989
those bounds into some set of valid
 

00:30:20.989 --> 00:30:24.240
those bounds into some set of valid
control signals and once we have these

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.250
control signals and once we have these
 

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.280
control signals and once we have these
set of valid controls all we have to do

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:26.290
set of valid controls all we have to do
 

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.940
set of valid controls all we have to do
is simply set up a shared controller or

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:29.950
is simply set up a shared controller or
 

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.160
is simply set up a shared controller or
shared parallel Tommy controller which

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.170
shared parallel Tommy controller which
 

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.900
shared parallel Tommy controller which
is just the human control if it falls

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:33.910
is just the human control if it falls
 

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.990
is just the human control if it falls
within that bound and if the human is

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000
within that bound and if the human is
 

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.640
within that bound and if the human is
trying to do something outside of the

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:38.650
trying to do something outside of the
 

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.550
trying to do something outside of the
bound the system provides some

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:41.560
bound the system provides some
 

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560
bound the system provides some
restorative feedback to bring them back

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:43.570
restorative feedback to bring them back
 

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.390
restorative feedback to bring them back
within the bounds so now in the next

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:48.400
within the bounds so now in the next
 

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.880
within the bounds so now in the next
section of this talk I'd like to discuss

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:50.890
section of this talk I'd like to discuss
 

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.490
section of this talk I'd like to discuss
this notion of model uncertainty when

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:53.500
this notion of model uncertainty when
 

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.130
this notion of model uncertainty when
can we trust our models and this is

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.140
can we trust our models and this is
 

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.590
can we trust our models and this is
really a huge question and actually all

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600
really a huge question and actually all
 

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.090
really a huge question and actually all
of deep learning not just autonomous

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:00.100
of deep learning not just autonomous
 

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.150
of deep learning not just autonomous
vehicles but we want to essentially

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:03.160
vehicles but we want to essentially
 

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.760
vehicles but we want to essentially
accurately determine or accurately

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:05.770
accurately determine or accurately
 

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.000
accurately determine or accurately
verify that our model is is confident in

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.010
verify that our model is is confident in
 

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.440
verify that our model is is confident in
the action that it's telling us to take

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:10.450
the action that it's telling us to take
 

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.900
the action that it's telling us to take
at that given instant of time so I hope

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:14.910
at that given instant of time so I hope
 

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.280
at that given instant of time so I hope
this notion of uncertainty is pretty

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.290
this notion of uncertainty is pretty
 

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.860
this notion of uncertainty is pretty
clear like the motivation of why we care

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:19.870
clear like the motivation of why we care
 

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.240
clear like the motivation of why we care
about uncertainty is pretty clear to all

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.250
about uncertainty is pretty clear to all
 

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.270
about uncertainty is pretty clear to all
of you especially in a talk about

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:24.280
of you especially in a talk about
 

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.590
of you especially in a talk about
autonomous vehicles so autonomous

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600
autonomous vehicles so autonomous
 

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.780
autonomous vehicles so autonomous
vehicles are one of like the most safety

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:30.790
vehicles are one of like the most safety
 

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.730
vehicles are one of like the most safety
critical robotic applications where it

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:32.740
critical robotic applications where it
 

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.750
critical robotic applications where it
is extremely important for us to

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760
is extremely important for us to
 

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.360
is extremely important for us to
prioritize safety in these systems that

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.370
prioritize safety in these systems that
 

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.880
prioritize safety in these systems that
we're building so what we've learned so

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:41.890
we're building so what we've learned so
 

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.340
we're building so what we've learned so
far is that modeling probabilities for

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.350
far is that modeling probabilities for
 

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.320
far is that modeling probabilities for
fixed classes like we do for discrete

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:46.330
fixed classes like we do for discrete
 

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:49.170
fixed classes like we do for discrete
control signals is actually different

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:49.180
control signals is actually different
 

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.880
control signals is actually different
than looking at the uncertainty of the

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:50.890
than looking at the uncertainty of the
 

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.310
than looking at the uncertainty of the
model as a whole so take for example if

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320
model as a whole so take for example if
 

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.560
model as a whole so take for example if
I want to train this model of cats and

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:55.570
I want to train this model of cats and
 

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.720
I want to train this model of cats and
dogs just to recognize a picture of a

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:57.730
dogs just to recognize a picture of a
 

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.220
dogs just to recognize a picture of a
cat and a dog and at the output I'm

00:31:59.220 --> 00:31:59.230
cat and a dog and at the output I'm
 

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.540
cat and a dog and at the output I'm
predicting a softmax layer that

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:00.550
predicting a softmax layer that
 

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.250
predicting a softmax layer that
represents probability being a cat

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:02.260
represents probability being a cat
 

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.800
represents probability being a cat
probability of being a dog now if I show

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:04.810
probability of being a dog now if I show
 

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.670
probability of being a dog now if I show
this model a picture of a cat assuming

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:08.680
this model a picture of a cat assuming
 

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.050
this model a picture of a cat assuming
that the model has been sufficiently

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.060
that the model has been sufficiently
 

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.210
that the model has been sufficiently
trained I'd expect that this model gives

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:12.220
trained I'd expect that this model gives
 

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.580
trained I'd expect that this model gives
me an answer of yes this is definitely a

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:14.590
me an answer of yes this is definitely a
 

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.130
me an answer of yes this is definitely a
cat and I expect that model to be very

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:17.140
cat and I expect that model to be very
 

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.920
cat and I expect that model to be very
confident in its answer right so in this

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:19.930
confident in its answer right so in this
 

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.240
confident in its answer right so in this
scenario they're the same thing but now

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.250
scenario they're the same thing but now
 

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.680
scenario they're the same thing but now
let's think about a different scenario

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:22.690
let's think about a different scenario
 

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.200
let's think about a different scenario
what if I feed that same model a picture

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.210
what if I feed that same model a picture
 

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.230
what if I feed that same model a picture
of a horse alright so these two output

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240
of a horse alright so these two output
 

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.810
of a horse alright so these two output
probabilities are still fixed so the

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:30.820
probabilities are still fixed so the
 

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.180
probabilities are still fixed so the
model will still output the probability

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:33.190
model will still output the probability
 

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.770
model will still output the probability
of being a cat or the probability of dog

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:34.780
of being a cat or the probability of dog
 

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.440
of being a cat or the probability of dog
and by definition those output

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.450
and by definition those output
 

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.130
and by definition those output
probabilities

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:38.140
probabilities
 

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.750
probabilities
have to add up to one so by definition

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760
have to add up to one so by definition
 

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.500
have to add up to one so by definition
one of them has to be greater than 0.5

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:42.510
one of them has to be greater than 0.5
 

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.610
one of them has to be greater than 0.5
right so even though one of the

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:44.620
right so even though one of the
 

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.180
right so even though one of the
probabilities are very high it may seem

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:47.190
probabilities are very high it may seem
 

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.710
probabilities are very high it may seem
it actually does not mean that the model

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720
it actually does not mean that the model
 

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.389
it actually does not mean that the model
is confident in predicting that this

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399
is confident in predicting that this
 

00:32:51.399 --> 00:32:53.909
is confident in predicting that this
horse is a dog and in fact what we want

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919
horse is a dog and in fact what we want
 

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:55.500
horse is a dog and in fact what we want
to see is that the uncertainty of this

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:55.510
to see is that the uncertainty of this
 

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.690
to see is that the uncertainty of this
model in this scenario is very low and

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:57.700
model in this scenario is very low and
 

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.880
model in this scenario is very low and
that's something that that motivates

00:32:59.880 --> 00:32:59.890
that's something that that motivates
 

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.419
that's something that that motivates
this this whole notion of problem

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:02.429
this this whole notion of problem
 

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:05.220
this this whole notion of problem
uncertainty or confidence and the key

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:05.230
uncertainty or confidence and the key
 

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:06.810
uncertainty or confidence and the key
point that I want to hammer home here is

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:06.820
point that I want to hammer home here is
 

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.549
point that I want to hammer home here is
that neural network probabilities

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559
that neural network probabilities
 

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:10.700
that neural network probabilities
created through softmax layers do not

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:10.710
created through softmax layers do not
 

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.169
created through softmax layers do not
correspond to confidence they don't

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:13.179
correspond to confidence they don't
 

00:33:13.179 --> 00:33:15.000
correspond to confidence they don't
measure uncertainty even though many

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.010
measure uncertainty even though many
 

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.180
measure uncertainty even though many
people actually makes the two terms

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:18.190
people actually makes the two terms
 

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:23.639
people actually makes the two terms
entertain and interchangeable so this

00:33:23.639 --> 00:33:23.649
entertain and interchangeable so this
 

00:33:23.649 --> 00:33:24.930
entertain and interchangeable so this
brings into question how we can actually

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:24.940
brings into question how we can actually
 

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.480
brings into question how we can actually
determine model uncertainty and for this

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:27.490
determine model uncertainty and for this
 

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.250
determine model uncertainty and for this
we turn to this really hot field in deep

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.260
we turn to this really hot field in deep
 

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.299
we turn to this really hot field in deep
learning right now which is called

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:30.309
learning right now which is called
 

00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:32.519
learning right now which is called
Bayesian deep learning and just as in

00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:32.529
Bayesian deep learning and just as in
 

00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:35.310
Bayesian deep learning and just as in
just as an example of the power of

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320
just as an example of the power of
 

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.759
just as an example of the power of
Bayesian deep learning let's take let's

00:33:38.759 --> 00:33:38.769
Bayesian deep learning let's take let's
 

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:40.409
Bayesian deep learning let's take let's
take a look at this figure here so this

00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:40.419
take a look at this figure here so this
 

00:33:40.419 --> 00:33:42.779
take a look at this figure here so this
is a system that was built to take as

00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:42.789
is a system that was built to take as
 

00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:46.169
is a system that was built to take as
input a single image and output the

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:46.179
input a single image and output the
 

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:48.960
input a single image and output the
predicted depth of every single pixel in

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:48.970
predicted depth of every single pixel in
 

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:53.129
predicted depth of every single pixel in
that image so when we use Bayesian deep

00:33:53.129 --> 00:33:53.139
that image so when we use Bayesian deep
 

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:54.870
that image so when we use Bayesian deep
learning what we actually want to do is

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880
learning what we actually want to do is
 

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.480
learning what we actually want to do is
compute this very very rich uncertainty

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:57.490
compute this very very rich uncertainty
 

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.610
compute this very very rich uncertainty
estimates for this neural network and we

00:33:59.610 --> 00:33:59.620
estimates for this neural network and we
 

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.129
estimates for this neural network and we
want to say for every single pixel what

00:34:02.129 --> 00:34:02.139
want to say for every single pixel what
 

00:34:02.139 --> 00:34:04.970
want to say for every single pixel what
is the confidence in that prediction and

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980
is the confidence in that prediction and
 

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.049
is the confidence in that prediction and
Bayesian deep learning really allows us

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:07.059
Bayesian deep learning really allows us
 

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:10.290
Bayesian deep learning really allows us
to do this in a systematic manner and

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:10.300
to do this in a systematic manner and
 

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.659
to do this in a systematic manner and
it's really remarkable because we can

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:12.669
it's really remarkable because we can
 

00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:14.760
it's really remarkable because we can
see some really interesting things that

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:14.770
see some really interesting things that
 

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.800
see some really interesting things that
start to arise so you can see that the

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:16.810
start to arise so you can see that the
 

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.450
start to arise so you can see that the
model is most uncertain around like the

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:18.460
model is most uncertain around like the
 

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.000
model is most uncertain around like the
edges of the cars also the shadows

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.010
edges of the cars also the shadows
 

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.919
edges of the cars also the shadows
underneath the cars and even the

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:22.929
underneath the cars and even the
 

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.720
underneath the cars and even the
reflections and the windows because then

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:24.730
reflections and the windows because then
 

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.520
reflections and the windows because then
the reflections you actually see trees

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:26.530
the reflections you actually see trees
 

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.139
the reflections you actually see trees
that are far away so the model is able

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:28.149
that are far away so the model is able
 

00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:29.940
that are far away so the model is able
to capture some very natural sense of

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:29.950
to capture some very natural sense of
 

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:33.960
to capture some very natural sense of
uncertainty so now the question becomes

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:33.970
uncertainty so now the question becomes
 

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:36.960
uncertainty so now the question becomes
how can we apply these techniques to the

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:36.970
how can we apply these techniques to the
 

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.460
how can we apply these techniques to the
end-to-end driving scenario for

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:38.470
end-to-end driving scenario for
 

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.129
end-to-end driving scenario for
self-driving cars so let's revisit the

00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:41.139
self-driving cars so let's revisit the
 

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.740
self-driving cars so let's revisit the
original end-to-end pipeline so this is

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:43.750
original end-to-end pipeline so this is
 

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.149
original end-to-end pipeline so this is
actually a different pipeline that I

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:45.159
actually a different pipeline that I
 

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.409
actually a different pipeline that I
talked about in the first talk this is

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:46.419
talked about in the first talk this is
 

00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:48.570
talked about in the first talk this is
an even simpler one so this is basically

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:48.580
an even simpler one so this is basically
 

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.220
an even simpler one so this is basically
the pipeline that NVIDIA has created for

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:50.230
the pipeline that NVIDIA has created for
 

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.570
the pipeline that NVIDIA has created for
their autonomous vehicles so this is

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:51.580
their autonomous vehicles so this is
 

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:51.990
their autonomous vehicles so this is
taking

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000
taking
 

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.879
taking
single image and predicting just a

00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:53.889
single image and predicting just a
 

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.740
single image and predicting just a
single control value there is no notion

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:55.750
single control value there is no notion
 

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.240
single control value there is no notion
of probability distributions like we

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:57.250
of probability distributions like we
 

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.680
of probability distributions like we
talked about before I'm just predicting

00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:58.690
talked about before I'm just predicting
 

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.020
talked about before I'm just predicting
a single real number we've already

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.030
a single real number we've already
 

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.520
a single real number we've already
discussed the issues with this approach

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:02.530
discussed the issues with this approach
 

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.340
discussed the issues with this approach
we lack uncertainty we lack ambiguous

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:05.350
we lack uncertainty we lack ambiguous
 

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.920
we lack uncertainty we lack ambiguous
scenario handling so instead what if we

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:10.930
scenario handling so instead what if we
 

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.680
scenario handling so instead what if we
can maintain this architecture but we

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:13.690
can maintain this architecture but we
 

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.150
can maintain this architecture but we
still want to create some sort of

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160
still want to create some sort of
 

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.000
still want to create some sort of
uncertainty so we can recently we can

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.010
uncertainty so we can recently we can
 

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.400
uncertainty so we can recently we can
actually reason about the confidence of

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:20.410
actually reason about the confidence of
 

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.980
actually reason about the confidence of
our model with that control and the way

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:22.990
our model with that control and the way
 

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.920
our model with that control and the way
we can do that is actually by

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:25.930
we can do that is actually by
 

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.320
we can do that is actually by
stochastically sampling over our output

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.330
stochastically sampling over our output
 

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.430
stochastically sampling over our output
to deterministically sorry to

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:32.440
to deterministically sorry to
 

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.530
to deterministically sorry to
deterministic sorry we want to sample

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:34.540
deterministic sorry we want to sample
 

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.530
deterministic sorry we want to sample
over our deterministic control signal to

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:37.540
over our deterministic control signal to
 

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.480
over our deterministic control signal to
actually obtain an expectation and

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.490
actually obtain an expectation and
 

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.630
actually obtain an expectation and
variance of that instance so this will

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640
variance of that instance so this will
 

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.310
variance of that instance so this will
give us the expectation is essentially

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320
give us the expectation is essentially
 

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.560
give us the expectation is essentially
the control that we want to take and the

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:46.570
the control that we want to take and the
 

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.540
the control that we want to take and the
variance is essentially the uncertainty

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:48.550
variance is essentially the uncertainty
 

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.720
variance is essentially the uncertainty
of the model at that instant so more

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:51.730
of the model at that instant so more
 

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:52.860
of the model at that instant so more
specifically we can do this using

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:52.870
specifically we can do this using
 

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.910
specifically we can do this using
patient deep learning like I said and to

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920
patient deep learning like I said and to
 

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.780
patient deep learning like I said and to
understand this let's actually

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:57.790
understand this let's actually
 

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.490
understand this let's actually
reformulate our problem a little bit

00:35:59.490 --> 00:35:59.500
reformulate our problem a little bit
 

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.610
reformulate our problem a little bit
using a bayesian state of mind so this

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:02.620
using a bayesian state of mind so this
 

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.020
using a bayesian state of mind so this
is a little different than the way we

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.030
is a little different than the way we
 

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.960
is a little different than the way we
trained our models in the previous

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:06.970
trained our models in the previous
 

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.970
trained our models in the previous
setting so now in the Bayesian deep

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:08.980
setting so now in the Bayesian deep
 

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.900
setting so now in the Bayesian deep
learning framework we want to actually

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:11.910
learning framework we want to actually
 

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.400
learning framework we want to actually
like I said have that Bayesian state of

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.410
like I said have that Bayesian state of
 

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.400
like I said have that Bayesian state of
mind so the goal here like before we're

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.410
mind so the goal here like before we're
 

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.080
mind so the goal here like before we're
trying to create a network to learn

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.090
trying to create a network to learn
 

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.880
trying to create a network to learn
staring control directly from raw data

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:20.890
staring control directly from raw data
 

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.040
staring control directly from raw data
we want to find that functional mapping

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.050
we want to find that functional mapping
 

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.810
we want to find that functional mapping
and we want to do it by minimizing some

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:24.820
and we want to do it by minimizing some
 

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.480
and we want to do it by minimizing some
empirical loss the difference here is

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:27.490
empirical loss the difference here is
 

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.430
empirical loss the difference here is
that in Bayesian neural networks were

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440
that in Bayesian neural networks were
 

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.960
that in Bayesian neural networks were
actually attempting to learn this

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:30.970
actually attempting to learn this
 

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.750
actually attempting to learn this
posterior of our weights given our data

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760
posterior of our weights given our data
 

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.300
posterior of our weights given our data
so another another way to say this is

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.310
so another another way to say this is
 

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.710
so another another way to say this is
that we want to understand the

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720
that we want to understand the
 

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.890
that we want to understand the
likelihood of observing some model given

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:40.900
likelihood of observing some model given
 

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.640
likelihood of observing some model given
the data that we see now Bayesian neural

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
the data that we see now Bayesian neural
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.020
the data that we see now Bayesian neural
networks are actually called Bayesian

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:46.030
networks are actually called Bayesian
 

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.270
networks are actually called Bayesian
neural networks because we can rewrite

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280
neural networks because we can rewrite
 

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.760
neural networks because we can rewrite
this posterior this one using Bayes rule

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:52.770
this posterior this one using Bayes rule
 

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:56.340

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:09.250
uncertainty estimates but there's
 

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.890
uncertainty estimates but there's
actually a problem here in terms of

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:10.900
actually a problem here in terms of
 

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.440
actually a problem here in terms of
convolutional layers so the original

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.450

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.390

take into account this huge spatial

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.250
take into account this huge spatial
 

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.550
take into account this huge spatial
correlation between adjacent pixels in

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.140

early convolutional layers so especially

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.150
early convolutional layers so especially
 

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.090
early convolutional layers so especially
in like I said in earlier convolutional

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:27.100
in like I said in earlier convolutional
 

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.590
in like I said in earlier convolutional
layers you're dealing with things like

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:28.600
layers you're dealing with things like
 

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.890
layers you're dealing with things like
edges and corners and and things like

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:31.900
edges and corners and and things like
 

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.200
edges and corners and and things like
that and there are massive amounts of

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:34.210
that and there are massive amounts of
 

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.970
that and there are massive amounts of
spatial correlation between the pixels

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:35.980
spatial correlation between the pixels
 

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.910
spatial correlation between the pixels
so when we apply our Bernoulli masks we

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920
so when we apply our Bernoulli masks we
 

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.100
so when we apply our Bernoulli masks we
may actually lose a lot of valuable

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.110
may actually lose a lot of valuable
 

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.780
may actually lose a lot of valuable
information and this may cause our

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:42.790
information and this may cause our
 

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.690
information and this may cause our
output to change undesirably so how do

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:45.700

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.460

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.650
we how do we handle this so let's make a
small change and instead of sampling

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:49.660

implemented in our algorithm so we found

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:37.900

studied how the uncertainty of our model

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.530
studied how the uncertainty of our model
 

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.230
studied how the uncertainty of our model
changed as a function of the steering

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240

for that specific type of control so

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:14.530
for that specific type of control so
 

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.350
for that specific type of control so
finally we found that the uncertainty

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:16.360
finally we found that the uncertainty
 

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.210
finally we found that the uncertainty
increased as we tried to make more

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:21.220
increased as we tried to make more
 

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.800

dynamic turns which you might expect

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:22.810
dynamic turns which you might expect
 

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:23.820
dynamic turns which you might expect
because when you're trying to make a

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:23.830
because when you're trying to make a
 

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.190
because when you're trying to make a
more dynamic turn you actually have less

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200
more dynamic turn you actually have less
 

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.530
more dynamic turn you actually have less
of that seen in your field of view so if

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:28.540
of that seen in your field of view so if
 

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.600
of that seen in your field of view so if
you're making a very dynamic right turn

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:30.610
you're making a very dynamic right turn
 

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.670

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.050
can see maybe even 100 meters in front
 

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.220
can see maybe even 100 meters in front
of you so this really leads to this nice

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.230
of you so this really leads to this nice
 

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.590
of you so this really leads to this nice
property which we found was we have a

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:46.600
property which we found was we have a
 

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.840
property which we found was we have a
more uncertain model as we try to make

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:48.850
more uncertain model as we try to make
 

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.960
more uncertain model as we try to make
more extreme turns this also aligns with

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:51.970
more extreme turns this also aligns with
 

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.960
more extreme turns this also aligns with
the fact that the vast amount of

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:54.970
the fact that the vast amount of
 

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.240
the fact that the vast amount of
training data comes on straight roads so

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.250
training data comes on straight roads so
 

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.980
training data comes on straight roads so
you'd expect that straight road driving

00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:58.990
you'd expect that straight road driving
 

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.310
you'd expect that straight road driving

of this talk and tie things back with
parallel autonomy once again so we

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:14.650
parallel autonomy once again so we
 

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.770
parallel autonomy once again so we
started this talk by exploring one of

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:16.780
started this talk by exploring one of
 

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.030
started this talk by exploring one of
the control algorithms that we've

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040
the control algorithms that we've
 

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.640
the control algorithms that we've
created to actually predict the control

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:23.650
created to actually predict the control
 

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.530
created to actually predict the control
of an autonomous vehicle and not only

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:25.540
of an autonomous vehicle and not only
 

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.270
of an autonomous vehicle and not only
predict the control but also predict the

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280
predict the control but also predict the
 

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.190
predict the control but also predict the
control bounds and entirely end-to-end

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200
control bounds and entirely end-to-end
 

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.770

manner we showed how we can officially
 

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.509

approach and we explored ways that we

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:35.890
approach and we explored ways that we
 

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.049
approach and we explored ways that we
can use techniques from base and deep

00:41:37.049 --> 00:41:37.059
can use techniques from base and deep
 

00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.579
can use techniques from base and deep

nothing is happening but if he tries to
 

00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:04.380
nothing is happening but if he tries to
drive off the road that you'll see in a

second the system will see that he's
 

00:42:06.189 --> 00:42:08.459
second the system will see that he's
exited the bounds and tried to provide

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:08.469
exited the bounds and tried to provide
 

00:42:08.469 --> 00:42:10.289
exited the bounds and tried to provide
restorative feedback like to what just

00:42:10.289 --> 00:42:10.299
restorative feedback like to what just
 

00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:11.489
restorative feedback like to what just
happened there you'll see another

00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:11.499
happened there you'll see another
 

00:42:11.499 --> 00:42:13.079

example where the human tries to even

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:13.089
example where the human tries to even
 

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:14.519
example where the human tries to even
more aggressively try to drive off the

00:42:14.519 --> 00:42:14.529
more aggressively try to drive off the
 

00:42:14.529 --> 00:42:17.459
more aggressively try to drive off the
left of the road where the modeler will

00:42:17.459 --> 00:42:17.469
left of the road where the modeler will
 

00:42:17.469 --> 00:42:20.429
left of the road where the modeler will
respond even more aggressively to bring

00:42:20.429 --> 00:42:20.439
respond even more aggressively to bring
 

00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:26.159
respond even more aggressively to bring
the car back onto the road so we hope

00:42:26.159 --> 00:42:26.169
the car back onto the road so we hope
 

00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:28.349
the car back onto the road so we hope
that this kind of parallel autonomy way

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359
that this kind of parallel autonomy way
 

00:42:28.359 --> 00:42:31.949
that this kind of parallel autonomy way
of thinking brings about like this this

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:31.959
of thinking brings about like this this
 

00:42:31.959 --> 00:42:34.079
of thinking brings about like this this
new realm of of autonomous driving

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:34.089
new realm of of autonomous driving
 

00:42:34.089 --> 00:42:36.899
new realm of of autonomous driving
specifically of like this guardian angel

00:42:36.899 --> 00:42:36.909
specifically of like this guardian angel
 

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:39.629
specifically of like this guardian angel
capability so the goal the ultimate goal

00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:39.639
capability so the goal the ultimate goal
 

00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:42.689
capability so the goal the ultimate goal
of our work is to create a vehicle that

00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:42.699
of our work is to create a vehicle that
 

00:42:42.699 --> 00:42:44.779
of our work is to create a vehicle that
even if you want to crash it is

00:42:44.779 --> 00:42:44.789
even if you want to crash it is
 

00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:47.370
even if you want to crash it is
uncrashable right so it will prohibit

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:47.380
uncrashable right so it will prohibit
 

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.349
uncrashable right so it will prohibit
you from making any dangerous actions

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359
you from making any dangerous actions
 

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:52.979
you from making any dangerous actions
that exit the bounds of the set of valid

00:42:52.979 --> 00:42:52.989
that exit the bounds of the set of valid
 

00:42:52.989 --> 00:42:55.409
that exit the bounds of the set of valid
controls right so this is this is really

00:42:55.409 --> 00:42:55.419
controls right so this is this is really
 

00:42:55.419 --> 00:42:57.239
controls right so this is this is really
the the holy grail of the work that

00:42:57.239 --> 00:42:57.249
the the holy grail of the work that
 

00:42:57.249 --> 00:42:59.339
the the holy grail of the work that
we're doing and I'd like to conclude
