00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659
so last year a fascinating study came

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669
so last year a fascinating study came
 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.329
so last year a fascinating study came
out in the journal Science from a team

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
out in the journal Science from a team
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.150
out in the journal Science from a team
led by Betsy Sparrow at Columbia and in

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
led by Betsy Sparrow at Columbia and in
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.240
led by Betsy Sparrow at Columbia and in
this study the scientists showed that

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
this study the scientists showed that
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.660
this study the scientists showed that
people who used Google and who thought

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
people who used Google and who thought
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.279
people who used Google and who thought
that they would be able to access

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
that they would be able to access
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.859
that they would be able to access
information on a computer later on

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
information on a computer later on
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320
information on a computer later on
didn't remember it as well as the people

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
didn't remember it as well as the people
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029
didn't remember it as well as the people
who didn't think they would have access

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
who didn't think they would have access
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.810
who didn't think they would have access
to it so you have one kind of key

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
to it so you have one kind of key
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700
to it so you have one kind of key
variable do you think you'll be able to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
variable do you think you'll be able to
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470
variable do you think you'll be able to
use your computer later on to find this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
use your computer later on to find this
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.389
use your computer later on to find this
information the answer is no you're

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399
information the answer is no you're
 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.430
information the answer is no you're
going to remember it if the answer is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
going to remember it if the answer is
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799
going to remember it if the answer is
yes you're not going to remember it but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
yes you're not going to remember it but
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.220
yes you're not going to remember it but
you will remember where to find it so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
you will remember where to find it so
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.959
you will remember where to find it so
you'll remember where it was stored

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
you'll remember where it was stored
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639
you'll remember where it was stored
you'll remember what the folder was

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
you'll remember what the folder was
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830
you'll remember what the folder was
you'll remember how to access it on the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
you'll remember how to access it on the
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510
you'll remember how to access it on the
computer so it's not that you're not

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
computer so it's not that you're not
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369
computer so it's not that you're not
remembering anything it's that you're

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
remembering anything it's that you're
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170
remembering anything it's that you're
remembering a very different thing do

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
remembering a very different thing do
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029
remembering a very different thing do
you use your memory to store the actual

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
you use your memory to store the actual
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.459
you use your memory to store the actual
piece of information do you use it to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
piece of information do you use it to
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.029
piece of information do you use it to
store the retrieval process so I take a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
store the retrieval process so I take a
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.260
store the retrieval process so I take a
few things from this thing one

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270
few things from this thing one
 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.250
few things from this thing one
technology can be very bad for our

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
technology can be very bad for our
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.969
technology can be very bad for our
memory if we let it be bad for it so if

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
memory if we let it be bad for it so if
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.670
memory if we let it be bad for it so if
we always rely on it and if we have this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
we always rely on it and if we have this
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.980
we always rely on it and if we have this
attitude of oh I don't need to remember

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
attitude of oh I don't need to remember
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080
attitude of oh I don't need to remember
this because I'll always be able to look

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
this because I'll always be able to look
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999
this because I'll always be able to look
it up you won't remember it and then you

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
it up you won't remember it and then you
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.200
it up you won't remember it and then you
won't have that knowledge in your head

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
won't have that knowledge in your head
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.179
won't have that knowledge in your head
and then you won't have anything in your

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
and then you won't have anything in your
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.609
and then you won't have anything in your
attic to play with you won't have that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
attic to play with you won't have that
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100
attic to play with you won't have that
knowledge base you won't be able to be

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
knowledge base you won't be able to be
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660
knowledge base you won't be able to be
imaginative like Holmes you won't be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
imaginative like Holmes you won't be
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.070
imaginative like Holmes you won't be
able to reach those conclusions because

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
able to reach those conclusions because
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.490
able to reach those conclusions because
your attic will be pretty bare but we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500
your attic will be pretty bare but we
 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.550
your attic will be pretty bare but we
can also use it to enhance her memory by

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
can also use it to enhance her memory by
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950
can also use it to enhance her memory by
saying okay I know that there are these

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
saying okay I know that there are these
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469
saying okay I know that there are these
great technological benefits why don't I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
great technological benefits why don't I
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690
great technological benefits why don't I
use that to create this virtual storage

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
use that to create this virtual storage
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.359
use that to create this virtual storage
space for myself so Holmes does this to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
space for myself so Holmes does this to
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.910
space for myself so Holmes does this to
Holmes has files that he accesses and he

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
Holmes has files that he accesses and he
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.399
Holmes has files that he accesses and he
says Watson you know look up my file for

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
says Watson you know look up my file for
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.230
says Watson you know look up my file for
this case look up my file for this case

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
this case look up my file for this case
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719
this case look up my file for this case
so he remembers that he has the file he

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
so he remembers that he has the file he
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.429
so he remembers that he has the file he
remembers that there was a case he

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
remembers that there was a case he
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109
remembers that there was a case he
doesn't necessarily remember all of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
doesn't necessarily remember all of
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.120
doesn't necessarily remember all of
these details so you can think of Google

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
these details so you can think of Google
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.840
these details so you can think of Google
as this vastly expanded Holmes the in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
as this vastly expanded Holmes the in
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.420
as this vastly expanded Holmes the in
filing system so you can use it for

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
filing system so you can use it for
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700
filing system so you can use it for
exactly that what are the things that I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
exactly that what are the things that I
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949
exactly that what are the things that I
want to remember and that I want to be

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
want to remember and that I want to be
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.960
want to remember and that I want to be
able to access later

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
able to access later
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.480
able to access later
on and focus on remembering how to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
on and focus on remembering how to
 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.180
on and focus on remembering how to
access them and then keep your mind

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
access them and then keep your mind
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.470
access them and then keep your mind
space for those things that you think

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480
space for those things that you think
 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260
space for those things that you think
will be important for you to know at any

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270
will be important for you to know at any
 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.160
will be important for you to know at any
point so the exercise that I like to say

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
point so the exercise that I like to say
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.920
point so the exercise that I like to say
for myself is if I were on a desert

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
for myself is if I were on a desert
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.350
for myself is if I were on a desert
island with no power or I don't even

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360
island with no power or I don't even
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.670
island with no power or I don't even
have to go to a desert island in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
have to go to a desert island in
 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.680
have to go to a desert island in
hurricane sandy I had no power no

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690
hurricane sandy I had no power no
 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.440
hurricane sandy I had no power no
internet no cell phone service nothing

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
internet no cell phone service nothing
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.590
internet no cell phone service nothing
so if hurricane sandy strikes again and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600
so if hurricane sandy strikes again and
 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.110
so if hurricane sandy strikes again and
I don't have anything do I have

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
I don't have anything do I have
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.000
I don't have anything do I have
everything that I need immediately in my

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
everything that I need immediately in my
 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.150
everything that I need immediately in my
head what are those things that I really

head what are those things that I really
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.480
head what are those things that I really
can't rely on a computer for
