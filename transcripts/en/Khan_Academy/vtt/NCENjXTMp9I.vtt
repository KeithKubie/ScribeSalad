00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.050
- [Instructor] Derrick
is a political pollster

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.690
tracking the approval rating

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.010
of the prime minster in his country.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.810
At the end of each month, he obtains data

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.850
from a random sample of adults

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.040
on whether or not they currently approve

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.100
of the prime minister's performance,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.933
using a separate sample each month.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.670
Derrick wants to test if the proportion

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.660
of adults who approved
was significantly lower

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.049
in December than it was in November.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:29.611
Which of the following
is an appropriate set

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.540
of hypotheses for Derrick's
significance test?

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.160
Pause this video and
see if you can figure it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040
out on your own.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.420
Alright, so let's think about ways

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.830
to write a null hypothesis first.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.580
So, remember, your null
hypothesis is assuming

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.770
that there's no news here.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.890
There's no difference.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.820
So, one way to say it is
that the true proportion

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:53.390
in December is equal to your
true proportion in November.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.141
Another way to write
that exact same thing is

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:58.970
to say that your, the difference

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.885
between the true proportion in December,

00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:02.887
and let's see.

00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:03.720
They say, Derrick wants
to test if the proportion

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.330
of adults who approved
was significantly lower

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.110
in December than it was in November.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.530
And so, you could write it as

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890
because he's wanting to
see if November is higher

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.810
or not, I'll put November first.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.562
So, another way to say
this exact same thing is

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.750
that the true proportion of November

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.340
minus the true proportion in
December is equal to zero.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.432
So, each of these would look,
be legitimate null hypotheses

00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.650
and so, let's see,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.845
this one looks good.

00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:31.820
This one looks good.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.700
This one looks good.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.500
This one is not a
legitimate null hypothesis

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.365
for what we're trying to do.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.460
So, we could rule out D.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.880
And then, the other one it says,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.550
Derrick wants to test if the proportion

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.960
of adults who approved
was significantly lower

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.373
in December than it was in November.

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:51.830
So, the news here would be if this is,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.930
if this actually is the case.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.316
If we have evidence that the true propor,

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.610
that the proportion of adults who approved

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.220
was significantly lower in
December than it was in November.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.100
So, that the alternative hypothesis

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.200
could look something like this.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.880
That the proportion in December was less

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.370
than the proportion in November.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.510
Or, it could be that the proportion

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.001
in November is greater than
the proportion in December.

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.660
And, if we look at these choices,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.730
the proportion in December is less

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.930
than the proportion in November.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.100
That's what I wrote right over here.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.580
So, that looks good as well.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.740
Here, they swap it.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.780
Here, they're saying our
alternative hypothesis is

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.380
that the true proportion
December is larger,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.290
is more than the true
proportion in November

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.660
which is the opposite of what say here.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.160
So, we rule that one out.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.770
Here, they're just saying that
we actually have a difference

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.850
in the proportions.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.629
And, many times, you will
see something like this,

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.870
but here, Derrick wants
to test if the proportion

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.040
of adults who approved
was significantly lower

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.580
in December than in November.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.440
He's not interested in
the other way around.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.522
If he said, if it said
Derrick wants to test

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:53.050
if the proportion of adults

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.200
who approved was significantly different

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.100
in December than November,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.240
then you would pick choice
C instead of choice A.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.550
But, given the way it was phrased,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.130
I would pick choice A.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.281
Let's do another example.

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:09.230
Here, it says that Kiley
has a dime and a nickel

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.421
and she wonders if they
have the same likelihood

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:13.930
of showing heads when they are flipped.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.189
She flips each coin 100 times to test

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.351
if there is a significant difference

00:03:18.351 --> 00:03:20.350
in the proportion of flips

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.560
that they each land showing heads.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.200
Which of the following
is an appropriate set

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.360
of hypotheses for Kiley's
significance test?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.680
So, once again, pause the video.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440
Try to do it on your own.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.620
Alright, well, your
null hypothesis would be

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.050
that there is no difference.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.690
So, that the proportion of getting heads

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.430
with your dime is the
same as your proportion

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.970
of heads with your nickel.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.773
And then, your alternative hypothesis,

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:45.490
so it says here she fl,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.385
she wants to test if there's
a significant difference.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:50.950
She's not trying to say if the proportion

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.800
of dimes coming up head
is significantly lower

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.640
or significantly larger.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.270
She just cares about the difference.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.650
If there's a significant difference

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.480
in the proportion of slips.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.820
So, her alternative hypothesis is

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.730
that there is a difference.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.340
That these two proportions
are not equal to each other.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.916
And, so, if we look at the choices,

00:04:05.916 --> 00:04:08.420
so this null hypothesis looks good.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.022
This null hypothesis does not look good.

00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:12.170
Remember, you're null hypothesis,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.380
you're trying to assume that,
man, there's no news here.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.760
So, all of these null hypotheses,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.230
these, A, B, and D's null
hypotheses look good.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.290
And then, the alternative hypotheses is

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.400
this is exactly what we
wrote before is for choice D.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.930
Choice A's alternative
hypothesis would work

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.550
if here it said she
flips each coin 100 times

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.000
to test if there is, if the proportion

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.490
of heads with the dime
is significantly lower

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.310
than the proportion of
heads with the nickel

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.606
or something like that.

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:42.420
And then, if it was the reverse,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.970
then choice B would look good.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.560
But, she just wants to see
if there's a difference,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.450
not if one is lower than the other.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.253
And, so I would pick choice D.
