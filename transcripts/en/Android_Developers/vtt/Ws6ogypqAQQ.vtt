RETO MEIER: Hello, and welcome
to "This Week in Android

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.010
Development" for July 1, 2013.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.710
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.150
Last week, we released the
latest in a long line of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.680
"DevBytes" from Chet Haase.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.070
Chet's forgotten more about
Android animations than most

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.430
of us will ever know, so we're
recording what he still

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.420
retains before his memory
fails entirely.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.610
The Android Design in Action
team took their metaphoric

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.430
scalpels to Google Play last
week, with special guests

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.299
Marco Paglia and Owen Otto from
the Android design team.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.900
Google is redesigning apps
written by Googlers.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.540
We must go deeper.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.160
I personally had the pleasure of
presenting some Android pro

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.830
tips to the delightfully
acronym-ed NSBE during their

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.990
Android summit here at Google.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.600
For our games developers, we
released the Firewall Defense

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.200
Google Play games web sample.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.630
And the Google Play for
Education folks continue to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.460
expand their program, with
developers now able to submit

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.010
their apps to Google Play for
Education for use in their

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.150
ongoing pilot programs.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.990
Speaking of pilots, Android
Studio has added integrated

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.379
cloud support through support
for Google Cloud Endpoints,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.640
allowing you to quickly and
easily create an App Engine

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.220
backend for your apps directly
from your IDE.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.760
We also saw a lot of new apps
released on Google Play,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.970
including music discovery and
sharing app Soundwave; an

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.370
update to photography,
discovery, and sharing app

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.650
EyeEm; an update that includes
Holo styling and tablet

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.070
support for French TV app Tele
Loisirs; as well as an email

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520
management app, Boomerang.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.050
Those of us based in the US will
be taking a few days off

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.315
this week to celebrate the
independence of this great

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:35.550
nation from the kings of
an island-based empire

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.220
some 200 years ago.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.570
Personally, I would have
called it America Day.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.910
But I've been told that here,
every day is America Day.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.990
In any case, that means we'll
be barbecuing rather than

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.190
broadcasting from our Mountain
View Studio.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.630
But our colleagues in Sydney
and London will be holding

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.690
down the fort in our absence,
starting with Ankur Kotwal,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.100
who has generously translated
some "DevBytes" into an

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.080
Australian patois.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.540
So if you talk like a proper
Aussie, you'll want

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.890
to check this out.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.310
Good on ya.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.990
Nick and Rich will also be
broadcasting a "DevByte

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.450
Backstage" next Thursday.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.289
As always, you can keep track
of what's coming up and any

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.650
last-minute changes at
developers.googl

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.080
e.com/live/android.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.170
That's all for "This
Week in Android

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.470
Development" for July 1, 2013.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.150
Join us for this
week's "Android

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.340
Developer Live" broadcast.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.270
And remember to make the most
of this night like you're

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.520
going to die young.
