00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:01.684
- So, right over here depicted

00:00:01.684 --> 00:00:04.101
a square loop of a conductor.

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.874
Let's say it's a wire and it's stationary

00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:07.645
and it's sitting in a magnetic field.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.004
And I've drawn a few
vectors that represent

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.350
the magnetic field and
you can see at least on

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.399
the surface that is defined
or that is contoured

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.198
by the wire that the magnetic
field looks constant.

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.434
So, if we just had this scenario

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:22.291
nothing too special going on

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.508
but it becomes interesting
if I were to actually change

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:28.435
the flux going through the surface.

00:00:28.616 --> 00:00:30.351
So, both of these pictures right over here

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:32.384
they actually show the same scenario

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.067
where we have increased the flux.

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:37.749
We have increased the flux at these points

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.619
on the surface defined by
the wire at every point

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:44.178
the magnetic field has
now gotten stronger.

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.384
So, we have increased the flux.

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:48.015
So, let me write that, the flux.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.017
We use the Greek letter
phi used to denote flux.

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:53.967
The flux of the magnetic field.

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:57.400
The flux of the magnetic
field has gone up.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:00.417
And we know from Faraday's law

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:02.350
that when you have a change in your flux

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.420
that that's going to induce
a current in the loop.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.531
And so an interesting question is

00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:11.538
what direction is that current
actually going to go in?

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:13.019
We have two options.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:15.031
The current could go.

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.762
The current... Let me find a
nice color for the current.

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:22.762
The current could go in
the clockwise direction

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:28.651
or it could go in the
counter clockwise direction.

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:30.351
So, which of these two do you think

00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.069
the current will actually go with?

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:33.917
Well, let's think a little bit about it.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:35.684
We know that a current flowing through

00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:40.051
a wire actually on it's own
will induce a magnetic field

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.201
above and beyond a magnet
field that's already there.

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.785
So, let's think about the
type of magnetic field

00:01:44.785 --> 00:01:48.119
that this orange current
would actually induce.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:51.194
So, if it's going in the
counter clockwise direction

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.284
remember we use the right hand rule.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.251
I can take my right hand

00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.990
point my thumb in the
direction of the current.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.418
So, let me see if I can do that.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.552
So, my thumb in the
direction of the current

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:05.722
and then my hands are going to loop

00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:07.851
or I should say my
fingers are going to loop

00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.864
in the direction of the magnetic field.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.491
So, when I do that with my right hand,

00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:14.331
so my right hand looks
something like that thumb

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:16.751
in the direction of the
current right over here

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:19.881
we see that it shows the
magnetic field being induced

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.237
that would wrap around like that.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:23.825
Or if we were to show
it, if we were to sample

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:25.781
it points right on the surface

00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:28.285
the magnetic field that would be induced

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.964
would look something like this

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.222
and I'm just doing it
at some sample points.

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:37.351
So, notice it would be additive

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.218
to the existing magnetic field.

00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:45.181
In fact, it would increase
the flux even more.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:47.268
In fact, at these points these vectors

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:48.634
would increase even more.

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:51.700
These vectors, let me
see if I can draw that.

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:53.635
These vectors would increase even more.

00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:54.574
Well, what would that do?

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.751
If the flux increases even more

00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:57.617
then the current is going to increase.

00:02:57.617 --> 00:02:59.517
The current is going to increase even more

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:01.260
which is going to make the
flux increase even more

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.752
and which makes the
current increase even more

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:04.918
and you would have this never ending cycle

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.116
where the current keeps increasing,

00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:08.284
the flux keeps increasing
and you would have

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.484
this energy that's
appearing out of nowhere

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:13.168
which would violate the law
of conservation of energy.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.818
And so that's a pretty good argument

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:17.555
for why you would not...

00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:19.848
That's a pretty good
argument for why we would

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:24.531
not expect the counter clockwise scenario.

00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.784
We would not want the
current that's been induced

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:29.284
to induce a magnetic
field that goes in the

00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:32.535
same direction as our increase in flux.

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:34.683
So, just by deductive reasoning we know

00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:36.484
that this is going to be the scenario

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:37.854
and let's see if we think
about what happens here.

00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:39.304
We can do the right hand rule again.

00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:40.994
We take our right hand

00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:43.087
point our thumb in the
direction of the current

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:45.327
point our thumb in the
direction of the current

00:03:45.327 --> 00:03:49.368
and we see if we do that
with our right hand.

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:52.818
Well, now this would
induce a magnetic field

00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:55.034
that would decrease the flux.

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:57.518
So, it would produce a magnetic field.

00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:58.650
The current right over here would produce

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.416
a magnetic field that's going downward.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.638
The current in that direction would also

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:06.264
when you take your right hand

00:04:06.264 --> 00:04:07.918
and you were to put it along here.

00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:12.404
Once again if you're going
in the counter clockwise,

00:04:12.404 --> 00:04:14.541
or sorry if you're going
in the clockwise direction

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:16.584
over here that too when you do your

00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:17.784
right hand rule right over here

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:20.374
your fingers would coil around that way.

00:04:20.374 --> 00:04:22.551
And so once again when
you look at the surface

00:04:22.551 --> 00:04:26.351
it would produce, it would
induce a magnetic field

00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.134
that is going in that direction.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:31.285
And so it would have the
induced magnetic field

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:33.907
from the induced current will go against

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.467
the change in flux.

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.985
And this makes sense because
we won't go into this

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:39.751
never ending positive feedback loop where

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:41.117
the current keeps getting
strong and stronger

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:42.550
and the flux keeps increasing

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.167
and increasing and increasing.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.585
And this idea that the orientation

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:49.191
of the current that is induced

00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:51.178
will produce a magnetic field

00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:54.751
that counter acts the change in flux.

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:56.544
This is Lenz's law.

00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:00.591
Lenz's Law.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:03.291
And once again if that wasn't true

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.518
then you would have a violation

00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:07.535
of the conservation of energy.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:10.565
So, in general if someone says okay well,

00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:12.184
this is the change in flux

00:05:12.184 --> 00:05:13.735
is happening in a certain direction.

00:05:14.018 --> 00:05:15.418
Well, to think about which way

00:05:15.418 --> 00:05:17.448
the current would flow
you just have to say

00:05:17.448 --> 00:05:19.614
well what type of a magnetic field

00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:22.117
would each direction
of the current produce?

00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:24.234
And that magnetic field
should go in a direction

00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:26.385
that goes against your change in flux.

00:05:26.385 --> 00:05:28.017
So, if the flux is increasing

00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:29.484
the magnetic field that's induced

00:05:29.484 --> 00:05:32.269
by the induced current should
make the flux decrease.

00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:34.518
If the flux was decreasing

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:36.218
then the induced magnetic field

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:37.828
by the induced current should make

00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:39.474
the flux decrease less

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:43.821
or should be additive to the flux.
