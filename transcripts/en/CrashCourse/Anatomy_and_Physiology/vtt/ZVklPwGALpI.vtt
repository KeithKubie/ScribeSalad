00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Why is everybody so worried about high blood
pressure?

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.000
I mean, of all of the millions of things that could go
fatally wrong in your body at any given moment,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.060
it doesn’t seem like the biggest threat you face is
that your blood might be pumping a little too hard.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.780
A heartbeat that’s too strong? Isn’t that
like an awesome song that’s played too loud?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.900
Or nachos with too much cheese?!

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.400
Well, no.
The fact is:

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.620
You’re more likely to die from diseases related to
your cardiovascular system than anything else.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.580
And probably you would like to know why.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.590
Well, we know that blood pressure is the circulatory
system’s way of getting your five liters

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.820
of blood flowing throughout your body, so that your
tissues can get the oxygen and nutrients they need.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.520
But chronic high blood pressure, or hypertension,
can cause serious damage to both the heart

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.480
that creates the high pressure, and to the blood
vessels that have to withstand that extra pressure.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.900
Over time, the increased force of blood against
the arterial walls can make them stiffen, leak,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.020
or rupture, while the heart itself may simply wear out
from all the extra work it’s doing to keep blood moving.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.440
Luckily, your nervous and endocrine systems
have some tricks to try and balance blood

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.100
pressure when it gets too high or too low,
in an effort to create homeostatic balance.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.840
But, even with these defenses in place, if
your blood pressure stays out of balance long

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.670
enough, things will start going really, really
wrong.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.579
One in three adults in the U.S. has high blood
pressure -- that’s two in six, that’s

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.479
three in nine -- and often there are often
no symptoms until it’s too late.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.660
Just like your favorite song turned up to
11, or an unlimited supply of nacho cheese,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.020
even your own life-giving blood can become…too
much of a good thing.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.600
Part of what might seem confusing about high
blood pressure is the seemingly random list

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.189
of things that can contribute to it, some
of which are easier to control than others.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.179
There’s emotional stress. Physical exertion.
Dehydration. Too much salt on your mashed

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.119
potatoes. Or too much butter on your bacon.
Why are we buttering bacon?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.400
But all these things can in some way affect
how efficiently your blood flows. But in order

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.479
to understand why your heart hates french fries, you
first have to understand how blood flow works.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.640
When we talk about blood flow, what we’re
talking about is the volume of blood flowing

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.210
through any given vessel, or through the circulatory
system as a whole, per minute.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.550
This is also called cardiac output, and it’s
determined by the blood volume pumped during

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.480
one beat, and the number of beats per minute.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.890
Now, if you’ve ever used a garden hose,
or fixed a leaky sink, or had any other hands-on

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.450
experience with fluids, then you know that
flow can change in response to a number of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.790
factors, especially those that affect resistance.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.940
Resistance is just anything that hinders flow
or creates friction.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.360
In the case of your blood, resistance can
be the result of increased viscosity -- the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.130
thicker your blood is, the harder it is to
move -- or it could be because of increased

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.560
vessel length, since longer vessels are more
resistant to flow in general.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.600
But those factors tend to be pretty constant
in your body over time. Instead, for most

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.380
people, the biggest factor that affects resistance
has to do with vessel diameter.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.720
Changes in diameter can be temporary, like
during vasoconstriction or vasodilation -- when

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.020
the diameter increases or decreases, allowing
more or less blood through.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.300
But an excess of low-density lipoprotein,
or LDL, the so-called “bad” cholesterol,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.210
in the blood can build up to form a fatty
plaque on the inside of your arteries, permanently

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.170
increasing the resistance, and hindering blood
flow.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.820
So your blood pressure, blood flow, and resistance
are all tied together. In fact,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.880
they’re so closely and predictably tied together that we
can even express their relationship mathematically.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.250
Among the truths contained in this equation
is the fact that blood flow increases as the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.840
difference in blood pressure between two points
increases.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.980
Remember: The ventricles of the heart create
very high pressure, while the atria, or the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.060
receiving chambers of the heart, have very
little pressure, at least while the body’s at rest.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.070
So, the bigger the gap is between the high
pressure in your ventricles and aorta, and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.100
the low pressure in your vena cava and atria, the
faster a liter of blood will flow through your system.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.060
If you have to back up a few times to review
that, nobody’s gonna judge you.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.490
Now, at the same time, blood flow decreases
as resistance increases.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.860
So, with a little algebraic rearranging, you can
see that blood pressure equals blood flow,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400
or cardiac output, times resistance.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.900
In theory, this means that any change in resistance
or cardiac output would also change blood pressure.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.780
But when any one of these variables actually
does change, your body tries its best to compensate

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.940
for it, in its eternal quest to maintain homeostasis.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.040
And it accomplishes this in a few different ways,
mainly using neurons, hormones, and the kidneys.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.520
One major short-term fix to wonky blood pressure
comes from your brain, which targets both

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.730
cardiac output and resistance, by altering
the distribution of the blood flow around

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.670
the body, or by changing the diameter of certain
blood vessels.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.480
This comes in handy when you’re walking
up fourteen flights of stairs in your apartment

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.730
building with three bags of groceries. The
vessels feeding your digestive organs constrict,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.570
which increases resistance there, so more
blood goes to the skeletal muscles in your legs.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.430
Most neural responses like this use baroreceptors,
special nerve endings found in the carotid

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.660
arteries, the aorta, and other larger arteries
in the neck.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.960
When blood pressure stretches arterial walls,
that opens mechanically-gated sodium channels

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650
in these little receptors. The higher the
blood pressure is, the more frequently they

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.160
send action potentials to the midbrain informing
it just how much pressure the artery is feeling.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.280
When the brain learns what’s happening,
it can do any number of things to correct

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.690
the situation -- like dilate some arterioles
to reduce resistance, or reduce the heart

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.250
rate to lower cardiac output -- and these
things work pretty well for a while.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.700
But baroreceptors are not effective for long-term
pressure changes, in part because they end

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.590
up adapting, essentially reprogramming themselves
to read a high blood pressure as the new normal.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.850
Now, other short-term effects on your blood
pressure come from your hormones.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.010
We’ve already talked about one classic example:
when your body actually needs a little high

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.930
blood pressure -- like when it has to get
ready to fight or flee -- the adrenal medulla

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.890
starts flooding your blood with epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.640
These hormones raise both the heart rate and the blood
volume, and therefore cardiac output, while also

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.740
constricting vessels in less essential regions, increasing
the overall resistance, and therefore pressure.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.740
And again, just like with neural controls,
these hormonal controls work by changing vessel

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.850
resistance and cardiac output.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.950
But the way to get more long-term control
of blood pressure is to alter the blood volume,

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.990
and for that, you need the kidneys.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.660
Your kidneys cook up hormones like renin and
angiotensin which help regulate levels of

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.960
sodium and fluids in your body, and also help
expand and constrict blood vessels.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.680
And when blood pressure gets too high, your
kidneys will try to reduce the volume of

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.340
blood, by getting rid of any extra water.
Basically, they make you pee.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.810
Blood volume, by the way, is partly why sodium
is the root of all evil in blood pressure

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.290
treatments: The excess sodium used in processed
foods and salty snacks causes your body to

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.320
retain water, which creates higher blood volume
and leads to higher blood pressure, which,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.830
you know, is a bummer.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.340
So, those are some of your body’s automatic
solutions for high blood pressure.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.530
But how it compensates for sustained high
blood pressure will almost certainly lead

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.590
to trouble -- either for the heart that has
to work harder to overcome the resistance,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.230
or for the vessels that have to take that
extra pressure.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.780
An increase in either blood flow or resistance
leaves the heart struggling to do its job, so it might

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.820
actually build more muscle around that left ventricle 
to help generate the force needed to move the blood.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.680
Now, a more muscley heart may not sound like
a bad thing, but trust me, it is.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.040
Why? Well, because more muscle needs more oxygen,
and your body just can’t create new blood

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.700
vessels to feed that super-sized ventricle.
So that big muscle is left starving.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.320
It’s literally a hungry heart.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.480
Plus, if you have cholesterol plaques in your
arteries, then you probably have them in your

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.230
coronary arteries, which carry oxygen and
nutrients to the heart muscle itself. That

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.130
increases the resistance, and therefore decreases
blood flow to the heart muscle. So you have

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.090
this bigger, hungrier heart muscle, but its
nutrient supply is diminished, and eventually

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.080
those heart muscle cells can slowly die.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.880
When that happens, it’s known as heart failure.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.980
Or, if you completely block one of those coronary
arteries with plaque, or maybe a blood clot,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.770
a whole bunch of heart cells quickly starve
to death.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.970
And that can lead to a myocardial infarction,
which is what we also call a heart attack.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.560
And then we’ve got the problems on the blood
vessel end, under sustained hypertension,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.440
you may see your otherwise elastic arteries
go from being flexible balloons to stiff,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.480
hardened pipes, in what’s called arteriosclerosis.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.720
Or… the high pressure may make them weak
and bulgy in spots, until they’re stretched

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.840
too thin and leak or burst.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.920
And that is an aneurysm.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.060
And if the weak spot ruptures in a smaller
arteriole blood vessel -- say, one that leads

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.780
to an organ like a kidney or eye, it can lead
to organ damage or failure.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.360
So although having a huge, strong flow of
blood coursing through your body might sound

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.240
like some kind of comic book-caliber superpower,
it is not.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.540
It’s just too much of a good thing.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.170
That’s why you just learned, first and foremost
that you should not butter your bacon -- and

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.540
also what blood flow and resistance are, and
how they relate, in direct proportion, to

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.890
blood pressure. We also looked at your body’s
short term responses to high blood pressure

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.880
-- including neural, hormonal, and kidney
response -- and wrapped up by describing all

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.439
of the ways that chronic high blood pressure
can kill you.
