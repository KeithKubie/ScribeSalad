00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Actually, by the book this equation for gravity--this equation for the force of gravity--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is only true for point masses.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We would have to concentrate all of our earth in one single spot.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So do we cheat when we don't do so?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The nice thing about gravity is that this equation still holds

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
for a rotationally symmetric distributed mass.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is called Newton's Shell Theorem,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you are going to see in the upcoming quiz why this is called "shell" theorem.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
To see why Newton's Shell Theorem holds,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it's best to introduce an analogy to water.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This looks outrageous, but please bear with me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we leave our first mass where it is and move the second mass around,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we can determine a force vector at every point in space.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We get a force field.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Imagine that this wasn't the solar system but a pool of water,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and the water has velocities,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and the velocity of the water is described by our force field.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Water flows downward here at a high speed.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It flows to the right at a low speed at this point.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It flows to the left at a somewhat higher speed at this point, and so on.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We interpret the force field a velocity field in our pool of water.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Of course, we're ignoring the units of measurement right now.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Of course when setting force equal to velocity we're ignoring

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
units of measurement for a moment.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
To make that work, there has to be a huge drain in the center.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The first mass acts like a cosmic drain.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Why can we do so? Why does water behave in the same way as this force field does?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
To understand that consider two imaginary spheres in our pool,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
both centered at the drain.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the radius of the outer sphere should be twice the radius of the inner sphere,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which means that the surface area of the outer sphere is 4 times the surface area

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of the inner sphere.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
All lengths are being multiplied by 2.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
These are square meters.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They are multiplied by 2 squared.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now the important quantity to consider is the flow of water through these spheres.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
How many cubic meters per second flow through these surfaces?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This number has to be the same for the outer and for the inner sphere.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We are not losing water or gaining water in between,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but as the outer sphere has a surface area of 4 times that of the inner sphere

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the velocity has to go up to transport the same amount of water per second

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
through each of these spheres the velocity at the inner sphere has to quadruple

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
as compared to this velocity at the outer sphere.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This is precisely what we saw before with gravity.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
As we double the distance the force shrinks to 1/4 of the original.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Of course, this doesn't only work for a factor of 2.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This works for all ratios.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Hence, we can indeed identify the force field of gravity with the velocity field of water.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Once this analogy between gravity and water is in place,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it's easy to see that the flow through each of these surfaces

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
has to be the same.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Let's assume that we have three masses at the center of this sphere.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And this same masses are at the center of that smaller sphere.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And the same three masses are somewhere inside this weird closed surface.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Then the flow through each of these surfaces has to be the same.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
If we replace the force field of gravity by the velocity field of water,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
we have to seem the same number of cubic meters per second

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
for each of these surfaces.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Because we're draining water in three spots at the same rate.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Somehow that amount of water has to enter from the outside.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And it has to be this same amount of water,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because we're draining the same amount of water in each of them.
