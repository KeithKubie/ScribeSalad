So, thank you Sara. This was helpful. It's pretty nice to know that HTML and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.250
CSS aren't actually all that complicated. So

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.050
thank you for lifting the veil on that.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Definitely there's definitely more to it

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.190
than just what we did here. It would

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.990
definitely take more practice and familiarity to start

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.510
you know building pages of this complexity, but I

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.370
&gt;&gt; You mean from scratch I bet is a little harder?

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah a little bit.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; But

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.780
it's cool to be able to modify open source projects.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.009
&gt;&gt; Yeah and it's nice to be able to actually just, you know

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.970
look at the source for any page you know you could just, any

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.500
&gt;&gt; Change Google to Boogle.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you wanted, you could

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.290
&gt;&gt; I don't think I want to.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.640
&gt;&gt; You could just look at [LAUGH] Any, any page

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.650
that, that you're visiting, you can always just look at the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.160
source code and see what they're doing and learn a little

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
bit that way. See what, what standards there are out there.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.690
Cool.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.270
&gt;&gt; I can't wait to see all the projects that the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000
students in this class come up with. I'm sure they'll be some

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll be awesome.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.820
&gt;&gt; Some good ones. And next time, we're going to make [INAUDIBLE] button.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we'll, we'll look at the JavaScript in more detail.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.000
And add in the functionality and then throw a button on the HTML.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.650
&gt;&gt; Cool. Alright. See you then.
