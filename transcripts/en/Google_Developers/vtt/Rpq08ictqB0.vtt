00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.250
Steve Jacobs: IDEAL Group is the umbrella,
or parent company,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.917
to five subsidiary companies.

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.083
One is Apps4Android, 

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:16.833
a developer of Android
accessibility applications.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:17.583
Paul Speese: So at the show here, 

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.875
we're demonstrating an application
that runs on an Android phone

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.000
or tablet, or television.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.167
And the application consists of a number
of Bluetooth vital sign devices

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:30.333
that we've integrated and they
communicate to the phone.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:34.125
So, the phone acts as a concentrator
and it collects all the data

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.625
and we convert that to medically
specific data formats,

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.375
encrypt it, send it up over the cloud, and
put it into an electronic medical record.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.375
Steve Jacobs: Oh, when you say
"Android, I have a good feeling in my heart.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:51.750
The reason I do is the Google,
the Android culture of Open Source.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.000
It's built into the DNA.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.792
People share code.

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:59.667
And it makes it so much easier
if I develop something

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:04.000
and somebody else can improve upon it 
and I give them the code.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.875
It gives them the leverage

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.625
to make the product better
without adding a lot of cost.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:13.000
Paul Speese: The reason we're here today
in the Google Accessibility pod,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.792
is with Apps4Android, 

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.458
we've been able to take their expertise

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:21.833
in making applications accessible
for the blind

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.333
and low-cost, mobile health solutions

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:30.292
that help monitor people and alert medical
professionals to conditions that change

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:34.792
will really help to bring down cost
and provide a higher level of care.

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:38.625
Steve Jacobs: You talk to the community
you're developing applications for.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.167
They won't hesitate to tell you
what they like,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.208
what they don't like,
what they can and can't do.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:47.333
And then if you hear the same thing
from enough people,

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.292
you know there's a market out there,

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:52.208
especially for Open Source applications.
