00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to bonus programming gem #1.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This part is completely optional in that there are no quizzes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to lay out a programming problem and show you how I would approach it

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and debug it and give you some hints.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you already feel comfortable after seeing the problem, then you can skip it.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Otherwise, follow along with me.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
At a high level, here's the problem description that we'll be tackling today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Given a list 'l' of arbitrary elements--could be strings, could be numbers,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
could be lists themselves--and a function 'f',

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
return the element of 'l' that maximizes that function.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So for example, if the function is square root and the list is 9, 16, 4,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we'd want to return 16 because it has the highest square root.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And we can assume that 'l' is not empty and that 'f' returns a number.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Let's show an example.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Let's say that the list is a list of strings--['Barbara', 'Kingsolver', 'wrote', 'the',

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
'Poisonwood', 'Bible'],

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and the function we're trying to maximize is len--the string length function.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So among the 6 elements, 'Poinsonwood' has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 letters.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
'Kingsolver'--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10--also 10 letters, returning either one of those

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
would be fine.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What I encourage you to do at this point is, try it on your own!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Go to the Python interpreter, make up some test cases, implement a function that does this,

00:01:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then we'll all go through it together.
