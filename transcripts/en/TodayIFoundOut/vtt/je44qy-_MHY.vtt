00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:09.849
What's the Difference Between Brown Eggs and
White Eggs?

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.239
There are all sorts of rumours surrounding
brown eggs and white eggs.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.300
Some people say that brown eggs are better
for you and contain more nutrients; some people

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.300
think brown eggs taste better; some think
that brown eggs are better for cooking things

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.420
like quiches, while white eggs are better
for baking cakes (or vice versa, depending

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.420
on who you talk to).

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.660
We here at Today I Found Out are all about
uncovering the truth amongst all of the myths,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.490
and so here is the fascinating difference
between brown eggs and white eggs:

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.900
Brown eggs are brown.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.480
White eggs are white.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.120
Seriously, brown or white, they are the same
on the inside, with one minor caveat which

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.140
we’ll get to in a minute that has nothing
to do with whether the chicken is a brown

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.650
egg layer or white.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.150
But besides that caveat, a brown egg or a
white egg will give you the same amount of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:06.540
nutrition, they taste the same, and they are
equally delicious in quiches and cakes.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.770
The two also have more or less the same shell
thickness.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.690
The differences in shell thickness that you
may have observed likely has to do with the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.210
age of the chicken- young chickens lay eggs
with shells that are typically harder than

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.370
older chickens’ eggs, but this is true for
both white and brown egg layers.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.500
How the rumours started about brown eggs being
“better” is thought to be because they

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.710
are often more expensive at supermarkets.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.450
If something costs more, it has to be better
quality or better for you, right?

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.600
Not in this case (and not in many others either-
increasing the price of something, sometimes

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.720
drastically, is an occasionally used marketing
trick to get people to think one product is

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.910
better than a comparable cheaper product.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.870
Sometimes that’s true, but many times it’s
not.)

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.960
As for egg prices, brown eggs cost more in
part because the hens that lay them usually

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.570
eat more, which means the hens cost more to
keep per egg.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.220
You see, white eggs are most often laid by
white or light coloured hens with white ear

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.670
lobes, while brown eggs are most often laid
by red-feathered or brown / dark-feathered

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.330
chickens with red ear lobes.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.890
(This is not a universal truth, just a general
rule.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.730
Further, the chicken’s ear lobes are really
the indicator here, not the feathers, but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.499
there is a very strong correlation between
ear lobe colour and feather colour, so feather

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.830
colour can be a decent indicator too.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.709
Ultimately, egg colour is determined by genetics,
but the ear-lobe / feather colour thing is

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.209
a good, though slightly flawed indicator.)

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.870
In the end, red-lobed chickens tend to be
larger than their white-lobed counterparts,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.610
which is why they eat more.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.739
The farmers need to get reimbursed for the
extra feed somehow, so they up the price of

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.159
the brown eggs.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.459
This also explains why white eggs tend to
be more popular in supermarkets.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.450
White-lobed chickens cost less for farmers
to keep, which leads to cheaper eggs, which

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.140
leads to grocers buying more white eggs to
put on the shelves to offer this product cheaper

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.140
to customers.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.299
White eggs are simply more cost-effective.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.170
There is also a commonly touted myth that
brown eggs taste better, and that’s why

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.450
they’re more expensive.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.689
As noted, this white egg / brown egg taste
difference is a myth.

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.451
But the potential difference in taste from
one egg to another does lead us to our one

00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:21.760
caveat, though it isn’t anything to do with
the colour of the egg—rather, it has to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.870
do with the chicken’s diet.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.840
Many chickens raised at home are brown-egg
layers, while most of the chickens raised

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.370
for commercial use are white-egg layers.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.449
The different diets affect the taste of the
eggs and even the colour of the yolk, similar

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.950
to how diet can drastically affect the taste
of the meat of some animal.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.709
However, if you were to take one of those
brown egg-laying chickens and raise it on

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.069
the same food as a white egg laying chicken,
their eggs would taste the same and be otherwise

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.930
indistinguishable aside from the colour of
the shell.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.120
If their diets are the same, the yolks will
even be identical in colour.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.689
Today, chickens raised for commercial purposes,
whether layers of white eggs or brown, are

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.749
all getting fed the same thing, with perhaps
just a slight variance from company to company.

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.449
If you’ve had some brown eggs from a neighbor
or a chicken of your own that’s fed a different

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.769
diet than commercially fed chickens eat, then
there may be a difference in taste.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.409
It just doesn’t have anything to do with
the colour of the egg.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.680
So, if brown egg-laying chickens are more
expensive to feed and to keep, why do farmers

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.720
keep them around?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.229
The answer is that so many people buy into
the “brown eggs are better” myth that

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.419
brown eggs are still a viable business option.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.479
As long as people keep buying the more expensive
eggs and are willing to pay marked up prices

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.250
beyond factoring in the extra feed, farmers
will keep raising chickens that lay them.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.789
Of course, these days some of the most hotly
debated arguments aren’t over white vs.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.430
brown eggs, but over the superior quality
of organic vs. not organic eggs, or free range

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.090
vs. cage eggs.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.330
While differences in diet can affect the taste,
if you’re wondering about quality of the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.620
egg or nutritional value, a study done by
D.R. Jones et al. through the Agricultural

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.751
Research Service and published in Poultry
Science in 2010 found that, ultimately, there

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:11.330
is very little difference in the quality of
eggs produced in these different ways.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.020
The small differences they did find “varied
without one egg type consistently maintaining

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.620
the highest or lowest values.”

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.180
So, in the end, while there are small ways
the composition and taste of chicken eggs

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:40.039
can be influenced, the colour of the egg shell
isn’t one of them.
