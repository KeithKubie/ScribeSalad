00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.580 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Two Washington D.C. high school
students, Amaud Woodward [assumed spelling]

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.130 position:61%
and Tanae Crumlin [assumed spelling]
meet award winning author Tanya Bolden,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.800
to discuss the research and writing
process around her book entitled,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.510 position:61%
Capital Days: Michael Shiner's Journal.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.700 position:75%
The book spans more than 60 years of American
history, highlighting a period of immense change

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960 position:56%
in our country and its capital, much
of it witnessed by Michael Shiner.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.150 position:73%
Born enslaved but eventually able to secure
his freedom, Shiner left behind a rich journal,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.630 position:67%
which is housed at the library of Congress.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.720 position:64%
In his journal, Shiner recounted the
burning of a city during the war of 1812,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.620
to the laying of the cornerstone
for the Washington Monument,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.080
as well as the inauguration
of eleven presidents.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.830 position:69%
Much as she did, in her award winning books,
Maritcha and Searching for Sarah Rector,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.860
Tonya Bolden expertly examines the
intricacies of American history

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 position:59%
through the lens of one person's life.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.300 position:69%
&gt;&gt; I want to begin by asking you how did you
start your writing process with this book?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.800
&gt;&gt; For this book, with panic.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.340
Every book begins with panic.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.990
10th book, 15th book, 18th book,
24th book, it begins with panic.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.410 position:59%
Because I think that this is new, it's
stuff that I've never done before.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.780 position:75%
Because no book is like the last one that I did.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.370 position:59%
Capital Days is not like Sarah Rector.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.740
And then I kind of calm down
and then I go to the research.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.590
That's what saves me.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.840
And I think everything comes
out in the research.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.820
&gt;&gt; So, how do you organize your
research for the writing process?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.710 position:64%
&gt;&gt; Ok. Well, for one thing I do, if I'm
getting newspaper articles from online --

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.880
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.090 position:66%
&gt;&gt; I tend to, because I don't know I don't
trust things I don't understand things --

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.220
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.390 position:59%
&gt;&gt; I have to save them on my computer.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.270 position:56%
In case if I'm not just on their
site but I save it onto my computer.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.740 position:70%
And I've been better, I used to have like, it
would be like Michael Shiner in everything.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.380
My drafts, my memos, everything
was in one folder.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.660 position:69%
But now I break out into newspaper articles,
other references and break it all out.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.390
Because the trouble comes when you
do that research is you lose stuff.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.950
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.860
&gt;&gt; So generally when I write also,
sometimes, I write and research.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.720
And kind of switch back and forth.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.540 position:69%
I may be writing, this was in the past when
he talks about the hard year without summer,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.940
and I put TK and say go find
out what that means.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.100
You know, I look it up quickly
and I'll keep writing

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.130
and then I'll go back and
research what I don't know.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.640
Sometimes I need to write it
out and put TK what I don't know

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.750 position:63%
and then go back and fill in the blanks.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.260
&gt;&gt; What does TK mean?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Well that say it just means to come,
although it doesn't make any sense,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.870
but I think it's because it's
the only combination of letters

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.650 position:58%
that don't exist in American English.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.300
I don't think you'll find any word.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.460 position:59%
So it's easy to track in a manuscript.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.610 position:58%
You put TK and then find out, like TK
Mohammad Ali's trunks were TK color

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.890
and then go back in and say look.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.010
And I think that's the rationality,
that's the only two,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.940 position:72%
the combination that you never find in a word.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.030
&gt;&gt; That's deep, actually.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.950 position:64%
&gt;&gt; So, a lot of times and because I think
there's a difference between, you know,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.470 position:56%
kind of getting the arc [assumed
spelling] and getting the story out.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.010
You can always find the details.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.260 position:69%
So I'll usually have a lot of TKs in my work
and just say ok you know where this is going

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.810
and then getting to a point and
saying, say at the end of, I guess,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.290
he's reunited with his family
and then say ok now what?

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:00.370 position:63%
Whoa, I've been so into Shiner I need to
talk about, ok what's the feel of D.C.?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.750 position:61%
What's the everyday life of Washington?

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.130 position:66%
And then I say go read some newspapers
from around the time his family was freed.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.620 position:64%
And that's where I found out about
pickled oysters and how much a book cost.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.290
I just went looking for articles
to give a flavor.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.780 position:73%
Because I think at different stages when you're
writing and then you'll find what you need.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.290
&gt;&gt; So, being from New York,
did you have to any research

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.110 position:63%
for primary and secondary sources there?

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.190
&gt;&gt; In New York?

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.810
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.510
&gt;&gt; Yes. But you know what?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.720 position:69%
With this digitization age, is amazing
because I needed to read a lot of newspapers

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.540 position:64%
from Washington in the 19th century, for
example The Daily National Intelligencer,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.030
The Evening Star.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.150 position:59%
But I could do it, I had a
subscription to genealogy [inaudible].

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.150 position:58%
So, you know, from my desktop I could
read all of these newspaper articles.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.320 position:70%
In the last, I guess,10, 15 years that
research has really become just amazing to do

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.260 position:72%
because you can do so much from your computer.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.930 position:63%
You know, before you had certain people.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.610 position:64%
You know, research wasn't really
democratic because you had to have budget

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.430
to be able to travel to archives --

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.560
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.170 position:70%
&gt;&gt; And spend time in cities to go through
archives, you know, and then you had to rely,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.960 position:73%
if you didn't have the money for that, then
you had to rely on all these secondary sources.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.770 position:73%
Whereas now it's so much online it's just, even
the photo research, you know is just amazing.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.280 position:59%
&gt;&gt; So, would you consider the
research process now is easier than --

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.110 position:63%
&gt;&gt; I would say, well, it's easier to do.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.990 position:61%
We can access more material but you can
become so obsessive because there are

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.130 position:61%
so many subscriber sites or free sites.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.270
You can just go and go and
go and go and go crazy.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.090 position:69%
So at least I always think, well I'm
learning something I'll use in another book.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.190 position:58%
Because, you know, I'll go read
every article and then you go off on,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.950
but see going off on tangents
is how I found Shiner.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.560
I was researching for Sarah
Rector and I stumbled upon Shiner.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.840
So, it has its benefits.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.320
But it's much easier and less
expensive to research now.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.580
You can dig deeper.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.220 position:75%
See the problem before was a lot of times you
deal with secondary sources and you get a quote.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.310
Right?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.650
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.120
&gt;&gt; And you use it and you quote
it and you give your source.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.250 position:61%
But I started to notice sometimes I
would see a quote in a secondary source

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.790 position:63%
and I would go try to find the original.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.220 position:69%
And very often I find that people, what they
will do is, they'll take a quote and kind

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.830
of manipulate it in a way so
that it illustrates their point.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.650 position:63%
But when you read the original quote you
say, that's not quite what they mean.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.800
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.440
&gt;&gt; That's one thing I can do now.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.120
I can go, if someone was quoting
The Evening Star, I can go now

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.020
and check The Evening Star
and use the primary source.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.120
So, yeah.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.780
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
