- Alright, our first
headline is from Connecticut.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:07.073 line:0%
Baseball is just
starting up there

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.744
and the police in Ridgefield,
Connecticut are investigating

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.347
a fire in which 25
gallons of gasoline

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.317
were doused onto
a baseball field

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.854
by someone who thought
that was the best way

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
to dry out the field
after heavy rain.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.961
- So it rained before
a little league game,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.362
who was it, was it the manager

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.597
of one of the teams?

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.931 align:start size:81% position:19%
Was it like the
home team manager?

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.166
- It's unclear.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.601
- Ah, but somebody
was like "I'll dry-

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.902
- Police are investigating.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:36.870
- Someone was like,
"I'll dry the field

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.638
"so these kids can play ball."

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.608 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then just lit
the infield on fire.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:43.309 align:start size:84% position:16%
Using how many
gallons of gasoline?

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
(laughs) - 50
gallons, and you know

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.715
with that amount
of firepower there,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.784
they lost a little
bit of control of it.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:51.751
- No, I mean

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.952
(unintelligible stuttering)

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
they've used
helicopters in the past

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.188
to try to dry off a field.

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.289
Doesn't really work.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.857
Uh, Erica, do we have a video

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.759
of that little league
game where they try

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start size:84% position:16%
to dry off the
field with gasoline?

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.664
(screams coming from
video on computer)

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.733
(laughs)

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.404
- I mean-

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.338
- Yeah, I mean,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.273
you'd think they would've,

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.808
at what point did they call it?

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.708
- They did,

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.976
they canceled the game.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.411
There's no games being played.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.747
It could cost up to $50,000.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
(screaming on
computer continues)

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.918
(all laughing)

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.520
I mean it's another
reminder, don't-

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.888
- These kids just
wanna play a game.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.156
- Right, it's another reminder-

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.724
- And now, they're
in this situation.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.995
- We don't have these
problems in California.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:39.132
Like our fires are natural
and they're in the hills.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.400
We don't have to worry about,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.269
you know, rain on
a baseball field

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.771
that you have to
dry out for fires.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.738 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's another reason.
- No.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.940
- Like the longer I live here,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.975 align:start size:88% position:13%
the more insane it
seems that anyone lives

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.276
in the Northeast.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.012
- I'm just glad that
this was a baseball,

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
you know, this happened
at a baseball game,

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.982
not a football game,

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:57.117
because there's so
many more players

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:57.951
on the football team.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.918
Do you know what I mean?

00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.752
If you listen to that clip,

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.288
you hear 18, 20 kids.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.590
You know, having a hard time.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.125
Play it again.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.359
(screaming from video)

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.293
(giggling)

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.461
Yeah, you know what I mean?

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.395 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's like, they're
in the dugout.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.030
They're a little worried.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.800
I think most of them got
out with minor injuries.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.736
Smoke inhalation will
follow them forever,

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:19.472 align:start size:88% position:13%
but I think that if it'd
been football players

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.541
that it would've
been melted helmets

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.375
and stuff like that.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.209
You don't need that.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.344
(screaming plays again)

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.513
And these kids, you know,

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just hope they get a
chance to make up the game.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.817
(laughing)

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.119
And some adults moving forward,

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.587
find a better way
to dry the field

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.924 align:start size:84% position:16%
than burning a bunch
of kids to death.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:40.260
- Our last headline's
from the great country-

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.094
- This is my favorite
story of the week.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.295
- Yeah, I knew it was.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.730
(laughing)

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.465 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know it's Anthony's
favorite because it goes last.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.400
The great country of Brazil,

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.371
where a judge this week ordered

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:55.942 align:start size:88% position:13%
that a pair of
identical twins both pay

00:02:55.942 --> 00:03:00.880
child support to a woman who
is seeking paternity results

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.585
because neither one
of them will admit

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.120
to being the father.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.125
They are identical
twins, and she knows

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.494
that she slept with one of them.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:18.064
The paternity test for one of
the guys turned up positive,

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:22.101
but they made his identical
brother also take a test,

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.038
and that also came up positive.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.106
And now they both have
to pay child support.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:28.541
- And she's saying
that she doesn't know

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.642
which brother she slept with?

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:30.577
- How would she know?

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.045
I mean, they're identical twins.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.746 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm sure their
names are different.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:34.681
You know what I mean?

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.915
I don't know, uh,

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:37.483
I assume there's
more to the story,

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.152
that she slept with both guys.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.454
That she slept with both
twins at certain points.

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
Maybe one of the
twins was like, "Hey,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.391
"I slept with this girl.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.492
"Uh...

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:47.527
"Now's your chance."

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.795
Do you know what I mean?

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:49.963
I don't know how twins work.

00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:51.197
- They both deny it.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
The first guy denied
he was the father

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
even though the
paternity test came back.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.605
And so that's why they made
the identical twin brother

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.872
do it as well.

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.474
But there's even
more to the story.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:04.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
The judge in the
case, who was livid,

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.780
said it was evident
that the defendants

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.150
from adolescence took
advantage and continued

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.785
to take advantage
of the fact that

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.220
they're identical twins.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start size:94% position:6%
It became clear that
they have repeatedly used

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.326
each other's name to attract
as many women as possible,

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
and to hide
instances of betrayal

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:23.696
in their relationships.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.065 align:start size:84% position:16%
So this is like a
long con that they do

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.300
with lots of women.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.102 align:start size:84% position:16%
- If the judge says
that about two people,

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.770
why weren't they
killed on the spot?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.238
(chuckling)

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.574
Like if they're that,

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:35.708
(sighs) what's the word?

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.909
Insidious?

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.311
With their twin behavior?

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.079
You gotta put them
in separate prisons,

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.148
or you gotta kill
them on the spot.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.250
Or mark one of their faces,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.184
you know what I mean,

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:48.054
with like a brand, you know?

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.522
That just says like, "Twin."

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.624
(laughing)

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.126
- It's kind of,

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.661
I wouldn't say it's
really working out,

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.263 align:start size:94% position:6%
because it took a while
to go through courts. And-

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.197
- But they get to split-

00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.932
- Now the kid's nine years old.

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.434
They are not splitting,

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:03.803
that's kind of the twist,
is they're both paying-

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.038
- Equal?

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:07.106
They're both paying
like the maximum?

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.808
- Right, which is depressingly

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.312
only $60 each, a month.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.713 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What?
- But apparently,

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:17.016
that's above what
you would expect

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.986
for minimum wage, which is
what they make in Brazil.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.921
So she's actually getting double

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:24.857
what she would've gotten
from either one of them.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.794 align:start size:84% position:16%
If one of them just
said, "I'm the father"

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:30.096
then they could've split it

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.031
and they would've
been paying half.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.366 align:start size:84% position:16%
But instead they're
paying double.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
- But what's to stop
one of the twins

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.603
from coming up and being
like, "Here's your $60."

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.038
And then she goes to the
other twin and he's like,

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:39.872
"What do you mean?

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:40.940
"I just gave it to you."

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.774
(laughing)

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:42.709
You know what I mean?

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:43.643
This could go on forever.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.211
You gotta brand their faces.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.647
You gotta brand their faces.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.182
And this kid's nine years old?

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.218 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Well now, yeah, the girl
is now nine years old.

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:54.120
It took forever to
go through courts

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.055
and all sorts of
different things.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.256
- Is there any visitation?

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.892 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't think
they're too interested,

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.795 align:start size:81% position:19%
it is kind of like
a sad reality.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.897 align:start size:88% position:13%
Did you have any
friends that were twins?

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
Two of my best
friends were twins.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.000
- There were two sets of twins,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.603
the Nelson brothers and
the McBride brothers.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:12.138
- Shout out to the Veeteck's,

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:14.640 align:start size:84% position:16%
two of the best people
I've ever known,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.343
who weren't identical,
but everyone thought

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:20.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
they were identical
except for their friends

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:21.280
or the people that
really knew them

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.715
that could definitely
tell the difference.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.217
And that's the type of
thing in high school

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.284
that everyone talks about.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.519
It's like, "Oh, Bob!

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.454
"Why don't you go
do this and that

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:31.691
"and say you're Jeff to a girl?"

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:35.194
Everyone is always
pushing twins to go

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.396
in this direction.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.097
- Twins are screwed up.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.032
I think we should go back to,

00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:42.368 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know back in the day,
if someone had twins,

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.603
and they were identical,

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.871
they would throw
them off a cliff.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:47.473
Very Game of Thrones style.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.742
You don't see a lot of
twins on Game of Thrones.

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.844 align:start size:84% position:16%
Of course, you know,
the vampire twins

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:53.346
from The Matrix Reloaded.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.281
Those are two of the
worst people ever.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:57.950
Not a twin guy-

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.019 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Not a twin guy. (laughs)
- The twins in my high school,

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.254
the twins in my high school,

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.455 align:start size:88% position:13%
I remember their parents
wouldn't let them

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.990
do things without each other.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.091
They're like, "What
if something happens

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.526
"to one of you?

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
"You'd want the other
one to be there."

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.263
I think they had to go
to college together, too.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.865 align:start size:97% position:3%
- My friends went to college
together, The Veeteck's.

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:15.868
- If you're identical twins,

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.837
I assume you're a
flat out rapist.

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:20.873
- Please, you could
look at this from a-

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:21.841
- Give me one example.

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.277
- The Veeteck's, they're clean.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.313
- I'll believe it when I see it.

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:28.381 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You could look at this-
- It's too easy.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:30.082
- In so many cases-

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:30.983
- It's too tempting.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:32.185
- In so many cases-

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:33.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:34.487
- What's that documentary?

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:35.321
Three Brothers?

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.255
- Three identical twin-

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.958
uh, three identical strangers.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.993
- And there's so many cases,

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:43.095
and I'm thinking of
this with my friends

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.397
who are totally different

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.165
like totally different in terms

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.934 align:start size:88% position:13%
of their personality,
the lives that they led,

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:49.335
the types of people.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:51.471
You know, they date,
all that sort of stuff.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.606
You know, that happens
all the time with twins

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.875
but you can look at
this story as like

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.043
they're in it to win it.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:00.012 align:start size:84% position:16%
They've stayed buddies
this whole time

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.147
with this scheme.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.648
They're very similar.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:03.850
They're close.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.351 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah but they're still
making minimum wage

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.821
in Brazil, which is not
at the height of success.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:09.822
I'll tell you this right now,

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.491
if I had a twin brother,

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.325
I'd kill him.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:17.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
I wouldn't risk the
temptation taking over,

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.632
I would kill my twin brother.

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:20.833
- Wouldn't you,

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.368 align:start size:88% position:13%
I feel like you'd be
attracted to him though.

00:08:22.368 --> 00:08:23.402
- Of course.

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:25.872
Of course I would.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:26.939
Are you crazy?

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.307
He's my brother, I'm not blind.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.243
You know what I mean?

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It could just drive
you crazy to have

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.713
this other guy out there-
- It's one of the reasons

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:34.547
I'd have to kill him.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:35.781
You know what I mean?

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:40.386
So I wouldn't sleep
with my twin brother.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:42.488 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It would really
be an amazing thing-

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.490
- I would never sleep
with my actual brother.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.424
- Yeah.

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.626
- There's a seven year age gap.

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
But a twin brother,
nothing wrong with that.

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.230
But I would have to kill him.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.665
I would have to kill him.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.668
(rock music plays)
