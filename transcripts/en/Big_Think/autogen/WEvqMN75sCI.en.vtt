it's not that easy to categorize jobs

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850
it's not that easy to categorize jobs
 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.180
it's not that easy to categorize jobs
but here's a categorization scheme

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190
but here's a categorization scheme
 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.530
but here's a categorization scheme
that's kind of general but that's

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540
that's kind of general but that's
 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.140
that's kind of general but that's
actually accurate okay so the first

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150
actually accurate okay so the first
 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.200
actually accurate okay so the first
dimension is complexity jobs range from

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210
dimension is complexity jobs range from
 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.779
dimension is complexity jobs range from
simple to complex a simple job is one

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789
simple to complex a simple job is one
 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.510
simple to complex a simple job is one
that you can learn and then repeat okay

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520
that you can learn and then repeat okay
 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.670
that you can learn and then repeat okay
you don't need high levels of cognitive

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680
you don't need high levels of cognitive
 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.029
you don't need high levels of cognitive
function for a simple job if if you have

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039
function for a simple job if if you have
 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.680
function for a simple job if if you have
high levels of cognitive function you'll

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690
high levels of cognitive function you'll
 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.619
high levels of cognitive function you'll
learn the job faster but once you learn

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629
learn the job faster but once you learn
 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.300
learn the job faster but once you learn
it you won't necessarily do it better

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310
it you won't necessarily do it better
 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.270
it you won't necessarily do it better
okay but now a complex job is one where

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280
okay but now a complex job is one where
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.620
okay but now a complex job is one where
the requirements change on an ongoing

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630
the requirements change on an ongoing
 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.500
the requirements change on an ongoing
basis so most managerial jobs are like

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510
basis so most managerial jobs are like
 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.389
basis so most managerial jobs are like
that and all executive jobs are like

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399
that and all executive jobs are like
 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.460
that and all executive jobs are like
that and that requires a high level of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470
that and that requires a high level of
 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.110
that and that requires a high level of
general cognitive ability that's the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
general cognitive ability that's the
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.790
general cognitive ability that's the
best predictor of success in complex

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800
best predictor of success in complex
 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.459
best predictor of success in complex
jobs okay so that's that's access number

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469
jobs okay so that's that's access number
 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.350
jobs okay so that's that's access number
one access number two is creative slash

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360
one access number two is creative slash
 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.389
one access number two is creative slash
entrepreneurial versus managerial slash

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399
entrepreneurial versus managerial slash
 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.600
entrepreneurial versus managerial slash
administrative okay so for creative

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610
administrative okay so for creative
 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.060
administrative okay so for creative
entrepreneurial jobs you need people who

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
entrepreneurial jobs you need people who
 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.890
entrepreneurial jobs you need people who
are high in the trait personality trait

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900
are high in the trait personality trait
 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.930
are high in the trait personality trait
openness to experience big five

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940
openness to experience big five
 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.670
openness to experience big five
personality trait that's associated with

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
personality trait that's associated with
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.609
personality trait that's associated with
lateral and divergent thinking and those

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619
lateral and divergent thinking and those
 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.910
lateral and divergent thinking and those
are creative types and for managerial

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
are creative types and for managerial
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.219
are creative types and for managerial
and administrative jobs and those are

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229
and administrative jobs and those are
 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.929
and administrative jobs and those are
jobs that are more algorithmic and so

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939
jobs that are more algorithmic and so
 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.289
jobs that are more algorithmic and so
like imagine the guardrails you're a

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299
like imagine the guardrails you're a
 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.330
like imagine the guardrails you're a
train on a track and you want to go down

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340
train on a track and you want to go down
 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.340
train on a track and you want to go down
the track fast you don't have to be

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350
the track fast you don't have to be
 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.840
the track fast you don't have to be
creative to go down a track that's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850
creative to go down a track that's
 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.120
creative to go down a track that's
already laid down fast you have to be

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
already laid down fast you have to be
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.880
already laid down fast you have to be
conscientious and so the best predictor

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
conscientious and so the best predictor
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.830
conscientious and so the best predictor
personality predictor for managerial and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
personality predictor for managerial and
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.390
personality predictor for managerial and
administrative jobs is trait

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400
administrative jobs is trait
 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.390
administrative jobs is trait
conscientiousness okay so there's a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400
conscientiousness okay so there's a
 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.300
conscientiousness okay so there's a
tension in organizations between lateral

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310
tension in organizations between lateral
 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.640
tension in organizations between lateral
and divergent thinking and efficient

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650
and divergent thinking and efficient
 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.280
and divergent thinking and efficient
movement forward now if you know what

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290
movement forward now if you know what
 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.330
movement forward now if you know what
you're doing what you want is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
you're doing what you want is
 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.670
you're doing what you want is
conscientious people because if you know

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
conscientious people because if you know
 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.870
conscientious people because if you know
what you're doing you should just do it

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
what you're doing you should just do it
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.149
what you're doing you should just do it
as efficiently as you can

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159
as efficiently as you can
 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.830
as efficiently as you can
but the problem is is the world changes

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840
but the problem is is the world changes
 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.770

around you unexpectedly and so if you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780
around you unexpectedly and so if you
 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.910
around you unexpectedly and so if you
don't have people who can think

it most certainly will then you don't
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.679
it most certainly will then you don't
have anybody who can figure out where to

things that conscientious people are
 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.800
things that conscientious people are
much less likely to be able to tolerate

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810
much less likely to be able to tolerate
 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.030

enterprise is to understand that these

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
enterprise is to understand that these
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.410
enterprise is to understand that these
are actually different people okay so

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
are actually different people okay so
 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.770
are actually different people okay so
first of all everyone is not creative

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780
first of all everyone is not creative
 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.190
first of all everyone is not creative
that's a lie there's so we we

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
that's a lie there's so we we

questionnaire which is very widely used

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220
questionnaire which is very widely used
 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.910
questionnaire which is very widely used
in creativity research now okay and what

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
in creativity research now okay and what
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.310
in creativity research now okay and what
you see so what it does is it breaks

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320
you see so what it does is it breaks
 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.700
you see so what it does is it breaks
down creativity into 13 dimensions

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710

then it ranks order levels of creativity

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860
then it ranks order levels of creativity

right it's like how the hell do you

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
right it's like how the hell do you

evaluate a creative person because they
 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.080
evaluate a creative person because they
keep changing the rules of evaluation so

fast so if there's this terrible tension

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
fast so if there's this terrible tension
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.440
fast so if there's this terrible tension
in organizations and I think what

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450
in organizations and I think what
 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.420
in organizations and I think what
generally happens is all the creative

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
generally happens is all the creative
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.430
generally happens is all the creative
people are there at the beginning they

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440
people are there at the beginning they
 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.020
people are there at the beginning they
get chased out until you have nothing

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030
get chased out until you have nothing
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.210
get chased out until you have nothing
but managers and administrators then the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220
but managers and administrators then the
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.159
but managers and administrators then the
environment shifts then the company dies

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169
environment shifts then the company dies
 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.970
environment shifts then the company dies
and so the way that capitalism solves

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980
and so the way that capitalism solves
 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.860
and so the way that capitalism solves
the problem of the tension between the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870
the problem of the tension between the
 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.420
the problem of the tension between the
creative types and the managerial types

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430
creative types and the managerial types
 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.390
creative types and the managerial types
is it just lets companies die now you

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400
is it just lets companies die now you
 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.860
is it just lets companies die now you
might think well I don't want my company

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870
might think well I don't want my company
 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.750
might think well I don't want my company
to die it's like okay then you would

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760
to die it's like okay then you would
 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.159
to die it's like okay then you would
need to understand the difference

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169
need to understand the difference
 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.990
need to understand the difference
between these two kinds of people which

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000
between these two kinds of people which
 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.250
between these two kinds of people which
you probably won't and you probably

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260
you probably won't and you probably
 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.159
you probably won't and you probably
won't admit to even if you knew and then

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169
won't admit to even if you knew and then
 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.750
won't admit to even if you knew and then
you have to figure out how to get the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760
you have to figure out how to get the
 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.320
you have to figure out how to get the
balance right and so that's

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330
balance right and so that's
 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.840
balance right and so that's
extraordinarily complicated so

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850
 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.089
