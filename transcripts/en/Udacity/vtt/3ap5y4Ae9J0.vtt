00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me modify my question and let me say this time I expressed things

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in terms of standard deviations and not variances.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Each of these has a standard deviation of 10 m.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You ought to know that the combined Âµ will be 200 m, but what about the new standard deviation.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can actually calculate this and give me at least an approximate answer.
