00:00:00.983 --> 00:00:03.244
Javier is calibrating sophisticated

00:00:03.244 --> 00:00:05.388
medical imaging equipment.

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.721
The manual reports that the tangent

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:10.992
of a particular angle is one.

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:12.896
So that's saying that the tangent

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:14.240
and let's say that that particular angle

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.977
is theta is equal to one.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.986
What should Javier do to find the angle?

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.472
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:22.864
and look at these choices

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:23.837
and think about which of these

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:27.829
should he do to find the angle?

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:31.204
So let's look through each of them.

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:32.211
So the first one...

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.492
well, actually, instead
of looking at the choices,

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:34.605
let's think about what we would do

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.752
to find the angle.

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:36.994
So they're saying that the tangent of

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:39.979
some angle is equal to one.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.900
Well one thing that you
might want to do is say

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.137
okay, if we take the inverse tangent,

00:00:45.137 --> 00:00:47.121
if we take the inverse tangent,

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:50.273
of the tangent of theta,

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:51.792
so if we take the inverse tangent

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:53.221
of both sides of this,

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:54.189
we of course would get

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:56.564
the inverse tangent of
the tangent of theta.

00:00:56.564 --> 00:01:00.338
If the domain over here is
restricted appropriately,

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:02.390
is just going to be equal to theta,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.698
so we could say the theta

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.147
is going to be the inverse tangent of one.

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:08.035
So it might be tempting to just

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.908
pick this one right over here.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.436
Type inverse tangent of
one into his calculator.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:16.787
So maybe this looks like the best choice.

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:17.696
But remember,

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.217
I said if we restrict the
domain right over here.

00:01:21.217 --> 00:01:23.086
if we restrict the
possible values of tangent,

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:25.113
of theta here appropriately,

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:29.151
then this is going to simplify to this.

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.190
But there is a scenario

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.852
where this does not happen.

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:35.191
And that's if we pick
thetas that are outside

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.698
of the range of the
inverse tangent function.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.074
What do I mean by that?

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:42.006
Well it's really just based on the idea

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.262
that there are multiple
angles that have...

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:48.930
or multiple angles whose tangent is one.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.870
And let me draw that here

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.332
with a unit circle here.

00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:53.799
So we draw a unit circle,

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:56.242
so that's my x axis,

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:58.304
that's my y axis,

00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:01.306
let me draw my unit circle here.

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:02.603
Actually you probably don't even

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:03.756
have to draw the unit circle,

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.097
because the tangent is really much more

00:02:05.097 --> 00:02:07.278
about the slope of the ray

00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:08.573
created by the angle,

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:10.532
than where it intersects the unit circle

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:13.035
as would be the case with sine and cosine.

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:14.356
So if you have..

00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:17.014
so you could have this
angle right over here.

00:02:17.418 --> 00:02:20.477
So let's say this is a candidate theta,

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:22.016
where the tangent of this theta is

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:23.891
the slope of this line,

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:25.903
and this terminal angle,

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:27.086
the terminal ray, you could say

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:28.152
of the angle.

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:29.914
The other side, the initial ray,

00:02:29.914 --> 00:02:31.731
is along the positive x axis.

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:32.738
And so you could say,

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:34.632
okay the tangent of this theta,

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.065
the tangent of this theta is one.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.148
Because the slope of this line is one.

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:39.056
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.685
Well, so let me write it this way.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:44.401
So tangent theta is equal to one.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.170
But I can construct another theta

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.052
whose tangent is equal to one

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:49.533
by going all the way over here

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.704
and essentially going in
the opposite direction

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.640
but the slope of this line,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.478
so let's call this theta two,

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:59.110
tangent of theta two is also

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.569
going to be equal to one.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.266
And of course you could go another

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.649
pi radiance and go back
to the original angle,

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.991
but that's functionally the same angle

00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.822
in terms of where it is relative

00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:12.560
to the positive x axis,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.993
or what direction it points into,

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.196
but this one is fundamentally

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.818
a different angle.

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:18.647
So we do not know,

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:20.858
we do not have enough information

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:22.718
just given what we've been told

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:23.806
to know exactly

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:25.113
which theta we're talking about,

00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:26.846
whether we're talking
about this orange theta

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:28.336
or this mauve theta.

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.436
So I would say the get more information,

00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:34.329
there are multiple angles
which fit this description.
