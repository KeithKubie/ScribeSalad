voted in no they guys are something yeah

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940
voted in no they guys are something yeah
 

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.419
voted in no they guys are something yeah
no I like the fact that again you see

00:24:38.419 --> 00:24:38.429
no I like the fact that again you see

where the sympathizers are coming from
 

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.899
where the sympathizers are coming from
and I think that makes the idea of

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:41.909

00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:44.629
and I think that makes the idea of
taking her down even tougher and even

00:24:44.629 --> 00:24:44.639
taking her down even tougher and even
 

00:24:44.639 --> 00:24:46.460
taking her down even tougher and even
more realistic you know because they are
