1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,310
What will happen. The Joe
Rogan experience. It's
funny cause inevitable let,

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,460
like you do a lot of,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,990
I noticed that the whole MMA stand up
making everyone laugh and then you hide.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,100
No, you were, you haunted as
well. You know what it is, man.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,260
I don't have anybody
telling me what to do,

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,000
so because I don't have
anybody telling me what to do,

7
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:18,390
I gravitate towards things that I'm really
interested, which is why you're here.

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,980
Right. You know what I'm saying? Like I
found out about your story. I was like,

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,990
that guy seems cool and I saw youtube
videos. I go, oh, he's cool. All right,

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,360
let's do this. Yeah, I mean that's like,

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,950
to have that kind of freedom in your
life is a beautiful thing and I feel

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,360
incredibly fortunate that I have that
kind of freedom. So I indulge it.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,940
I indulge it like a little baby,
like a child.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,090
Like I just gravitate towards things
that I like to do and you know,

15
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:46,370
people could say it's stereotypically
toxic masculinity or what it was. Okay.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,020
Yeah, I like it. It's like,
I'm nice, I'm a nice person,

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,740
but I gravitate towards manly shit.
I like watching fights.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,960
I liked doing martial arts, fighting
while I buy. It's like buying a cars.

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,200
I like cars.
I like these things.

20
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,110
I mean I'm one of my got to pretend that
I don't like them to make other people

21
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,830
feel happy. Some people feel intimidated
by that. Like, oh, it's too Mami.

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,020
Oh that's the problem is you don't
want to look like an asshole.

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,920
Which I've experienced. You know, I look
like an asshole. I'll tell you this.

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll just look at me just like
I look like an asshole to me.

25
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm sure I look like an asshole.
The other be true.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,570
I don't think preciate that I started
to go, wow, this guy looks like a,

27
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,210
like a decent guy coming out
of that fancy Tesla. Actually,

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,590
I would think you're an environmentalist
and I probably douche bags probably

29
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:29,430
like Super Vegan. He looking at
it and annoying, right? Yeah.

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,500
Doesn't want your kids to get vaccinated

31
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,270
doing the shit you want to do that. That
that's, that's definitely a big deal, man.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,270
So I, I definitely respect that about you.
I feel that more people should do that.

33
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,610
And I think one of the things that we
have a problem with people doing what they

34
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:48,000
want to do is cause we don't get
to do what we want to do, right.

35
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,570
So when we see other people, they're
like, yeah, that's bullshit. We get mad.

36
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,170
Or we like, he doesn't even really like
that stuff for he's, you know, Oh yeah,

37
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:55,591
you're,
you're,

38
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,930
you're just falling into the typical
stereotypical masculine behavior.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,580
Maybe explore your sensitivity.
The

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,270
man will say that because the coaches
telling you how to do shit. I hate that.

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,670
It's usually men that are bitches.
Yeah. There's a lot of those.

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,780
Funny how that works. Yeah. Got Any
names for me now. I'll write them down.

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,120
I'll write them down. So speaking of that,
so interesting story for you. So, um,

44
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,651
yeah,
I was,

45
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,450
I was kind of talking back to tier guy
back and forth about being on the show.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
And the craziest thing happened where,
you know,

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,460
I was out here attracts you work on a
Tufts related project. Oh. Uh, and um,

48
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,170
to top secrets going to come out in a
couple of months, but basically, uh,

49
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,410
is that my job? Right. And then
I was like, hey, listen, um,

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,380
I got to take a week off to go out to
California to work on this project.

51
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,260
And then I was talking to your
guy and they're like, hey listen,

52
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,500
you're going to be out here. Come
back the next week as well. You know,

53
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:46,120
if you could say, hey listen,
you have two weeks out here.

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,850
They told my boss and he's like,
listen man,

55
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,140
like two weeks is kind of a long time. You
don't have any coverage. Like, you know,

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,850
I know you can be on Joe Rogan.
It's really cool,

57
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,400
but I'm not sure I can
let you do that or not.

58
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,960
So made a decision following in
your light. I said, you know what?

59
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,760
Then I'll leave my job then.
Oh Shit. Yeah. I left my job,
man. Damn. I left my job,

60
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:11,310
which is why I'm here. I need a
job. Joe, just fucking with you.

61
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,780
Did you really leave
your job? I did, yeah.

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,480
It was a big thing because I had this
whole meme thing going on my youtube

63
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,840
channel. Uh, and I used to say,
oh, I have a full time job.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,060
I can't work on these bills. I
can't do this. I can't do that.

65
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:26,680
I was getting in the way and you
have no idea. I finally left,

66
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,900
and this is kind of
the, I was reading, um,

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,560
your story awhile back about how you
got started in the whole comedy thing,

68
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,570
how you went out, you flooded
in Boston, went to La,

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,580
and it just felt so liberating
because literally, you know,

70
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,040
when you're doing something
you're not passionate about,

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,430
that's literally eight to 10 hours of
your day doing something that you just,

72
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:50,350
you just don't really want to do.
It's most of your day. It's, yeah,

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,140
because most of your day, so,
so it's insane. So I thought
to myself, you know what?

74
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,170
Everyone's in the rat race,
everyone's rushing to get somewhere.

75
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,450
Every year you're in your,
you know, the ball Boston,

76
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,010
like you're rushing to get on the train,

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,250
you're rushing to get somewhere
that you don't really want to be.

78
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:07,000
You're rushing there to work for eight
hours for someone else doing something

79
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:11,560
that you don't want to do and it just
gets taxing, man. It was, it was,

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,480
it was just taxing.
So,

81
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,900
and you're not going to do your best
with the things you do afterwards.

82
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,080
If you've been doing this thing for eight
hours, four hours that you have before,

83
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,850
you really have to go to bed.
When you get home at night,

84
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,660
you're not going to have the same kind
of energy that you had at noon or 10:00

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,870
AM or whatever it was when you woke up
or when you got to work your, what you,

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,000
what you're dealing with is this past,
this crossroads, right? You, you've,

87
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:37,001
you've hit this path where you can decide
to either not take a chance and just,

88
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,080
you just slowly take like
little incremental steps
towards what you really want

89
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:47,250
to do or take a risk, right?
And when you take a risk, yeah,

90
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,830
you don't have health insurance,
dental, you don't have to, right.

91
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,860
That's what the risk is all about,
right? That's, that's the only way.

92
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,810
And people like, yeah, but what if a fool?

93
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,630
But you can't think like that
because if you think like that,

94
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,480
you're gonna fail set. And
second of all, yeah, you might,

95
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,400
but then you got to do it again.

96
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,700
And if you continue to just fail and do
it again one day you'll figure out why

97
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:08,994
you're failing.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,150
If you're paying attention and if you're
doing your work and then you'll find

99
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,950
something that you can do
that you're successful at.

100
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,680
If somebody wants to hire you,
if you're good at your job,

101
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,100
if you go to a place and you're
valuable to that employer,

102
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:21,480
you could be valuable to yourself.

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,710
You just got to figure out how to do it
or what it is that you want to do that

104
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,240
you could do without having a boss
without, and something that feels natural,

105
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,170
something that you are,
you're,

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,470
you gravitate towards when you get up in
the morning and go, I'm fucking pumped.

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,490
I'm going to like, I work for myself.
Yeah. And I'm gonna do my thing. Right.

108
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,270
There's not a time where ever come
here to do a podcast while I go, fuck,

109
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,940
I can't believe I have to do this right
out of time. I must feel good. Thank you.

110
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,900
Yeah. Not Today. Not ever. Never. Never.
I mean, there's times when I leave.

111
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:50,420
I was like,
what the fuck was that about?

112
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,460
I could imagine there's a
couple that's in a thousand,

113
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,600
whatever podcasts I've done,

114
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:56,820
there's only been like a small
handful of those that have been like,

115
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:59,750
what fuck was that? Right.
If you can do that, man,

116
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,820
if you can find that
thing that you love to do,

117
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,690
whether it's making furniture or
fucking painting or whatever it is,

118
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,470
if you can ask it so you can make
a living doing that. God Damn,

119
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,420
that's everything. It changes the world.
The world becomes a better place. Yeah.

120
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,020
That's the goal, man. So, so we'll see.
So again, I took some cues from, uh,

121
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,900
from some inspiration from you when
you left Boston and you're like,

122
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,650
you know what? I'm going to do this comedy
thing. I want to figure it out. So what,

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,960
what was that like for you? So when did
you make the determination to say, hey,

124
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,450
you know what, I work at
this Gig, uh, you know,

125
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,150
this isn't the thing that I want to do.
And you made the jump, like what does it,

126
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,210
what was that like? The Boston
thing was super lucky. Um,

127
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,910
I was only 25 or less,

128
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,630
24 dash 24.
And uh,

129
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,430
I was doing standup and I was driving
limos during the day and doing a bunch of

130
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:48,800
different odd jobs and shit. And then, um,

131
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,250
I got seen by a manager who is coming
from New York to Boston to scout for new

132
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,480
talent. Okay. I just got dumb luck.

133
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,090
I wasn't even supposed
to be on the show and uh,

134
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,270
he asked me to go to New York
and do some spots in New York.

135
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:06,680
I did some spots there and then, uh, next
thing you know, I was living in New York.

136
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,250
I signed a contract with them and
I just upped packed up my shit.

137
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,980
And my grandparents were
still living in New Jersey.

138
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,330
They live on north ninth street,
which was like a,

139
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,710
when the time when they first moved there,
it was a pretty nice neighborhood,

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,730
middle class. But then as New York has
got kind of Funky, it's like skid row now.

141
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,810
Yeah, well it's just, it was
the next door neighbor, uh,

142
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,160
while I was living with him,

143
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,040
they broke down his house door
cause he was selling crack. Oh,

144
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,670
he had a dope Audi parked in his
driveway and they smashed his door with a

145
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,150
battering ram. And as soon as it was
a legit, that was an experience. Yeah.

146
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,640
Sketchy neighborhood. Um, but
that, so that's what I did.

147
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:45,020
I just packed up my shit and moved. I
mean, I didn't have any money. I didn't,

148
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,380
I didn't know if it was going to work
out at all, but I knew this was a chance.

149
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,940
But I was young. When you're
24, you're like, whatever,
health insurance, whatever.

150
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,670
I didn't have health insurance for a long
time. Do you have it now? Yeah. Okay,

151
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,450
good. That's good. Yeah. You got it.
Did you hate it when you quit this job?

152
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,480
Do you have it? At one wife has it. Okay,
well, there you go. So that was a scary,

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,610
just like, Shit. Hey, listen, what does
she say? She go for it. Ooh, I like it.

154
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,810
Good.
You've got a good one.
