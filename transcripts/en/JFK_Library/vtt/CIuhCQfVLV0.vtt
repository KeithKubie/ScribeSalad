00:00:00.347 --> 00:00:04.155
- Early '70s when we were
down to 11.1 poverty,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.822
which is the lowest we ever were

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.276
is that the good jobs went away

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:13.846
and we de-industrialized as a country.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.937
That's the heart of it.

00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:18.744
And most people who were poor,

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:21.535
except people who have disabilities,

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:24.452
they do have some income from work.

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:30.722
They're not some kind of
lazy something or other.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:34.889
So the economy changed, the
structure of the economy changed

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:37.992
in a very, very fundamental way,

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.575
and then you add to it the fact

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:44.498
that you have mass incarceration.

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.007
You add to it what's happened to the cost,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.757
on the other side, the
cost of housing, that.

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:56.585
There's a whole list of
things that have happened.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.780
The changes in family structure.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.650
You know, you can have
a big argument about,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.430
you know, should people
get married, people that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.774
dadadadada, you know.

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:05.509
That's a whole argument to have.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.209
But bottom line, if you
have in a low wage economy,

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:12.195
that there's only one wage earner

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.526
who happens to be the mom,

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:18.215
then you have a very,
very serious problem.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:21.456
And along with everything that I've said,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.813
and there's more to say,
what's happened to our schools

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:27.313
in a time where we need much more capacity

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.847
to work on rather technical things

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:36.759
compared to working in a
steel plant back in the 1950s.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.479
So all of this has changed,
and that's the reason

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.965
why with good public
policy, but not good enough,

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:47.715
we still have 43 million
people who are poor.
