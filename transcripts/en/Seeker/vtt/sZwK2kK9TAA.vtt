00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.830
New science is making it so doctors can take
a heart that's been dead for 20 minutes and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.729
implant it in another person.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.180
They're BEATING the odds.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.980
Yeah, that was a bad one.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.470
Heart transplantation surgery is the process
of taking a heart from a donor and placing

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.860
it another person to help their quality of
life.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.400
The first successful heart transplant was
in December 1967, and until recently, the

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.500
only way to transplant a heart was directly
from a cadaver to the recipient; mainly because

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.480
the heart has to be kept ALIVE and BEATING
(or on ice).

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.170
If the heart stops beating, it won't be used
for donation because it could be damaged from

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.110
a lack of blood supply… ironically.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.820
But doctors in Sydney are starting to change
this practice, and to prove their theories

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.360
they just implanted a "dead" heart into a
patient!

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.130
See, most organ donations use a beating-heart
cadaver, basically, a brain-dead human body

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.350
hooked up to a medical ventilator to keep
the organs alive.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
Within a few days, doctors can remove the
heart, put it in a cooler and fly it to where

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.489
it's needed.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:11.369
Once on ice, they have 4 to 6 hours to get
it INTO someone before it's spoiled.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.079
According to one source, only 4% of donors
have viable organs, and only a third of those

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.740
get used because of this time constraint.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.209
Thus, any advancement which can extend the
window in which a heart can viable, will increase

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:27.000
the number of hearts available and used!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.770
The dead heart they used in Sydney wasn't
ACTUALLY dead, but it had stopped beating

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170
for 20 minutes.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.630
Normally, they wouldn't use it at all, but
because of a machine called a "heart-in-a-box"

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.520
made by TransMedics, they were able to restart
the heart, fill it with the donors blood,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.560
warm it up, and then assess whether it was
still good before implanting it.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.679
This was two months ago.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.259
Today, the woman who got the first one is
doing great, and they've done similar operations

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.479
on three other patients since!

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.219
It's a huge breakthrough for organ donation!

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.999
This adds hours more to the process, allowing
more hearts to get used!

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.999
Yay!!

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.999
But if you're like me, you're thinking…

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.999
Why don't we just grow a damn heart already?

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.999
Well, we're not there yet.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.999
If we can do all this, then why not hearts?

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.999
Wouldn't MY heart be better than someone elses?

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.999
Well, we're not there yet.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.939
Scientists are able to create beating heart
cells, individual cells, in petri dishes,

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.959
but constructing a three-dimensional heart
is still many years away.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.989
Last year, researchers at the Texas Heart
Institute demonstrated they were able to take

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.019
a pig's heart, run detergent through it to
"strip away lipids, DNA, soluble proteins,

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.239
sugars and almost all the other cellular material,"
and then use what's left, called a extracellular

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.099
matrix, to create a new heart.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.610
It's sort of like EXTREME renovation.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.090
They've done this with a human heart too,
but e building on the framework of an existing

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.040
organ isn't as difficult as building a new
one on demand.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.040
That being said, earlier this month, a study
in Nature Medicine revealed how doctors used

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.160
stem cells from HUMANS to grow functional
human intestinal tissue inside of MICE.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.530
And YES, technology from Sahlgrenska University
Hospital can grow a whole blood vessel in

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.940
a week using stem cells floating in two tablespoons
of human blood.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.540
That vessel is essentially the donors own
tissue!

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.510
The next step is to begin growing the simpler
organs like back in April when a company in

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.540
the UK made a human ear, or nose…

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.069
We've got a long way to go.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.069
*sniff*

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.170
Are you an organ donor?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:30.460
Why or why not?
