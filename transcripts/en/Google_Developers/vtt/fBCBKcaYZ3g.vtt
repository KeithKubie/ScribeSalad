00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; CHENG: My name is Sega and this is my colleague
Albert. We are software engineers from iGoogle

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.320
JPack team. So today we are going to talk
about iGoogle Developer Portal and the tools.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.369
And the session is basically divided into
two parts. In the first half, I will talk

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.659
about the iGoogle Developer Portal which is
basically a gadget dashboard collecting your

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:32.480
gadget usage data. While in the second half
of this session, Albert will talk about a

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.129
very powerful tool for writing and developing
gadgets. And after that we will take questions

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.190
for Q&amp;A. And in this session we will both
do a quick demo of the new service and also

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.079
the new tool. Okay, so before we get started,
I would like to remind you that you can jump

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.760
in to the wave of this session. You can see
the notes being taken there, the question

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:10.870
being posted there and you can have live discussions
there. And the link is bit.ly/a598YY. Again

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:19.440
bit.ly/a598YY. Okay, so let's get started.
So here is the outline of today's session.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.140
So first, I will talk about iGoogle Gadgets
and OpenSocial. I believe many of you are

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.090
already familiar with this key concepts but
we want to make sure that if, even if you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.830
are new to iGoogle or Gadgets or you are a
total stranger to OpenSocial you can still

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.990
follow us in this session. And after that
I will talk about the gadget dashboard which

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.360
we also call iGoogle Developer Portal. And
next Albert will talk about OSDE which is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.350
the new development tool for writing and developing
gadgets. Okay, let's start it with iGoogle.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.530
So, what is iGoogle and what can you do with
it? The URL is google.com/ig. So basically,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.890
iGoogle is a personalized homepage where you
can customize to satisfy your information

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.730
needs. You can customize the information.
You can customize the tools you need as gadgets

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.030
on your page. And of course, you can also
do Google search on the page. You can also

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.390
interact with your friends. The Google Talk
is fully integrated with iGoogle's page. So,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.550
iGoogle is basically, as homepage, an entry
point for all your Google service. And from--here's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.980
a screen shot of the iGoogle. As you can see
from the screen shot at the top there's a

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.400
search box where you can do Google search
as usual and the rest of the page is basically

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.450
composed of several gadgets where you can
get weather information, where you can watch

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.370
YouTube videos, where you can post notes,
you can read news or even you can play games

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.940
on this page. And from a different perspective,
iGoogle for developer is a distribution channel

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.520
for your content, for your app, for your games,
et cetera. You can write your own gadgets

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.590
and your own applications and put these gadgets
and applications on iGoogle directory and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.340
for millions of active users to use. So for
now we have hundreds of thousands of gadgets

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.220
and the list in our iGoogle directory. And
most importantly you can monetize these gadgets

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.290
by putting apps behind them. Okay, thanks.
We will talk about gadgets as you've just

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.000
seen from the screenshot. The gadget is just
a bunch of HTML JavaScript application that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.310
can be embedded in webpages and other applications.
So we will still talk about gadgets from two

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.470
different perspectives. As a user, gadgets
are no more than application by Google users

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.439
like you, Google developers like you that
offer over cool and dynamic content that can

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:30.159
be placed on any page on the web. So the gadgets
are not only limited to iGoogle. As long as

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.889
the gadgets are written by standard it can
be run on any website and can be embedded

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:43.110
into any webpage you like. Okay, again here's
a screenshot again. In the middle of the page

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.330
this is what we call a YouTube gadget. We
can watch the video inside that gadget. It's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.879
very simple. And as a developers gadgets are
great channels to reach more people with your

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:01.539
content. It's really simple to build, all
you need is an XML file and we will parse

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.360
that XML file into a bunch of HTML and JavaScript
codes that we can put on to your page or you

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:14.559
can put on your iGoogle homepage. And as I
said, it can run on multiple sites and it

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:22.590
reaches millions of users worldwide. So next,
we talk about OpenSocial. So far we have been

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.240
talking about the gadgets that gather weather
information or that you read the news or that

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.610
you post notes on your personal homepage.
OpenSocial is a standard that Google proposed

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.600
to support social features that will allow
you to interact with your friends. So basically

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.240
it's a--as a user it's nothing more than a
technology that enables you to interact with

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.900
your friends through those gadgets. And as
a developer, OpenSocial is basically a set

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.819
of APIs that make your gadget social. We want
to make OpenSocial in such a way that once

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.860
you develop your gadget in OpenSocial it can
be run on any other website that supported

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.949
OpenSocial. So OpenSocial is now supported
by many well-known websites such as iGoogle.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:19.029
iGoogle itself is an OpenSocial container
that can host any kind of OpenSocial gadget.

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:26.379
We also have Mixi, which is the biggest social
network site in Japan. And we also have LinkedIn,

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:34.979
MySpace, Ning, Hi5, these websites, they all
support OpenSocial. So once you write a gadget

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:41.139
that is consistent with OpenSocial standard,
you can run your gadget on this website without

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:50.169
changing any code. Okay. So OpenSocial basically
is a set of standard and specifications so

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.909
it doesn't come with any implementations.
So if you want to create an OpenSocial website

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:02.030
and run OpenSocial gadget, the first thing
you have to do is to create an OpenSocial

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:11.759
container and put it on your website. Now,
we have an open source project that is a reference

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:19.270
implementations of the OpenSocial API applications
which is call Shindig, and it's hosted on

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:25.699
Apache. It supports the following social features
like profiles, relationship, activities, all

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:31.309
you can imagine about interactions with your
friends. We won't go into details of Shindig

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:36.539
today but we strongly suggest that you take
a look at this project if you are about to

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:44.690
start your own OpenSocial website. Okay. So
now you know what iGoogle is and you know

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.939
how to write a gadget and you know how put
OpenSocial into your gadget to let your gadget

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:55.649
users interact with their friends and indeed
you have already written several decent gadget

00:07:55.649 --> 00:08:01.399
and put it on iGoogle directory. So what's
next? The next thing you would want to know

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:07.649
would be, so how is my gadget being used?
What other page we use? What are the numbers

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:12.749
of user I have? And what are the comments?
What are the feedbacks? What are the ratings

00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:21.569
my gadgets have? It's very hard to collect
all these information altogether, so here's

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:27.099
our Gadget Dashboard. The internet makes this
information available, while in Google we

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:32.250
make this information accessible. So we create
a gadget dashboard to connect all your gadget

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:41.060
data and how it is used by your users. So
here is the link to the Gadget Dashboard,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.029
it's code.google.com/igoogle. I'll give you
a quick demo after this. So what is a Gadget

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:54.010
Dashboard? The Gadget Dashboard was launched
last year on November and it is live now.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.319
The goal of this project is that we would
like to provide you an entry point for managing

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:05.500
your gadget you developed and also we will
try to aggregate it, organize the gadget usage

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.520
information in one place for you to better
understand how your gadget is being used.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.569
So at the bottom is a screenshot of the Gadget
Dashboard. As you can see from the screenshot

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:23.519
there's a gadget listing here and it contains
the stats of a gadget. We'll come back to

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:33.190
the Gadget Dashboard in the demo later. So,
in summary with Gadget Dashboard, you can–-it

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.899
is an entry point for managing your gadget.
You can like submit or remove your gadget

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:45.220
to iGoogle Directory or from the Google Directory
with this dashboard. And also you can view

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.269
the usage data of your gadgets such as page
views, unique users, comments, feedbacks or

00:09:50.269 --> 00:10:06.550
ratings. Okay, so let me give you

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:12.410
a quick demo. Again, the URL is code.google.com/igoogle.
Once you get on to this page you'll see a

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:21.190
link here to go to the Gadget Dashboard. Let's
take a look. So first it will ask you to log

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:35.960
in with your Google account. So, okay, after
doing them, if this is the first time you're

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:43.920
using Gadget Dashboard, you'll be asked to
accept the terms of the service here and if

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.629
you're already have several gadget associated
with your account, we will try to pull out

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:56.120
your URL gadget usage data and populate them
in this page. So now, with this account, since

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:14.990
I don't have any gadget associated with this
account. I have to put my gadget URL here,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:39.240
like this. So here, I will use the gadget.
I would use the currency converter gadget

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:46.319
to do the demo. Since this gadget is not owned
by me, the Gadget Dashboard will check if

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:52.589
I'm the author of this gadget. If I'm not,
it will send a verification email to the gadget

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:59.850
owner and tell the gadget owner that somebody
else is adding your gadget to his dashboard

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:07.889
and he want to see your gadget usage data.
The Gadget Dashboard first asks me if I will

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:13.430
really add, I would really want to add this
gadget into my dashboard. I'll hit that, okay.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:45.680
So here, the email is now send to the gadget
owner. So I switch here. Okay, now I come

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.830
to back to the dashboard and I can see that
access is granted. So I can see the gadget

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:58.589
usage data here and here is our currency converter.
And as you can see here, we have several columns

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:04.500
collecting your gadgets usage data such as
page views, number of unique users, and comments

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:10.440
worldwide and also the status of this gadget.
If you want to add more gadgets into your

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:17.649
dashboard it's very easy to do this, and you
simply hit the, add gadget to dashboard button

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:24.220
and follow the previous steps. So here, let's
take a closer look at, what do we have here.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:32.670
So if click in, we have a details page for
each task, such as the graph here that's showing

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.851
the history of the traffic here, if you are
Google Analytics user you are probably are

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:44.759
comfortable with this table. And we also have
a heatmap, for your gadgets around the world.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:53.120
And we also have the country breakdowns here,
something like this. Also, we also collect

00:13:53.120 --> 00:14:03.389
all comments from different countries here,
like this. Here you see comments in different

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:11.129
languages since you might not speak other
languages except English, we also integrate

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:17.019
this service with Google Translate like I
have to translate comments into English like

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:23.230
this. Here the comments is immediately translated
into English so that you can understand what

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:33.499
it is about. And last, we have status information
here in the last column in here. It says--oh,

00:14:33.499 --> 00:14:40.020
the gadget is already in directory and it
was submitted on July 17, 2008. And we also

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:46.310
give you the option to view this gadget into
directory. So if the gadget is not in the

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:51.730
directory, we would also show the status here.
I'm now submitting it to that directory and

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:58.490
we will give you a button here to let you
submit this gadget to the directory. So, that's

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:11.240
basically the Gadget Dashboard. Let's go back
to the slide. Okay, so having talk about this.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.899
Gadget Dashboard is still dynamic project.
It's still in a very early stage of its development

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:23.450
so we'll be rolling out more and more new
features and adding more metrics into the

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:30.870
dashboard. Soon we'll be rolling out in nationalizing
and localization of the Gadget Dashboard into

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:37.189
different countries and different languages.
And last but not the least, we, in the future,

00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:44.769
we will try to analyze your gadget to see
its performance and to do the quality checking,

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:52.499
and that we will actively give you quality
suggestions about your gadgets. So that's

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:58.509
all I have for Gadget Dashboard. Next, Albert
will talk about OpenSocial development environment

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:00.799
which is a very powerful tool for writing
gadgets.

00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:15.509
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Many thanks to Sega for his demo
and the ensured action to iGoogle and gadgets.

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:22.860
I'm Albert Cheng, a Software Engineer from
Google Taipei office. And at this moment,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:31.790
you may want to say, "Hey, Albert stop introduction,
let's see some code." Okay, here we are. This

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:41.249
is a Hello World gadget. It's basically a
HTML file that's comprised with OpenSocial

00:16:41.249 --> 00:16:49.509
spec. So you can see the, in the code, that
first line is the correlation of XML and then

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:58.339
the second line module and the module prefs
content, all these are defined in OpenSocial.

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:06.670
And you could put your real gadget content
in HTML in the main body here. Also, you could

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:14.470
also embed your Javascript file here. So this
is a very simple gadget. So, how can you edit

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:21.940
a gadget? Of course, you could always use
any text editor to do that. There are some

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:31.920
other options. iGoogle provides two convenient
online tools. Let's have a look at them. The

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:41.330
first one is called a Google Gadget Editor;
the second one, Gadget Checker. Let me switch

00:17:41.330 --> 00:18:00.470
to broader, to quickly demo it all out to
you. Okay, this one, this one's a gadget--Google

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:08.820
Gadget Editor, it helps you to edit a simple
gadget online and it provide some basic features

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:18.950
for you. And then this one, Gadget Checker,
it helps you to verify the basic requirements

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:28.150
of your gadget. So these two tools are convenient
online tools for you but they are good for

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:38.080
simple gadgets. How about if you have a complex
gadget, how can you edit that? So here's the

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:47.830
tool, OSDE. That's a powerful Eclipse plugin
that can help you to edit an OpenSocial gadget.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:54.010
As most of you already know that Eclipse is
one of the most powerful editor in the world

00:18:54.010 --> 00:19:01.810
that can edit like a Java files, XML files,
and the Javascript files, et cetera. So with

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:11.540
that, in addition OSDE provides some Wizards
and tools to help you to edit OpenSocial code.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:19.280
And once you are ready with your code, you
may want to test your gadget. This is always

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:27.280
a difficult part for most developers. OSDE
will help you to easily test your gadget.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.880
It provides two ways to test your gadget.
The first one is you could test it locally

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.550
as an OpenSocial container which is called
Shindig. The other option is you have--it

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:52.300
helps you to test it against a production
online container. Right now, OSDE only supports

00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:01.090
iGoogle at this moment. We are planning to
support more containers in the future. And

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:07.580
also when you test your gadget online, you
will need to host your--all of your gadget

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:15.320
files somewhere in the Internet. This tool
will help you to easily complete its goal

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:23.280
to host all of your files. Okay, that's a
quick introduction of OSDE. Let's see some

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:32.650
of the background. It's an OSDE, it's an open
source project hosted at code.google.com.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:42.240
Its license is Apache 2, so that means everybody
could contribute and use it. We recently launched

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:51.490
the version 0.9 this month. And--next, the
contributors--the core contributors, I have

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:58.830
to introduce them. The first one is Yoichiro
Tanaka. He is actually the founder of this

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:07.060
project. He works at Mixi from Japan as a
tech lead. So, Yoichiro could you just wave

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:15.180
your hand? Okay, thanks. And Albert Cheng,
that's me. And we have some other contributors

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:27.600
Do'phin, Sega, and Ching-Yi Chan and et cetera.
Okay, now let's look at some of the demo to

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:41.460
let you know the power of OSDE. Let's switch
to, okay, here. Let me start my Eclipse. Just

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:52.500
wait for a few seconds. Okay, let me say,
type something here to make sure the environment

00:21:52.500 --> 00:22:02.650
is okay, because we had some difficulties
at the start of this session. Okay, it looks

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:14.080
fine, WAN IP is adjusted. Start the local
Apache Shindig. That's in OpenSocial container.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:22.340
Okay, first of all, let's demo a quick Hello
World Gadget from scratch. So, let's start

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:36.600
a new project. Click on OpenSocial. Click
on, next. And create a project name, say Google

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:45.890
io1. Click on, next. And then provide some
basic information here, like the gadget name,

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:53.610
the title, your email address, and then the
feature. We'll just take the default menus

00:22:53.610 --> 00:23:03.710
here, and then click on next. There are some
views, like an OpenSocial defines, like canvass

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:10.240
view. Canvass view means the bigger view of
a gadget and the home view means the small

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.831
view of the gadget. So, here I'm going to
just use the canvass view for demo and then

00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:28.510
choose HTML type. Click on finish. Okay, and
then this tool will quickly help you to create

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:36.200
an OpenSocial project. Let me see what we
have here. We have a gadget file. With this

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:43.950
Wizard, the OSDE tool, you could edit the
basic information, like attributes, features,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:54.610
and et cetera. You could edit the contents.
Like you could edit the canvass content or

00:23:54.610 --> 00:24:01.830
add some more new content here. Look here
for your internationalization. You can add

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:14.020
a new language to your gadget here, user preference
and of course most of you may want to just

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.480
edit the source code directory. You could
always scroll out here, source file. Okay,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:29.420
once you're ready with your code. You want
to test it. You could test it locally. I'm

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:37.610
going to show you first how to test locally;
just one application locally and just accept

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:49.330
the default values. Okay. It will open a browser
and that's the--what you see for this gadget.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:56.330
So, that's quite easy for you to quickly to
repair a gadget. And then the second way to

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:02.910
test it, it's a--you could test it online
against a production container. So, right

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:12.710
now we support iGoogle. Just click on iGoogle
to review gadget. For testing that, of course

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:23.280
you need a Google account. Let me type the
project name. I'm typing my Google account.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:38.210
Just click on, OK. There are some notes here.
When you test it online the updates of your

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:46.540
Gadget files may not be reflected instantly.
You may need to wait for few hours but here

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:59.820
it should be okay. Let us try that. And also
wait for a few seconds. Okay, so you can see,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:08.600
this is the gadget that you will see on the
real iGoogle server. Okay, so that's a simple

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:20.590
gadget. I'm going to demo a more complex gadget
for you. So let's clean out everything here.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:30.480
Let's have another project. Okay, do the same
thing. Click on OpenSocial project. Click

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:43.460
on, next. Give it another project name, Google
io2. Click on next. Okay, yeah, we'll just

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:52.860
accept the same thing here. Click on, next.
At the last step, I'm going to show you a--listen

00:26:52.860 --> 00:27:00.900
we, we're going to help you to like create
external Java file automatically for you.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:08.360
So, you don't need--if you don't want to embed
your Javascript file in the gadget XML file.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:15.320
You could always have an external Javascript
file. So this could help you to do that and

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:25.570
also it will help you to generate some simple
code like this one. I choose to generate a

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:33.270
code for fetching the list of your friends.
Okay, I'm going to do the same thing for the

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:50.250
home view. Okay, here. Okay, it's done. Yeah,
okay let's see what we have right now. We

00:27:50.250 --> 00:28:00.180
have two Javascript files, canvassed top JS
and the home top JS, these are automatically

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:08.880
generated for you. And when you run your gadget,
all the Javascript files here will be automatically

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:18.390
called. Okay, lets go back to look at the
gadget file, the source code. So you could

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:26.530
see there's a one function called the Fetch
People it's automatically could edit for you.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:38.540
Okay, now let's assume you're ready with this
complex schedule. You want to test it. For

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:44.600
testing the scheduler is a tricky part. You
need to have a, you need to have some friends

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:52.440
for your account to test it. So this tool
will help you to do that. If you--we go down

00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:01.700
here, there's a tab called, The People. It
shows that there are four data in a local

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:07.090
Shindig database. These are automatically
created for you so that you could test them

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:17.080
with this mock data. Usually when you start
using OSDE, you could click on here, OSDE,

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:24.790
and then choose, Create Simple Data in Shindig.
It will automatically create this mock data

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:32.430
for you. And the--let's locate some more data
here. If you click on anyone of them, it could

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:41.030
edit the basic information for each person,
like basic information, or you could even

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:50.340
edit the relationship here. So for this person
can write though, he had his three friends

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:59.810
John, Jane and George. So these are all mock
data in your local database. Besides that,

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:07.111
you could also have some activities of the
data. Applications I can say that because

00:30:07.111 --> 00:30:12.150
we are running out of time I'm going to skip
some of the demo here, I will just quickly

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:21.600
show you how this schedule looks like when
you run the, run the local Shindig container.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:35.120
So lets just run it. Click on OSDE, choose
wrong application locally and you could choose

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:42.281
which view you want to test and which owner
you are right now. Assume we are currently

00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:52.400
with in the viewer language country and there
are some other applications like the second

00:30:52.400 --> 00:31:00.500
ones. If you click on this pattern it will
have you to measure that gauge of performance

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:10.690
for you. So that's quite pretty good. It helps
you to detect some parts in your code it will

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:18.020
tell you which part you could improve to have
better performance. I'm going to skip this

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:27.870
part. I will just quickly locate the basic
features here. Click on, OK. So this is how

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:36.580
the gadget looks like against your local Shindig.
If you click on this button it will go fetch

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:45.480
to your local database and list all of your
friends here. So that's it. And finally, I'm

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:57.350
going to demo against the iGoogle with this
compact gadget. Usually when you want to test

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:04.870
a gadget online against the production server
you need to first host your gadget file online.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:15.200
So this one, this function will easily help
you to do a lot of host gadget on iGoogle.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:23.390
Okay, project name, google io2 we just log-in.
So I'm going to use the previous Google account

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:36.610
session. Click on, OK. This tool will silently
and automatically host all of your gadget

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:44.590
files. Actually, three of them host all of
it, the files online somewhere on iGoogle

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:56.570
server. Okay, it's done and the next step,
the next one is you could edit schedule to

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:05.470
your iGoogle homepage. I assume everybody
here has an iGoogle homepage. So quite easy

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:14.011
just make sure it's the URL you want and then
click on, OK. You do everything that they

00:33:14.011 --> 00:33:22.870
can and you will see this page, just click
on, edit now. This page which you just created

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:32.980
will be edit to your iGoogle page. So, and
of course, you could go back to your iGoogle

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:40.690
home to see how the schedule looks like in
a real iGoogle page. But you could always

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:46.630
test the--you may want to just test the schedule.
You don't want to see all the other gauges

00:33:46.630 --> 00:34:04.960
of your account. So that's another option
here. Okay, let's--okay, let me go back here.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:14.679
You could always come back here. This is how
the schedule looks like in your iGoogle homepage.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:24.610
If you click on this button it'll fetch the
real friends of your Google account. So this

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:32.280
one's you, the other four are your friends.
Okay, once you are ready with your gadget,

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.790
you may want to share your gadget with all
the people in the world. So the other one

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:48.240
easy feature for you, you could click on publish
schedule. Make sure this is, it's the URL

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:58.390
which you just created. Click on, OK. Then
after you click on the beneath button then

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:04.270
it's done. Your gadget will be shared by all
the people in the world. So it's quite easy.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:12.410
I think the most difficult part is you need
to read through the license agreement here.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:19.880
Yeah that's the--it has the most of the time
anyway. So let's click on somewhere beneath

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:31.030
here. Okay, congratulations your gadget has
been successively submitted and then you could

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:37.190
follow the instructions here to tell your
friends, share your gadget with all the people

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:46.990
in the world. And the--oh, I have a few minutes
so, actually a lot of powerful features in

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:56.820
this tool. With limited time, I can only show
some of them. Like the delete gadget, you

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:03.630
could always manage other files which you
could edit online and then host it on iGoogle.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:12.060
So like this one. If you don't want your gadget
you could just delete them from iGoogle. Okay.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:22.330
So that's it. So, yeah that's all about--yeah,
that's all about my demo. I'm going to hand

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:29.970
it over back to Sega because we are close
to lunch time. So I need to skip some of the

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:39.170
demo. If you are interested, you are welcome
to ask me questions later or talk to me later

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:46.830
offline. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Okay, so here are some OSDE references.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:52.290
You might be interested in taking a look at.
We have OSDE homepage. We have our user guide.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:37:00.160
We also have a roadmap for OSDE on the website.
So please take a look at it. Okay, so in the

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.120
past, writing a gadget might be a really painful
process for many of you. You have to set up

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.640
your own testing environment. You have to
pick your own editor for writing the gadget

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:19.830
and once you manage to complete your gadget,
it's even harder to manage it. So today we

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:29.280
develop a very powerful development tool for
you to use to write your gadgets. And we also

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.600
give you a gadget dashboard that put together
all your gadget users data so you can get

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:40.010
a big picture of how people use your gadget.
So again, the gadget dashboard, the link is

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:48.720
code.google.com/igoogle and next OSDE, we
strongly encourage you to take a look, give

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:56.700
it a try and tell us what do you think. So
that's all we have for today. Thanks for your

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:05.960
attention. Okay, so next, we will take questions
from the audience and both from the web. So,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:20.400
if you have any question please step up to
the mic.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:27.250
&gt;&gt; Is there any way, you know, your program,
you know, can detect the list (ph) or weight

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:37.790
because this depends on users screen size.
And we can refresh, you know, the gadget in

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:45.090
case I have some, you know, picture or whatever,
I need to re-adjust. You can tell the only

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:55.290
way you define the list (ph) is the percentage.
However is there any way, you know, you can

00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:06.580
know the list (ph)? The users weight, you
know, to gauge the list (ph) when you turn

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:15.790
on the iGoogle. Then I can re-adjust, you
know, my weight with this gadget.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.470
&gt;&gt; CHENG: You mean in OSDE or generally in
iGoogle?

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.930
&gt;&gt; Generally, yeah, on the program itself.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: iGoogle has a support, some basic

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:27.060
features for detecting the screen size of
your gadget, is that what you want?

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:34.470
&gt;&gt; No, I mean. I need to know when the user
is using your gadget and because they have

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.470
different size or a screen.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Yes.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.470
&gt;&gt; So is there anyway I can tell the users
screen size and I mean, before from whatever,

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:37.470
and then I can refresh my gadget. Because
it depends on I have some table display on

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.470
the gadget and the user for example, if your
nearest small screen like a netbooks size.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.450
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Yes.
&gt;&gt; And I need to do re-adjust my table and

00:39:42.450 --> 00:40:06.779
make it this square. I don't want to scroll
the up and down and you know, left and right.

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:17.800
You know what I mean?
&gt;&gt; CHENG: I see. So the question is, is there

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:29.620
a way an iGoogle could automatically detect
the clients screen size and then generate

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.350
a gadget according to the size?
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:40.619
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Okay. Yes, we do have some features
to do that. But it might not be powerful enough,

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:48.240
but for example it could detect where you
have some JavaScript and the current size

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:55.830
could detect the client window size and then
it will send back the information. Once we

00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:04.790
have a lot we might be able to adjust that.
For example, adjust the number of columns

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.260
in the window like by default we have a three
columns...

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: ...to put all of your gadgets. If

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:16.690
your screen is small you might have to adjust--change
it to like two columns. But it's a feature

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:24.310
I'm not sure, unless you're in experiment
right now, so you might not be notice of a

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.510
lot because maybe it's still in experiment.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.980
&gt;&gt; CHENG: So, we do have some basic features
like this.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:35.660
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Okay, I hope that answer your question.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:42.540
Thanks.
&gt;&gt; I just have a question about monetization.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:48.530
In your existing terms right now, if I understand
it correctly, it's quite restrictive about

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:54.370
actually selling a gadget. I'm just wondering
what your thoughts are on that.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:59.061
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Can you say that again?
&gt;&gt; In terms of monetization...

00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:03.800
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; In your terms right now, it's quite restrictive

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:11.740
about the ability to sell a gadget. You can
sell a feed that comes through it, things

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.570
like that, if I'm understanding it correctly.
I'm just wondering what the...

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:22.390
&gt;&gt; CHENG: What the monetization is? Or how...
&gt;&gt; What's Googles' stance on actually providing

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:30.319
a marketplace so you can sell...
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Sell a gadget?

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:33.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So you can earn some money
to keep building gadgets.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:39.500
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Uh-huh. Oh, I see. So, well basically
the business model of Google is to put ads

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:46.560
beside your gadget. So basically we don't
have that mechanism for you to like auction

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:53.490
your gadget or sell your gadget on the marketplace.
&gt;&gt; It's not so much having--providing a mechanism,

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:58.580
but your terms are actually restricted. You
don't allow it.

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:03.080
&gt;&gt; CHENG: I don't think so.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.820
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; We can take this off, I'll show you the

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:15.350
line. The second thing is, and I noticed this
a lot on comments on gadgets, reliability

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:22.940
seems to be a real problem. Things are up
and down quite a bit. I'm just wondering what

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:34.670
your take is

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:40.150
on that.
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Maybe we can talk about that offline.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.370
Okay?
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:55.480
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; I'll see you in a few minutes. Thanks.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.359
&gt;&gt; CHENG: Okay, no more question? Okay, thank
you.
