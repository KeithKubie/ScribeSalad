1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.550
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah,
he's going to smell in the blood.
Yeah,
he's good.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.160
He knows a lot of people.
I know.
That's one thing I'm not good at.
I have,

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.961
I'm working on that.

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.330
Mark was telling me other day like I want to start finish people with the hands.

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.830
Like you had so many fights where you couldn't,

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.190
but you hit a guy with a condom on and you've take a shot like the guy be right.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.130
You just don't see it.
Instead of key punching them,
you as shoot,

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.660
he stopped punching your chute on him.

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.720
It's was like I hate guys are combos and like when I go to the boss and you're

10
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:25.530
like Bro,

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.080
you box like you a boxer but you go into your fight and you box just to get your

12
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.300
take downs.
But that's because I'm a wrestler.
I can box.

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.950
I don't have to but I will.

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
Do you think there's a worry though when you're trying to finish fights versus

15
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.800
just trying to fight your best?

16
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.610
I think guys should just fight the best and if a finished comes at comps,

17
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
I'm of the opinion that I'm of the opinion that when people make big mistakes,

18
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:54.600
and I wouldn't discourage anybody from going crazy if someone likes to go crazy,

19
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.630
they like to fight wild.
Hey man,
that's you.
That's your style.

20
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.400
That's how you express yourself.
Nothing wrong with that.

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.250
But if I was going to give some advice,
they said,
what should I do?

22
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.000
I want to have a long career as a professional.
Let's say fight your best.

23
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.610
Don't worry about the outcome,
just fight your best.

24
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.980
And if you fight your best and if you connected,

25
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:14.490
someone gets hurt and you put them away,
that's great.
But if you just win,

26
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
that's great to just fight your best.
The more,

27
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.610
the more you can do what you can technically and take as little damage as

28
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.500
possible.
That's a good fight.

29
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.530
<v 1>And this,
like I said,
that's almost the OSP fight.</v>

30
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.130
Mark said it like you just gotta smothers,
got whole camp,

31
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.370
he's got that good kit and they had the Osp fi and GM volante the two fights and

32
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:41.060
mark called only thing that I can get knocked out way.
He said,
well Gee,

33
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.010
I'm blind to the only thing this guy can knock you out with his overhand right.

34
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.610
He says you got to bring that Jab right back after you've got a good job of

35
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:49.890
bringing your hands back.
Cause he's times that overhand.
Right?

36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.070
So smooth and even in between rounds like you eat over here,
right?

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.160
I know it's not hurting you but only takes one.
It takes one.
Keep that hand up,

38
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:58.950
keep that hand up.
And sure enough to this day he say,

39
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.390
remember I told you over here.
Right?

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.270
And then with Osp is like only thing I can get you it is that,

41
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:06.630
hey that left kick.
If you stay close to them,
keep the pressure,

42
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:09.450
keep them on occasion when he's down he stand up,
bring them back down.

43
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.260
Don't listen to the fans.
People are going to boot it.
Get,

44
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.740
get to your head and make you want to strike.
Trying to get in that fight.

45
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.230
That's what they want to see.
But we just try and get the win.

46
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.180
Don't go right and keep pressure.
Do not go right and keep pressure.

47
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.080
Have you watched that fight?
The whole two rounds.
Pressure and not going right.

48
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.170
Going left,
put into the case,
taken back,
keep them down in the case.
He stand up,

49
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.660
bring them back.
Third around.
I took him down,

50
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.450
he popped out when I was against the case.
I can remember hearing people say,
Oh,

51
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.360
let's tear it up and fight and stand up and fight.

52
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:36.720
And I backed away for a second,

53
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.880
started moving like God almost play from the outside a little bit.

54
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.070
And I went right right into the head kick and I was like,
you know when I came,

55
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:47.010
first thing mark sat in the back,
I wrote,
you look phenomenal.

56
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.610
You just went right.
Like you look great.
You just went right.

57
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.620
Everything was beautiful.
That fight,
that was your breakthrough fight.
He you,

58
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.760
you just went right.
But we're going to go back.
You're going to do better.

59
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.480
I know you will.
And now it's just like after that,
like I said,
I went to drama.

60
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.260
It was like fuck what the fancy,
we went into France.

61
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.240
But like you said when you and Sean like I listened to before and you say I

62
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:07.951
believe the chief you,

63
00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:11.080
I beat this but you don't hear my name is because I'm not trying to do this

64
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.550
stuff that's exciting anymore.
I'm just winning and my style and excited.

65
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.570
But that's cause you're not a mixed martial arts fan.

66
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.540
You're a fan of a knockout or you're a fan of some fancy stuff.

67
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.110
They talking in Johnny Walker up.

68
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.740
This is Ms. Johnny Walker hasn't shown mixed martial.
Oh Shit.

69
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:27.580
He's shown fancy stuff that knock people out.
It looks great.
Yes.

70
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.710
But just like Anthony Smith and all those guys,

71
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.830
when they get in front of somebody like John Jones and you can't hit them with

72
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.850
that one punch,
what are you going to do?
You know what I mean?

73
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.120
So that's thing I say right now I'm not fighting.
He said,

74
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.010
when are you going to fight?
I don't know,

75
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.900
but I'll be ready cause I can do everything.

76
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.440
<v 0>Yeah.
We were just talking about Johnnie Walker.</v>

77
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:49.100
He's in surgery now who he had to go through surgery for shoulder cause that,

78
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.800
that celebration,
that celebration was just so crazy.

79
00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:55.490
He wins Eba beets or corn off with a beautiful time knee.

80
00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.620
Perfect flying knee looks fantastic and then drops to the ground just playing

81
00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.950
around and blows his fucking shoulder out.
It was crazy.

82
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.960
<v 1>Yes,
the gang or anything can happen.
You never knew his hand injury.</v>

83
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.050
<v 0>What happens like that?
It's like God damn man,
you're so promising.
Um,
he's a,</v>

84
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.040
he's a mean.
What,
what gets people excited when people finish fights,
right?

85
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.810
But People Kao People.

86
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.380
And so a lot of times people try to lean towards that.

87
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:24.900
But if that's not your style,
you know,
you should,

88
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.110
you should fight the way your f if I was in your corner,
first of all,

89
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:31.660
I'd say listen to Mark Henry,
Mark Henry knows everything.
And then second of all,

90
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:35.400
let's say don't change Shit,
man.
What you're doing is perfect.
Just just fight.

91
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:39.300
The way you're fighting,
the way you're fighting is just you winning.
You know,

92
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.163
you when you're,
you're,

93
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.680
I just think that it should be what it should be emphasized always to fight the

94
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:48.571
best.

95
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:53.040
You can fight intelligently and you got to decide and everybody has to decide

96
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.130
when is it time to take a risk?
When is it time to close the distance?

97
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.970
When is it time to put pressure on someone and and throw yourself into the fire

98
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:03.180
to try to get a finish.
And if you just think you should just fight technically.

99
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.780
Look man,
fucking Floyd Mayweather has done that most of his career,

100
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.170
especially like later on when he was pretty boy Floyd.
Early on in his career,

101
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:11.520
he's tried to knock a lot of guys out,

102
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.090
but later on in his career and most of his big fights,

103
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.660
like with Pacquiao and a lot of the guys,
he does wins.

104
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.750
He just wins and he makes more money than anybody.
Just wins

105
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.280
<v 1>interests me and my mind.
I know exactly.
I'll tell you when I get in this barn,</v>

106
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.770
no spoilers might want to work on things.
You know,
every,

107
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.810
every side they going to spot me and my wife's Josh,

108
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:32.680
like what are we working on today?

109
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.740
We're going to try to work on putting a little more emphasis on the punches and

110
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.950
not shoot right away,
a blah,
blah,
blah on the ground.
More ground and pound.

111
00:05:38.951 --> 00:05:41.080
Don't worry about that.
UGC submissions just hit this,
this and this.

112
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.370
When it's come time to fight,

113
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.670
when the lights come on Saturday night and Joe or Bruce buffer in there and you

114
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.490
sit at the side,
it's a whole different game plan.
I know what I can do.

115
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.830
I know what's right and that's why I get into those spots and like I tell my

116
00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.160
stuff,
take a shot.
It's muscle memory,
but I hit him.

117
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.320
He put his hands up and he stopped the legs wide open court.
Oh,
the NCAA.

118
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:01.280
All American NCAA finalist.
Why we're not shooting.
I take them down.

119
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.710
Exactly and have you look at my last three fights.

120
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.160
I feel like going back and watching them,
those,

121
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.490
you can't say I'm one side because Ilir everybody will know where he can wrestle

122
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.640
at lear.
Lear is way more powerful and better wrestler he works for,
for uh,

123
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.310
whatever where he's from Albanian world team.

124
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.110
He couldn't take me down and I was struck him,
you know,
you went to glow.

125
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:21.950
Like I'll go over the finish and introduce who got cord goes to ground him.

126
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.920
It's over and you can not Cory out.
I was struggling.

127
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.660
I'll rested up and got them in out and had him Saiga.
I had him,
he had his back.

128
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:32.390
I had every position on him.
So you can't say I don't have Jujitsu,

129
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.330
I don't have Russ and I don't have striking cause near and impact comes.

130
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.250
Everybody thought he was the NCAA.
Do you want all American?
This is,

131
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.770
he beat DC at OTC.
Hit begs on gonna kill quarter in wrestling.
Stop.

132
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.100
Just take down and set the record with 13 take downs on him who had the record

133
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.240
at 11 it's like,
I don't understand the fans.
Everybody got something to say.
