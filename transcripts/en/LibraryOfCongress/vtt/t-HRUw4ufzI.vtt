&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Hello my
name is Nancy Groce I am one

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.410
of the senior Folklife
specials here

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.350
at the American FolkLife Center
and I'd like to welcome you

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.650
to the latest presentation

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.200
of our ongoing Benjamin
Botkin lecture series.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770
The Botkin series allows
us to highlight the work

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.100
of leading scholars in the
disciplines of folklore,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.040
ethnic musicology, oral
history and cultural heritage,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.610
while enhancing the
collections here

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.940
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.270
The center, and for the
center, and for the library,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.590
the Botkin lectures
form an important facet

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.720
of our acquisitions activity.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.020
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.770
of the permanent collection
here at the center.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.480
In addition, the lectures
are later posted as webcast

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.560
at the library's website
where they will be available

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.600
for viewing to Internet patrons
[phonetic] throughout the world.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
So, if you haven't already done

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.990
so now would be an excellent
time to turn off cell phones

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.860
and anything else that
might beep and make noise.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.430
So, today, I have the honor

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.330
of introducing the respected
folklorist researcher,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.450
ethnomusicologist and
author, Jean Freedman.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.920
Dr. Freedman received her PHD
in folklore and ethnomusicology

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.850
from Indiana University in 1995
and her first book "Whistling

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.410
in the Dark, Memory and
Culture in Wartime London",

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.680
[inaudible] popular culture
and political ideology

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.450
in London during World War II".

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.130
She's published on a
wide variety of topics,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.740
including Scottish ballads,
Jewish folk theater,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.510
an unconventional
Civil War soldiers.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.250
Her writings have appeared

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.770
in numerous prestigious
publications including The New

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.750
York Times, The Washington Post,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.930
The Journal of American
Folklore,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.090
and Fast Folk Magazine.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.740
She lives in Washington
DC area and she teaches

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.350
at Montgomery College and also
at George Washington University,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.070
where I understand you'll
be teaching the course

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.290
on "Fairy Tales"
starting next week.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.870
&gt;&gt; Jean R. Freedman: I
actually already started.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.250
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Already started?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.450
OK, today she will be speaking
about her recent University

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.020
of Illinois publication,
"Peggy Seeger,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.780
a Life of Music,
Love and Politics".

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.410
Jean first met Peggy in 1979
during a junior year abroad

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.090
in London and she
frequented the Singers Club,

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.200
a legendary folk club run
by Peggy and her partner

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140
and husband Ewan MacColl.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.510
Although much has been
written about other members

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.410
of the Seeger family, several
years ago, Jean realized

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.470
that Peggy's involvements in
and contributions to the world

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.950
of folk music, in the folk
music revival had been

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.570
under documented.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.290
So, her highly readable new
biography should address this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.310
oversight, in some very good
read, Jean was in close touch

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.310
with Peggy when researching
and writing this book,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.860
and she also may
considerable use

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.300
of the significant collections
on the Seeger family material.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.130
We are proud here to have
her here at the library,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.880
both in the American
Folklife Center

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.630
and in the music division,
and we are always delighted

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.540
to feature Botkin
much you have made use

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.220
of library resources
and archives.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240
Anyhow, I'll let her tell
you more about Peggy Seeger.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.170
Let me just close by reminding
you that we do have copies

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.880
of Jean's book for sale in the
four yard, and she will be happy

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.350
to sign them immediately
after her talk.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.510
So, what please join me in
making welcome Jean Freedman.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.670
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.590
&gt;&gt; Jean R. Freedman:
Thank you Nancy and thanks

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.430
to everyone here at
the Library of Congress

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.770
for making this possible and
thanks to all of you for coming.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.070
Can you hear me?

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.370
OK. All right.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.340
Well, I'm going to start off
by building on what Nancy said

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.030
about how I first met Peggy

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.940
because that is usually
the first question,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.300
I'm asked when people hear

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.270
that I've written a
biography of Peggy Seeger.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.330
So, I'm just going to read a
little bit from the preface.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.890
I first met Peggy Seeger

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.720
on an autumn evening
in London in 1979.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.940
The setting was the Singers
Club, a folk club that Peggy

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.800
and her husband, Ewan McColl
had begun in the early 1960s.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.160
I was in London,
studying theater

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.220
through the most
American of adventures:

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.530
the junior year abroad.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.920
Having grown up in a much
smaller city, I was entranced

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.910
by the cultural offerings
it only a major metropolis

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.280
can afford.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.490
But on that October evening,
I was still a newcomer

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.990
and a stranger, a long
way from home and amused

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.940
by cultural differences
I had never anticipated.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.060
I didn't know my shoe size

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.280
or the proper way
to buy vegetables.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.350
The cars were unfamiliar and
they drove on the wrong side

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.210
of the street and I needed a new
vocabulary for ordinary things,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.370
lift, over jean, petrol,
chemist shop, surgical spirit,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.740
translated into American that
is elevator, eggplant, gasoline,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.910
pharmacy and rubbing alcohol.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.050
I'd never seen Peggy before,
but her accent was familiar

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.070
and she sang the songs I knew,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.010
The Single Girl and
Jenny Jenkins.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.880
After the performance, I
introduced myself and said,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.730
"Thank you for taking me home".

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.290
Throughout that long
an extraordinary year,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.030
the Singers Club became an
essential part of my routine.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.340
In a small room above Bloomsbury
pub, I could hear some

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.930
of Britain's finest folk
musicians for a price

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.930
of 50 Pence, and anyone who
wanted to could sing a song

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.520
from the floor in the
middle of the evening.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.400
I particular looked forward
to the nights when Ewan

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.560
and Peggy sang, I loved their
unique combination of old

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.350
and new music, 18th
century ballads

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.250
and 19th century sea shanties
mixed with musical polemics

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.990
about apartheid or
Margaret Thatcher.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.750
I loved their combination
of musical skill,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.700
intellectual rigor
and political clarity.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.790
I joined the committee
that round the Singers Club

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.380
in at our first committee
meeting, Ewan begin telling me

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.340
of his days in the theater.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.720
When I indicated my
interest in hearing more,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.230
Ewan and Peggy invited me
to dinner at their home

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.100
where we ate, talked and
sang long into the night.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.470
Ewan and Peggy's influence

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.580
on my life is perhaps
greater than they knew.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.580
After my year in London, I
returned to the United States

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.860
and completed my
degree in theater.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.490
Then I moved to New York, where
I found myself spending more

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.430
and more time with folk music.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.520
Singing, writing songs, helping

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.620
to run a small folk club
in Greenwich Village.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.700
In 1988, I began graduate work
and folklore in ethnomusicology

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.610
at Indiana University.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.310
My PhD dissertation was a study
of London during World War II.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.700
Once again, I spent
a year in London.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.190
But the Singers Club
no longer existed

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.490
and the folk music community,
still creative and vibrant,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.150
was very different from
the one I had known.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.780
Time passes.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.960
In the 1990s, a friend from
the New York City folk revival,

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.900
put Peggy and me in
contact via email.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.440
A friend from graduate school
asked me to review a book

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.990
about Peggy's mother,
Ruth Crawford Seegar

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.560
for the Journal of
American Folklore.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.480
I had questions about the book
and emailed them to Peggy.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.410
She preferred to discuss
the matter by telephone.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.570
In the course of
our conversation,

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.740
she asked if I knew
anyone who was interested

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.840
in writing her biography.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.340
I suggested myself.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.950
Six months later, we saw
each other for the first time

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.030
in years when she visited my
home in Montgomery County,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.990
Maryland, only a few miles
from where she grew up.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.320
Our work is biographer
and subject had begun.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.300
So that was the beginning.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.580
Now, Peggy was born
in New York City 1935,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.830
live there for six months
before moving to the Washington,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.250
DC area, and her parents
were very influential

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.090
on her life in many ways.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.020
This is a photograph of
the Seeger family at home,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.000
there's -- reading
from left to right --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.140
her mother, Ruth Crawford
Seeger, her sister Barbara,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.380
her father Charles
Seeger, her sister Penny,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.950
her brother Mike Seeger,
and then Peggy herself.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.890
Now, her father, had
begun as a composer,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.760
and then later became
an academic.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.430
And her mother also
began as a composer

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.840
and later also became a
folk song anthologized.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.760
She transcribed and
arranged folksongs

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.650
for many people,
including Ben Botkin.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.930
And Peggy in fact, learned
how to transcribe when working

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.780
for her mother, transcribing
songs

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.240
for Ben Botkin's Treasury
of Western Folklor.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.180
So, there's a very
strong connection

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.500
between Botkin and the Seeger's.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.070
They move to Washington, so that
Charles could take up a post

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.260
with the New Deal and he
held a variety of positions

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.280
in the government service for
several years, doing all sorts

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.160
of activities to
do with folk music.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.970
These included: collecting
folksongs, publishing them.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.660
He started out in the
resettlement administration

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.250
in which there were these new
communities that had been formed

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.800
by people who had been
displaced by the depression,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.770
and Charles's job was to use
music to create some kind

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.540
of cohesion, and community
spirit, in these communities.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.810
And the Seeger's met
Botkin fairly early on,

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.560
he was also employed by the
New Deal, he was working

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.790
for the Federal Writers Project

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.060
and they became not only
coworkers, but personal friends.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.970
And I suggest that it is
largely through their influence

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.200
that the idea of folk music
that we have today as sort

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.700
of progressive left liberal
notion of folk music,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.980
was promulgated initially by
the Seeger's and by Botkin.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.420
And it was in contradistinction
really do an older idea folk

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.810
music which is become common

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.330
in the early decades
of the 20th century.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.490
An idea that that folk
music was essentially rural,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:36.300
it was essentially conservative,
it was resistant to change.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.190
And the people who were involved

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.280
in what's often called the first
folk revival, used folk music

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.480
in a very, very conservative
fashion, very nationalistic,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.810
frequently racist,
frequently anti-semitic.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.000
And in the 30s people
such as the Seeger's,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.030
[inaudible] said,
"This is all wrong.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.600
This is not what folk
music should be used for".

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:05.380
I'm going to read just very
briefly, from the book: I say,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.240
"they argued for a vision
of America more diverse

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.460
and progressive than had
here to fore been known,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.760
an America in which
the cultures of rural

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.190
and urban communities were
valorized, the contributions

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.960
of immigrants, workers
and minorities celebrated.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.980
Botkin's Treasury
of American Folklore

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.050
for which Charles Seeger
served as music consultant,

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.180
contains a strongly worded
denunciation of those

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.280
who view folklore in
terms of racial heritage,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.130
or insist that a
particular folk group or body

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.590
of tradition is superior
or pure".

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.060
So, this is the atmosphere
that Peggy grew up in.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.330
An atmosphere in which
music is always present,

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.410
her parents were
always playing music.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.800
They were always singing.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.160
Her mother had songs that
accompanied every activity,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.700
she said she knew
it's time to go to bed

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.740
when her mother started
playing Cindy on the piano,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.280
and when it was time to wash
dishes they would all get

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.470
together in the kitchen and one
person would lead the singing

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.270
and that would be the accompany
meant for the activity.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.500
It was not a real surprised
when both Peggy and her brother,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.170
Mike became, not only
interested in folk music,

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.820
but became proficient in it

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.860
by the time they
were in their teens.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:28.450
Now, the second question I
get asked when people find

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.390
out that I've written a
biography of Peggy Seeger is

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.790
"is she related to Pete?

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.610
And the answer is, yes, Charles
Seeger had been married before

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.890
and had three sons
by his first wife

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.430
of which Pete is the youngest.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.280
This is a picture taken
during World War II,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.340
and there you see private
Pete Seeger with Peggy

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.120
and her younger sister Barbara.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:13:00.200
Now, in the fall
of 1953 a number

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.220
of very important things
happened in Peggy's life.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.640
One is she started college
at Ratcliff [phonetic],

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.940
and the second thing

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.290
that happened was much less
happy, her mother died.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.030
Ruth Crawford Seeger had cancer.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.610
She died far too young.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.440
And she had been
the main breadwinner

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.470
for the family for
several years.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.000
She -- most of the
money that came in,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.320
was earned by Ruth
as a piano teacher.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.510
So, Peggy was concerned,
as a college freshman,

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.680
that she might not have enough
money to continue college.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.650
Since her father had to
support the other children,

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:43.620
support the household, he might
not have money for tuition.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.920
So, she was talking to a couple
of her friends in Boston.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.740
This was sort of the springtime
of the mid-century folk revival.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.210
She had a lot of friends,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.640
who were involved
in the folk revival.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.620
And they said to her, "Why
don't you make an album?

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.040
If you need money, why
not make an album?"

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.470
And so, she did.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.700
And her first album, collection
of love songs call "Folk Songs

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.800
of Courting and Complaint",
they are all traditional,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.030
all but one is American.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.300
And I'm going to play
just a little bit of one

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.580
of these songs, "hen First
Unto This Country a Stranger,

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.510
I came".

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:53.040
[ Music ]

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:59.280
OK. So, that's her early
voice very pure very lovely,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.610
relatively anonymous.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.160
It could had belong to
any talented young singer.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.800
So, she made this, so she
was able to continue college.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.140
Her father and sisters
moved up to Boston

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.590
so they could all be together
and there be only one household

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.770
to support, and then at the end

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.820
of her sophomore year her
father remarried and moved

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.560
to California with his new wife,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.490
taking the younger
girls with him.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:33.010
Peggy didn't really want to
stay in Boston on her own.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.230
She considered briefly going
to college in California,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.470
but she ended up going
in the opposite direction

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.340
and spending some time with
her brother Charles the third.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.550
Technically her half-brother,
Charles Seeger's eldest son,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:51.630
at the university of life,
where he was a professor.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:16:00.590
So, she moved to Leiden
in the autumn of 1955.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.010
But she didn't stay there very
long, her initial plan was

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.070
to study Russian in
the language of Dutch,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.910
which was challenging
and interesting.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.380
But, she was never
far from folk music.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.970
So, towards the end of the year
a friend of her's from home,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.980
who been studying at the London
School of Economics showed

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.250
up in Leiden and said,
"How'd you like to hitch hike

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.010
around Europe" and
she said, "sure".

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:32.010
So, they were hitchhiking
around Europe in December,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:37.120
and it was cold and there
was no central heating

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:44.130
and they were picked up by a
Belgium Catholic priest named

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.830
Joseph Lousberg.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.640
Who is with a bunch of students
from the University of Leuven

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.040
in Belgium and they
were going to Germany

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.620
to present a Christmas play in
German, and they asked Peggy

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.910
and her friend if
they wanted to join.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.690
Because what does a German
Christmas play really need?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.060
It needs a banjo.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.100
[ Laughter ]

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.810
So, they said, "sure".

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.070
And they went to Germany,

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.740
they did the play
in German in Berlin.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.880
Peggy's friend went back to
London and Peggy returned

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.520
to Belgium with this Catholic
priest and a couple of the kids

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.990
who they had met in Berlin
and stayed there for a while.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.040
Went back to Leiden for a while
and then she got a phone call

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.250
from an old family
friend: Alan Lomax.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.250
And he said, "how'd you
like to come to London,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:44.030
I am starting a folk group and
we are going to do a production

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.150
of dark of the moon and
I think there are lots

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.450
of things that you could do.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.450
We need a banjo player, no one
in England plays the banjo.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.210
So, can you come to London?"

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.240
And initially she said, "no".

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.970
She said "I'm going
Scandinavians,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.970
friends that I met
on the boat coming

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.670
over to Europe have
invited me to go with them.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.270
I said 'yes', I have
a commitment.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.120
And besides I don't
have any money.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.850
I can't afford to
come to London".

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.170
But Alan's persistent.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.600
He was nothing if not
persistent and he said, "OK,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.200
you can wait a few weeks, you
fulfill your commitment to go

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.930
to Scandinavia and I'll send you
the money to come to London".

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.190
And she said "all
right, why not?

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.070
Sounds like an adventure".

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:32.440
So, she arrived in London on
the morning of March 27th 1956.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.600
She had been on the
train all night.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.240
Now, you know how you
look when you have been

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.540
on the train all night?

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.080
You know how you
feel when you've been

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.590
on the train all night?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.260
That's how she felt and looked.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.080
Allen met her at Waterloo
Station, gave her a big hug

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.410
and said, "you got an interview.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.530
So, not an interview, an
audition, this morning

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.950
with this group of singers
that I want you to play with".

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.750
Alan's girlfriend at the time
was a model, she took one look

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:06.450
at Peggy and started doing a
makeover on her, giving her lots

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.030
of makeup, doing her hair
in a beehive, giving her one

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.150
of those 1950s outfits
that looked like that.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.490
And Peggy went out and saying
for this group of musicians,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.150
and they thought
she was wonderful.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.640
Particularly one, his
name was Ewan McColl.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.940
So, Peggy joined The Ramblers,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.600
which is the name
of the folk group.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.480
They did concerts,
they did albums.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.560
They did this production of
Dark of the Moon and to hear you

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.070
until the story, he
fell in love with her.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.880
The minute he saw her, but
there were a number of problems

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.180
in their relationship.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.360
One was that he was 20
years older than she was,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.030
and another one with the he
was married to somebody else.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.080
So, Peggy said, "I
can't handle this.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.110
I'm going to go back
to the States".

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.370
So, she went back to California
stayed with her father,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.220
but they stayed in touch.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.140
And Peggy being Peggy
continue doing concerts.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.640
And one day she and Ewan
were talking on the phone.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.980
Now, that sounds completely
unremarkable to as now

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.410
that someone in California would
be talking to someone in London.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.850
But, in the 50s this was very
rare, was very expensive.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.380
You tended to limit your
calls to three minutes

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.860
because in every three minutes
block, you had to pay more money

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.320
and during the course of their
conversation, Peggy said,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.820
"I got a concert coming up and
they want a new short love song

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.670
and I can't think of one.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.970
Do you have one?

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.750
Do you know of one I could use?"

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.130
And he said, "well, I'm
sure I can write one"

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:55.510
and put together this song
on the spot on the phone.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:22:00.140
[ Music ]

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.140
So, that was the song, she
sang it, it was well received.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.820
She then got a gig playing at
the Guetto Horn in Chicago,

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.080
which was one of the mayor
first major folk clubs.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.600
And then you would
encourage her to go

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.160
to the World Youth Festival in
Russia, which was a gathering

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.710
of people, young people
from all over the world.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.000
Left wing organizations had
begun the World Youth Festival

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.790
shortly after the
end of World War II,

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.560
and actually the one she
attended with the largest

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.450
of the World Youth
Festival gatherings.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.470
So, she went.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.080
She met a young Californian,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.600
whom she had actually known
before at her parents' house,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.110
Guy Carawan, and the two
of them gave a number

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.580
of concerts together in Russia.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.880
I don't know if you can see it.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.180
But if you look very, very
closely at this photograph,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:02.760
you can see the hammers and
sickles on the curtains.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.790
And so, she and the rest

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.140
of the American delegation
gave a number of concerts

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.490
and then the American delegation
was invited to go to China.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:19.720
Now, this was 1957, America
had no diplomatic relations

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.930
with China and everyone in
the American delegation, was,

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.900
got an individual telegram
from the State Department.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.230
This was John Foster Dulles
State Department, saying,

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.140
"if you go to China,
you will be considered

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.690
to be a willing [inaudible]
in this propaganda,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.030
working against the
interests of the United States

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.980
and when you come back
home, you maybe fined,

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.890
you may lose your passport,
you may even be put in jail".

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.550
Now, this is pretty
serious business,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.330
this is the height
of the Cold War.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.790
And so, most for the people in
the American delegation decided

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.330
that they had better not take
a chance, that they were going

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:03.070
to heat State Department's
warnings, and not go.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.900
But, Peggy and Guy
Carawan, and his wife Noel,

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.350
and a few other people,
about 40 other people decided

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.010
that they were going
to go to China.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.780
When would they get another
opportunity like that.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.080
And there's a picture
of Peggy in China.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.800
Now, when she left China, she
actually went back to Russia

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.060
for a while and she
didn't want to go back home

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.900
because she had been warned
that she might lose her passport

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.160
and if she lost her passport
that meant she'd be stuck

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.300
in America and she wouldn't
be able to see Ewan MacColl.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.490
Their relationship at this point
was sort of a state of flux.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:45.410
She didn't know quite what
was going on, so she decided

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:50.430
that she was going to stay in
Europe for as long as possible.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.280
She stayed for a while in
Paris, staying with a friend

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.750
of Ralph Rinzler, who, I'm
sure you know the name,

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.270
became one of this country's
most distinguished folklorist

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.500
are the Smithsonian
Folklife Festival.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:10.160
At the time was a student
studying French in Paris.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.930
And she got a work permit
to enter England briefly,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.500
not permanently, but
long enough to work

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.080
on what were called
radio ballades.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:27.010
Now, these were a particularly
innovative radio documentaries

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:31.070
that she and Ewan MacColl,
and Charles Parker produced.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.230
And what they did is they went
around and interviewed people

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.990
and then they created songs
based on the interviews

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.480
and they also used the actual
words of the interviewees

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.780
which was very new,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.820
it was extremely
revolutionary technique.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.800
BBC wasn't quite sure
if it was going to work.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.700
But, it ended up
working very nicely.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.970
The first radio ballads called
"The Ballad of John Axon".

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.400
It was about a train
engineer who had died sort

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.700
of like a captain going

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.820
down with his ship there
was a train malfunction

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.440
and he had stuck with
it, do it till the end.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.880
The third radio ballad,
which is one

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.750
of the best known called
Singing The Fishing,

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.190
won a very prestigious
prize, The [inaudible].

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.810
So, they continued working
on these radio ballads

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.610
of throughout the, the
late 50s and early 60s.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.780
But Peggy could only
initially, while she was working

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.050
on the radio ballad, she
could only go to England

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.410
for a brief period of time
on this special work visa,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.500
then she'd go back to France.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.790
And she and Ewan decided that
they did want to stay together,

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.750
they did want to live together,
so they had this problem

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.390
to solve, and then
something happens that sort

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:53.290
of accelerated the process
of them deciding what to do.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.870
Peggy got pregnant.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.670
So, they had to figure out
some way that she could get

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.950
to England and stay there.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.650
Now, the easiest way is to
marry a British subject,

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.390
but at this point,
Ewan was still married

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.820
to his second wife.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.140
They had a friend, a Scottish
folk singer by the name

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.780
of Alex Campbell, who in
what I consider an absolutely

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.290
extraordinary gesture

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:24.220
of friendship said,
"I'll marry you".

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.640
And so, when Peggy was
about six months pregnant,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.320
they were married in Paris.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.630
The priest, giving
Alex Campbell,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.540
a dirty look the whole time,

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.730
and later on gave
him a stern dressing

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.850
down for getting this young
woman in trouble and waiting

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.730
so long to make an
honest woman of her,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.430
but it fulfilled its
bureaucratic purpose.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.090
She was able to go to England

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.810
and she immediately
could get citizenship.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.840
Because she was married
to a British subject,

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.530
and then sometime later, she

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.500
and Alex Campbell had
a nice quiet divorce.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:06.360
So, 1959 Peggy moved to
England and lived with Ewan.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.790
Also in that year their
first son Neil was born.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.950
1963 their son Calum was born
and that's a picture of the four

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.250
of them at the Singers Club.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.540
All right, now I want to
give you some examples

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.340
of the different kinds
of music that Peggy does

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.490
because she is very
prolific, she can do all sort

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:34.080
of different genres,
different varieties of music.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.290
First thing, I am going
to play you a little bit

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.670
of a traditional Scotts folk
song that she sang with Ewan

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.490
and called "The Spinning Wheel".

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:44.400
One of the many things that
I love about this song is

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.150
that in common with
many Scots folksongs,

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.790
it has a heroine named Jean.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:29:30.380
[ Music ]

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.450
So, that's a love song in which
the man is courting the woman

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.240
and she continues to
spin her spinning wheel

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.200
until the very end in which
she says, "what I learned?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.100
I like to [inaudible] wheel far
better than my spinning wheel".

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:48.100
Up until this point, Peggy had
done mainly traditional songs,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.400
mainly American.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.860
She started singing Scott songs
and English songs with Ewan.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.890
But in the late 50s she started
writing songs of her own,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.150
and the first one that
really got attention

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.170
with called the Ballad of Spring
Hill, and it was about an event

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.460
that happened in 58 near the
town of Springhill, Nova Scotia,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.030
where there was an underground
earthquake that caused a mine

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.980
to collapse, and a number of the
miners were killed immediately.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.250
The others were eventually
rescued, took about a week.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.210
And it became very well-known
because it was the first

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:29.130
of this kind of disaster
to be televised.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.530
So, Peggy heard about it when
she was still living in France,

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.660
and she wrote this song in
traditional ballad format,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.170
but telling this
very modern story.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.810
I'm going to play
just a little bit

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.110
of the Ballad of Spring Hill.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:31:26.410
[ Music ]

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.550
OK, and another thing
that both Peggy and Ewan

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:32.100
and became very well-known for
was writing political music,

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.440
writing topical songs
about events.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.690
And in 1960 they brought
out this album called the

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:45.030
"New Britain Gazette", which was
composed entirely of new songs.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.900
Again, that's something that
we think of unremarkable

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.180
for folksingers to be
politically minded.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.350
But, except for Peggy's
brother Pete,

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:58.860
this was relatively unusual, so
this was very much a new thing,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:04.210
and Peggy wrote "The Crooked
Cross" after a campaign

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.690
in London, a political campaign,

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.000
in which a man named Oswald
Mosley was running for office.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.560
Now, Oswald Mosley was a
fascist, genuine fascist,

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.040
big F. During the
wars, he had been part

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.090
of an organization called
the British Union Fascist.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.900
And he was running
for office in 1959.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.770
His followers plastered
London with swastikas,

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.410
which was of course
"The Crooked Cross",

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.700
and Peggy wrote this
song in response.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:33:07.470
[ Music ]

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:13.350
So, by the early 60s, Ewan
and Peggy were becoming known

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.820
as the primary folksingers in
England, and there was a group

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.960
of young folk singers who wanted
to learn more about singing,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.370
and about songs and
writing songs.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.310
And so, Ewan and Peggy
got together this group,

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.760
which they named
The Critics Group.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.580
And, this was a group of young
singers who would meet weekly

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.150
at Ewan and Peggy's house and
they would get instruction

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.130
on how to sing, how
to write songs

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.280
and they also did quite
a number of projects.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.150
Together they did
albums, they did concerts.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.860
And one of the most innovative
things they did was a kind

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.540
of folk theater called
The Festival of Fools.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.450
Now, The Festival of Fools was
originally a medieval festival

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.830
done in Europe in which
people on the, the lower runs

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:04.190
of social hierarchy make fun
of people on the upper runs

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.720
of the social hierarchy.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.040
And this appealed to them,
so they decided it was time

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.480
to revive this tradition.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.010
And what they did is they would
go through the newspapers,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:19.080
month by month, collecting items
of news that were interesting,

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.520
horrifying, funny, engaging,
in some way dramatic,

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.180
and they wrote songs about them,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.630
and they made sketches
about them.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.880
And then at the end of the year,
they performed this as sort

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.010
of a musical revue called
The Festival of Fools

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:39.120
and they did this from the,
the mid 60s to the early 70s.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.850
It was very well received,
it became very well known,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:49.660
and then in 1971, they used to
have this, the first stirrings

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.190
of what we now called the
second wave of feminism,

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:56.790
and Ewan wrote most of
the script of The Festival

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.090
of Fools presentations.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.250
Peggy wrote a lot of the songs.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.940
She also did the musical
direction, she also acted, sang,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.010
played instruments, did
most of the organizing.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:11.680
So, she had a lot to do,
and then in 1971, Ewan said,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.610
"I think we need a women song
in this year's production.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.290
I think you should
write a women's song".

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:21.510
Peggy had a quite enough to
do as it was, but she decided,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.810
"Yes, that was a good idea".

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.820
And she wrote what is often
considered for most famous song

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.120
"I'm going to be an engineer".

00:35:32.510 --> 00:36:19.760
[ Music ]

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.140
OK, yes, then that is still
her, her most famous song.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.810
She still has people
coming up to her, saying,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.120
"I became an engineer because
of you" or then it was,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.720
"my daughter became an
engineer", but now it's,

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.500
"my granddaughter became an
engineer because of you".

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.150
And she and Ewan
continued to play, sing,

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.200
write songs about
all sorts of issues.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.780
In the 80s Peggy got involved

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.760
with quite a number
of new issues.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.400
One of them was the women's
Peace Camp at Greenham Com,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.840
and where she went periodically.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.810
She also got very involved with
the environmental movement,

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.500
and that remains
one of her passions.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.390
One of the things that
she continues to sing

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.190
and write songs about.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:14.170
And then, in the middle of the
decade was the miners' strike

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:18.250
in Britain and she and Ewan
were also very involved

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.550
in the miners' strike.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.850
So, they continued being

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.860
up to the minute political
topical song writers throughout

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.160
the 80s.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:36.560
Then in 1989 Ewan McCall died,
and Peggy got a lot of solace

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.170
from a friend of
hers, Irene Scott,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.730
someone she had known
for many years.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.780
And after Ewan died, Irene
was them very often the person

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.080
that she turned to.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:51.060
And then, they fell in love,

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.840
and here's a song,
she wrote about that.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:22.750
[ Music ]

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:25.990
So, after Ewan died,
it became difficult

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.880
for Peggy to stay in England.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.550
Everything there reminded her
of Ewan, and she also found

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:38.170
that she and Ewan had been
considered such a musical unit

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.640
that it became difficult for
her to get bookings without him,

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:46.930
there was one man in particular,
a particular horrible person

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:51.940
who referred to her as a
"remnant of a dead duo".

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.960
Yes. So, she decided she
would like to move back

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.410
to the States for a while.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:01.380
She was, after all, a
specialist in American folk song

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.300
and that remained her specialty
throughout the time she lived

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.860
in England, because she
felt, "this is my culture,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.610
these are the songs
of my country

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.470
in this is what I can do best".

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:18.760
But, she hadn't lived in in
America for nearly 35 years.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.820
So, she moved back to America
initially to Asheville,

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.080
North Carolina, which is the,
the seedbed to a lot of the song

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.890
that she sang, it was the place

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:32.260
that her father visited during
his work for the New Deal,

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.270
visited some of,
the festivals there.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.760
It was a place where
her brother Pete,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.530
first heard the five
strings banjo.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.760
So, it was definitely
a very meaningful place

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.450
for her to go to.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:51.890
And she lived there for 12
years, and then moved to Boston

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:57.290
to teach song writing at
Northeastern University in 2006.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.200
And stay there for four years,
continuing to write songs

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.300
and continuing to make
albums of traditional music.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:11.350
She never lost her roots,
she was always someone

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:15.100
who had one foot in the
traditional camp and one foot

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:20.530
in the contemporary camp, and
who was equally adept at both.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:27.910
And then, in 2010 she
moved back to England

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.520
and settled in Oxford.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.000
Her children and her
grandchildren lived

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.910
in the London area, so
Oxford is very nearby.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:41.850
And the last thing I am going to
play for you is a song she wrote

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:45.380
for her brother Pete's
94th birthday.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.700
Now, let me see if I remember
how to get out of this.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:59.510
So, this is the song that she
wrote for Pete's 94 birthdays

00:40:59.510 --> 00:43:53.180
[ Music ]

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.430
Just had the pleasure to play
all that, it's so delightful.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.710
OK, so we're almost
up to the present.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:12.680
Peggy made her, the most recent
album she made was in 2014.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.600
It's called "Everything Changes"
and it's a very different album

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.760
from the kind of things that
she had done previously.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.730
And she's now planning a new
album to go along with the tour

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.440
that she's doing in the autumn,

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.420
and that's not bad
for an 82-year-old.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.100
I spoke to her last summer.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.860
I remember, she had
just finished the tour

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.510
and she said -- I'm tired
and I need to take a break.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.640
I've just had this tour
throughout England --

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.880
and I said -- OK, so
what are you going to do?

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.670
-- She said -- well, Irene
and I are going to go

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.460
on a three week safari
in Africa -- .

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.890
So, that's how she relaxes.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:56.100
Well. Thank you very much,
does anyone have any questions?

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.900
Yes.

not entirely clear,

I know she didn't want
to initially, they,

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.840
and so it took a while
to get a divorce.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.940
They eventually did
divorce and eventually Ewan

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.500
and Peggy did marry, but exactly
how it happened is something I

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.940
have never figured out.

That's a good question.

I really don't know they, The
State Department's take on that.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.960
I do know that, a lot of
folksingers, particularly Pete,

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.290
was viewed with a certain
amount of suspicion.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:14.070
In fact, one the reasons that
Charles Seeger, the third was

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.520
in Leiden, and not
the United States is

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.590
that he couldn't get a
job in the United States,

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:21.480
not because he wasn't a
good enough scientist,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.410
but because he couldn't
pass the security clearance.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:29.560
He'd been offered a plumb job
at, I believe it was MIT on,

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.360
but the interview
consisted largely of,

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.630
"tell me about the
politics of Pete and Peggy".

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.570
So, they were very much,
under the, they were very much

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.860
on the radar of the
powers that be,

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.650
how much they were
actually being followed

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.590
by the State Department,
I don't know.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.890
It's a good question.

Yes. That's a good question.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.440
I mean, Peggy always does
what she thinks is right,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.130
and you know if there
are consequences,

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.860
there are consequences.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.820
But, I know in the
in the early 60s,

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.060
she and Ewan had planned this
major tour of the United States

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:19.830
and at the last minute,
Ewan didn't get a visa,

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.840
he was considered too
much of a security threat.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.960
So, she had to do
the tour by herself.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.240
So, I know that was one thing.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:34.220
England, was under less
of a of a red scare.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.680

less of a problem there.

it could be a problem.

That's a huge question.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:48:01.030
She was a great influence and
in fact, the American folk rival

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.710
in some ways jump started
the British folk revival,

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:09.960
then they had took great pains
to differentiate themselves

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.800
from the American folk revival.

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.970
But, before a number of
Americans came there,

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:21.410
including Alan Lomax and Peggy
Seeger, the main folk music,

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:25.510
the idea was sort of the Cecil
Sharp early 20th century,

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:30.160
Maypoles peasants dancing
in the village green idea,

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.880
and people who were
interested in this kind

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.640
of music took their inspiration

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.860
from Leadbelly and
Woody Guthrie.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:43.180
And started a movement called
skiffle, which was in many ways,

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.380
a sort of attempt to do the
songs of Guthrie on Leadbelly

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.070
in England, using
particular instruments,

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.040
washboard base and
things like that.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.530
Then, Alan came along doing
lots of folk music of projects

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:00.240
and brought Peggy over,
and because she was

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.280
such a skilled musician and
because the music she did was

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.590
so exciting, that a lot of
people in Britain said, "hey,

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:07.960
I want to get involved in this".

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.140
The American folk revival
was doing very well,

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.560
records were selling well and
were being played on the radio,

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.620
and so a lot of a British
people started singing American

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.370
folk songs.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.870
And there was actually an
incident that took place

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:27.540
at the Singers' Club in which
someone was singing a Leadbelly

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.230
song, I can't remember
which one,

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.020
but singing in the very
strong cockney accent

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.430
and Peggy just fell
on the floor laughing.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.700
She thought it was so funny.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.230
And people were saying "that
wasn't a very nice thing to do,

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.920
laugh at this person's
performance", she says,

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.420
"but I know Leadbelly, I know
how he is supposed to sound

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.950
like and that's not it".

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:55.020
So, the Singers' Club
instituted a policy,

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.500
which lasted till the
end of the Singers' Club,

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.770
that if you sang a
song in that club,

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.040
you sang the songs
of your own culture.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.990
So, that if you were English
you sang English songs.

00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:10.010
If you were Scott,
you, sang Scott songs.

00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:11.980
And so, a lot of
people in Britain,

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.970
then started looking
toward their own music

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.480
and started saying.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.820
"hey, we got folk
music to, we don't have

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.060
to just be imitating
the Americans.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:27.080
We can sing the songs of our own
culture", so she had I think,

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.290
she had a great influence
on the folk revival there,

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.590
and continues to do so.

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.930
She's sort of the
elder stateswoman

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.620
of the folk revival there now.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.420
Yes.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:51:05.040
[ Inaudible question ]

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.310
Yes. It's interesting.

00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:11.960
Good catch, she does, this is
something I discuss in the book,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.560
I didn't actually
discuss it with her.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.480
But, she read everything
I wrote so --

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.320
and she made comments
and if she didn't

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.030
like something she'd
let me know.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.760
So, she didn't make a
negative comment about that,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.790
so she apparently approved.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:32.830
But in "Love Unbidden", she
takes some of the language

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:38.100
from first time ever and
uses it, and uses it in sort

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:43.230
of interesting ways, like in
first time ever, he has talking

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:46.300
about the trembling heart of
a captive bird that was there

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.680
at my command, in
a "Love Unbidden",

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.810
she talks about being a wild
bird instead of a captive bird,

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:58.040
she is a wild bird that
is at your command.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.210
So, it's a very,
very different idea,

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.060
but using a similar structure

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.270
and she uses the same
structure beginning every stanza

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:12.130
with approximately the same
line with minor revisions.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:15.350
So, it's yes, it's very
definitely taken off

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.220
of first time ever.

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:21.680
And, one of, there's one
scholar has a quote in the book

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.860
who noticed that she in the
first in "Love Unbidden",

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:30.080
she talks at, I am on one of
those who dare not claim thee.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.360
And she says that this
sounds like the love

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.330
that dare not speak its name,

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:39.790
which is on that what was the
phrase, it became famous at,

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.340
at Oscar Wilde's trial
for homosexuality.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.640
But very subtle.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.440
Yes.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:58.040
[ Inaudible question ]

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.880
Sure, she recorded for lots
of different record labels,

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.710
go to her website and you'll
see that there are maybe 20.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:10.350
But yes, she recorded for
Folkways, she recorded for DECA,

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:18.240
she recorded on the
On-Topic Folk Lyric, Rounder.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.560
She and Ewan founded their own
company, Blackthorn Records,

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.260
she did a number
of records on that.

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.870
Apple Seeds.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:32.810
It just loads and
loads of different --

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:36.790
wherever they could
do the kind of music

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.450
that the wanted and
could get it out.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.350
Good question.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.150
Yes.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:48.040
[ Inaudible question ]

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.510
I know a little bit, she's
planning to do a similar

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:55.930
to her most recent album, which
is a much more contemporary,

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:57.940
it has a much more
contemporary sound.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.240
It's really her.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.540
I was talking with her
daughter in law, who said,

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.050
"this isn't a folk album this
is a Signer's songwriter album".

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.770
And it's true in a
lot of her albums,

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.650
it could it have been
a live recording.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.580
It could it just been sort
of like the old-fashioned way

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.880
that music technology was,

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.130
so this is to record
live performance.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:17.900
Her latest album is
not like that at all,

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.630
is full of sampled sound.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:23.450
It's full of music that
could only have been done

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:26.270
in a recording studio
and it's full of,

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:30.270
of jazz inflected accompaniment,

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:35.570
lots of international
instruments and also,

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:39.820
writing in a much less
traditional style,

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.050
so that's what she is planning
to do for her next album.

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.660
I'll be eager to see it.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.960
Anybody else?

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.260
All right, well, thank you.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:57.040
