00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.474
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.160
There are two things in this world that bother me: number one, the fact that the Tasmanian devil

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.040
is about to go extinct because of a rapidly spreading face cancer, and you didn't know that,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.326
and number two, the fact that the dude in charge of the immunization effort to save the Tasmanian devil

00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:17.481
has never watched the Warner Brothers cartoon.

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.081
We've gotta fix these things! So today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to Tasmania

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.560
and I want the record to show that within two hours of an Alabama boy being on the ground,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800
we had a Tasmanian Devil in a sack.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.469
Let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.229
- This is Jocelyn,
- Hi!

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.900
- And this is Alex.
- Hello.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.200
- Okay, so this facility is run by the University of Tasmania, correct?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.368
- That's right, yeah.

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:43.940
- And the purpose of it is to study a disease that has been killing the Tasmanian Devil all over the island, right?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.720
- That's right.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.760
(Destin) Welcome to ground zero in the fight against the extinction of a species.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.980
These guys deploy clever little pipe traps all over the island to monitor devils in order to understand why they're dying.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.600
(Destin) So the devil would come in, grab the bait...
(Alex) And then this would pull,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
(Destin) Pull the string.
(Alex) Pull the string and the pin,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.020
(Alex) And then this pin locks it so it can't open.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.280
(Destin) And at that point you've caught the devil.
(Alex) That's right.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.041
(Destin) Once you catch a devil in a pipe, you've got to look at its mouth, so Alex agreed to show me

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.600
how they look at their mouths on one of the more docile devils that they keep in captivity.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.180
(Destin) So we're going to put a tasmanian devil in a burlap sack, or, as you call it, a hessian sack,
(Alex) Yeah, that's right.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.700
(Destin) And we're gonna check him for the...
(Alex) Well, he had this tumor,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.300
(Alex) This DFTD tumor in the gum, on the gum, that was removed...

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.020
(Destin) DFTD.
(Alex) That's right. Devil Facial Tumor Disease.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.340
(Destin) Devil Facial Tumor Disease. Okay, so we're gonna check

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.060
this tasmanian devil for the tumor.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.614
(Alex) Yeah, so the tumor was removed two or three years ago,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.200
so we are going just to check if the tumor hasn't grown back.
(Destin) Okay.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860
(Alex) So we'll put him in the sack and see if he cooperates.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.840
I can open his mouth, and have a good look in his mouth to see if there is no tumor.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.121
(Destin) Great. So I'm going to help you catch a tasmanian devil?
(Alex) Yes, yes.

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.500
(Alex chuckles)

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.720
(Destin) Where do you want me?
(Alex) Well, if you can just hold the lid for me.

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:09.022
(Alex) And if we can just...

00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:10.760
(Box creaking)

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.080
(Destin) Woah.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.417
(Box creaking)

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:18.077
(Destin) So you're just going to hold his head?

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.740
Oh, you're going to grab his tail?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.500
(Destin) Okay, so we've got to get to his mouth now.
(Alex) Yep. Well, we'll try.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.400
(Destin) So we have a Tasmanian devil in a sack.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.140
(Destin) Is it transmissible to humans?
(Alex) No.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
(Destin) How do you know that?
(Alex) A few people got stabbed with needles,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.160
and tumors never grew, so...

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920
(Destin) Wow.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.160
(Alex) So I sort of am covering his eyes, so he can't see,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.640
but I have access to his mouth.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.400
(Destin) Where would the tumors be?
(Alex) I think this tumor originally

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.800
was on this side here, but he doesn't have any sign of a tumor there now.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.340
(Destin) You really love them, don't you?
(Alex) Yeah.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.820
(Alex) We don't have any sign of devils becoming immune to the disease,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.920
so it seems that, where the disease arrives, the population just declines, by that extent,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:37.260
and whenever a devil gets DFTD, that devil, it doesn't survive.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.740
(Destin) Why have I not heard about this? A cancer with a 100% mortality rate.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.384
That's a huge deal! In order to understand it more thoroughly, let's go to the University of Tasmania

00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:49.660
and speak with Professor Greg Woods, who's working on a vaccine to beat it.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.320
(Prof. Woods) It's a tumor, that occurs in Tasmanian devils, and it starts in the face,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720
so it's called Devil Facial Tumor Disease.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440
(Destin) And why is this a threat?
(Prof. Woods) It is a threat because

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.460
it is a really rare cancer, it's a contagious cancer, and, so far, it's wiped out about eighty to ninety percent

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:09.386
of the remaining Tasmanian devil population.

00:04:09.386 --> 00:04:12.280
(Destin) Are you serious? In how long?
(Prof. Woods) In less than 20 years.

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:16.145
(Destin) Wow. It's almost killed it in 20 years.
(Prof. Woods) It's almost wiped out the entire species, yeah.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:20.245
(Destin) What is this you have on your screen here?
(Prof. Woods) So, this is a map of the DFTD distributions.

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:23.220
So, it started in the far northeast corner of Tasmania,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.772
and it's been moving south and west ever since.

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:29.052
(Destin) So this is like the ripple of death.
(Prof. Woods) The ripple of death, yeah.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:31.637
(Destin) You can see it going down the island.
(Prof. Woods) You can see it moving down the island.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:34.117
Every year it moves 10 to 20 kilometers.

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:37.071
(Destin) Can you show me what it does? Do you have a picture or something?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.740
(Destin) So this is a Tasmanian devil head?
(Prof. Woods) This is a healthy devil.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.200
(Destin) Okay.
(Prof. Woods) Now, the other half of this devil has got a small tumor.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.800
Now, you can just see the tumor there. So, that's a very early tumor.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.240
(Prof. Woods) In one single devil, in fact, it was a female devil,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.680
(Destin) That would be patient zero, right?
(Prof. Woods) That would be patient zero.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.738
(Prof. Woods) It's gone from a single cell in a single devil to about, maybe 100,000 devils have now been killed

00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:08.546
(Prof. Woods) by this cancer.
(Destin) Oh, wow.

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:12.800
(Prof. Woods) So, it's like a clonal proliferation of...
(Destin) So it's like the game of Life, only death.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.900
(Prof. Woods) The game of death, yeah.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.820
(Prof. Woods) Any devil that gets it, dies from it.
(Destin) Really.

00:05:16.828 --> 00:05:20.468
(Prof. Woods) It's 100% kill rate.
(Destin) What's the cause of death?

00:05:20.468 --> 00:05:24.068
(Prof. Woods) They just can't see, so they won't be able to eat.
(Destin) So they starve to death.

00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:26.688
(Prof. Woods) So this is the healthy side,
(Destin) Okay.

00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:30.920
(Prof. Woods) And this is the diseased side. I don't know if you can see straight away,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.640
but you can see there, there's a hole. The cancer cells are producing enzymes which are digesting the bone

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.860
and if we open up the jaw...
(Destin) The canine tooth is gone.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.180
(Prof. Woods) The canine tooth's gone, so he still can't obviously eat as well.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.480
(Destin) That's amazing.
(Prof. Woods) And these canine teeth, they are what

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.026
they'll bite each other with. So they'll bite another devil...(Destin) Oh, so that tooth will be infected.

00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:02.306
(Prof. Woods) This tooth will be, yeah, this tooth will have tumor cells on it. Alright?
(Destin) Wow.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:10.040
(Prof. Woods) So what will happen is, a few tumor cells there, it will bite the other devil, and inoculate a few tumor cells.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.599
Greg says they transmit the disease by biting each other on the face, which is really bad news for the

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.252
Tasmanian devil, because all the locals told me that's how they say hello.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.920
I wanted to verify this for myself, so I went to the local zoo

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.920
may or may not have lowered my camera into the pen. Don't tell on me.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.460
(Tasmanian devil sniffing)

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.440
(Destin) Well, this explains how you guys transmit DFT...wow!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.320
Okay, so I'm learning. So they transmit DFTD, Devil Facial Tumor Disease, by biting each other.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.011
Watch this, I'm just gonna stick the camera near him.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.280
This is just what they do, they just bite.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.320
All the time.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.026
Why are you biting my camera?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.600
Don't you know you'll get cancer like that?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.120
(plastic chomping sounds) Woah!

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.740
(Zookeeper) Just watch those cameras. Bring the cameras up. Yeah, don't - you'll lose the camera,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.200
You'll lose the lens and everything.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.800
(Destin) They'll eat it?
(Zookeeper) Nothing over the side.
(Destin) Okay, thank you.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.433
(Destin) How are you trying to defeat the cancer? What is the mechanism? What are you doing?

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:27.153
(Prof. Woods) Well the ultimate mechanism is to produce a vaccine. So to understand that,  we need to

00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:31.254
understand the devil's immune system, we have to understand the tumor,

00:07:31.254 --> 00:07:35.414
we need to know how to make the tumor become more visible to the devil's immune system.

00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:38.549
(Destin) These guys are not just talking the talk. They're making huge discoveries.

00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:43.991
DFTD is a specific type of cancer that affects the cells in the nervous system called Schwann cells.

00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:48.810
Prior to their research, human Schwann cell cancers were super rare and often misdiagnosed.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:54.290
I'll let these guys humbly explain something they did which could easily save the life of someone you love in the future.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.130
(Scientist) The normal cells compared to the cancer cells.
(Destin) Wow, so you've actually identified the boundary here. That's interesting.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:05.537
(Scientist) Yes, because we have a marker for the tumor, so [it] only strains DFTD tumor cells.

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:09.520
(Destin) You created the marker for the tumor?(Scientist) We discovered the tumor - the marker.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.440
(Destin) You discovered the marker?
(Scientist) Yeah, we did.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.720
(Destin) How long ago did you do that?
(Scientist) That was, like, three years ago?
(Prof. Woods) Three years ago.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:22.168
(Destin) Other cancers, like human cancers, it wouldn't stain?
(Prof. Woods) It would stain human Schwann cell cancers, yeah.

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:27.342
(Prof. Woods) We discovered this in the devil and we actually got it to work on human cancers, so it will help diagnosis.

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:34.375
(Destin) No way. So you discovered this staining method for the Tasmanian devil, and then you've applied that

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:37.692
research to medical research for humans.
(Prof. Woods) Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:39.830
(Prof. Woods) It's just a way to...
(Destin) Do you know what this is? Yeah!

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.630
(Destin) It's a good thing! That's awesome.
(Prof. Woods) It all adds up. It all goes together.
(Destin) That's great.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.870
(Destin) I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day. I'm about to do a really honest advertisement

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.222
advertisement here. I want to say thank you the sponsor of this video, which is Harrys.com. They make razors,

00:08:53.222 --> 00:08:57.217
and I used these razors long before they decided to sponsor Smarter Every Day, but the fact that they're

00:08:57.217 --> 00:09:02.657
sponsoring Smarter Every Day is pretty impressive. They could, like, sponsor hot bloggers and stuff, they're

00:09:02.657 --> 00:09:09.449
sponsoring a dude going to Tasmania and talking about a disease that's affecting a species. That's cool.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:14.869
Thank you Harry's. If you're interested in getting a razor, go to harrys.com, use the promo code "smarter", I think

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:19.206
it's worth it. I'm going to use a portion of this sponsorship to make a personal donation to the

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:22.921
Devil Facial Tumor Disease research fund at the University of Tasmania by going to the links in the

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:28.135
video description, so, please consider doing that yourself as well. I want the knowledge of Devil Facial

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:34.742
Tumor Disease to spread faster than the disease itself, so, please consider sharing this video, if this added value

00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:39.883
to your life, consider subscribing to Smarter Every Day, or don't, whatever. Thank you so much, I'm Destin,

00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.617
you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one.
(beep)

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:46.537
(Prof. Woods) And any philanthropists out there, this is an absolutely perfect project to be involved in.

00:09:46.537 --> 00:09:49.240
Actually saving a species. Can you imagine that?
(Destin) Yeah.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.600
(Prof. Woods) Saving a species.
(Destin) That's cool.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.760
(beep)
 (Destin) I noticed there's not a single Tasmanian devil cartoon on the wall, anywhere here.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.760
I expected that when I walked in.
(Prof. Woods) No, no, in fact I've never seen the cartoon.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.800
(Destin) Have you not?
(Prof. Woods) I have not seen it. I've seen a picture of it.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.960
(Destin) Are you serious?
(Prof. Woods) I've never watched the cartoon.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.720
(Destin) And you're the man that's trying to save it.
(Prof. Woods) I've never watched the cartoon, no.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.000
(Destin) He's never seen the Tasmanian devil cartoon.
(Prof. Woods) I'm - I haven't watched the cartoon.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.146
(Prof. Woods) Have you watched...
(Jocelyn) Are you serious?

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.435
(Prof. Woods) Seriously! What would I watch the cartoon for?

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:18.389
(Destin) I don't want to force you to watch the cartoon.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:22.052
(Prof. Woods) I'm a nerd you know, I don't  watch cartoons.
(laughter)

00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:27.453
(Destin) Greg is too proud to watch the Tasmanian devil cartoon, even though he's the man in the world that's trying to save it.

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:29.155
This is very interesting.

00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:32.841
(faint cartoon sounds - Tasmanian devil spinning up like a tornado)

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.480
(Prof. Woods) Is that it?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.560
(Destin) That's it. That's the Tasmanian devil.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.800
(laughs) You've never seen that?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.240
(Prof. Woods) So what's his role in life?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.880
(Tasmanian Devil Cartoon sounds)
(Destin) He's just destructive.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.400
(cartoon noises)

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.240
(Destin) People like it. That's why your research is getting funded. (laughs)

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.000
(Destin) That's it.
 (Prof. Woods) That's it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.711
(Destin) Maybe showing you that was a bad idea.
(Prof. Woods) Maybe it was a bad idea.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.360
(Destin laughs) I like you. He's a pure academic. I like people like Greg.
